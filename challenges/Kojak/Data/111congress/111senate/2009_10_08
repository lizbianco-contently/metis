Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nproceed to a period of morning business for 1 hour, with Senators \npermitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. The Republicans will \ncontrol the first 30 minutes. The majority will control the second 30 \nminutes.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nthe Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Act. We hope to reach \nshort time agreements on available conference reports. Senators will be \nnotified when any votes are scheduled during today's session of the \nSenate. Senators Shelby and Mikulski feel we can finish the bill that \nwe are working on today.\n\n\n                      Finance Committee CBO Report\n\n  The Finance Committee report came out yesterday from CBO. It was \noutstanding, $81 billion, bending the curve. That bill will be voted on \nby the Finance Committee on Tuesday morning. It will be reported to the \nSenate.\n  Since Harry Truman was President, Democrats have fought to make it \nmore affordable to live a healthy life in America. Every day we come \ncloser to achieving that goal. Yesterday was a landmark occasion. \nYesterday the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office confirmed that \nthe Finance Committee plan, which is one of the five plans in Congress \nto reform the way health insurance companies treat people in this \ncountry, will reduce the deficit.\n  It did not say it will keep the deficit the same. It did not say it \nwill increase it, not even by one penny. It said, in black and white, \nthat the Finance Committee's bill will reduce our deficit, not just in \nthe short term but over the long term as well.\n  That is something progressives, conservatives, and Independents, \neveryone in between, can be thankful for and can applaud. Today we \nstand closer than ever to fulfilling that fundamental promise, the one \nfor which we have fought more than 60 years. We stand closer than ever \nto fulfilling the cause of Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  But as anyone who has even superficially followed the debate knows, \nthe route to realizing Senator Kennedy's dream is far from smooth \nsailing. There are still those who will not rest until the American \npeople are denied the change they demanded, those who will not be happy \nunless the status quo is sustained. There are those who still want to \npick fights against us, even though we are interested only in fighting \nfor hardworking American families. There are those who consider this a \nzero sum game and will only declare victory if President Obama concedes \ndefeat. So let me be very clear. Just as Democrats believe in ensuring \nquality, affordable health care for every American citizen, we believe \nequally as strongly that this country has no place for those who wish \nfor its leaders to fail.\n  Just as yesterday brought us another step closer to real reform, it \nalso brought us another round of Republican excuses, from the \nRepublican\n\n[[Page S10258]]\n\nleadership on down. The other side remains trapped in its strategy of \ndistortion, distraction, and deception. Yesterday on the Senate floor, \nthe Republican leader asked rhetorically: What happens to Medicare \nunder our plan? Well, let me answer that question. Under our plan, \nseniors pay less for their medicine. Under our plan, seniors pay \nnothing for their annual checkup. Under our plan, seniors pay nothing \nfor preventive care. And, under our plan, doctors who treat seniors get \na raise.\n\n  But the other side is not letting those facts get in the way of a \ngood sound bite. Instead, yesterday on the Senate floor, the Republican \nleader said: Our plan will cut Medicare. What he did not bother to say \nis that the only thing we are cutting is the waste rampant in that \nsystem, waste that you as a taxpayer pay in every paycheck.\n  Yesterday on the Senate floor, the Republican leader said: \n``Republicans have tried to protect Medicare throughout the debate.''\n  Listen to that one: ``Republicans have tried to protect Medicare \nthroughout the debate.''\n  What he did not bother to say is that this debate is also the first \ntime in history Republicans ever found such an interest. The fact is \nthat ever since Senate Republicans opposed the creation of Medicare, \nthey have spent the past 40 years on the wrong side of history when it \ncomes to helping seniors.\n  In the past 10 years, Republicans have voted against protecting and \nstrengthening Medicare 59 times. When President Bush vetoed the \nMedicare Improvement Act last year, the only Senators who supported \nthat disastrous veto were his fellow Republicans here in the Senate. So \nthe American people can be excused for not buying the Republicans' \neleventh-hour claim that they are the true guardians of seniors' health \ncare.\n  It is telling that after weeks of negotiations, months of debate, and \ndecades of national movements for health insurance reform, this is the \nbest they can came up with. It is telling that one of their most oft-\nrepeated arguments protests not the contents of the bill but now the \nnumber of the pages of the bill. How is that for criticism: The bill \nhas too many pages.\n  Let's not forget the Republicans only offer arguments in response to \nour plan to make health care more stable and more secure. We have yet \nto hear any Republican arguments in support of their own health care \nideas. Why? Because there are not any. They do not exist.\n  The Republican plan is nothing more than the status quo. Under the \nRepublican plan, insurance companies can continue to deny a person \ncoverage when they need it the most. Under the Republican plan, \ninsurance companies can deny you coverage because you have high \ncholesterol or hay fever or even heart disease.\n  They can raise your rates because you are getting older, because your \ndad had prostate cancer, or simply because you are a woman. Under the \nRepublican plan, if you have health insurance, your family has to pay \nat least $1,000 a year more to cover all of the other families who have \nnone.\n  Republicans in Congress are the only ones who support that plan. The \nrest of the country knows we need to act and we need to act now. Here \nis a list of those who support our plan to improve our health insurance \nin the short term and the long term alike: doctors; hospitals; the \npharmaceutical industry; a bipartisan group of Governors; President \nObama, who has made fixing health care his top priority; Democrats in \nCongress who are committed to getting it done this year; and, at the \ntop of that list, the American people, 9 of 10 of whom say high health \ncare costs are hurting their families, crushing their families.\n  In recent days, prominent, courageous, independent-minded Republicans \nthroughout this country have added their names to that list of people \nwho are crying for health care reform. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the \nGovernor of a State with 38 million people, the most populous State in \nthe Union; Michael Bloomberg, the mayor of the most populous city in \nthe country; Bobby Jindal, the Governor of Louisiana--Republicans asked \nhim to provide their party's response to President Obama's first ever \naddress to Congress--Tommy Thompson, former Governor of Wisconsin, \nformer Secretary of Health and Human Services under President Bush; \nMark McClellan, former head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid \nServices under President Bush; Bill Frist, former Senate majority \nleader and a physician who said last week, if he were still in the \nSenate, he would vote for health insurance reform; and, Bob Dole, \ntoday, announced that he supports something being done. This former \nmajority leader and Republican nominee for President this week \nencouraged his party to drop their ``just say no'' strategy. He was \neven stronger in his statements today.\n  Here is a list of those who think things are just fine the way they \nare: Republican leaders in Congress. That is it. That is the list. And \nthat is the real match-up in this health care debate. It is clear to \nsee who is listening to the American people, who has tuned them out.\n  Democrats are willing to listen not only to the American people, we \nare also more than willing to listen to congressional Republican ideas, \nif they offer any, to move this debate forward. We would be happy to \nend up with a bill that does not rely on 60 Senators but one that can \nearn a lot more.\n  But until that happens, until Republicans in Congress show they want \nto be productive partners rather than partisan protesters, we will \ncontinue to do what the vast majority of the American people demand \nthat we do; that is, continue moving forward to improve a badly broken \nsystem.\n  I agree with President Obama who told Congress last month: We have no \npatience for those who seek more of the same failed ideas. We have no \npatience for those who contribute only criticism and not constructive \ninput. We have no patience for those who mischaracterize our plan or \nmislead the people, and will call them out when they do.\n  That is what the speech was all about. We believe this because we \nbelieve the American people deserve to be told the truth. We believe \nhard-working families already have enough real problems to worry about \nwithout having their time wasted with fake problems. We believe this \ncountry is no place for those who hope for failure, failure of their \nleaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/08/senate-section/article/S10258-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday morning, our friends across \nthe aisle came to the floor to defend the health care plan that they \nand their colleagues are pushing through Congress--a plan that has as \nits foundation a trillion dollars in spending, half a trillion dollars \nin cuts to Medicare, higher premiums, higher taxes on just about \neveryone at a time of near double-digit unemployment, and limits on the \nhealth care choices that millions of Americans now enjoy. Later in the \nday, we got a cost estimate. It is irrelevant. The bill it is referring \nto will never see the light of day.\n  What matters is that the final bill will cost about a trillion \ndollars, vastly expand the role of government in people's health care \ndecisions, increase premiums, and limit choice.\n  For months, Republicans have taken every opportunity to talk about \nthe kinds of commonsense reforms we need and that Americans actually \nwant. Personally, I have spoken just about every day we have been on \nthe floor since June about step-by-step reforms to lower costs, \ncommonsense ideas that we should all agree on like malpractice reform, \nequalizing the tax treatment for businesses and individuals, and \nprevention and wellness programs--all of which would get right at the \nheart of our health care problems.\n  We have talked about these things because they address the problems \nwe have, problems of cost and access, without limiting the choices \nAmericans now enjoy. We have talked about these things because these \nare the reforms Americans want.\n  I have spoken about reform 43 times on the Senate floor. Yet some \ndon't seem to be listening. And this is precisely the problem Americans \nhave identified with some of the advocates of the Democrats' health \ncare plans.\n\n[[Page S10259]]\n\nThey are not listening to our commonsense proposals any more than they \nare listening to the concerns of the American people.\n  In fact, listening to the proponents of these plans, one gets the \nsense they are more concerned about their legacies than what the \nAmerican people actually want. ``This is the moment'' . . . ``Be a part \nof history . . .'' These are the kinds of things they say to each other \nabout health care reform. Here is an idea: How about asking the \nAmerican people what they want instead?\n  Everyone wants reform. I have said so almost every day on the floor \nfor months. But a 1,000-page, trillion-dollar bill that cuts Medicare \nby half a trillion dollars, raises taxes on virtually everyone, raises \npremiums, and limits the health care choices Americans now enjoy is not \nthe kind of reform Americans want. And what matters more than that?\n  The views of the American people are relevant in a debate about \nlegislation that will have a profound and lasting effect on their \nlives. And these same Americans overwhelmingly oppose the 1,000-page, \ntrillion-dollar plans they have seen from the administration and \nCongress. They have been saying so for months.\n  Take the issue of cost. One of the things Americans are concerned \nabout is how much this legislation will cost. They are asking the \nquestion. They are not getting a straight answer.\n  We have seen a lot of numbers thrown around. As I have already noted, \nyesterday we got another one from the CBO. It doesn't tell the whole \nstory. The fact is, the bill it is referring to will never see the \nlight of day. That is because the real bill will soon be cobbled \ntogether in a secret conference room somewhere in the Capitol by a \nhandful of Democratic Senators and White House officials.\n  The other numbers we have seen are intended to explain how much this \nbill will cost over 10 years. What most people do not realize is that \nthe new plans would not go into effect for another 4\\1/2\\ years. So \nwhat is being sold as a 10-year cost is really a 5\\1/2\\ year cost. That \nmeans you can take the numbers you are getting and nearly double them.\n  Here is what we know about the true cost of the three bills we have \nseen so far: The Budget Committee has determined that the Finance \nCommittee Bill, as introduced, will cost $1.8 trillion over 10 years, \nand we do not expect it to get any better from here on out. The HELP \nCommittee bill will cost $2.2 trillion over 10 years. And the House \nbill will cost $2.4 trillion over 10 years. So the average cost of \nthese bills, when fully implemented, is more than $2 trillion.\n  Americans are concerned about all this spending. They want straight \nanswers. Advocates of the administration's health care proposal seem to \nthink that the bigger the proposal, the more complicated, the more \nexpensive, the better. That is not what the American people think. They \nare making it clear. It is about time we listen.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/08/senate-section/article/S10259-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I congratulate the Republican leader \nfor his comments. If it weren't so serious, he and I and the Senator \nfrom Texas would probably all be amused to hear the Democratic leader \ncome here day after day and say the Republicans don't have a health \ncare plan and then attack our plan. That is typical of the kind of talk \nwe are getting about health care reform from the Democratic side. We \nare getting double-talk.\n  It reminds me, a few years after I was Governor of Tennessee--it must \nhave been the early 1990s--I was driving along in Nashville as a \nprivate citizen. I had the radio on. It might have been an Arkansas \nradio station, but I think it was a Nashville station. The announcer \nsaid: Big news. The Tennessee legislature has passed a new law creating \na Medicaid program called TennCare. Here is what it will do. It will \ncover twice as many people for the same amount of money.\n  Everybody was happy about that. Nobody had to raise taxes. Nobody had \nto pay any more money. Twice as many people get health care. I remember \nwhat went through my mind: I bet that doesn't happen. That sounds too \ngood to be true.\n  The same idea went through my mind when I picked up a paper this \nmorning and read: The Senate Finance Committee has finished its work. \nWe are going to give 29 million more Americans health care. It is going \nto cost hundreds of billions of dollars more, and it is going to reduce \nthe Federal deficit all at once. What went through my mind was: That \nsounds too good to be true. It sounds like the TennCare story.\n  Let's remind ourselves what the Republican leader said a minute ago. \nThe focus is reducing cost. We all know there are people who don't have \nhealth care and who need it. We would like to extend it to them. But we \ncan't afford to do that until we reduce the cost of the health care we \nhave. It is going to bankrupt us as individuals if we don't reduce the \ncost of our health care premiums. It is going to bankrupt our \ngovernment if we don't stop the growth of health care. Our first goal \nis reducing cost, which is why the Republican plan for health care is \nto take several commonsense steps in the right direction--reducing \ncost--that will get us where we want to go. We have said those on the \nfloor time after time after time.\n  They include allowing small businesses to pool their resources so \nthey can offer insurance to more of their employees. They include \ntaking steps to stop junk lawsuits against doctors, which are driving \nup malpractice premiums and causing problems for patients. For example, \nmany women who are pregnant in rural West Tennessee counties have to \ndrive all the way to Memphis to see a doctor because doctors would not \npractice there anymore because of the high cost of medical malpractice \npremiums, which is driving up the cost of health care. We could create \nexchanges in each State so people could shop for individual insurance. \nWe could allow people to buy their insurance across State lines. We all \nbelieve that if we did a better job of encouraging technology, we could \nreduce cost and reduce paperwork. All doctors and nurses and medical \nassistants know that.\n  Those are five steps we could take together to reduce cost, and we \ncould begin to add to our rolls the 11 or 12 million people who are \nalready eligible for programs we have today. That would make a big \ndifference.\n  Instead, what our friends on the other side want to do is transform \nthe system at a cost of closer to $1.6 to $1.8 trillion, when fully \nimplemented. The question will be, Will it reduce our costs? That is \nwhy we want to read the bill. We want to know what it costs. This is \nnot a bill. This is some pages of concepts. This is not a formal, \ncomplete estimate of its cost. That only comes when we have a bill.\n  We have had 8 Democratic Senators who have written to the majority \nleader and said what all 40 Republicans have said. The legislative text \nand the complete budget scores from the Congressional Budget Office \nthat are going to be considered should be available on a Web site for \n72 hours prior to the first vote. Democrats voted that down in the \nFinance Committee. They voted down the idea of allowing 72 hours to \nread a 1,000-page bill and to find out what it costs. Apparently, some \nDemocrats are coming to their senses and saying: No, we would like to \nhave the bill. We would like to read it. We would like to have a \nformal, complete score--their words--of what it costs, and then we will \nstart voting. This is not a bill. These are concepts.\n\n[[Page S10260]]\n\n  Then the majority leader is going to put this all together into \nanother bill or create a bill. Then it will take a couple weeks to find \nout what that costs. We have some questions to ask in the meantime. \nFirst, we would like the Democrats to join us in step-by-step solutions \nto reduce cost. Next, we want to know whether it is going to reduce the \ncost to government and whether it will reduce the cost to each of us \nwho is buying health insurance. As I look at the outlines, I think it \nmight not. For example, as the Republican leader said, we know it is \ngoing to cost about twice as much as the $800 billion advertised \nbecause it doesn't start taking effect for a few years. The taxes start \nright away, but the benefits don't start for a few years. That is the \nfirst thing.\n  The second thing is, it is going to put 14 million more people into \nthe Medicaid Program--not Medicare, this is the Medicaid Program. This \nis the program States operate that is paid for two-thirds by the \nFederal Government and a third by the States, about which all the \nGovernors have said: If Washington is going to expand the Medicaid \nProgram, Washington ought to pay for it. I suspect when we start asking \nquestions, we will find Medicaid Program costs are underestimated. All \nthe Governors think so. We had one of the most painful letters I have \never read from the Democratic Governor of Tennessee. Senator Corker put \nit in the Record. He talked about how Tennessee's condition was similar \nto the condition of most States.\n  He said: For example, by 2013, we expect to return to our 2008 levels \nof revenue. We will already have cut programs dramatically. We will \nhave to start digging out. We haven't given raises to State employees \nor teachers for 5 years. Our pension plans will need shoring up. Our \nrainy day fund will have been depleted. We would not have made any \nsubstantial investments in years. There will be major cuts to areas \nsuch as children's services.\n  We are going to expand a program that is already causing the State of \nTennessee and most other States to go toward bankruptcy. That is the \nway we are going to achieve reform. That is half the reform. Most \nGovernors who have had anything to do with the Medicaid Program say \nthat dumping low-income Americans into the Medicaid Program, where 40 \npercent of the doctors would not see them, is not health care reform. \nMedicaid costs are underestimated.\n  Also, I don't think the Congressional Budget Office estimate of these \nconcepts we saw includes what we inelegantly call the doc fix. Every \nyear the system we have reduces payments to doctors who work on \nMedicare patients. So we come back and raise the amount of money. If we \nonly pay doctors 10 years from today what we are paying them today to \nserve Medicare patients, it will cost $285 billion, and that is not in \nthis bill. When we ask our questions and read the bill and find out \nwhat it costs, we will find it doesn't reduce the deficit. Even if it \ndid, it is going to cost $1.6 or $1.8 trillion. Who is going to pay for \nit? Half of it is going to come from cuts in Medicare, which serves \nseniors. Instead of putting any savings in Medicare to strengthen that \nprogram, which is going bankrupt in 2015-2017, we are going to spend it \non a new program. Eight hundred billion will come in new taxes. Our \ninsurance premiums are likely to go up instead of down because we will \nall be buying new government-approved programs.\n  If Speaker Pelosi is successful in adding the government-run option \ninto the bill before it finally gets through, millions of Americans \nwill be losing their insurance because employers will be paying a fine, \ninstead of the insurance, because their employees can go to the \ngovernment program. We are going to be paying for it. If you are a \nMedicare beneficiary, if you pay taxes, if you are a State taxpayer, if \nyou buy insurance, you are going to be paying for this program. So it \nis important for the next 3 to 4 weeks that as we debate this, we ask \nthese questions.\n\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Texas on the floor, and I \nwonder, as I conclude my remarks, whether he has thought a little bit \nabout whether it is going to be possible to ensure 29 million more \npeople, spend hundreds of billions of dollars, and still reduce the \ndeficit and reduce costs to the American people who are trying to \nafford their insurance premiums today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I would respond to the distinguished \nSenator from Tennessee, of course not. The American people are smart. \nThey can understand that these numbers are not going to add up. As our \nRepublican leader said this morning, this bill that was reported in the \nnewspaper and scored by the Congressional Budget Office yesterday will \nnever see the light of day. So this is a work in progress.\n  We are committed, I think on a bipartisan basis, to reform our health \ncare system. But the goal--and we need to keep our eye on the goal--is \nto bring down the cost and to cover people who currently are not \ncovered. This bill, unfortunately, does not accomplish those goals. But \nwe are going to keep working with our colleagues, if they will be open \nto our suggestions. But I have to tell you, as a member of the Finance \nCommittee, virtually every suggestion Republicans made during the \namendment process to this bill was voted down on a party-line basis.\n  I came to the floor to talk about one of those amendments the Senator \nfrom Tennessee mentioned, where we asked merely that the bill--once it \nis reduced to legislative language and the cost is determined--be put \non the Internet for 72 hours. That was voted down along a party-line \nvote. But I thank the Acting President pro tempore and other folks on \nthe other side of the aisle, eight of whom have written to the majority \nleader saying that makes sense to them. So I hope we will build a \nbipartisan consensus for more transparency in the debate.\n  I have also come to the floor to talk about how it makes no sense to \ncut Medicare benefits for 11 million Medicare beneficiaries who happen \nto be engaged in the Medicare Advantage Program in order to pay for \nthis bill. Why would you take $\\1/2\\ trillion from Medicare, which is \non a pathway to bankruptcy by 2017, in order to create a new government \nprogram? It can only make sense inside the beltway and if you \nvoluntarily suspend your powers of disbelief. It does not make sense \nacross the country. That is why it is so important to have these \ndiscussions, ask these questions, have transparency.\n  Today I wish to ask another question: Will the health care proposals, \nsuch as the Finance Committee proposal and others, break the \nPresident's promise of not raising taxes on families making less than \n$250,000 a year? Unfortunately, the Finance Committee bill does, in \nfact, raise taxes on families making less than $250,000 a year. So the \nPresident cannot keep his promise if we pass this particular \nlegislation.\n  For example, this bill imposes a penalty on individuals who do not \nmeet the Washington-imposed mandate that will be enforced by the \nInternal Revenue Service. The Internal Revenue Service is going to \nimpose a penalty on you if you do not have health insurance that meets \nthe Washington-imposed mandate.\n  According to the Joint Tax Committee, the penalty initially included \nin the bill would especially hit middle-class families hard. They found \nthat at least 71 percent of the penalty would come from people earning \nless than $250,000 a year.\n  The bill also increases the penalty from 10 percent to 20 percent for \nAmericans who use a portion of their health savings account for \npurposes other than qualified medical expenses. It seems to me we ought \nto be encouraging more people to use their health savings accounts \nrather than less. But as I discussed yesterday on the telephone with \nthe CEO of Whole Foods, John Mackey, he said the health savings \naccounts--they call them wellness accounts, which are overwhelmingly \nsuccessful and voted on every year with the satisfaction rate of some \n85 percent or more by the employees of Whole Foods, headquartered in \nAustin, TX--will be an illegal plan under this mandate. Insurance \npremiums, of course, will go up in the process.\n  This bill also raises the floor on deductions of medical expenses to \n10 percent from its current level of 7.5 percent. So you will be able \nto deduct less of your medical expenses if you have serious health care \nexpenses, which means your taxes will go up. If you can deduct less, \nyour taxes will go up.\n  The committee did, I would point out, consider an amendment that was\n\n[[Page S10261]]\n\nintended to bring the bill in line with the President's promise not to \nraise taxes on people making less than $250,000 a year, and it was \nvoted down along party lines. Republicans were for it and Democrats \nwere against it. This amendment would have protected families who earn \nless than $250,000. But, as I say, it was voted down.\n  In addition to imposing taxes on people the President promised not to \nimpose taxes on, this also imposes additional so-called industry fees, \nwhich experts have said will ultimately be passed down to consumers in \nhigher insurance costs. So instead of making insurance more affordable, \nthis bill would actually make it less affordable and head in the wrong \ndirection. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint \nTax Committee both confirmed these fees would be passed along to \nconsumers and ultimately raise insurance premiums.\n  So my question for today is: Will these proposed health care reforms \nbreak the President's promise not to raise taxes on those making \n$250,000 or less? Unfortunately, the Finance Committee proposal, which \nwe will now apparently vote on on Tuesday of next week, does break the \nPresident's promise.\n  But Republicans stand ready to work with our friends on the other \nside if they will accept some ideas on how to do this to bring down \ncosts and to cover more people to make health coverage more affordable. \nBut so far all those suggestions have been rejected along party-line \nvotes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, along with my colleague, I noticed, with \ngreat interest, the headline in this morning's paper that said the \nCongressional Budget Office has said the health plan that is coming out \nof the Finance Committee will not increase the deficit. I thought: That \nis a little bit hard to believe. Then I looked at the details, and all \nof this reminded me of a scene out of an old movie. The movie is not \nworth talking about, but the scene is worth talking about to describe \nwhat is happening.\n  It was a circumstance where a spendthrift husband comes home to a \nfrugal wife with a new car. The wife takes one look at the new car and \nsays: Why in the world are we doing this? We can't afford a new car.\n  He said: No. Remember, we got that windfall. There was an inheritance \nthat came through. We got some extra money. We can afford the new car, \nand it will not add--to use the terms of politicians--a dime to the \ndeficit because we have this windfall coming in and we can spend it on \nthe new car.\n  She said: Are you kidding? The roof is leaking. The college fund for \nthe kids is empty. Our house payments are in arrears. We got that \nwindfall. We could take care of some of these other problems. We don't \nneed a new car.\n  Well, he said: We got the money and I have already spent it on the \ncar and there is nothing you can do about it now.\n  As it turned out in the movie, the new car got repossessed later on \nbecause he had only made a downpayment on it, and they could not afford \nthe payments to keep the car.\n  Why do I say the health care debate reminds me of this scene from the \nmovie? The Federal debt is rising. The deficits from the regular \nappropriations bills are enormous. We are wallowing in red ink in the \nFederal Government. But this bill is not going to add to the deficit \nbecause we found $1 trillion as a way to pay for it. We found $1 \ntrillion someplace else we can use to pay for this bill. We can buy \nthis new car, and, OK, the roof is leaking, the college fund is gone, \nthe house payments are in arrears, but somehow we have a trillion extra \ndollars that we think is best spent on the new car.\n  If the new car is that much better than the old car, maybe the case \ncould be made that we should take this $1 trillion and spend it on the \nnew car. What do we get for $1 trillion from the Baucus bill? The $1 \ntrillion, which, if it is available to make this thing deficit-neutral, \ncould very well be spent in balancing other budgetary problems and \npaying down the national debt and doing other things with it.\n  If we do have $1 trillion to spend here, what are we getting for it \nwhen we are spending it entirely on the Baucus bill? Well, we are \ngetting a continuation of defensive medicine because there is no \nsignificant malpractice reform, tort reform in this bill.\n  In his speech to the Congress, President Obama said:\n\n       I don't believe malpractice reform is a silver bullet, but \n     I have talked to enough doctors to know that defensive \n     medicine may be contributing to unnecessary costs.\n\n  I do not want to argue with the President that much because I was \ndelighted when he said that, and I was on my feet applauding with \nothers for that particular statement. I would say, defensive medicine \nnot ``may be'' contributing to unnecessary costs; defensive medicine \n``clearly is'' contributing to unnecessary costs. But we are not \ndealing with that in the Baucus bill. We are raising $1 trillion \nsomewhere else so we can continue business as usual with respect to \ndefensive medicine and malpractice awards within our present system. So \nthe new car is no better than the old car. It is costing us a lot more \nmoney, but it is no better than the old car.\n  Are we getting coverage of the 47 million Americans whom we hear \nabout over and over again in the debate, when they say: Well, the whole \npurpose we have to undertake this is because we have 47 million \nAmericans who do not have health care coverage. Are we getting them \ntaken care of? Do we have room for them in the new car? Well, not \nreally.\n  According to the paper this morning, we are going to get 29 million \nof the 47 million taken care of, which means roughly 20 million left \nout. We can go into the details of who the 47 million are. As we do, we \nfind out it is a very mixed bag of people who are just passing through \nthat category, people who deliberately choose not to be there. If we \nare spending $1 trillion just to get to 29 million out of the 47 \nmillion, we are not getting a very good new car. We are not getting an \nimprovement over what we have already.\n  Again, that $1 trillion could be spent in a much better and wiser \nway. If, indeed, we have an extra $1 trillion we can spend on health \ncare--if, indeed, we do have an opportunity to buy a new car--this is \nthe kind of thing we could get for the $1 trillion, if we said: All \nright, we have an extra $1 trillion lying around, let's put it in \nhealth care. We could double cancer research funding; we could provide \ntreatment for every American whose diabetes or heart disease is going \nunmanaged; we could create a global immunization campaign to save \nmillions of children's lives; and we would still have enough money left \nover to keep doing these programs for at least a decade and probably \nmore.\n  That is what we could get for a new car in the form of health care \nreform, if we were willing to spend the trillion dollars on trying to \nimprove people's health. Instead of trying to improve people's health, \nwe are simply trying, through this bill, to keep the present system as \nit is.\n  I have heard my friends from the other side of the aisle say \nrepeatedly: The present system is broken. The present system is not an \nacceptable alternative. The present system must be changed. I say: \nHooray. I agree. I just wish the Baucus bill would deal with the \npresent system. I just wish the Baucus bill would give us, in fact, a \nnew car rather than simply replacing the old car with a duplicate of \nthe old car that happens to cost an extra $1 trillion.\n  So I am hoping that as we move things forward, we can make some \nsignificant changes in it because at the present time what we have here \nis a program that would spend Federal cash for a clunker.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. What is the pending order, Mr. President?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in morning business \nfor another 27 minutes.\n\n[[Page S10262]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/08/senate-section/article/S10262-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10262-S10265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  As the dean of the Democratic Women in the Senate, we wish to tell \nour colleagues and the American people that we want to join together as \nwomen of the Senate today to talk about the compelling issues facing \nthe American people in terms of the need for health care reform. We are \ngoing to be speaking out and speaking up about the need for reform. I \nwill be the wrap-up speaker.\n  In order to kick it off, I am going to yield--how much time does the \nSenator from Minnesota need?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I would say 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. We have nine speakers.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I will need 3 minutes.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from Minnesota.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the \nimportance of health care reform to the women of this country.\n  Let me tell my colleagues how I got interested in this issue. When my \ndaughter was born, she was very sick. She couldn't swallow. She was in \nintensive care. They thought she had a tumor. It was a horrendous \nmoment for our family. I was up all night in labor, up all day trying \nto figure out what was wrong with her, and they literally kicked me out \nof the hospital--my husband wheeled me out in a wheelchair after 24 \nhours--because at that point in our country's history, they had a rule; \nit was called driveby births. When a mom gave birth, she had to get \nkicked out of the hospital in 24 hours.\n  Well, I went to the legislature with a number of other moms and we \nsaid: Enough is enough. We got one of the first laws passed in the \ncountry, in the State of Minnesota, guaranteeing new moms and their \nbabies a 48-hour hospital stay. My favorite moment of this was at the \nconference committee when there were a number of people who were trying \nto get the implementation of this bill delayed so it wouldn't take \neffect. I went there with six pregnant friends of mine. When the \nlegislature said, when should this bill take effect, the pregnant women \nall raised their hands and said, ``now.'' That is what happened. That \nis what the women of America are saying today. They are saying, \n``Now.'' They cannot keep having these escalating health care costs \nthat are making it harder and harder for them to afford health care.\n  I always tell the people in my State to remember three numbers: 6, \n12, and 24. About 10 years ago, the average family was paying $6,000 \nfor their health insurance. Now they are paying something like $12,000, \na lot of them paying even more; small businesses, even more. Ten years \nfrom now, they are going to be paying $24,000, if we don't do something \nto bend this cost curve.\n  Medicare is something that is so important for women in this country. \nIt is going to go in the red by 2017.\n  One of the things that really bothers me about the current situation \nis this preexisting condition issue. I couldn't believe what I found \nout last week: In nine States and the District of Columbia, women who \nare victims of domestic abuse or who have been victims of domestic \nabuse can be denied health care coverage because domestic abuse can be \nconsidered a preexisting condition. So they get abused and then they \ncan't even get the health care coverage to help them. Maternity, being \npregnant--these things can all be preexisting conditions, and that is \nsomething we need to stop.\n  That is why I am so glad one of the major proposals in this reform is \nto do something about preexisting conditions. We also need to make sure \npreventive care--so important to women--things such as mammograms are \ncovered in our health care plan.\n  Finally, one of the things I know the Senator from Maryland has been \nsuch a leader on is aging parents. People such as myself, we have kids \nof our own and then we also have aging parents. We are caught in what \nthey call the sandwich generation: taking care of our own kids and \nmaking sure our parents get care at the same time. Predominantly, a lot \nof women are in this situation. That is why the CLASS Act, which \nSenator Kennedy proposed and which is in one of the health care \nproposals, which allows Americans to use pretax dollars to pay for \ntheir health insurance and their long-term care insurance is so \nimportant.\n  So I am glad for American women that we are moving forward on this \nhealth care reform.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we thank the Senator for her advocacy to \nend this driveby delivery and other punitive practices.\n  I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I am joining my colleagues on the floor \ntoday to talk about how health care reform will improve women's access \nto care.\n  I recently received an e-mail from a woman in Raleigh that truly \nunderscores why women need health care reform in America. Julie wrote \nto me about her sister who was uninsured and waited years for a \nmammogram because she literally couldn't afford to pay for one. Then \nshe found a lump in her breast. By the time the lump became a mass, \nJulie's sister finally got a mammogram and had to pay for it with cash. \nThe mammogram confirmed what she suspected: She had breast cancer. But \nnow that she had the diagnosis, she had no way to pay for the \ntreatment. Julie's sister lost her battle with breast cancer this \nMarch. Like thousands of women across America, perhaps Julie's sister \ncould have beaten this cancer if she had had access to affordable, \npreventive care and, after her diagnosis, access to either insurance or \nmedical care to cover her cancer treatment. In this heartbreaking \nsituation, Julie's sister was sick and stuck.\n  Unfortunately, I hear about such cases far too often. Inefficiencies \nand discriminatory practices in our health care system \ndisproportionately affect women. In all but 12 States, insurance \ncompanies are allowed to charge women more than they charge men for \ncoverage. The great irony here is that mothers, the people who care for \nus when we are sick, are penalized under our current system.\n  My daughter Carrie recently graduated from college and had to \npurchase her own health insurance. For no other reason than her gender, \nher insurance policies cost more than they do for my son Tilden.\n  Yesterday, a 23-year-old staffer in my office, a female from \nFayetteville, shopped for health insurance on the individual market for \nthe most basic, bestselling plan. It would cost her $235 a month; for a \nman of the same age, $88. That is 2\\1/2\\ times more expensive, close to \n$1,800 more per year.\n  Many women who have health insurance are still stuck. Insurance \ncompanies don't often cover key preventive services such as mammograms \nand pap smears. Often, the copays for these critical services can be \nout of reach for many women when they range as high as $60 a visit. \nMore than half of all women, like Julie's sister, have reported \ndelaying preventive screenings. Without insurance, mammograms cost well \nover $100.\n  In many cases, the difference between life and death is early \ndetection. The Affordable Health Choices Act--which I worked with my \ncolleagues on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee to \ncraft--makes preventive care possible for women across America. It \neliminates all copays and deductibles for recommended preventive \nservices.\n  We are also stopping insurance companies from charging women more \nthan men or using preexisting conditions as a reason to deny anyone \nhealth insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I now yield 3 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the dean of the women in this \nSenate, Senator Mikulski, for bringing us all together on the Senate \nfloor, and I join with my great colleagues from California and North \nCarolina and other colleagues who will be joining us\n\n[[Page S10263]]\n\nas well, to talk about the importance of health care reform for women.\n  Women are the majority of the population. We have the ability to \nbenefit from this reform that holds insurance companies accountable and \ncreates more opportunity for coverage. We will see a great benefit to \ncome from all of this, and I want to speak to just one piece of it. We \nknow the majority of people today--men and women, families--have \ninsurance, and there are a multitude of bad insurance company practices \nthat are occurring today stopping people from getting coverage because \nthey have a preexisting condition.\n  By the way, we found out just last week, from an article in the \nWashington Post, that some insurance companies treat pregnancy, or the \nintention to adopt, as a reason to reject someone for a preexisting \ncondition. I mean that is pretty shocking to me. In fact, the same \nreport said that being pregnant or being an expectant father, with some \ncompanies, was grounds for automatic rejection--automatic rejection--\nwhen it comes to being able to get a health insurance policy.\n  So this reform is about making sure everyone benefits; that women who \nhave insurance, as well as women who don't currently have access to \nhealth insurance, can see protections and changes that stop the \ndiscrimination and create better access to health care because that is \nwhat this is all about, being able to find affordable health care and \nhealth care that meets our needs. All women across the country \ncertainly are desperately concerned about that. We have 62 million \nAmerican women right now who are in their childbearing years, and I was \nquite shocked to learn that right now, according to the Women's Law \nCenter, nearly 60 percent of the individual insurance plans that are \nout there in the marketplace--if you are not getting insurance through \nyour employer, but you are going out yourself to find an insurance \npolicy for you and for your family--nearly 60 percent don't provide any \ncoverage for maternity care or even an option of supplemental insurance \nfor an additional cost.\n  So for the women in these plans who are attempting to get insurance, \nno amount of money can buy the maternity care that they need. So this \nbill is about changing that and making sure the women of this country \nhave the care they need.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I thank the Chair.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I now yield 3 minutes to the Senator from California, \nMrs. Boxer.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank Senator Mikulski for her leadership. Everyone in \nAmerica has a stake in health care reform, even if they are happy with \ntheir insurance at the moment. The main reason is that costs are \nexploding and health care insurance companies are walking away without \nany penalty. They come up with a reason, and then we all are paying for \nthose who have no insurance and wind up in the emergency room.\n  Women have even more at stake. Why? Because they are discriminated \nagainst by insurance companies, and that must stop, and it will stop \nwhen we pass insurance reform.\n  Now, how are women discriminated against? If they have been victims \nof domestic violence, that is considered to be a preexisting condition \nand, therefore, they are told they can't get insurance, and that \nhappens in eight States and the District of Columbia. It is a tragedy, \nand it will change when we pass health insurance reform.\n  If a woman is pregnant, only 14 States in America require insurance \ncompanies to cover maternity care. Imagine, a country that puts family \nvalues first and yet only 14 States will cover maternity. That will \nchange.\n  Everyone is faced with huge increases in cost, but women 18 to 55 are \ncharged nearly 40 percent more than men for similar coverage in my home \nState, and that happens in most States, and health reform will stop \nthat.\n  Because of discrimination, women are at risk under the current \nsystem. More than 52 percent of women reported delaying needed care or \navoiding it completely because of cost compared to 39 percent of men. \nNow, 39 percent is terrible, but 52 percent is deplorable. People are \nwalking around sick because they can't afford to go to the doctor. \nHealth insurance reform will stop it. There will be no more gender \nrating.\n  Women earn less than men, and that is why it is an impossible \nsituation. In my home State, over the past 9 years, premiums have risen \nmore than four times as fast as earnings. We spend more than twice as \nmuch as any other industrialized Nation on health care. You would think \nwe would have greater outcomes, Mr. President, but we rank 29 out of 30 \nindustrialized nations in infant mortality. It isn't surprising, when \nso many women are not getting prenatal care.\n  Medicare: More than half of those on Medicare are women. If we do \nnothing, Medicare goes broke in 2017. So when politicians try to scare \nour seniors, it is despicable because it is the status quo that is \ndangerous. When we fix Medicare--and we will in health reform--women \nwill get free preventive care, mammograms, and annual physicals.\n  So in summary, women, children, and men need us to act on health \nreform. We must make our voices heard.\n  I thank my colleagues, my women colleagues, for coming to the floor \nof the Senate today to wake up this Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I now yield 3 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I thank our leader, the Senator from \nMaryland, Barbara Mikulski, for organizing this effort on the Senate \nfloor this morning. I am pleased to join my sisters and colleagues in \nthe Senate this morning to raise some specific and important issues \nrelative to this reform debate that is moving forward. They are \nimportant facts as we press forward with our reforms.\n  I would like to begin, just briefly, with reminding all of us that we \nbegan--as the President called for us to do--to focus on health care \nreform and to reduce cost--cost to our Nation, cost to our States, cost \nto individual businesses as they continue to see these premiums \nskyrocketing beyond their ability to either afford or to control, and \ncost to individuals.\n  The Baucus mark in the Senate Finance Committee, which is pending, \ngoes a significant step forward in terms of the cost issue. That is \nvery encouraging to those of us who believe that health care reform is \nessential for several reasons. But one of the important reasons is to \nget cost under control and to begin to help balance the Federal budget \nand get us back on a sure financial footing, which--as has been stated \nby many experts, Mr. President--is impossible without fundamental \ninsurance reform. So that is point 1.\n  Point 2, the benefit of moving forward with reform will significantly \nimprove outcomes for women, as the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, \nstated. It is going to help all Americans, but it is going to be \nparticularly helpful for women of childbearing age, who are often \ndiscriminated against with insurance rates because they have to see \ndoctors more often just by the very nature of pregnancy and the care \nthey require. Because they have to see their doctors more often, their \ninsurance is sometimes significantly higher.\n  In fact, the records show that the cost of an insurance plan for a \n40-year-old woman can be up to 38 percent more than a 40-year-old man \nin the same circumstance--same health, same geographic location. Our \nreform efforts will eliminate that bias and make health care more \naffordable for everyone but particularly for women.\n  I wanted to take my last minute to talk about a letter I received \nfrom Denelle Walker, a 25-year-old woman living in Baton Rouge, who \njust graduated from school and went on to get a job.\n  Mr. President, 20 percent of Denelle's modest paycheck--20 percent--\nis going toward insurance. This bill will help young women such as \nDenelle, middle-aged women, and older women on the issue of \naffordability.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I now yield 3 minutes to the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to join my women \ncolleagues in the Senate today to talk about the importance of passing \nhealth\n\n[[Page S10264]]\n\ncare reform for all the women in this country, and I want to thank \nSenator Mikulski for her leadership on this issue.\n  Plainly and simply, the status quo is not working. Today's health \nsystem is simply not meeting the needs of women. For too many women and \ntheir families today, quality, affordable health care is out of their \nreach.\n  It should surprise no one that women and men have different health \ncare needs. Despite this difference, it is unacceptable that women are \nnot treated fairly by the system and do not always receive the care \nthey require and deserve. In cases where women can find coverage that \nis affordable, often it is woefully inadequate.\n  A recent survey by the National Women's Law Center found that the \nvast majority of individual market health insurance policies did not \ncover maternity care, and only a few insurers sell a separate maternity \nrider. That isn't that surprising when you consider, as we have heard, \nthat only 14 States require maternity coverage and insurance companies \nare all about their bottom line. Defending the practice, one insurance \nspokesman called pregnancy ``a matter of choice.'' To make matters \nworse, many insurance companies consider C-sections a ``preexisting \ncondition.'' One insurer simply rejects women who have had C-sections. \nThis is unbelievable.\n  What is most shocking to me is that insurance companies can deny \ncoverage to a woman for having been a victim of domestic violence. \nDomestic violence--something no woman plans for or wishes upon herself \nor anyone else--can be used to deny insurance coverage. Mr. President, \nthis cannot be allowed to continue.\n  Without a doubt, the current private health insurance framework \nleaves too many women uncovered. For those who are covered, care often \nfalls short. It is time to end the insurance discrimination that women \nface. I am pleased that both Senate bills which have come out of \ncommittee ban discrimination based on preexisting conditions, and I \nalso applaud the Finance and the HELP Committees for putting an end to \ngender discrimination in pricing insurance and ensuring that women and \nmen pay the same price for the same coverage.\n  We must come together to pass comprehensive health reform to help all \nthe women of our Nation who are facing high insurance costs just \nbecause they are women. I applaud the women on the HELP and the Finance \nCommittees for the work they have done and reiterate that any \nlegislation we consider must level the playing field and make health \ncare accessible and affordable for all.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, how much time is remaining in morning \nbusiness?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n\n\n                          Order of Proceedings\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that morning \nbusiness be extended for another 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I withhold that unanimous consent request. I ask \nunanimous consent for 15 minutes and that it be equally divided. I ask \nunanimous consent that morning business on our side be extended for 15 \nminutes and that 15 minutes also be added to the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I assure my colleagues on the other side \nthat all time will be protected. I think there is a little confusion. I \nhave not been briefed on the order. I can assure everyone's time \nagreement will be protected at the time they were assured they could \nspeak.\n  I now yield 3 minutes to the Senator from New York.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of \nhealth care reform on behalf of greater access to health care for \nwomen. I am very grateful to Senator Mikulski for her extraordinary \nleadership on this health care debate.\n  There are few Americans who are not hurt by the rising cost of health \ncare. However, it is shocking to think that in today's America, over \nhalf of this country could be discriminated against in one of their \nmost basic life needs. Women must shoulder the worst of the health care \ncrisis, including outrageous discriminatory practices in care and \ncoverage.\n  According to the data compiled by the National Women's Law Center, \nunder the current system, a 25-year-old woman pays up to 45 percent \nmore for the same or identical coverage.\n  Some of the most essential services required by women are not covered \nby many insurance plans, such as childbearing, Pap smears, or \nmammograms. As a mother of two young children, I cannot imagine how \nawful it would be for a woman who does not have these basic needs \ncovered. That is exactly what millions of women and young mothers face \nbecause of the costs of childbirth.\n  A standard in-hospital delivery costs between $5,000 and $10,000 and \nmuch more if there are complications. In the current system, pregnant \nwomen can be turned down for health care coverage because insurance \ncompanies would rather evade those costs. Pregnancy should never be a \npreexisting condition. Such discrimination is unacceptable and is \ncontrary to our core American values of equality and equal rights.\n  As we address the inadequacies of our current system, we must \nsafeguard the women's health clinics that are an essential point of \ncare for millions across this country. Their work is being politicized \nas part of this debate. Politicizing health care delivery endangers \nyoung women, putting them at risk for teen pregnancy, STDs, cervical, \nor breast cancer. Women's health clinics provide critical services to \nwomen every day.\n  In my own State, over 400,000 New Yorkers receive health care from \nPlanned Parenthood each year. About 50 percent are working adults whose \njobs do not include health benefits. Our strategy for reform must \nprotect these critical services that clinics provide and expand upon \ntheir success.\n  The health care crisis is a life-and-death issue for so many \nAmericans--one that disproportionately affects women in this country. \nWe must reform our broken health care system and disparities among race \nand gender and make quality, affordable health care available for every \nsingle American.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I now yield 4 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Washington State.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Mikulski, \nand all of the women who are out on the floor today to talk about this \ncritical issue because the rising cost of health insurance is hurting \nwomen and it is hurting our country.\n  For the millions of women across this country who open the mail each \nmonth to see their premiums rising dramatically, who cannot get \npreventive care, such as mammograms, because the copays are too much or \nthey work part time or for a small business that does not provide \ninsurance for them and their families, who cannot get covered for \nprenatal care or who are forced to stay in an abusive relationship \nbecause if they leave, their sick kids will lose their health care \ncoverage, we are their voice.\n  I remember a similar debate such as this on this floor almost 16 \nyears ago. Senators in this Chamber were debating legislation that \nwould allow 35 million Americans to stay home to take care of a newborn \nor sick child, a parent or spouse, without fear of losing their jobs. I \ncame to the floor then and I told the story about a woman I knew whose \nchild was sick at the time and who was not allowed to take time off \nfrom work to care for him as he was dying because she would lose her \nincome and the health insurance that covered him.\n  At the time, as a new Member of the Senate, I spoke passionately \nabout that. I told the story. As I was walking off the floor, one of \nour colleagues came up to me and said: You know, here in the Senate, we \ndon't tell personal stories. I remember well what I said to him: I came \nhere to tell the stories of the people I represent. They deserve a \nvoice in the Senate.\n  Those stories impacted that debate, and we passed the family and \nmedical leave law.\n\n[[Page S10265]]\n\n  I am back today to tell the story of a woman whose child was sick. I \nwant to tell every one about the story of this little boy, Marcelas \nOwens. I met him at a health care rally in Seattle. He was 10 years old \nand his two sisters who we see in this picture as well have been \nthrough a lot. Two years ago their mother Tifanny, who is not in this \npicture--that is his grandmother--lost her life because she was \nuninsured, 27 years old.\n  How did that happen? Tifanny was a single mom who felt strongly about \nworking to support her family. She worked as an assistant manager at a \nfast food restaurant. She had health care coverage for her family. But \nin September of 2006, she got sick and missed some work. Her employer \ngave her an ultimatum: Make up the lost time or lose your job. Because \nshe was so sick, she physically could not make up the time, and she did \nlose her job.\n  When she lost her job, she lost her health insurance. Without the \ncoverage and care she needed, in June of 2007, Tifanny lost her life, \nand Marcelas and his sisters lost their mom.\n  Our health care system is broken. It is broken for moms such as \nTifanny who work to provide for their families and do the right thing, \nand for men who lose their health care in this market we have today. It \nis broken for women we have heard about who have been denied coverage \nor charged more for preexisting conditions such as pregnancy or C \nsections or, tragically, domestic violence. It is broken for their \nfamilies and for little boys such as Marcelas who will never get back \nwhat he lost.\n  Enough is enough. The time is now. The status quo that is being \ndefended by the other side is not working. For women across this \ncountry, for their families, for our businesses, for our Nation's \nfuture strength that as mothers we care about so much, we have to get \nthis right. We have to remember these stories. We need to be their \nvoice. That is why we are here today and why we are going to keep \nfighting to make sure that we reform the health care insurance system \nin this country finally and do it right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as we wrap up our discussion on health \ninsurance reform, I want to say as the senior Democratic woman that I \nam very proud of my colleagues today and how they have spoken up about \nthe terrible practices of the insurance companies discriminating \nagainst women.\n  What you heard loudly and clearly today is that health care is a \nwomen's issue, health care reform is a must-do women's issue, and \nhealth insurance reform is a must-change women's issue because what we \ndemonstrated is that when it comes to health insurance, we women pay \nmore and get less.\n  We stand today on the Senate floor to say we want equal access and \nequal benefits for equal premiums. We women pay more and get less when \nwe do pay our premiums. A 25-year-old woman is charged more than a 25-\nyear-old man of equal or similar health status. And at age 40, it is \noften up to almost 50 percent. And when we do pay our benefits, when we \nare able to cross that barrier of getting health insurance, we get less \ncoverage because insurance companies have certain punitive practices.\n  No. 1, we are often denied coverage because of something called a \npreexisting condition. These preexisting conditions are not \ncatastrophic. We hear horror story after horror story that a woman who \nhas had a baby by a C section which was medically mandated is then \ndenied subsequent coverage because she had that. We have heard horror \nstory after horror story in some States that victims of domestic \nviolence are denied health insurance because they have been battered by \na spouse and then they are battered by the insurance company.\n  This has to change. Coverage for women is often skimpy and spartan. I \nthink people would find it shocking, good men would find it shocking \nthat maternity care is often denied as a basic coverage or we have to \npay more to get coverage for maternity care. Often on basic preventive \ncare, such as mammograms and cervical screenings, we have to pay \nsignificant copays in order to get them.\n  So we the women are fighting for health care reform. We have very \nbasic things we support. No. 1, we want to make sure that Medicare is \nstrengthened and saved. We know that Medicare is a woman's issue and a \nfamily issue not only because there are more women on Medicare than \nthere are men, but we know that with Medicare, often without it or if \nit is curtailed or shrunk, it would mean disaster.\n  Mr. President, you see that I am speaking from a wheelchair. It is \nbecause I had a fall coming out of 4 o'clock mass a couple of weeks \nago. When going through the ER, the OR, the rehab room, if I did not \nhave Medicare and my health care benefit, I would be bankrupt today.\n  If health care is good enough for a U.S. Senator, it is good enough \nto make sure we have health care for U.S. citizens. So we want to save \nMedicare.\n  We also want to close that doughnut hole. The doughnut hole for \nprescription drugs has been very difficult to swallow. It is time to \nchange that. We want to end the punitive insurance practices of \ndiscriminating on the basis of gender--so whether you have had a C \nsection or whether you need mental health benefits after you have been \nraped, you can get your coverage.\n  Later on this weekend, there will be many in my State who will be \n``Racing for the Cure.'' I think it is great that we are looking for a \ncure for breast cancer, and we salute the Komen Foundation. But we not \nonly want to do the research to find the cure, we want to make sure \nwomen have access to the preventive screening for breast cancer, \novarian cancer, and cervical cancer. We are fighting to make sure that \naccess is provided for these important screenings and there are no \nbarriers for payment.\n  In a nutshell, we, the women of the Senate, have fought for equal pay \nfor equal work. Now we are fighting for equal benefits for equal \npremiums. We hope that when the insurance debate comes to the Senate, \nwe will be able to elaborate. But today, we wanted to say: Let's get \nrid of the mob scene that is going around the debate on health care. \nLet's focus on the important human needs.\n  I now conclude my remarks, and I believe this concludes morning \nbusiness. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/08/senate-section/article/S10265-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor with an amendment that \nwould eliminate another unneeded and unwanted earmark which is \nsuggested by the President of the United States.\n  Before I go into that, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an article from this morning's Washington Post entitled ``Ex-\nStaffers Winning Defense Panel Pork, Study Finds.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Ex-Staffers Winning Defense Panel Pork, Study Finds\n\n                         (By Carol D. Leonnig)\n\n       In the coming year's military spending bill, members of a \n     House panel continue to steer lucrative defense contracts to \n     companies represented by their former staffers, who in turn \n     steer generous campaign donations to those lawmakers, a new \n     analysis has found.\n       The Center for Public Integrity found that 10 of the 16 \n     members of the House subcommittee on defense appropriations \n     obtained 30 earmarks in the bill worth $103 million for \n     contractors currently or recently employing former staffers \n     who have become lobbyists. The analysis by the Washington \n     Watchdog group found that earmarks still often hinge on a web \n     of connections, despite at least three criminal \n     investigations of the practice that became public in the past \n     year. Those probes focus on a handful of defense contractors \n     and a powerful lobbying firm that together won hundreds of \n     millions of dollars in work from the House panel and are \n     closely tied to its chairman, Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.).\n       On Tuesday, the Senate approved a $636 billion military \n     spending bill for fiscal year 2010; the House approved its \n     version in July. House and Senate members now will work in \n     conference to resolve differences between their two bills.\n       The Center for Public Integrity's analysis found some \n     shifts in earmarking patterns since its similar analysis of \n     the 2008 defense bill. First, Rep. Peter J. Visclosky (D-\n     Ind.), whose office records were subpoenaed by federal \n     prosecutors in May, has markedly reduced his earmark requests \n     and sought no work for private companies. Also, defense \n     appropriators are generally steering more earmarks to \n     nonprofits.\n       The Washington Post has documented more than $400 million \n     in defense earmarks that Murtha has directed in the past \n     decade to research groups in his district, including the Penn \n     State Electro-Optics Center and the John P. Murtha Institute \n     for Homeland Security, which steered much of the funds to \n     private contractors.\n       Since last fall, federal investigators have been probing \n     the PMA Group, a now-shuttered lobbying firm whose clients \n     had unusual success in winning earmarks from Murtha's \n     subcommittee. Founder Paul Magliocchetti is a close friend of \n     Murtha's and worked as a defense appropriations staffer when \n     Murtha was a rank-and-file member of the committee.\n       PMA and its clients had been big donors to Murtha and his \n     fellow subcommittee members in the past decade, according to \n     a Center for Responsive Politics report, with Murtha \n     receiving the most. Since 1998, workers at those firms and \n     their family members provided $2.4 million to Murtha--who \n     helped insert more than $100 million in defense-related \n     earmarks into 2008 appropriations bills. Visclosky was \n     second, collecting $1.4 million, and Rep. James P. Moran, Jr. \n     (D-Va.) was next, with $997,000.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I quote from the beginning of it, \nsomething that is well known but continues to be authenticated about \nthe corruption of the process that we go through in appropriations. It \nsays, ``Ex-Staffers Winning Defense Panel Pork, Study Finds.''\n\n       In the coming year's military spending bill, members of a \n     House panel continue to steer lucrative defense contracts to \n     companies represented by their former staffers, who in turn \n     steer generous campaign donations to those lawmakers, a new \n     analysis has found.\n\n  Not an astonishing finding but, again, authenticating of the \ncorruption that goes on around here and the reason Americans are fed \nup.\n\n       The Center for Public Integrity found that 10 of the 16 \n     members of the House subcommittee on defense appropriations \n     obtained 30 earmarks in the bill worth $103 million for \n     contractors currently or recently employing former staffers \n     who have become lobbyists. The analysis by the Washington \n     watchdog group found that earmarks still often hinge on a web \n     of connections, despite at least three criminal \n     investigations of the practice that became public in the past \n     year.\n\n  Mr. President, I bring forward another amendment--this will be my \nsixth--to eliminate a program and the appropriations for it that the \nPresident of the United States has asked for. I often quote from this \ndocument. This will be the sixth one. This document is entitled, \n``Terminations, Reductions and Savings, Budget of the U.S. Government, \nFiscal Year 2010.''\n  Again, I would like to read from the introduction. This comes from \nthe administration. It says:\n\n       The President's 2010 Budget seeks to usher in a new era of \n     responsibility--an era in which we not only do what we must \n     to save and create new jobs and lift our economy out of \n     recession, but in which we also lay a new foundation for \n     long-term growth and prosperity. Making long overdue \n     investments and reforms in education so that every child can \n     compete. . . .\n\n  It goes on and on. In the next paragraph:\n\n       Another central pillar of a sound economic foundation is \n     restoring fiscal discipline. The administration came into \n     office facing a budget deficit of $1.3 trillion for this year \n     alone--\n\n  By the way, I think that is up to $1.4 trillion now--\n\n     and the cost of confronting the recession and financial \n     crisis has been high. While these are extraordinary times \n     that have demanded extraordinary responses, we cannot put our \n     Nation on a course for long-term growth with uncontrollable \n     deficits and debt.\n\n  It goes on to talk about the problems we face.\n\n       [T]he President has announced a procurement reform effort \n     that will greatly reduce no-bid contracts and save $40 \n     billion, and at the Cabinet's first meeting, he directed \n     agency heads to identify at least $100 million in \n     administrative savings.\n\n  Then it says:\n\n       This volume is the first report of that effort. In it, the \n     Administration identifies programs that do not accomplish the \n     goals set for them, do not do so efficiently, or do a job \n     already done by another initiative--and recommends these \n     programs for either termination or reduction.\n\n  We are talking about the administration speaking. We have identified \n121 terminations, reductions, and other areas of savings that will save \napproximately $17 billion next year alone.\n  It goes on to describe what they are:\n\n       Half of these savings for the next fiscal year come from \n     defense programs and half come from non-defense. No matter \n     their size, these cuts and reductions are all important to \n     setting the right priorities with our spending, getting our \n     budget deficit under control, and creating a Government that \n     is as efficient and it is effective.\n\n  As I said at the beginning of my remarks, this will be the sixth \namendment I have offered to support the President's request for \nreduction or termination of unneeded or unwanted programs. I am \nconfident this will be the sixth time that the appropriators on both \nsides of the aisle will vote down the President's request--not my \nrequest, not my assumption, but that of the President of the United \nStates and the Office of Management and Budget.\n  By the way, had the Senate agreed with my amendments--which they did \nnot--and supported the call of the President to end programs that do \nnot accomplish the goals set for them, we would have saved the \ntaxpayers $87 million. In this day and age with multitrillion-dollar \ndeficits, $87 million is not a lot around this town, but it certainly \nis back in my home State of Arizona.\n  What this amendment does, and I quote again from the President's \ndocument, and I will read from it:\n\n       The Budget supports public broadcasting through increased \n     appropriations to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting and \n     eliminates the unnecessary Public Telecommunications \n     Facilities Grant Program.\n\n  Let me make it clear. The administration is supporting increases in \npublic broadcasting but is trying to eliminate the unnecessary Public \nTelecommunications Facilities Grant Program in the Department of \nCommerce.\n\n       PTFP funding equals less than 4 percent of the Corporation \n     for Public Broadcasting funding and has in recent years \n     supported the transition to digital television broadcasts \n     which will be completed in fiscal year 2009.\n\n  The administration goes on to say:\n\n       Since 2000, most [of these] awards have supported public \n     television station's conversion to digital broadcasting. \n     Digital broadcasting facilities mandated by the Federal \n     Communications Commission will be completed in fiscal year \n     2009, and there is no further need for this program.\n\n  Again, it goes on to say:\n\n       The Administration proposes to support public broadcasters \n     through CPB, and the\n\n[[Page S10267]]\n\n     Budget includes $61 million for the Corporation for Public \n     Broadcasting in 2010, which is in addition to the $420 \n     million enacted advance appropriation, for total proposed \n     2010 resources of $481 million, nearly $20 million above \n     2009. The Budget also includes an advance appropriation \n     request for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting in 2012 \n     of $440 million to support public broadcasters. The \n     Corporation for Public Broadcasting funds can support the \n     same types of capital projects as PTFP funding as well as \n     stations' operating and programming costs. . . .\n       The National Telecommunications and Information \n     Administration, the Commerce Department bureau that has \n     administered this program, was provided $4.7 billion in the \n     American Recovery and Reinvestment Act to implement the new \n     Broadband Technology Opportunities Program. Terminating this \n     program will enable the NTIA to focus its efforts on BTOP, \n     [the Broadband Technology Opportunities Program] a major \n     challenge for this small Commerce Department bureau, and one \n     which will aid the nation's economic recovery and help \n     promote long-term competitiveness.\n\n  These are not my words. These are the words of the President of the \nUnited States. We are talking about $20 million savings by eliminating \nthis program.\n  One of the arguments we are going to hear, and one of the great \nsacred cows around here, is the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. \nThis does not affect the increase in funds for public broadcasting. It \nsimply terminates a program that the President of the United States \nbelieves is not necessary because its mission has been completed.\n  I imagine we will lose again with appropriators on both sides of the \naisle voting not to eliminate a program--again, the sixth amendment I \nhave had trying to implement the recommendations of the President of \nthe United States and the Office of Management and Budget, and while we \nare staring at a $1.4 trillion deficit for this year and a $9 trillion \ndebt for the next 10 years. Those estimates have been completely \nunderestimated.\n  I tell the managers, the American people are mad. They are very \nangry. There is going to be another tea party in my home State this \nweekend. You know we are mad because we are stealing their children's \nmoney; 43 cents out of every dollar we are spending today is on \nborrowed money. Who is going to pay it back? They know they are. They \nknow our kids and grandkids are. We cannot even eliminate a program or \nprograms the President of the United States requests that we terminate. \nThere will come, and it will come fairly soon, a day of reckoning.\n  The reason I added this article from the Washington Post this morning \nis because, I say to my friends and colleagues, there is corruption, \nand there is corruption in the earmarking and porkbarrel process that \ngoes on. The American people are tired of it. I urge my colleagues to \nadopt the amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second.\n  There appears to be a sufficient second. The yeas and nays are \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I strongly oppose the amendment of the \nSenator from Arizona to strike the funding in the bill for the \nDepartment of Commerce Public Telecommunications Facilities. His \namendment would eliminate from the bill $20 million. That $20 million \ngoes for competitive grants for public radio and TV stations around the \nNation to upgrade their infrastructure and technology. His amendment \nwould terminate the grant program in fiscal year 2010.\n  He argues that President Obama's budget proposed to eliminate the \nprogram, so Congress should too. We are a separate and coequal branch \nof government. In this case, the CJS Committee respectfully disagrees \nwith the President's budget. We know our President inherited a terrible \nmess. We know the previous administration ran up debts and deficits and \nnow, as we try to clean it out, our President is looking for modest \ncuts to the budget. But here, with public telecommunications \nfacilities, this is exactly what we need during these troubled economic \ntimes to provide access to quality TV to ordinary people who might not \nbe able to afford cable TV, satellite TV, or dish TV.\n  I am ready to dish on the McCain amendment. We need jobs in this \ncountry, and we need to let people know their government is on their \nside and that they can have access to public television--public \ntelevision.\n  Sure it is a public option. We like the public option on TV.\n  But we know for our local stations, where donations are down and \ntheir revenues starved, you cannot put up the necessary antenna and \nother technology by doing it on bake sales and dialing for dollars. \nThey need help from their government. This is what this does: A modest \n$20 million that will help replace equipment such as antennas, power, \nand telephone hookups, generators and other kinds of things.\n  It will improve technology to keep up with changing requirements. \nGrants are competitive. There are no porkbarrel projects in this, no \nearmarks. The grants are competitive. The Commerce Department selects \nwhat are the ones that meet the compelling needs in communities. By the \nway, the local community has to provide 25 percent of local cost share \nso it is not a free ride.\n  The President's budget and the amendment sponsor argue that this \ntechnology program is no longer needed because all radio, public radio \nand TV stations are already going from analog to digital, so we do not \nneed it.\n  This argument is flawed for two reasons. First, digital conversion \nhas never been nor ever will be the sole purpose of the Public \nTelecommunications Facilities Program. The Public Telecommunications \nFacilities Program was intended to help public radio and TV upgrade \ntheir infrastructure and buy new equipment. Digital conversion \nequipment is eligible, but that is not all.\n  I am saying this because not only do we provide public TV. It is \ngreat to have the Corporation for Public Broadcasting. That is about \ncontent. About content. But you need to have an infrastructure to \ndeliver the content. In many of our communities, the infrastructure is \nworn. It is dated. It is 20, 22 years old. So they are looking to \nreplace it. Guess what. When they do replace it, it creates jobs, jobs, \njobs in those local communities. It takes talented men and women to put \nthat antenna or that tower up, to install that very important new \ndigital equipment.\n  For $20 million, we can broadcast to people, we can broadcast \nquality, and we have people going to work putting up and replacing \ndated equipment. Last year this program received almost $50 million in \napplications but had only $20 million to award. This funding is \nimportant in rural and underserved areas.\n  Last year, the technology program received 57 applications from \nNative American communities alone. The President and the Senator from \nArizona argue it is not needed because the Corporation for Public \nBroadcasting will pick up the slack. I will repeat: I love Orszag, but \nmaybe he did not read the fine print, which is the Corporation is for \nongoing operations and programming. It does not provide funding for new \ninfrastructure.\n  It is about infrastructure; just like we want to have money to build \nour highways, we need to have superinformation highways. This helps the \npublic facilities be able to do it. The local communities depend on the \nCommerce Department to do this.\n  The program has built the Public Broadcasting System. It ensures that \nthe American public has access across the Nation. This is not Senator \nMikulski talking because she is the chair of the CJS and she wants to \nhold onto every program. I got a letter, as did my ranking member, from \n21 Members of the Senate, including the chairman of the Commerce \nCommittee, asking us to put $44 million into the Appropriations \nCommittee to fund this. We could only afford to do $20 million, the \nsame as last year.\n  Why? Let me read from their letter: For some four decades, PTFP has \nserved as a critical infrastructure program for building public \nbroadcasting systems of radio and TV stations that reach 95 percent of \nthe American people.\n\n[[Page S10268]]\n\n  What does this do? It maintains infrastructure for transmitters, \ntranslators for the deaf, power, and antennas.\n  It has been drastically underfunded in the past several years since \nsuffering an 18-percent cut in 2002 and 2003. Over the years, PTFP has \nforegone $270 million in Federal funds over the authorized level during \nthe last 8 years.\n  I am not going to sound like an accountant here. I want to sound like \nI have accountability to my communities. I want them to have access to \npublic TV and public radio and the technology to transmit it. ``PTFP's \npreservation role has always been most important,'' says the letter \nfrom the 20 Senators, ``because it is the only source of Federal \nemergency funds for public radio and television in the event of an \nemergency.''\n  After Katrina and Rita, several stations in the gulf region were \nawarded these emergency grants so they could start rebroadcasting. \nWithout those funds, many communities would have been vulnerable to the \ncompounded effects of losing local news and the kinds of programs they \nneeded as they were struggling to rebuild.\n  On average, according to the letter from my 21 colleagues, including \nthe chairman of the Commerce Committee, stations leverage these PTF \nfunds by an additional 50 percent. So this is a Federal-local \npartnership.\n  PTF funding is about providing access to quality TV. In my own \ncommunity, it has meant access to educational programs. It has meant a \nway to link up to community colleges and the way they have done \ndistance learning. Many of the early children's programs, many of those \nearly children's programs often help get children learning ready. \nAgain, yes, that is about content. But content cannot be delivered \nwithout infrastructure.\n  During several weeks this summer as I lived in a rehabilitation \nfacility getting physical therapy, many of my constituents said: Well, \nis it not great to watch public TV? We can see what is going on in the \nworld. They loved the MacNeil/Lehrer show, even though it is not called \nthat anymore, to get news about what was going on in the country.\n  They loved hearing public debate in a civil way, thrilled and enjoyed \n``Mystery Theater,'' and at the same time were excited that their \ngrandchildren were able to get learning ready, either at the preschool \nlevel or the work it was doing in the community college.\n  There are a lot of things government does that is unpopular with \npeople. But one of the things it does that is very popular with the \nAmerican people is public TV and public radio. We have to maintain \nquality content. We have to maintain quality infrastructure.\n  Because of that, I urge the defeat of the McCain amendment \neliminating $20 million and essentially zapping those much-needed \nantenna and monitoring and transmission facilities we need. There are \nother things we can zap. Let's not zap public TV and public radio.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 12:15 \np.m. today the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the McCain \namendment No. 2626; with no amendment in order to the amendment prior \nto the vote; further that prior to the vote, there be 2 minutes of \ndebate equally divided and controlled in the usual form.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I have come to the floor very briefly to \ntalk about the Congressional Budget Office's score of the health care \nreform proposal that is before the Senate Finance Committee.\n  I understand that earlier today there were members on the other side \nwho were questioning whether the Finance Committee's proposal is paid \nfor and whether it reduces the deficit and whether it bends the cost \ncurve of health care in the right way.\n  Let me say that the Congressional Budget Office has now issued their \ndetermination on all those issues. Their conclusions are very clear. \nThe Congressional Budget Office has said--and I will put on the chart \nstand a page from their report. It shows very clearly, over the 10 \nyears of the bill, from 2010 to 2019, that the deficit will be reduced \nby $81 billion if the Finance Committee proposal were to become law.\n  With respect to the question that apparently has been raised by some, \nas to whether this bill is paid for, the Congressional Budget Office \nhas answered clearly and unequivocally. They have said the bill is not \nonly paid for over the 10 years, but it actually reduces the deficit by \n$81 billion.\n  Second, on the longer term question of bending the cost curve and \nwhether this proposal bends the cost curve in the right way, the \nCongressional Budget Office has also been clear and unequivocal. Here \nis what they said in their report of October 7, just yesterday:\n\n       In subsequent years, beyond 2019, the collective effect of \n     the Finance plan would probably be continued reductions in \n     Federal budget deficits.\n       . . . CBO expects that the proposal, if enacted, would \n     reduce federal budget deficits over the ensuing decade \n     relative to those projected under current law--with a total \n     effect during that decade that is in the broad range of \n     between one-quarter and one-half percent of gross domestic \n     product.\n\n  What does that mean? What CBO is saying is in the first 10 years, the \nFinance Committee plan would reduce the deficit by $81 billion. In the \nsecond decade, they are saying it would reduce the deficit by one-\nquarter to one-half percent of gross domestic product. Gross domestic \nproduct over that decade, the second decade, is estimated to be \ncumulatively $260 trillion. That would be the gross domestic product of \nthe United States from 2020 on through the next 10 years. One-quarter \npercent of $260 trillion is $650 billion of deficit reduction in the \nsecond 10-year period. That would be one-quarter of 1 percent of GDP. \nOne-half percent of GDP over that second 10-year period would be $1.3 \ntrillion.\n  Just to be clear, CBO has told us in their report of yesterday--and \nthe Congressional Budget Office is the nonpartisan scorekeeper, the one \nwe all look to for objective facts--that the Finance Committee proposal \nreduces the deficit by $81 billion over the next 10 years and in the \nsecond 10 years would reduce the deficit by one-quarter to one-half \npercent of gross domestic product. No one can be certain what the gross \ndomestic product will be in the second 10 years. Current projections \nare that it will be $260 trillion. So one-quarter to one-half percent \nof that second decade would be a reduction in the deficit from what \nwould otherwise occur of $650 billion to $1.3 trillion, bending the \ncost curve in the right way.\n  I might add parenthetically, the Finance Committee plan is the only \nplan that has been produced that the Congressional Budget Office says \nreduces the deficit in the first 10 years and bends the cost curve in \nthe right way, has further deficit reduction, in the second 10 years.\n  I am a little disappointed when I hear some of my colleagues coming \nto the floor and suggesting that this really isn't paid for. We have a \nway of determining what scores are around here. We can all make up our \nown facts or we can rely on the Congressional Budget Office, which is \nthe objective scorekeeper, nonpartisan. I have great respect for them \neven though I have had strenuous disagreements with them at times about \nhow they score things. Indeed, I had strong disagreements with them on \nhow they scored some of these proposals. But there has to be an \narbitrator here, somebody we look to, someone with credibility, and the \nCongressional Budget Office does.\n  For Members to come to the floor and suggest this isn't paid for \nflies in the face of the facts before us from the CBO. The \nCongressional Budget Office reported yesterday clearly and \nunequivocally that the Finance Committee plan is paid for; that it, in \nfact, reduces the deficit by $81 billion over the next 10 years; that \nit has further deficit reduction in the second decade of one-quarter to \none-half percent of GDP. As I have said, in the second 10 years the \nforecast is that gross domestic product over that 10-year period\n\n[[Page S10269]]\n\nwill approach $260 trillion. One-quarter to one-half percent of that \namount would be $650 billion to $1.3 trillion of additional deficit \nreduction in the second decade. Those are the unvarnished facts. I hope \nthat during the debate, which will be tough enough, which will be \ncontentious enough, we will not resort to trying to mislead people as \nto the objective facts before us.\n  It has been said by a previous President that facts are stubborn \nthings. Indeed, they are. One of the stubborn facts is, we are on a \ncourse that is utterly unsustainable with respect to health care. \nToday, we are spending $1 of every $6 in this economy on health care. \nSeventeen percent of the gross domestic product is going to health \ncare. The CBO long-term budget outlook says that in the next period \nfrom 2010 to 2050, we will go to spending 38 percent of our gross \ndomestic product on health care unless we do something. That would be \nmore than $1 of every $3 in this economy going to health care; in fact, \nclose to every $1 of every $2.50 going to health care. That is an \nunsustainable course.\n  The question before this body and before the Congress and before this \nPresident will be, Do we act or do we stick with the status quo? I \nsuggest sticking with the status quo is utterly indefensible. There is \nno way to suggest that sticking with the status quo is going to succeed \nfor America's families, businesses, or the government itself.\n  The hard reality is, Medicare and Medicaid spending as a percentage \nof GDP is going up dramatically during this forecast period. It has \nbeen happening. This chart shows clearly, between 1980 and 2009, the \nshare of our gross domestic product going to Medicare and Medicaid has \nbeen rising inexorably. We know that trend will continue unless we do \nsomething about it. That means we have to act. That means we have to \ntake responsible steps to rein in the skyrocketing cost of health care. \nThat is critically important to families, businesses, and their \ncompetitive position, and it is absolutely essential to the Federal \nGovernment. The trustees of Medicare have told us clearly: Medicare is \ngoing to go broke in 8 years unless we act. The Medicare trust fund has \nalready gone cash-negative. The Social Security trust fund has already \ngone cash-negative. The time and the need for action is about as clear \nas it can possibly be.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to respond to what some colleagues \nsuggested this morning. It is clear--the Congressional Budget Office \nhas told us--that the Finance Committee proposal is not only paid for, \nit actually reduces the deficit both over the next 10 years and over \nthe next decade after that 10-year period as well. That is a \nsignificant accomplishment by the Finance Committee chairman who laid \ndown this mark. We will see where the votes lie on Tuesday.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I wish to speak on behalf of \nthose of us who are concerned about NASA and express my personal \nappreciation to the Senator from Maryland, chairman of the \nappropriations subcommittee that handles NASA, for the tremendous work \nshe has done in appropriating money to keep NASA going. If I may, I \nwant to go beyond the Senator's appropriation. She has taken the very \ndifficult task of a budget that is quite lean, put out by the \nPresident, and has come up with the best she can come up with in trying \nto sustain the Nation's human space program with those resources.\n  What we know is, over the course of the last several years, the \nOffice of Management and Budget and the White House have not given \nadequate resources to those of us in this Chamber who want a vigorous \nhuman space program. We simply, over the last several years, have not \nbeen able to get the resources we need for NASA to do everything it has \nbeen asked to do, with the result that NASA is now at a crossroads.\n  I commend Senator Mikulski for her work in how she has put together \nthis budget. We find ourselves now with the opportunity beyond this \nspecific budget to strengthen and advance our leadership in the world \nor to stand by and allow what has become a hallmark of U.S. leadership \nto slip by the wayside.\n  Last month, the blue ribbon panel the President appointed, called the \nAugustine Commission, released a summary of the findings from the final \nreport on the Nation's space program. That report has not come out in \ndetail. We await its release. In part, what it says is, the U.S. human \nspace flight program that has made America a world leader in science \nand technology ``appears to be on an unsustainable trajectory.''\n\n  Specifically, the report will say:\n\n       [O]ur space program is being asked to pursue goals without \n     the appropriately allocated resources.\n\n  So this country stands at a crossroads for NASA with a stark choice \nbefore us: We can continue on the path we are on--underfunding and \nunderallocating our space program--or we can choose to act. We can \nchoose to act by ensuring that the appropriate resources are allocated \nto meet the goals laid out before us.\n  The Augustine Commission was abundantly clear. It said that--while \nthe current path we are on is unsustainable--``meaningful human \nexploration is possible under a less constrained budget'' with an \nadditional $3 billion a year. That is $30 billion additional over a 10-\nyear period. These are not my words. These are the Augustine \nCommission's words.\n  Even though we face uncertain economic times--certainly in a \nrecession--the challenge of finding that additional money is one we \ncannot afford to ignore.\n  I wish to add my voice to others from this Chamber in asking the \nPresident to divert $3 billion to NASA from the unspent portion of the \n$787 billion in the economic stimulus recovery money. The stimulus \nbill--that we passed by a one-vote margin back earlier this year--was \nto get this economy moving again, to stimulate, to electric shock \ntherapy the economy back to life by getting dollars out, turned over, \nand jobs created.\n  That is a very good source for this money, for NASA to be able to \ncontinue on the road of what almost every American wishes for--to \ncontinue to explore the unknown.\n  We have identified other possible revenue sources for future years. \nBut no matter how much we find by scraping the bottom of the barrel, it \nis still going to come down to one thing: It is going to be the \nPresident's decision.\n  If we remember, similar to President John Kennedy before him, a \nPresident has to decide and has to commit the resources. If this \nPresident will do it, it will commit the space program that will keep \nAmerica a global leader in science and technology.\n  Why do I say that? Think of all the effects of the spinoffs that came \nout of the Apollo Program when President Kennedy said: We are going to \nthe Moon and back, and that was within a 9-year period.\n  Currently, our space program is funded at less than 1 percent of the \ntotal Federal budget. Yet our space program has always paid back \ndividends--both tangible and intangible--which is vastly greater than \nthe initial investment.\n  The additional funding for NASA, I have indicated, will ensure the \nUnited States remains at the very top for the peaceful use of \ntechnology for the betterment of humankind. Of singular importance, \nthis commitment will help us to inspire the next generation of \nexplorers and the next generation of scientists and technologists and \nengineers and mathematicians and educators. It is this payoff which is \nApollo's greatest and lasting legacy.\n  We have a similar opportunity right now in front of us. You think \nabout that generation of kids who got inspired when President Kennedy \nsaid we were going to do what was almost thought to be the impossible \nand how many of those kids went into math and science and technology \nand engineering. Look what that generation brought to us in the global \nmarketplace.\n  The Augustine Commission notes that the time may finally be upon us \nwhen commercial space companies can begin to carry some of the burden \nof the access to low-Earth orbit. Many of\n\n[[Page S10270]]\n\nthese companies are already developing capabilities to give us a \ncommercial resupply of the International Space Station. Are they going \nto be successful? We certainly hope so. Are they going to be timely? We \ndo not know. These commercial ventures are already behind the timeline. \nWe certainly hope they are going to be timely.\n  This ability, according to the Augustine Commission, is critical to \nensuring our ability to operate the station beyond 2016. Almost \neverybody unanimously agrees we should be planning to keep the \nInternational Space Station, of which we are still continuing to \ncomplete its construction and equipping, to keep that going at least \nuntil 2020 and to maximize the return of what has become a substantial \n$100 billion investment.\n  Those commercial endeavors serve another function. They also create \nnew industries and, with that, new jobs for Americans. But we are still \ngoing to have to have the question of: What is NASA's new mission, new \narchitecture? How are we going to fund it? What are we going to do with \nthe workforce in the meantime that is going to have severe disruptions?\n  This is what the President of the United States is going to have to \ndecide as soon as the Augustine Commission report is final and is \npublished.\n  The International Space Station has proven to us that many nations \ncan work together on enormous endeavors in a peaceful fashion. The \nstation--just now being completed--is at its dawn, and its many \neconomic, scientific, and social payoffs from our investment are still \nto be realized. But the international partnerships formed during the \ndesign, the construction, and the ongoing operation of the station have \nproven something. It has proven that the world community looks to the \nUnited States for leadership in space.\n  Many of the world's nations are patiently waiting to see which \ndirection our country chooses, which direction this country chooses as \na result of our President's decision. At the same time, these many \nnations are prepared to follow the U.S. lead in the form of additional \ncommitments and resources in space. To turn our backs on space at this \nmoment would have negative effects that would reverberate around the \nworld.\n  It is interesting that last night President Obama hosted several \nyoung people at the White House for a star-gazing party. Oh, that must \nhave been very exciting for those young people. They had the \nopportunity to view, in vivid detail, craters on the Moon, the rings of \nSaturn, the colors of the planet Jupiter, and the belt of the Milky \nWay. For many of those kids, it was the first time they ever even \nthought of viewing those things.\n  The wonderment displayed by those children--and many of those adults \nthere as well--proved, once again, that the space program inspires. If \nall goes well, tomorrow morning America will successfully plow a rocket \ninto the surface of the Moon to help determine conclusively whether \nlarge quantities of water can be found just beneath the lunar surface. \nImagine, this mission may reveal new knowledge about a source of water \nfor astronauts in the future and fuel for their rockets to explore the \ncosmos.\n  A suitably funded space program is the best catalyzing element to \ngather and organize the energies and abilities of this Nation. In \nreturn, this program will pay many dividends, perhaps the most \nimportant of which is to inspire, encourage, and motivate the next \ngeneration of Americans.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting Senator Mikulski on her \nappropriations bill but then to join me in supporting increased funding \nfor NASA and this Nation's space program.\n  You can tell I am quite intense about this subject. I have had the \nprivilege of being a beneficiary of our Nation's space program. I have \nseen us achieve extraordinary things. It is a part of our character as \na people. We are, by nature, as Americans, explorers and adventurers, \nand I do not want us to ever give that up. That is why I make this plea \nto the Congress of the United States and to the President of the United \nStates for NASA's funding.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, many of my colleagues have taken to the \nfloor in recent weeks to discuss the details of health care reform and, \nin particular, the clear need for a public option.\n  We have heard from distinguished Senators on both sides of the aisle. \nFor the most part, this has been a healthy debate. But it is a debate \nthat has been going on for almost a century. Over the years, the \nproblem has grown. Care has become more and more expensive.\n  Today, $1 out of every $6 spent in this country goes to pay for \nhealth care. Insurance company profits are up. Health outcomes are \ndown. After a century of thoughtful debate, I believe the way forward \nis clear--very clear. The only way to achieve meaningful health care \nreform and bring costs down is through a public option that creates \nreal competition in the system.\n  Let me be clear. I will not vote for any health care bill that does \nnot include a public option. That is because the stakes are too high to \nsettle for anything less.\n  Every day, more people get sick and die because they cannot get the \nquality care they need; 45,000 Americans died last year because they \ndid not have adequate coverage. That is one death every 12 minutes and \n45,000 more will die this year and next year and every year until we \npass meaningful health care reform.\n  Some of my colleagues think we are moving too fast, and they say we \nshould wait. I say the American people have been waiting long enough. \nWe must not wait another moment.\n  A public option would restore choice and accountability to the \ninsurance market. It would help bring down costs and make quality care \naffordable for every single American.\n  If you cannot afford private insurance under the current system, you \nwill have the opportunity to buy a low-cost public plan or a private \nplan that is guaranteed to be affordable based on your income level.\n  If you have private insurance but it is too expensive or they do not \ntreat you right, you will have the opportunity to switch to an \naffordable and high-quality public plan. No American has ever \nexperienced such freedom of choice when it comes to health coverage. \nThat is because consolidation in the insurance market has left a few \ncorporations with control of the whole industry. In Illinois, two \ncompanies dominate 96 percent of the market. They can charge \nexcessively high premiums, drop your coverage for any reason or no \nreason at all, and cap the amount they will spend on treatment in any \ngiven year. That is why their profits are breaking records and growing \nfour times faster than wages, while the rest of us suffer the effects \nof a terrible recession.\n\n  But we can rein in these costs. If we pass insurance reforms that \ninclude a public option, these corporations would have to compete for \nyour business. Premiums would come down. No one would be able to drop \nyour coverage because of a preexisting condition. Companies would not \nbe able to drop you in the event of a catastrophic illness, and they \nwould not be able to place a cap on the benefits you can receive during \nyour lifetime. Honesty and fair play would be restored to the system.\n  I don't understand how my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \ncan oppose such a plan. I don't understand how they can oppose \ncompetition in the market, which I have always regarded as a \nquintessential American idea. Certainly there is nothing wrong with \nmaking a profit. Insurance companies play an important role in our \nsystem, and I support that role. But between 2000 and 2007, the profits \nfor the top 10 insurance companies grew at an average of 428 percent. \nLet me repeat that. Between 2000 and 2007, the profits of the top 10 \ninsurance companies grew by an average of 428 percent. This is not only \nunreasonable, it is breaking American businesses and families.\n  Many analysts agree that health care costs have contributed to the \nseverity of the current economic crisis, and it is easy to see why. \nCompetition and appropriate regulations will rein in these excessive \nprofits and put pressure on the companies to improve coverage or risk \nlosing customers.\n\n[[Page S10271]]\n\n  Reform with a public option will restore choice to the insurance \nindustry. Millions of Americans will be able to get coverage for the \nvery first time. And far from driving companies out of business, health \nreform will allow an estimated 1 million to 3 million new customers to \npurchase coverage from private insurers. It will enhance their \nbusiness.\n  Some of my colleagues have expressed concerns about the cost of a \npublic plan, but if they look at the way the program will function, \nthey will see there is no reason for concern. As in any business, a \nnot-for-profit public insurance option would require some initial \ncapital to get it off the ground, but afterwards it would rely on the \npremiums it collects to remain self-sufficient. The current system is a \nstrain on the American taxpayers. A public option will not be.\n  There will be no government takeover. I will repeat that. There is no \nsuch thing as a government takeover. There will be no death panels, no \nrationing, and no red tape between you and your doctor. The public \noption would complement private insurance providers, not drive them out \nof business.\n  It is time to take decisive action. This Senate has been debating \nhealth care reform for almost a century, while outside this Chamber \nordinary Americans suffer more and more under a broken system. I \nbelieve we have been talking about it enough. Our way forward is clear. \nNow is the time for us to act. That is why I will not compromise on the \npublic option.\n  I urge my colleagues to join with me to stand on the side of the \nAmerican people and demand nothing less than the real reform a public \noption would provide. We must not wait another moment.\n  Mr. President, I thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we will shortly be voting on the McCain \namendment. We look forward to closing that debate. But before we do, I \nwish to comment that we are going to dispose of as many amendments as \nwe can today and we are also going to arrive at a finite list of \namendments. So for those Senators who do have amendments on both sides \nof the aisle, Senator Shelby and I ask our colleagues to come and offer \nthem so we can dispose of them, as we did with the Senator from \nArizona. He offered his amendment, we had a good debate, and we are \ngoing to vote on it. So please, colleagues, if you have amendments, \ncome to the Senate floor and offer them.\n  Second, if you have amendments that you wish to file, this is the day \nto file them. We are trying very hard to see if we can finish today, \nbut that seems to be a bit of an exuberant wish on my part and on the \npart of Senator Shelby. But if we can't finish today, we would at least \nlike to get a sense of the amendments colleagues wish to bring over \ntoday. Then when we get to the Columbus Day weekend, we can work to \neither come to an agreement to take them, or a way of disposing of them \nwhen we come back from commemorating when America was discovered by \nColumbus.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues to come forward and either offer \namendments or file amendments.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2646\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and I call up amendment No. 2646.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alaska [Mr. Begich], for himself and Ms. \n     Murkowski, proposes an amendment numbered 2646.\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To allow tribes located inside of certain boroughs in Alaska \n             to receive Federal funds for their activities)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2626\n\n  There will now be 2 minutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a \nvote in relationship to amendment No. 2626, offered by the Senator from \nArizona, Mr. McCain.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is another attempt to agree with the \nPresident's request to cut some unneeded spending. This time, it is \nonly $20 million, which around here is obviously chicken feed. But the \nPresident has requested that this $20 million be cut. It is not needed. \nThe program it was funded for is complete.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for the amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, as the manager of the bill, I oppose the \nMcCain amendment. This $20 million is competitive funding that helps \nlocal public TV and radio stations with equipment, things such as \nantennas, generators, fire-suppression equipment, and transmission. It \nimproves technology. It enables our very important public TV stations \nto modernize.\n  This is a competitive grant program--no earmarks but big footprints. \nIt does require local cost sharing of 25 percent. It also creates jobs \nin local communities by actually installing this equipment, while we \nmove out the very wonderful content of public TV and public radio.\n  We, too, are stewards of the purse. The Commerce Department----\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, we have to have the regular order at some \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I do like to know that. I like to follow \nthe regular order. If the Chair would have notified me, I would have \nstopped sooner.\n  I call for the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, I also make a point of order against the \namendment that it violates rule XVI, paragraph 4--legislation on an \nappropriations bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The point of order is sustained and the \namendment falls.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I am very disappointed the majority has \nchosen to block full consideration of my amendment. What I am trying to \naccomplish is simply more transparency in the Senate. This would be \naccomplished by requiring a Congressional Budget Office score and \nposting of legislation 72 hours before consideration by committees or \nthe full Senate.\n  As a recent poll has shown, 83 percent of the American people support \na waiting period before Congress votes on bills. My amendment would \nprovide this to the American people. I think it is outrageous the other \nside is using a procedural tactic to block consideration of this \namendment on this bill.\n  Be assured I will be back to bring up this issue again and get a fair \nand full consideration of it by the Senate.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2648, as Modified\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 2648, and I send a \nmodification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2648, as modified.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To provide additional funds for the State Criminal Alien \n       Assistance Program by reducing corporate welfare programs)\n\n       At the appropriate place insert:\n\n                state criminal alien assistance program\n\n       For an additional amount for the State Criminal Alien \n     Assistance Program $172,000,000 to remain available until \n     expended.\n       Offset.--All amounts appropriated under this Act, except \n     for amounts appropriated for SCAAP, shall be reduced on a pro \n     rata basis by the amount necessary to reduce the total amount \n     appropriated under this Act, except for amounts appropriated \n     for SCAAP, under the heading ``Office of Justice Programs'' \n     under this title, by $172,000,000.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise today to propose an amendment \nadding $172 million for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program and \noffset it with corporate welfare funding currently in the bill.\n  The State Criminal Alien Assistance Program, known as SCAAP, provides \nFederal payments to States and localities that incur correctional \nofficer salary costs for incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens \nwith at least one felony or two misdemeanor convictions for violations \nof State or local law and are incarcerated for at least four \nconsecutive days during the reporting period.\n  This program also reimburses State, county, parish, tribal, or other \nmunicipal governments for the costs associated with the prosecution of \ncriminal cases declined by local U.S. Attorney's Offices.\n  While we have made strides in securing our border, illegal \nimmigration remains a significant problem, and the Federal Government \nshould bear the additional burden placed on States and local \ngovernments. While this amendment does not fix our problems with \nillegal immigration, it does help local communities address costs \nassociated with the incarceration of illegal immigrants who continually \nand repeatedly violate the laws of our country.\n  This will bring this program's funding up to the 2009 level of $400 \nmillion. This increase will match the level the other Chamber, the \nHouse of Representatives, accepted by a nearly unanimous vote of 405 to \n1. With increased funding for SCAAP, we can keep more repeat offenders \noff our streets and reduce some of the catch-and-release practices \ninstituted by many communities that just don't have the resources to \nkeep these criminals where they belong, which is behind bars.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to ensure that \ncritical funds reach our State, county, parish, tribal, and municipal \ngovernments to help battle the problems associated with illegal \nimmigration and to keep lawbreaking illegal immigrants off our streets.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article from the Las Vegas Review-Journal relating to this matter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Las Vegas Police Refer 2,000 Inmates to Immigration Officials\n\n                (By Antonio Planas and Lynnette Curtis)\n\n       The Metropolitan Police Department forwarded the names of \n     nearly 2,000 inmates to federal immigration officials during \n     the first 10 months of a controversial partnership that \n     allows specially trained corrections officers to start \n     deportation proceedings against immigration violators.\n       The agreement between the Police Department and U.S. \n     Immigration and Customs Enforcement officially began Nov. 15 \n     and is limited to the Clark County Detention Center.\n       Nearly 10,000 county jail inmates through Sept. 19 were \n     identified as being born outside the country or their \n     identities were in question, said officer Jacinto Rivera, a \n     Las Vegas police spokesman.\n       Police sent the names of 1,849 inmates who were determined \n     to be in the country illegally to ICE for possible \n     deportation.\n       It's unknown how many of those inmates were deported. ICE \n     doesn't track removals that way, the agency said Wednesday. \n     Illegal immigrants referred to the agency by local law \n     enforcement become part of ICE's larger caseload. Those cases \n     can drag on for months or even years.\n       The Police Department's partnership with immigration \n     officials has always been narrower in scope than that of \n     Maricopa County in Arizona and does not allow officers to \n     arrest people for immigration violations. Only once an \n     individual has been arrested on unrelated charges can he or \n     she be screened for possible deportation.\n       Sheriff Doug Gillespie has repeatedly insisted the \n     partnership is meant to target violent criminals.\n       In fact, police did not forward to immigration officials \n     the names of an additional 1,808 inmates who also were \n     identified as being in the country illegally because those \n     inmates had no violent criminal history, Rivera said. \n     Overall, 62,803 people were booked into the county jail \n     between Nov. 15, 2008, and Sept. 19, 2009.\n       Hispanic and civil rights groups have fiercely criticized \n     ``287 (g)'' partnerships, named for the corresponding section \n     of the federal Immigration and Nationality Act, saying they \n     target Hispanics and could lead to racial profiling and make \n     people afraid to report crimes.\n       ``Evidence is mounting across the country that 287 (g) \n     programs are being run in problematic ways,'' said Maggie \n     McLetchie, an attorney with the American Civil Liberties \n     Union of Nevada. ``We understand federal immigration laws \n     need to be enforced, but that's the job of federal \n     immigration officers, not the job of Las Vegas police.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I send a motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nevada [Mr. Ensign] moves to recommit the \n     Act H.R. 2847 to the Committee on Appropriations with \n     instructions to report the same back to the Senate with \n     changes that reduce the aggregate level of appropriations in \n     the Act for fiscal year 2010, excluding amounts provided \n     for the Bureau of the Census, by $3,411,000,000 from the \n     level currently in the Act.\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, what this motion is similar to the motions \nI have made on previous spending bills. What we are asking the \nAppropriations\n\n[[Page S10273]]\n\nCommittee to do is to fund our government at the 2009 level.\n  In 2009, we saw huge funding increases. Then, with all of the \nspending programs, the government has seen massive increases on top of \nthe increases in spending we had last year. So what we are saying is, \nwhile businesses, families, local governments, and State governments \nacross the country are cutting their budgets, the Federal Government \nshould freeze spending levels to 2009 levels. Let us not go on this \nmassive increase in spending.\n  We understand the census, which we do just once every 10 years, is \nnot part of the normal budget process, so we allowed for that. We allow \nfor the census to be funded. But everything else should be funded at \n2009 levels.\n  We allow the Appropriations Committee to set the priorities; that is, \nwhat funding is to go into which particular program. Some programs are \nmore effective than others, and they may have different priorities. \nThat should be the prerogative of the Appropriations Committee. But \nwhat this body should be doing is sending a message to the American \npeople that we care about our children and our grandchildren.\n  What we are seeing right now is that we are borrowing 43 cents of \nevery dollar we spend. Think about that. Think about a family or a \nbusiness borrowing 43 cents out of every dollar they spend. That is \nwhat we are doing. I think this next chart illustrates very well on \nwhom this burden is going to fall.\n  The picture of this young lady was taken out in the public. She had a \nsign around her which said: I am already $38,375 in debt, and I only \nown a dollhouse.\n  It is a picture of a cute little girl, and it would really be a cute \npicture if it wasn't so sad because it is true. Every child in America \nhas a huge debt burden put on them because of the spending.\n  During the last many years we have heard about the spending programs. \nThe other side of the aisle actually ran on fiscal discipline. They \nsaid we spent too much money under the Bush administration. By the way, \nI agreed with that statement. I think we did spend too much money \nduring the first part of this decade. But the spending levels now, in \ncomparison, are skyrocketing. We are adding trillions and trillions of \ndollars in debt to future generations.\n  So my motion, very simply, says: Instead of this large increase in \nthis spending bill, we are going to live at last year's numbers. We are \nnot even going to cut in ways State governments and local governments \nare doing. They are cutting. We are going to live within last year's \nfunding levels--which were, by the way, increased dramatically. Last \nyear, I think the same appropriations bill got a 15-percent increase. \nLet's at least live at last year's level instead of living on huge \nincreases this year.\n\n  I think this motion is the responsible thing to do for future \ngenerations and for the future of our country. We have to think about \nthis debt. What is this debt going to do? We are hearing about the \nweakening dollar. There are articles every day in financial magazines \nabout what a weak dollar means to America. The higher the debt, the \nweaker the dollar gets. We are adding trillions of dollars onto the \ndebt. That weak dollar is going to hurt our economy into the future. We \nhave to worry about not only inflation, but hyperinflation. We have to \nworry about whether jobs are going to continue to go overseas because \nof a weak dollar.\n  Every country that has tried to handle their debt by devaluing their \ncurrency, which is what seems to be going on now--has never succeeded. \nThe only way to control your debt is to get spending under control. \nThat is what we have to do in this body. That is what we have to do in \nthis country. My motion says: Time out. Time out from all the spending. \nLet's at least live at last year's spending level. Let's put a freeze \non Federal spending so we are not hurting future generations. I \nencourage my colleagues to vote for this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Udall of Colorado are printed in today's Record \nunder ``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I come to the floor regularly to share \nletters from constituents of mine, Ohioans, letters we get from people \ncommenting on the health care system. Many of these letters--most of \nthem, in fact--have come from people who thought they had good \ninsurance. If you had called them a year ago or 3 years ago or even, in \nsome cases, a month ago and said: Are you satisfied with your \ninsurance, they most likely would have said yes. Then one of their \nfamily members gets sick and it is a very expensive illness, spend \nweeks in the hospital or has all kinds of doctors visits and tests, and \nthey end up spending so much that they lose their health insurance. The \ninsurance company cancels them. The insurance companies call it a \nrescission.\n  You read the fine print and you see these policies are not what they \nare cracked up to be. That is one important reason why this health \ninsurance bill is so important.\n  Let me share a couple of these letters with my colleagues.\n  Edward, from Montgomery County, that is the Dayton area--Dayton, \nKettering, Huber Heights, that area of Ohio, sort of southwest Ohio.\n\n       About 5 years ago I took my wife to the hospital one \n     evening because she hurt her back. They took an X-ray but \n     told her nothing was wrong. She came back home, but she \n     stayed up all night crying in pain.\n       I then took her to the emergency room where the doctors \n     took an MRI. It showed she had a ruptured lumbar disc that \n     could have led to paralysis. The insurance paid for the MRI, \n     but their attitude was sickening. After being admitted that \n     night, the next day the hospital told her she had to go home \n     because the insurance wouldn't pay for the stay.\n       The doctors and nurses disagreed with that decision, but \n     insurance rules.\n       The public option is the only thing that will keep these \n     companies honest.\n\n  Edward from Montgomery County has it exactly right. He knows we need \ninsurance reform so the insurance companies can no longer deny care for \npreexisting conditions, no longer discriminate against people because \nof gender or disability or age or geography. He understands there \nshould not be a cap, an annual cap or a lifetime cap, on coverage, so \nif someone gets very sick and it is very expensive, their insurance \ncould no longer be canceled.\n  But he also understands not only do we need to change the rules, as \nour bill that we will bring to the Senate floor does, to change those \nrules so insurance companies can no longer game the system, this \nlegislation also includes a strong public option as Edward asked for. A \npublic option will make sure the insurance companies stay honest. It \nwill inject competition into the insurance industry, and it will give \npeople choice. That is why we call it a public option. It is a choice.\n  If you are in southwest Ohio, in my State, you only have two \ninsurance companies, and they have 85 percent of the insurance market. \nThat is not competition. You know that means rates are higher. That is \nwhy injecting competition with the public option will help stabilize \ninsurance rates and make the insurance companies behave a whole lot \nbetter than they have been.\n  Let me share two other letters. I see my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Casey, is in the Chamber. Linda from Hamilton County, also \nsouthwestern Ohio, Cincinnati, Blue Ash, Avondale, that part of Ohio.\n\n       I am 60 years old and I have private health insurance--if \n     you want to even call it that. I pay $450 a month and so few \n     services are covered until I reach a $10,000 deductible.\n       Three years ago I had a double mastectomy. As a result, I \n     can no longer go to another insurance company because of \n     preexisting conditions.\n       I have a good life. My husband and I worked hard, saved our \n     money, and have enjoyed our retirement so far. But I now find \n     myself not being proactive about my health care because I \n     know I will have to pay out-of-pocket for care until I reach \n     $10,000.\n       That's not insurance. It is highway robbery. I want you to \n     vote----\n\n  She says: Senator----\n\n       I want you to vote for the public option. Get in there and \n     fight for those who have nothing and for those of us who want \n     to remain healthy in our golden years.\n\n  Listen to what she says:\n\n       I now find myself not being proactive about my health \n     care----\n\n\n[[Page S10274]]\n\n\n  Because she has a $10,000 deductible, living now, it sounds like, \nprobably, on a fixed income, she simply cannot afford to pay that kind \nof money out of pocket to get the sort of maintenance of care she \nneeds. So she simply is not taking as good care of herself. She is not \nable to have physicians and nurses and others help her maintain her \nhealth the way we encourage our constituents to do. We want people to \nget regular checkups. We want them to do all kinds of preventive care. \nShe can't afford to because of this deductible. So she already, in some \nsense, has been a casualty of our health care system. I pray it is not \nworse than that. But in too many cases, that has happened. She argues \nagain--she says: I want you to vote for the public option. She \nunderstands she will not have this kind of $10,000 deductible if she \nchooses the public option--a choice, but a choice that she sounds like \nshe would make. She will not be turned away or in her mind think she \ncan't get this other health insurance, these other health care services \nbecause they are so expensive. She understands and she asks for a \nchoice--the choice of a public option.\n\n  This is the last letter I will read before I yield the floor.\n  Christopher from Summit County, the Akron area, northeast Ohio, Akron \nand Barberton and Tallmadge and Stow and that area of the State, \nwrites:\n\n       As a 58-year-old self-employed entrepreneur, it is \n     virtually impossible to obtain serious and genuine health \n     coverage insurance. Thanks to a relatively minor pre-existing \n     condition and total lack of a public option, I fall through \n     the cracks in the wealthiest nation in the world.\n\n  Two sentences he writes: ``It is impossible to obtain serious and \ngenuine health insurance'' and ``Thanks to a relatively minor pre-\nexisting condition and lack of a public option, I fall through the \ncracks in the wealthiest nation in the world.'' Why can't somebody like \nChristopher--he is self-employed, he had the initiative to start a \nbusiness and employ himself, and he wants to have insurance. He is 58 \nyears old. His medical problems don't sound particularly severe, but he \nhas a minor preexisting condition. He can't get insurance. That is why \nwe are changing the law. We are no longer allowing denial of care for \npreexisting conditions, but we also need a public option, as \nChristopher asks for, for him to choose from if he would like to choose \nthe public option or Aetna or Medical Mutual, an Ohio company, or CIGNA \nor BlueCross or whatever. But he also understands that the public \noption will enforce these rules, so the insurance companies can no \nlonger game the system. In other words, the public option, as the \nPresident has said, will make the insurance companies more honest.\n  It is clear our legislation does a handful of things that are so \nimportant. It is clear this will move our country forward. It says: If \nyou have insurance and you are satisfied with it, you can keep that \ninsurance, but we are going to build consumer protections around that \ninsurance: No more denial of care for preexisting conditions; no more \ncaps on coverage if you get very sick and you lose your plan--they \ncan't throw you off your plan then; no more discrimination based on \ngender or geography or disability or age.\n  The third thing our legislation does is it gives all kinds of \nincentives to small businesspeople to insure their employees: tax \ncredits, allowing them to go into a larger pool with consumer \nprotections. And our legislation provides insurance for people who do \nnot have it, with some help from the government if people are low or \nmedian income.\n  So all of that will mean a healthier population. It will mean choices \nfor people because they can choose the public option or they can choose \nprivate care, and they know the public option will make our whole \nhealth care system much better.\n  As we move forward and get this legislation to the President's desk \nbefore Christmas, I am excited about what we can do to make peoples \nlives better and to make for a healthier country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, first of all, I commend the words of my \ncolleague, Senator Brown, on the issue of health care but in particular \nthe importance of having a public option in our health care plan and \nthe legislation the Senate will take up.\n\n\n                           Afghanistan Policy\n\n  I rise today to speak in particular with regard to the debate we are \nhaving--just beginning to have, by the way, and need to have a lot more \ndebate about--the U.S. role in Afghanistan, with a special focus in \nterms of my own remarks today on building the Afghanistan National \nArmy. At the same time, I would also like to recognize the dedication \nof the Pennsylvania National Guard as well.\n  But first with regard to Afghanistan, the challenge we face in \nAfghanistan and Pakistan is a grave challenge indeed. Those who might \ndisagree on the way forward or what to do next can agree on that, that \nit is a grave challenge. In order to get it right, and we must get it \nright, we need to debate these issues thoroughly.\n  I have been fortunate enough in the 3 years since I have been in the \nSenate to be a member of the Foreign Relations Committee. As a member \nof that committee, most recently--the last couple of months, really--I \nhave had several opportunities, as others have on the committee, to \nexamine the military, political, diplomatic, and regional implications \nof our presence in Afghanistan. Chairman John Kerry has taken a very \ncomprehensive approach, and I applaud his efforts.\n  I also support the administration's deliberate consideration in \nmaking this strategic determination. The President is taking the time \nthat I believe is necessary to make the right decision.\n  General McChrystal as well has contributed much to this debate, not \nonly with his report but, more importantly than what he put on paper, \nthe kind of leadership he has provided to our troops on the battlefield \nand the way he has assessed the threats to our security and to our \ntroops and to the Afghan people and the way he has articulated those \nthreats.\n  Now he has made a recommendation to the President. We hear a lot \nabout what General McChrystal's report said, at least parts of it. We \nalso hear a lot about General McChrystal's recommendation on troops. \nWhat we have heard very little about and need to hear more about is the \nnonmilitary part. What will happen on the nonmilitary aspects of this \ncounterinsurgency strategy? That is vitally important and at the same \nlevel of importance as what we do militarily. So we have to get it \nright militarily and in terms of the other strategy.\n  But one thing we have not heard a lot about is that General \nMcChrystal has actually, in words I am quoting from the New York Times, \nendorsed the President's deliberate approach. General McChrystal was \nquoted on October 2 in the New York Times as follows: ``The more \ndeliberation and the more debate we have, the healthier that is going \nto be'' for the strategy. So for as much attention as has been paid to \nwhat his report says, or at least part of what his report says, I think \nit is also important to listen to his words about taking the time to \ndebate it and taking the time to deliberate it because if all we do in \nthe Senate is point a finger to the White House and say the White House \nmust do this or the President must do this or the administration must \ndo this, we are not fulfilling our responsibilities in the Senate.\n  A number of us have been talking about this challenge, but we have to \nhear from more voices here and we have to debate this in a very \nsubstantive, serious, thorough, and bipartisan way. I will talk more \nabout that in a moment.\n  In that same New York Times story, General McChrystal was also quoted \nas saying: ``I don't think we have the luxury of going so fast that we \nmake the wrong decision.'' So I think it is important to highlight what \nGeneral McChrystal has said about the approach we take, the approach \nPresident Obama is taking, spending a number of weeks looking at this, \nfocusing on the strategy before the resources. A lot of people in this \ntown want to just talk about troop levels only and resources only \ninstead of getting a sense of where we should be strategically first \nand then getting to resources.\n  We should consider the ideas set forth in a recent Wall Street \nJournal op-ed by the following Senators: McCain, Graham, and \nLieberman--all\n\n[[Page S10275]]\n\nrespected voices on national security and foreign policy.\n  This is not going to be the strategy going forward, the solution to a \ndifficult problem; this is not going to be a Democratic solution and it \nis not going to be a Republican solution; this has to be a strategy and \na solution that comes from both parties.\n  Also, I should say that only by working together can we develop the \nbest strategy, and to literally focus on strategy before the question \nof resources. We cannot simply use sound bites to communicate the \ncomplexities of this conflict or simply reassert talking points from \nthe Iraq war debate. If that is all we are going to do around here, we \nmight as well not have a debate because that will not do it for this \ndebate, especially when we are talking about what is at stake here and \nespecially in this case. Politics must stop at the water's edge. I \nthink we can do that. This body has done it in the past, and we can do \nit again.\n  Let me say at the outset that our problems in Afghanistan are \npolitical in nature and will ultimately require a political solution. \nThis does not mean additional troops may not be needed, but it does \nindicate to me that our strategy needs to reflect a deeper commitment \nto supporting the Afghan people in their efforts to focus on at least \nthree principal areas--one, the obvious priority of security. There is \na lot to talk about just under that umbrella. The second focus we have \nto have, as well as the Afghan people, is governance. We cannot govern \nfor them; they have to govern themselves. President Karzai and whoever \nelse has authority in that country to provide services have to \ndemonstrate to us and to the world that they can govern themselves. So \nfirst security and then governance and finally development, and that \nobviously is a joint effort, not just American-Afghan but all of the \nmore than 40 nations that are helping us in Afghan to help communities \nwith water systems and infrastructure and education and so many \nothers--health care included--so many other aspects that involve \ndevelopment or at least quality of life in Afghanistan.\n  Ultimately, our success will come in empowering Afghan institutions \nto address their own internal security. In some cases, this may mean \nco-opting certain elements of the Taliban, in other cases taking on the \nTaliban directly. We are now at a stage where the United States can \nplay a positive role in making sure the political framework for the \ncountry is sound.\n  The chairman of the Armed Services Committee, Carl Levin, has helped \nto focus attention on the critical importance of training the Afghan \nNational Army or the so-called ANA. I applaud Chairman Levin's \nleadership in this regard and support his call for an acceleration--a \nrapid acceleration of troop training to the levels of 240,000 Afghan \nNational Army troops by 2012. While there is some disagreement over \nthese training timelines, no one disputes the central importance of \ngetting the Afghan security forces trained well and soon. As this force \nis prepared to provide security, it will decrease the need for a robust \nU.S. presence in the country.\n  I applaud the efforts of Major General Formica, head of the U.S. unit \ncharged with training the Afghan troops. While the ANA certainly needs \nsubstantial additional assistance, we need to acknowledge the fact that \nthis fighting force did not exist 7 years ago. Due in large part to the \nextraordinary efforts of coalition forces and people like the general, \nthe ANA can be considered a measured success. Without these remarkable \nefforts, the Afghan National Army would not be in a position to grow at \nthe pace necessary in the coming months.\n  I should also add that the recent Presidential election in \nAfghanistan presented a very difficult security challenge, and both the \nAfghan National Army as well as the police performed pretty well. We \ncould witness some security problems but on a much more limited basis \nthan many would have predicted. So that is a bit of good news in all \nthe bad news we hear about Afghanistan.\n  Challenges do remain, however, and this training process will not be \neasy. A little more than 40 percent of the population in Afghanistan is \nof the Pashtun ethnicity, although they are not fully represented in \nthe army at these levels. The officer corps of the Afghan National \nArmy, based on traditions that go back decades, is primarily made up of \nTajiks, who represent just over 25 percent of the population. The most \nsubstantial fighting in Afghan currently takes place in the Pashtun \nbelt, an area of the country in the south and east along the border \nwith Pakistan. I hope the Afghan National Army can continue to take \nthese important ethnicity concerns into consideration as they grow the \nforce.\n  These are critically important concerns about ethnicity. We have to \nrecognize that and not turn away from it.\n  Second, Afghanistan has a very high illiteracy rate; some estimate as \nhigh as 70 percent. This presents considerable complication in troop \ntraining as some recruits are not able to read or write orders, \nunderstand maps or interpret instructions on how to operate equipment. \nOur trainers have come up with creative training techniques using \npictures, for example, but this is no substitute for basic skills \nrequired in a modern army.\n  The third challenge with regard to building up the Afghan National \nArmy and perhaps the most significant is posed by the substantial \nresources needed to stand up such a force. Army recruits are paid only \n$100 a month, while there are reports that the Taliban pays as much as \n$300 a month. Both are small amounts, but when the Taliban is paying \nthree times as much, that presents a challenge that we must confront, \nif we are serious about this. The Afghan National Army should begin to \naddress the discrepancy. Overall the cost of maintaining this expanded \nforce will be considerable, and it is unlikely that the Afghan \nGovernment will be able to shoulder this burden anytime soon. It is a \nchallenge that involves both cost and the reality that the government \ndoesn't have the resources to do all it needs to do in building up the \nAfghan Army. We need to be honest about that. This will be expensive \nbut nowhere near as expensive as the continued deployment and costs \nassociated with maintaining an international coalition force.\n  I have tried to outline some of the realistic challenges we face in \nstanding up the Afghan Army. Afghan Defense Minister Wardak, whom I met \nduring my trip in August, oversees this effort in Kabul. Minister \nWardak has been commended for his leadership of the Afghan armed \nforces. He believes these ambitious troop increases are challenging but \npossible. I hope we can aggressively pursue Chairman Levin's plan, no \nmatter what comes of the President's strategy. An expanded and enhanced \nAfghan Army should be a central part of the equation. In the final \nanalysis, this fight against the Taliban is an Afghan fight. We need to \nbe there to support them, but a stable and peaceful Afghanistan will \nultimately depend upon how well the Afghan Government can provide \nsecurity for its own people.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Casey are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. CASEY. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, this week the latest version of the health \ncare reform plan was scored by the CBO. The expectation is that \nsometime in the next few days, the Finance Committee will report out a \nbill which at some point will be merged with the bill that was produced \nby the HELP Committee. I rise to make some observations about the \nprocess generally, because we are talking about literally one-sixth of \nthe American economy. This is not something that is inconsequential, \nand certainly it is something that is personal to most Americans. \nHealth care is something they value deeply. Any type of reform ought to \nfocus on patient-centered health care--not insurance centered, not \npolitician centered, not Washington, DC centered, but patient-centered \nhealth care. As we get into this debate, we ought to have an \nopportunity not only for Members of the Senate to carefully examine \nwhat is in\n\n[[Page S10276]]\n\nthis legislation but also for the American people. The American people \ndeserve and have a right to know what is going to be in any final bill.\n  My first point is that we have tried. An amendment was offered in the \nFinance Committee by the Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Bunning, that would \nrequire for any bill that ultimately, once it is reduced to legislative \nlanguage and has an estimate from the CBO about what it might cost, \nthere be 72 hours for people to evaluate it, Senators as well as the \ngeneral public. That amendment was defeated in the committee \ndeliberations. Seventy-two hours is the bare minimum that ought to be \nrequired and necessary for people here in the Senate to look at what \nwill be inevitably north of 1,000 pages of legislative language.\n  The reason I say ``will be'' is because we don't know yet. We haven't \nseen legislative language to date. All we have is a concept paper. The \nFinance Committee will be voting out a concept paper. That concept \npaper has been scored by the Congressional Budget Office but it is just \nthat. It is a concept paper. We have yet to see anything that resembles \nlegislative language that ultimately is what we in the Senate will be \nasked to vote on.\n  The simple expectation is that there ought to be an adequate amount \nof time, whatever that amount is, but at a minimum 72 hours was all \nthat was requested by the Senator from Kentucky in his amendment before \nthe Finance Committee. That was defeated by the Democratic majority.\n  He subsequently offered that today, a resolution as an amendment to \nthe currently pending legislation, the CJS appropriations bill. It was \nobjected to. There was a point of order raised against it. It is pretty \nclear that our colleagues on the majority side do not want to consider \nhaving any sort of a requirement imposed that would allow people an \nadequate amount of time to review this incredibly consequential and \nimpactful piece of legislation coming before the Senate.\n  I make that observation to start with because it is relevant. This \nprocess needs to be open and transparent. The American people have a \nright to know exactly what is in this legislation. Even Senators and \nSenators on the Finance Committee right now don't know because they \nhaven't seen bill language. What they are going to be voting on is a \nconcept paper. And what the estimate that has been provided by the CBO \nis in response to is a concept paper, not legislative language. I argue \nto my colleagues that we need to have at least a certain amount of \ntime. I would argue more than that--it ought to be 2 weeks, when we are \ntalking about something this voluminous and this consequential for \nAmericans or the American economy. I regret that our colleagues on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle are objecting to what is even a minimum \namount of time to review this legislation, and that would be a 72-hour \ntime limit.\n  I don't believe for a minute that the Finance Committee bill, even if \nand when it is reduced to legislative language, is the thing we will be \nvoting on. There has been a lot of reaction to it and a lot written in \nthe last couple of days about how this would be scored by the CBO. And \nthere is a story out today that it actually would reduce the deficit, \nwhich I will get into in a moment.\n  But before addressing that, this bill, when it does become a bill, \nwill have to be married with another bill passed earlier by the HELP \nCommittee. Those two will be merged. Where will they be merged? They \nwill not be merged on the floor of the Senate. They will be merged \nbehind closed doors in the majority leader's office by a handful of \npeople who will be determining what is in the legislation. Then at some \npoint they will have to come out and we will get an opportunity to look \nat it.\n  I don't think the work the Finance Committee is putting in right now \nis anywhere close to what the end result will be. I argue that we will \nsee a very different product produced by the majority leader when they \ngo behind closed doors and a handful of people write the health care \nbill that will come before the Senate.\n  Those are a couple of observations I wished to make with respect to \nthe process and how flawed I believe it is with regard to the issue of \nbeing open and transparent and making sure there is accountability to \nthe people.\n  The second observation I wish to make has to do as well with the fact \nthat most Americans believe there is a right way and a wrong way to do \nthis. The right way ought to be making sure we are prioritizing our \nspending and being careful with taxpayer dollars.\n  The wrong way is for Washington to go about this in the traditional \nway; which is, to raise taxes still higher, put the country further \ninto debt, and more money into programs we do not believe--at least a \nlot of us do not believe--will work in the long run. Again, I will \npoint out in a minute why we think this is the case, why these programs \nwill not work in the long run.\n  The right way to do this is for us to protect and expand that doctor-\npatient relationship and to do it in a way that is fiscally responsible \nand to do it in a way that gets at the real crux of the issue; that is, \nhow do we reduce the cost of health care in this country.\n  As to the current bill, which I mentioned earlier, there have been \nsome news stories in the last day or so about how this bill reduces the \ndeficit, with $829 billion in spending and about $81 billion in surplus \nto reduce the deficit. What I think is important for people to focus on \nis, because there is a delayed implementation of these provisions in \nthis bill that do not start kicking in until 2014 or thereabouts, the \nnumbers that are being used by the other side and being reported upon \nby the media reflect a 10-year period starting now and going forward.\n  But when the bill is fully implemented, when all the provisions are \nfinally in place and we get the 10-year window from that point \nforward--or from that point through the 10-year window--that is when we \nget a real assessment of what the costs are. If we do that, the cost of \nthis legislation is not the $829 billion that has been put out publicly \nand has been sort of picked up by the media in the last day or two, but \nit is nearly double that amount. It is $1.8 trillion.\n  So it is a massive amount of new spending, a massive expansion of the \nFederal Government at the Federal level, and a massive amount of \nspending that somehow is going to have to be paid for either in the \nform of additional revenues, cuts in Medicare--which is what is being \nproposed--which I do not think, frankly, is ever going to happen. We \ntried back in 2005 when we were reforming Medicare to shave $10 billion \nout of that. We could not get the votes for it in the Senate. We had to \nbring the Vice President back from Pakistan to cast the deciding vote.\n  So the notion that somehow we are going to be voting to cut $500 \nbillion from Medicare is a pipe dream. You would have to be smoking \nsomething to believe that is actually going to happen. That is one of \nthe ways that $1.8 trillion of new spending is paid for.\n  The other way it is paid for is with higher taxes. The problem with \nthat is the taxes do not just fall on the ``rich'' or ``wealthy.'' They \ndo not just fall on the insurance companies, which is where some of the \ntaxes and fees in the Finance Committee bill are directed. They fall on \nthe American people. In fact, I think it is important to point out the \nCongressional Budget Office, when asked about this, said 90 percent of \nthe tax burden in 2019--90 percent of the tax burden in the health care \nbill--would fall on wage earners making less than $200,000 a year. That \ndirectly violates and contradicts the commitment and the promise the \nPresident made that he would not impose taxes on people making less \nthan $250,000 a year.\n  So we have these massive tax increases which, according to CBO, are \ngoing to fall disproportionately on people making less than $200,000 a \nyear, and we have these cuts in Medicare which, in my view, are not \ngoing to happen or, if they do, could be very devastating to seniors, \nas well as to a lot of the health care providers across this country.\n  But here is what is most amazing about all that: almost $2 trillion \nin new spending over a 10-year period--$500 billion, $600 billion of \ntax increases; $500 billion in Medicare cuts to pay for this--and who \nis to say if the Medicare cuts do not happen a lot of this will not end \nup being borrowed, which piles up huge debt on future generations of \nAmericans. But after all that, and after all the bills, including the \nFinance Committee bill, it assumes a tremendous level of government \nintervention and involvement in the health care\n\n[[Page S10277]]\n\neconomy of this country. The government is going to be in the middle of \nmaking decisions that traditionally have been made by doctors and \npatients.\n  But after all that, we would assume, at the end of the day, the \nunderlying purpose and goal of this--which is to reduce health care \ncosts--would have been achieved. The truth is, it does not reduce \ncosts. The bottom line is, after everything else is said and done, and \nwe look at all the spending and all the taxing and all the new \ngovernment expansion and all the new government interference and \ninvolvement and intervention in the health care economy and the \nfundamental doctor-patient relationship, we have not done anything to \nlower costs for the Americans who are struggling with the high cost of \nhealth care.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office, during the Finance \nCommittee markup last week, when asked whether the insurance company \ntaxes would be passed on--and how would that impact the people who are \nactually having to pay the insurance premiums out there--they said \nthose new taxes will be passed on dollar for dollar. We have seen all \nkinds of varying estimates about the amount of the increase, but there \nhas not been a bill yet, of the five that have been produced by any of \nthe committees in the Congress, that bends the cost curve down. They \nall raise and increase costs.\n  I think that is the Achilles heel, ultimately--that the American \npeople, who are struggling with the high cost of health care, are \nlooking for solutions and for reforms that will actually put downward \npressure on prices, and all that is being talked about is spending a \ncouple trillion dollars of their tax dollars, raising taxes and cutting \nMedicare in order to raise their overall cost of insurance. Only in \nWashington, DC, could something that stunning actually make it in the \nlight of day.\n  So at the end of the day, it ought to be about reducing costs for \nAmericans. It ought to be about trying to provide access for those who \ndo not have access to health insurance. By the way, the most recent \nversion of the Baucus bill--the Finance Committee bill--still leaves 25 \nmillion Americans uncovered. So we are not covering a lot of people we \nare proposing to cover. We are increasing costs of health care for \npeople who currently have insurance, and we are creating a couple \ntrillion dollars of new spending when this bill is fully implemented \nover 10 years that, again, is going to, in some way, have to be \nfinanced with taxes, Medicare cuts, or, worse yet, perhaps borrowing, \nwhich will come on the backs of future generations.\n  The amount of debt we are going to have at the end of 2019, according \nto CBO, is enough so that every household in this country will owe \n$188,000. Imagine if you are a young couple today just exchanging your \nvows, you are starting your family, you are getting ready to move on \nwith your life, and you get handed a big fat wedding gift from the \nFederal Government to the tune of a $188,000 IOU. That is not fair to \nfuture generations.\n  We ought to learn to live within our means. We talk about reforming \nhealth care. We ought to put reforms in place that actually reduce the \ncost of health care for working-class families in this country, that do \nnot raise their taxes, that do not borrow from their children and \ngrandchildren. Those are the types of things we would like to see as \npart of this debate.\n  We have already put forward a number of proposals that would do just \nthat: allowing people to buy insurance across State lines--interstate \ncompetition would put downward pressure on prices and insurance rates \nacross this country--allowing people to join larger groups, small \nbusiness health plans--something we voted on repeatedly in the Congress \nwhich has been consistently defeated in votes--dealing with the issue \nof defensive medicine, which it is estimated costs the health care \neconomy about $100 billion annually; doing something about medical \nmalpractice and all those physicians who order those additional tests \nsimply because they are worried about being sued.\n  We have had proposals put forward that would change the tax treatment \nof employer-provided health care plans so that those who do not have \ninsurance would have a tax credit that would be available to them so \nthey could go out and buy health insurance in the private marketplace.\n  We are laying out a lot of solutions we believe actually get at the \nfundamental issue before the American people, and that is the high cost \nof health care and also trying to provide coverage for those who do not \nhave it. None of these proposals, in my view--and I think the \nCongressional Budget Office, in their analysis, bears it out. These are \nall proposals that bend the cost curve up, that increase and raise \ninsurance costs for this country.\n\n  The only reason they could go out like they did yesterday and say, \nwell, this actually reduces the deficit, is because of the massive tax \nincreases and the massive cuts in Medicare that it assumes will take \nplace.\n  Again, I want to mention one more time, in closing, notwithstanding \nthe numbers that were released yesterday by the Congressional Budget \nOffice--and the way they were reported by the media--the number people \nneed to focus on is the cost of this program when it is fully \nimplemented.\n  Because it is delayed, because many of the provisions in the bill, in \nits entirety, for the most part, are going to be delayed--the \nimplementation--until 2014, we have to get the full picture of the \ncost, what it is going to cost in the 10 years once it is fully \nimplemented because a lot of the revenues are front loaded, the costs \nare back-end loaded. That is why this sort of wires and mirrors--the \napproach that is being used--understates the overall cost. They can go \nforward and say, well, we are reducing the deficit over 10 years \nbecause of all the tax increases, which kick in right away, but some of \nthe costs in the program do not come into play until later on.\n  So the American people need to be engaged in this debate. They need \nto have their voices heard. Frankly, they have a right to know exactly \nwhat is in this legislation. That is why it should not be rushed. It \nshould be done in a way that allows people to actually review this \nbill. It ought to be done in the light of day.\n  Secondly, it ought to be done in a way that actually is fiscally \nresponsible to future generations so we do not pile this huge burden of \ndebt on them. But even more importantly than that, it ought to \naccomplish the stated objective, which is to reduce the overall health \ncare costs for Americans.\n  These proposals do not do that. There are ideas out there and \nsolutions out there that do, some of which I just talked about. If we \nwould be willing to sit down and come to a consensus about those things \nthat actually do drive health care costs down, we could pass health \ncare reform through the Senate this year, through the House of \nRepresentatives, put it on the President's desk, and do something that \nactually meaningfully reduces costs for Americans and what they pay for \nhealth care.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Tribute to Erica Williams and HER SEC Team\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise again today to honor a great \nFederal employee, something I have been doing each week on the Senate \nfloor. I do so because I believe it is very important to recognize the \nunsung heroes who work every day on behalf of the Nation with great \neffort and often with great sacrifice.\n  Today, I want to honor an employee of the Securities and Exchange \nCommission, one of our most important independent Federal agencies, \nwhose work affects all Americans. This great Nation was founded on a \nbelief in freedom and fairness--two fundamental pillars of American \nsociety.\n  This is what the Revolutionaries fought for in the time of Samuel \nAdams and George Washington. It is what the Framers enshrined during \nthe era of Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson. Maintaining \ndemocratic government and fair, open markets were the charge of every \nadministration and Congress from their day to ours.\n  In the decades since World War II, American global leadership has \nfocused on promoting these two concepts throughout the world. Democracy \nand\n\n[[Page S10278]]\n\na fair marketplace complement each other perfectly. A society based on \nfair markets cultivates an egalitarian political culture. Likewise, \ndemocracy instills in all citizens the sense that they ought to enjoy \nin commerce what they so cherish in government: a marriage of liberty \nand equality.\n  I have already spoken from this desk several times about the \nchallenges we and the SEC jointly face today in protecting our \nfinancial markets. I have talked repeatedly about how, as a nation, our \ncredit and equity capital markets are a crown jewel. Only a year ago we \nsuffered a credit market debacle that led to devastating consequences \nfor millions of Americans.\n  I have squarely blamed the self-regulation philosophy of the SEC as \nbeing a major part of that problem. By this I mean that the SEC had too \noften deferred to those it regulates for knowledge, experience, and \ncertitude. I feel so strongly about this because we have lived through \nan era where regulators and the leadership of regulatory agencies \nfailed to regulate. Perhaps Congress, too, failed to give the \nregulators the tools and resources they needed to do their jobs \neffectively.\n  These failures have contributed not only to a financial disaster but \nalso to a loss of public confidence in our markets and our national \neconomy. In addition, these failures run counter to our ideals of \ndemocracy and market fairness.\n  During the time of the Revolution, we were a nation of farmers and \nmerchants bound together by our common dependence on the trade of \nmanufactured goods, foodstuffs, and local services. Today, we have \nbecome a nation of investors. Tens of millions of Americans own \nretirement accounts, and they depend on fair markets to protect those \nlong-term holdings.\n  Many Americans have suffered directly as a result of the markets \nlosing value. Those who have not been hurt personally surely know \nsomeone--a parent, a friend, or a coworker--who has. The financial \ncrisis has forced many to delay retirement or even go back to work. \nMost working Americans have lost something; some have lost almost \neverything.\n  Under its previous leadership, the SEC lost its way. While the \nfailure of the SEC to follow up on tips about the Bernie Madoff Ponzi \nscheme is certainly emblematic of this failure--and probably a huge \nblow to the morale of the agency--I believe morale at the agency may \nalso have suffered for a much more fundamental reason. Too often in the \npast, the SEC leadership kept its employees from pursuing its core \nmission. This happened not only at the SEC but at other Federal \nagencies as well. There was simply a philosophical difference between \ntheir policies and the need for effective enforcement of regulations.\n  Employees at the SEC, while still working hard every day, sadly, I \nsuspect, have become somewhat demoralized by this and by resulting \nsetbacks. And, I might add, SEC employees have also had to endure \ncriticism of the Commission in recent months by concerned Members of \nCongress--myself chief among them.\n\n  Today, the SEC stands at a crossroads.\n  In the wake of last year's historic election, Washington has been \nfocused on change. The greatest thing about change is that it offers \nthe promise of a new start. I wholeheartedly believe one of the most \nfundamental qualities of the American people is the ability to pick \nourselves up, dust ourselves off, and return to the important task \nbefore us.\n  For the SEC, this means a renewed focus on its original mission: to \nmaintain public faith in our markets, to protect all investors. The SEC \nneeds to reassure our long-term investors--many of whom are average \nAmericans saving for retirement--that the system is not rigged against \nthem. I know the SEC can, and will, be a can-do agency once more.\n  In 2005, the SEC moved into a new headquarters just a few blocks from \nthe Capitol. It is a beautiful glass and stone building with a high, \ncurving facade. The lobby is full of light, and its windows frame a \nview of the Capitol dome. Much of the building wraps around a \ncourtyard, and in the center of that courtyard is a playground for the \nchildren who attend the SEC's employee daycare. Across the street are a \nschool and a row of small businesses, including a busy coffee house. \nBehind the new building are the tracks leading out from Union Station \ncarrying business travelers and commuters each day.\n  The men and women who work in that building don't need to be reminded \nwho they work for. They see them every day out of their windows. The \nstability and fairness of our financial markets affects every American, \nfrom the small business owner to the coffee house patron; from the \ndaily commuter to the future of that toddler in daycare. I believe a \nnew building provides a chance for a new beginning.\n  I agree with the President that at least with regard to the financial \ncrisis, the worst is behind us. Now is the time for the SEC to step to \nthe plate. I know they can do it. I have faith in the SEC because it \nstabilized our markets in the aftermath of the Great Depression. I have \nfaith in the SEC because it always proved to be resilient during times \nof institutional change, and I have faith in the SEC because it has \nsome of the most talented public servants who are now working \ntirelessly to catch up after several years of failed leadership.\n  One of those public servants is Erica Williams, a lawyer for the \nSEC's Enforcement Division. A graduate of the University of Virginia \nLaw School, Erica has been with the SEC for 5 years. During that time, \nshe has distinguished herself as a trial lawyer on several complex \ncases involving accounting and fraud. Before coming to the SEC, she \nworked at a major private sector law firm in Washington.\n  In July, she and her team of SEC enforcement attorneys won a hard-\nfought verdict in Federal court on a case involving insider trading. \nThis case, commonly referred to as SEC v. Nothern, was a rare case \ninvolving U.S. Treasury bonds.\n  She could not have had better colleagues on this case than John \nRossetti, Sarah Levine, and Martin Healy, all of whom equally deserve \nrecognition. John is a graduate of Catholic University Law School, and \nhe served for 9 years as an SEC enforcement attorney. Sarah, who holds \na law degree from Yale, clerked for Justice David Souter before coming \nto the SEC in 2007 as a trial attorney. Martin supported their efforts \nas a regional trial counsel at the SEC's office in Boston.\n  Erica and her team had to prove that the defendant had insider \nknowledge from someone inside the Treasury Department. Approximately $3 \nmillion in illegal profits had been generated from this scheme. They \nargued their case strongly and thoroughly. They also had to prosecute \nthe case with fewer resources than are usually available to private \nsector litigators. They worked weekends and sacrificed time with their \nfamilies for long hours spent in the office or on the road. It all paid \noff, a victory that reflects what the SEC is all about: punishing and \ndeterring wrongdoing.\n  What Erica achieved with her team is more than a court victory, \nhowever. She is helping to send a message the SEC is back; that those \nwho are contemplating fraud better think twice. That is why I am \nhonoring her as my ``Great Federal Employee'' of the week.\n  I know this is only the beginning. The SEC knows it needs to focus on \ndeterring those activities that make our markets unfair. That is what \nErica's victory and what other recent gains of the Commission have \ndone. As new SEC Enforcement Division Director Robert Khuzami has said, \nthe SEC is engaged in ``a rigorous self-assessment of how we do our \njob.'' Their victory is what Khuzami meant when he promised ``a focus \non cases involving the great and most immediate harm and on cases that \nsend an outside message of deterrence.''\n  I also have faith in SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro, who shares my \nconcern about the stability and the quality of our markets. She \nunderstands the trade-offs between market liquidity and market \nfairness, and she recognized how important it is to protect the \ninterests of long-term investors.\n  As my colleagues are aware, since March, Chairman Schapiro and I have \nexchanged communications, and I believe under her leadership the SEC is \ncoming back stronger and better able to pursue its mission.\n  The famous Alabama football coach, Paul ``Bear'' Bryant, once said:\n\n\n[[Page S10279]]\n\n\n       I have learned over the years how to hold a team together. \n     How to lift some up, how to calm others down, until finally \n     they've got one heartbeat, together, a team.\n\n  Chairman Schapiro believes in the SEC's mission, and she is working \ndiligently to ensure that all who work there are doing so with one \nheartbeat--as a team. They, too, believe in the SEC's mission, and we \nhave to make certain they get all the resources they need, not only to \ncatch up but also to operate ahead of tomorrow's market threats.\n  Taped to the door of Chairman Schapiro's office is a sign for all \nthose entering with new proposals or ideas. It reads: ``How does it \nhelp investors?'' This ethos must once again be the source of \ninspiration for everyone who works in that beautiful new building.\n  As the SEC embarks on its next chapter, I want all of its employees \nto know when they walk out of that lobby each day and see the Capitol \ndome, they should feel confident that those of us who work under it are \ntheir partners. We will be their partners by making certain the SEC is \nstrong enough to do its job, and we will work together with the \nCommission to help identify and prevent new problems before they arise. \nThe American people also should have patience and hope that the SEC is \nback and on the right track. We all hold a common stake in its success.\n  The era of looking the other way is now behind us. The time has come \nto look forward. I hope my colleagues will join me not only in honoring \nthe service of outstanding Federal employees of the SEC such as Erica \nWilliams and her team but in recommitting ourselves to help them pursue \nour common goal. When it comes to protecting America's investors, we \nmust have one heartbeat.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Air Force Tanker Competition\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the recently \nrestarted Air Force KC-X tanker competition.\n  On February 29, 2008, after a lengthy competition, the U.S. Air Force \nannounced that the team of Northrop Grumman and EADS was selected to \ndeliver the best, most capable tanker to our warfighters, at a price of \n$3 billion less than their rival Boeing's offer.\n  It was only after the GAO sustained a mere 8 out of 111 complaints \nsubmitted by the losing team--Boeing--that the award was overturned and \nthe competition was placed in limbo.\n  Even after GAO's recommendation, there is still nothing to suggest \nthat the KC-45 was not the best tanker solution. This is a very \nimportant point to remember. The Air Force's contracting system may \nhave been flawed, but nowhere did GAO state that the KC-45 is not the \nbest tanker for our airmen.\n  A year later, Defense Secretary Robert Gates terminated the award and \ncanceled the entire tanker acquisition program.\n  Secretary of Defense Gates' decision to cancel the Air Force's No. 1 \nacquisition priority outright clearly placed politics and business \ninterests over the interests of the warfighter.\n  While Secretary Gates may have characterized this decision as a \n``cooling off'' period, it sent a clear message that only a Boeing \ntanker will be acceptable. The defense acquisition policy was \nunmistakable: No Boeing, no tanker. That is a fundamentally flawed \npolicy that may please some Members of Congress from the States in \nwhich Boeing would build the tankers, but it fails to satisfy the \ncritical need for the best new tankers for our warfighters. In that \ncase, politics obviously trumped military necessity and troop welfare.\n  After review of the September 24 draft RFP that begins the new tanker \ncompetition, I again have serious concerns that fairness and capability \nare being completely ignored.\n  For a moment, let me elaborate. As a result of the last protest, \nNorthrop Grumman was compelled to submit its proprietary, competitive-\nsensitive pricing data to the GAO, which, in turn, provided that \ncritical information to Boeing. Let me say it again. Boeing now has all \nof Northrop Grumman's competitive pricing information. Yet they are \ngoing to be competing again.\n  Boeing knows exactly how the Northrop Grumman team was able to offer \nthe best deal to the Department of Defense during the last competition. \nBoeing knows all of Northrup Grumman's bidding strategies.\n  In a competition for a defense contract, nothing is more carefully \nprotected than a company's pricing and bidding strategy.\n  Let me remind my colleagues here that Northrup Grumman/EADS offered a \nclearly better plane, at a price that was $3 billion less than Boeing. \nAnd now, today, Boeing knows how they did it.\n  Northrop Grumman has repeatedly asked the Department of Defense to \nlevel the playing field by providing them--Northrop Grumman--with \nBoeing's pricing information from the previous competition. To date, \nthe Pentagon has continually denied Northrop Grumman's requests. The \nDepartment of Defense has stated that Northrop Grumman's pricing and \nbidding strategies are not relevant issues in the current competition, \nand that the data is outdated.\n  Not relevant? I could not disagree more. It is intuitively obvious to \nanyone who is even vaguely familiar with the concept of competitive \ngovernment bidding that the Department of Defense, from the outset, is \ntilting the competition toward Boeing. Northrop Grumman is being \nseverely penalized before the game even begins. This situation is \ninconceivable and must be changed.\n  Further, after review of the draft RFP, it is becoming increasingly \nclear that this competition is not structured around what we call a \n``best value'' competition that would ensure that our warfighter \nreceives the best plane. Rather, it is structured around the lowest \nprice technically acceptable competition that does one thing and one \nthing only--it reduces the chances that our warfighters will receive \nthe most superior plane on the market.\n  One would think that our Air Force's top priority would be to ensure \nthat our men and women in uniform have the best, most capable \nequipment. It seems to me that is not the case.\n  A lowest price technically acceptable procurement process focuses \nheavily on cost and does not take into account additional or advanced \ncapabilities that may be available on the aircraft that will help us in \nthe years to come. This means that price is more important than \nquality; that performance is not a critical factor; that added \ncapabilities, technology that could help save the lives of our men and \nwomen in uniform and have an edge on the opposition, is not a key \nfactor in the draft RFP.\n\n  The fact that the draft RFP is structured so that cost is almost the \nonly component considered in the competition makes the aforementioned \npricing data issue even more relevant.\n  When combined with Boeing's knowledge of Northrop Grumman's pricing \ndata and not vice versa, it has become abundantly clear that the \nDepartment of Defense and the Air Force have their thumbs on the scale \nin favor of Boeing.\n  As was clearly shown in the previous competition, Boeing has a less \ncapable airframe, but Boeing now has all of Northrop Grumman's pricing \ndata and a full understanding of Northrop Grumman's bidding strategies. \nThis information is the holy grail for Boeing that provides them with \neverything necessary to surely submit a lower cost bid for their less \ncapable aircraft.\n  If this matter should not be a concern, then there should be no issue \nwhatsoever with the Department of Defense providing Boeing's prior data \nto Northrop Grumman because Boeing, again, has Northrop Grumman's data, \nas they recompete.\n  In order for this competition to be untainted, to be fair, to be at \nthe level of openness and transparency that my colleagues and I were \nrepeatedly assured would be the case, I believe it is imperative that \nNorthrop Grumman be allowed to obtain Boeing's pricing data from the \nlast tanker competition and that the competition shift away from\n\n[[Page S10280]]\n\npurely a cost basis to what is best for the warfighter.\n  It makes no sense for a procurement process that has been continually \nhampered by scandal, delays, and jail time for certain officials to \nbegin the latest version of this competition with such an absurdly \nuneven playing field.\n  As we go forward, it is my sincere hope that the safety of our \nwarfighters and the security of our Nation will become the priority, as \nit has been in the past, this time and decisions will not be based on \npolitical pressures that unfairly tilt competition.\n  Unless the Department of Defense and the Air Force live up to their \ncommitment of impartiality and transparency, I am fearful that our \nwarfighters will have to settle for second best. Apparently, that is \njust fine with some, as long as Boeing wins.\n  I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN.

Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator the from Alabama [Mr. Shelby], for himself and \n     Mrs. Feinstein, proposes an amendment numbered 2625.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To provide danger pay to Federal agents stationed in \n                    dangerous foreign field offices)\n\n       On page 170 at the end of line 19 insert the following:\n       Sec. XXX. Section 151 of the Foreign Relations \n     Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public Law \n     101-246, as amended by section 11005 of Public Law 107-273; 5 \n     U.S.C. 5928 note) is amended:\n       (a) by striking ``or'' after ``Drug Enforcement \n     Administration'' and inserting ``, the''; and (b) inserting \n     after ``Federal Bureau of Investigation'': ``, the Bureau of \n     Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives or the United \n     States Marshals Service''.\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I, along with Senator Feinstein, have \noffered this amendment that would make the U.S. Marshals and the ATF \nagents, who put their lives on the line in dangerous foreign countries \nto protect our Nation and our citizens, eligible for danger pay.\n  The U.S. Marshals and ATF agents are actively assisting Mexican law \nenforcement and the Mexican military in one of the bloodiest wars in \nthe world today--the Mexican drug war. There have been nearly 10,000 \ndrug war murders and deaths in Mexico since January of 2007. President \nCalderon has deployed 45,000 troops and 5,000 Federal police to 18 \nMexican States to help combat these cartels.\n  Every week, we read about the gruesome murders of Mexican law \nenforcement officers, many of whom have our own Federal agents serving \nat their side. Currently, FBI and DEA agents receive danger pay in \nMexico, while U.S. Marshals and ATF agents do not. I believe it is \noutrageous that these agents--our agents--serving their country and \nrisking their lives on a daily basis, do not receive this compensation \nlike their Department of Justice counterparts.\n  This amendment I offer on behalf of myself and Senator Feinstein \nsimply brings danger pay parity to the Department of Justice Federal \nlaw enforcement officers working in dangerous foreign countries. This \namendment, I believe, has a lot of merit, and although Senator Mikulski \nis not here right now, I believe she would join with me in support of \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken).

The report will be stated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill (H.R. \n     2997), making appropriations for Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies programs for the fiscal year ending September 30, \n     2010, and for other purposes, having met, have agreed that \n     the House recede from its disagreement to the amendment of \n     the Senate and agree to the same with an amendment and the \n     Senate agree to the same, signed by a majority of the \n     conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of September 30, 2009)\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise in support of the conference report \non H.R. 2997, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug \nAdministration, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for 2010.\n  This bill includes total spending of $121.1 billion. Of the total, \n$97.8 billion is for mandatory programs, and $23.3 billion is for \ndiscretionary programs. The discretionary spending in this bill is an \nincrease of $2.7 billion and is within our 302(b) allocation.\n  This bill funds a range of programs that help improve the lives of \nAmericans every day.\n  It provides more resources for food and drug safety.\n  It delivers low-income housing and supports rural communities who \nneed sanitary water systems.\n  It fully funds the WIC, SNAP, School Lunch and School Breakfast \nPrograms. It expands the Commodity Supplemental Food Program and the \nChild and Adult Care Feeding Program.\n  It significantly expands the McGovern-Dole Program so children in \ndeveloping countries can get school meals. Often, that is the only \nreason they come to school.\n  It bolsters agricultural research so we can produce better crops and \nfeed more people more efficiently.\n  It funds conservation, community development, animal and plant \nhealth, trade, and much more.\n  We worked closely with our counterparts in the House to come to \nsatisfactory agreements on issues about which we had differing views.\n  We included compromise language on the reimportation of Chinese \npoultry, setting up a stringent system to protect public health. This \nlanguage meets all of our WTO requirements and has been endorsed by all \nsides.\n  We included critical funds to aid the dairy sector which is suffering \nfrom historically low prices. Some will be used to purchase dairy \nproducts for food pantries, and the rest will provide direct relief to \nproducers.\n\n[[Page S10281]]\n\n  We fund development of new food aid products to provide higher \nnutritional content for food aid recipients; most of these products \nhave not been updated for nearly two decades.\n  Overall, this bill is properly balanced. It provides appropriate \nfunding and direction for the Department of Agriculture, FDA and other \nagencies. We worked to ensure that the concerns of all Senators were \naddressed, and I believe we have been successful.\n  I am very encouraged by the process that brought us to this point, \nand I am grateful to my ranking member, Senator Brownback, and others \nwho have been instrumental in its success.\n  I strongly encourage all Senators to support this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, Senator Kohl, who \nchairs this committee. This is the first year for me to be ranking \nmember. He has been a delight to work with.\n  A number of issues are addressed in this bill. The centerpiece is the \nagriculture industry. It is of key importance. It is interesting to \nnote, in this economic downturn we are in, that the agriculture \nindustry has had a great deal of difficulty, although it has been one \nof the stronger industry sections we have had during this period. That \nis in no small part because of the strength of the industry, the \nwillingness of people to work, to invest aggressively, to work hard, \nand to pay attention to details.\n  For us to support the research entities underneath it--a lot of that \nis in this bill. So we are researching aggressively what we can do to \nproduce things efficiently, effectively, that the marketplace wants. It \nis a great export industry. It is one that provides a lot of exports \nout of my State, out of the State of the chairman, and the States of \nother Senators. That research is important. That is what is in the \nbill, the research and development industry. That is the primary piece \nof it. It is not the total, but it is a key part.\n  Looking into the future, I can see that places we need to go are in \nthings that will require the research for us to be able to move \nforward, things such as cellulosic ethanol where people are excited \nabout doing the grain-based ethanol. We need to have a stream from \ncellulosic ethanol so we can produce more of our energy needs \ndomestically and renewably. That also goes into the energy field, but \nit is a key part of agriculture. It also grows jobs in rural areas \nwhere it is pretty hard at times to grow jobs. People go to more \nconcentrated regions and places, but we need them in rural areas. If we \ncan invest and if we can show ways people can invest and make money in \nrural areas, going into food and fiber and fuels and pharmaceutical \nproducts, these are things that can really work for us and for our \npeople and around the world. I am pleased to work with Chairman Kohl on \nthat. He has worked on this many years. This has been my first year as \nranking member.\n  In particular, I would like to note two areas we made key investments \nin that are important for the country and to save people's lives. One \nis in the food and drug piece of this bill. The FDA is also \nappropriated in this bill.\n  One of those areas is rare and neglected diseases. There is language \nincluded in this bill that creates two groups within FDA to examine the \nagency's approach to rare and neglected diseases in the developing \nworld and here.\n  Unfortunately, a number of people in the United States get diseases \nthat maybe only 100,000 people get. That sounds like a big number, and \nit is a big number, but to a drug company looking at making an \ninvestment and then being able to develop a cure, it is looking for a \nmuch larger marketplace.\n  What we are asking in this bill is, are there ways within the FDA, \nfor a rare disease or neglected disease, for us to cut down the cost \nprocess to develop a new drug? Otherwise, we are not getting any \nresearch into how we take care of diseases for somebody who is one of \n50,000 who get it, and there is nothing going on research-wise to help \nthem. I had a lady in my office this morning who had a disease in this \ncategory. She was basically told by her physician when she got \ndiagnosed: You should get your affairs in order. That is not an \nacceptable answer, particularly as a policymaker.\n  We have two groups in here looking at rare or neglected diseases and \nhow do we cut the cost of developing that drug so that a pharmaceutical \ncompany or others could say: This doesn't affect a lot of people, but \nmy entry cost is lower, so I will look at this, I will go into this \nfield. Our hope is we can stimulate some research in this country.\n  Then neglected diseases around the world that can affect huge numbers \nof people--the World Health Organization says that more than a billion \npeople, nearly one in every six persons worldwide is affected by at \nleast one of the neglected diseases. This isn't a small category, but \nthey happen to be in countries that don't have high per capita income. \nSo again a company looks at this and says: There are a lot of people \naffected, but there is no income level here, so I can't go into it. \nWell-known examples include malaria, tuberculosis, and cholera. They \ndisproportionately affect low-income populations in developing \ncountries. We are going at this issue too.\n  I can't think of a better place for us to invest more policy-wise \nthan helping to save people's lives. People tend to like you more when \nyou help save their lives. This affects a broad cross-section of people \naround the world. And we have the marketplace, the technology to work \non it, if we can cut the cost down. These two really track together, \nand they are very important for us to save lives. I always consider it \na great day if we can save a person's life by some policy move we are \nmaking that may make things work better. These are a couple of them.\n  Another area the chairman and I have been working on is the issue of \nfood aid. Here, I have had a lot of disappointment in the fact that we \nput a lot of money in food aid and then not a lot of it hits the \ntarget. For every dollar we put in food aid, 60 percent is eaten up by \ntransportation and administration. So 40 percent gets to the person who \nactually needs it.\n  A lot of these are food aid situations where it costs a lot to get \nthe food there. Going into the interior in Sudan, it just costs a lot \nto get there, there is no question. But still I have to think we can do \nthis better. We are starting to look at that but also pilot projects to \nhelp develop new food aid products and to develop micronutrient-\nfortified foods for infant through schoolage children, pregnant or \nnursing mothers. We haven't developed a new food aid product in over 20 \nyears. The last one was a corn-soybean blend which is a good product. \nBut I know the chairman and I don't eat the way we did 20 years ago. \nYou kind of understand the body moves a little differently.\n  This area of micronutrients is the area that most researchers believe \nthat if the world would invest in it, it is the highest yield category \nfor us to save and positively affect the most lives, an investment in \nmicronutrients. It may be a corn-and-soybean blend, but it also has \nvitamin additives put into it for that infant, that nursing mother, \nthat person with AIDS or malaria. We have invested a lot to try to save \nthe person with AIDS or malaria, but now they really can't get better \nbecause they don't have the nutrition in their body they need. We get \nthat into the system.\n  I am excited about these steps and pilot projects, what we might be \nable to find out in these categories and do to save lives. These are \nwell-spent funds.\n  It is tough economic times for us as a country. These are critical \nissues for us. I am always looking at ways we can hold the budget \nnumbers down because I think we really have to get our budget under \ncontrol. These are ones that have been good and wise investments. They \nare important places for us to work in.\n  I am appreciative of being able to work on these particular projects. \nAs we move forward, looking at next year, I hope we can sharpen the \npencil even more in areas that may have been a high priority in the \npast but they should not be now, for us to look at ways we can control \nand get our budget down. And then you move that money either into \npaying down the deficit so the deficit is much lower or you say: If we \nare going to put things in higher investment areas, we move them from \nlow-investment to high-investment regions, and that we would emphasize\n\n[[Page S10282]]\n\nourselves and work in the committee to see what areas are there that we \nshould be taking money out of to put into higher need categories or to \nput back against the deficit that is just running way too high for us \nas a country.\n  We all know that. This deficit is way too high. It is nonsustainable. \nWe need to sharpen our pencil every bit we can in these committees to \ndo our part. I hope we can really spend some time this next year, even \nas we line up for the appropriations process, holding hearings on what \nare low-priority areas, what we can cut out of this budget. We tend to \nmostly focus on new ideas, new programs, and those are good and \nimportant, but in these budgetary times, we have to spend some time \nasking: What is it we could do without? That would be important for us \nto do.\n  It has been a pleasure to work with the chairman. I urge colleagues \nto vote for the conference report and to send it on to the President.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                   Congressionally Directed Spending\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, it has been brought to my attention that the \nCongressionally directed spending items table in the statement of \nmanagers to accompany the Fiscal Year 2010 Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act mistakenly listed Senator Hutchison as requesting \nfunding for the medicinal and Bioactive Crops research project through \nthe Agricultural Research Service. Additionally, Senator Hutchison's \nname was mistakenly omitted from the table for the Grain Sorghum \nresearch project through the National institute for Food and \nAgriculture and the Range Revegetation for Ft. Hood conservation \nproject through the Natural Resources Conservation Service.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I agree with Chairman Kohl and appreciate him bringing \nthese items to the Chamber's attention.\n\n\n                       EMERGENCY DAIRY ASSISTANCE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Wisconsin and the \nSenator from Vermont for joining me to discuss $350 million in \nemergency dairy assistance funding included in the fiscal year 2010 \nAgriculture, Rural Development, and Food and Drug Administration \nAppropriations Act conference report.\n  I had a very encouraging meeting with the Secretary of Agriculture \nwhere he informed me that he intends to distribute emergency dairy \nassistance funds included in the conference report in a way that is \nregionally equitable, and to do so as quickly as possible.\n  As the author of the amendment to the fiscal year 2010 Agriculture \nappropriations bill that added $350 million in emergency dairy \nassistance funds, the Senator from Vermont stated on the floor that \n``whether it is Vermont, Wisconsin, California, Colorado--rural America \nis hurting.''\n  The Senator from Vermont went on to say that ``I know the people \nfamiliar with dairy always say these are great regional fights, the \nNortheast is fighting the Midwest is fighting the Southeast is fighting \nthe West coast, and every region has its own set of priorities. This is \nnot a regional issue, this is a national issue.''\n  I ask the Senator from Vermont, was it your intention that emergency \nassistance be provided to dairy farmers in every region of the country?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Yes, that is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Vermont. If I may ask the \nSenator from Wisconsin, as the lead Senate negotiator, can you tell us \nhow the conference committee intended these funds to be used when \ncrafting the final language?\n  Mr. KOHL. Let me start by saying that I appreciate the guidance and \ninput I have received from my California colleague throughout this \nprocess.\n  The bill before us provides $290 million to the Secretary under broad \nauthorities to assist our Nation's dairy farmers. The conference report \ndoes not direct any form this assistance shall take--an approach that \nwas the result of a hard-fought negotiation with the House. Many \nmembers would have preferred to distribute this assistance through the \nMILC program formula. In fact, I must admit that such an outcome would \nhave been my preference since programs such as MILC would greatly \nbenefit my farmers in Wisconsin. But I knew that dairy farmers all \nacross the country are suffering and an approach couched in inherently \nregional terms would not meet the test for national acceptance.\n  I understand the MILC program would impose limitations difficult for \nsome regions to accept, and for that reason a more general \nauthorization was employed to provide greater regional fairness in the \ndistribution of assistance. My understanding is that the Secretary has \nthree main goals in mind in administering this assistance: No. 1, the \npayments must be directed to actual dairy farmers, No. 2, the payments \nmust go out as quickly as possible, and No. 3, the payments must \nreflect as much regional equity and fairness as possible. I agree with \nthese three principles and trust that the Secretary will carry out this \nassistance in that fashion.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator from Wisconsin for his views and say \nfurther that his understanding of the Secretary's goals is correct. I \nthank my colleagues for joining me to discuss this issue.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the record, the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of H.R. 2997, the Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2010.\n  The conference report provides $23.3 billion in discretionary budget \nauthority for fiscal year 2010, which will result in new outlays of \n$17.7 billion. When outlays from prior-year budget authority are taken \ninto account, nonemergency discretionary outlays for the bill will \ntotal $24.9 billion.\n  The conference report matches its section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and is $120 million below its allocation for outlays.\n  The bill is not subject to any budget points of order.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n H.R. 2997, AGRICULTURE, RURAL DEVELOPMENT, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION\n              AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010\n   [Spending comparisons--Conference Report (in millions of dollars)]\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                               General\n                                                               purpose\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nConference Report:\n  Budget Authority.........................................       23,304\n  Outlays..................................................       24,905\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:\n  Budget Authority.........................................       23,304\n  Outlays..................................................       25,025\nSenate-Passed Bill:\n  Budget Authority.........................................       23,400\n  Outlays..................................................       25,030\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n  Budget Authority.........................................       22,900\n  Outlays..................................................       24,686\nPresident's Request:\n  Budget Authority.........................................       22,980\n  Outlays..................................................       24,904\n \n                     Conference Report Compared To:\n \nSenate 302(b) allocation:\n  Budget Authority.........................................            0\n  Outlays..................................................         -120\nSenate-Passed Bill:\n  Budget Authority.........................................           96\n  Outlays..................................................          125\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n  Budget Authority.........................................          404\n  Outlays..................................................          219\nPresident's Request:\n  Budget Authority.........................................          324\n  Outlays..................................................           1\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote: Table does not include 2010 outlays stemming from emergency budget\n  authority provided in the 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act (P.L.\n  111-32).\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today the Senate turns to the conference \nreport for H.R. 2997, the Agriculture appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2010. This bill spends about $120 billion in direct and mandatory \nspending. This is on top of the $108 million that was provided under \nthe fiscal year 2009 omnibus bill, as well as the infamous economic \nstimulus package, which provided another $26.5 billion in Ag spending.\n  I acknowledge that many of the programs funded by this bill are \nvalued for providing important services to the agriculture community at \nlarge, and I commend the members of the Senate Appropriations Committee \nfor reporting this bill in a timely manner. I agree that we should \nensure that our farmers stay out of the red, and that some Federal \ninvolvement is necessary to assist low-income families under nutrition \nprograms. Unfortunately, Congress once again has conformed to the \npractice of diverting precious taxpayer dollars into an array of \nspecial interest\n\n[[Page S10283]]\n\npork projects which have not been authorized or requested by the \nadministration.\n  When the bill passed the Senate shortly before the August recess, the \nbill carried with it 296 ``Congressionally Directed Spending Items'' a \nfancy new term for earmarks--totaling over $220 million. Now that \nconferees have had their chance to feed at the trough, the number of \nearmarks has grown to 461 totaling over $360 million. None of these \nprojects were requested by the administration. Many of them were not \nauthorized, or competitively bid in any way. No hearing was held to \njudge whether or not these were national priorities worthy of scarce \ntaxpayer's dollars.\n  Let's take a look at some of the earmarks that are in this bill: $2 \nmillion for a fruit laboratory in West Virginia; $819,000 for catfish \ngenome research in Alabama; $360,000 for a corn ethanol research plant \nin Washington, DC; $75,000 to promote childhood farm safety in Iowa; \n$250,000 for the Iowa Vitality Center; $700,000 to improve cattle \nhealth in Maine; $300,000 to develop ``Best Practices in Agriculture \nWaste Management'' in California; $1.3 million for greenhouse nurseries \nin Ohio, which weren't requested by the administration; $2.9 million \nfor shrimp aquaculture research in Arizona and Massachusetts; $693,000 \nfor beef improvement research in Missouri; $165,000 for maple syrup \nresearch in Vermont; $195,000 to research how to increase the lifespan \nof peach trees in South Carolina; $349,000 for pig waste management in \nNorth Carolina; $500,000 goes to the National Wild Turkey Federation in \nNebraska, and $250,000 for the Kansas Farm Bureau Foundation for a \nworkforce development program.\n  The largest earmark in this bill goes to Hawaii. The Aloha State bags \n$5 million to continue construction of an Agriculture Research Service \nCenter to study agriculture practices in the Pacific. As my colleagues \nknow, ARS construction is one of the most heavily earmarked accounts in \ngovernment. So much so that the President's budget actually proposed \nzeroing out ARS construction for fiscal year 2010 because:\n\n       Congress routinely earmarks small amounts of funding for \n     [ARS projects] located throughout the nation. The result of \n     scattering funding in this manner is that . . . few if any of \n     the projects are able to reach the critical threshold of \n     funding that would allow construction to begin. Funding \n     construction over such a long time significantly increases \n     the amount of money needed to fully complete these projects, \n     as well as postponing their completion for many years.\n\n  So here we have a program that is earmarked so severely that it \ndelays and drives up the costs of approved construction projects. Not \nonly are we funding this Hawaiian facility, but conferees approved 21 \nearmarks totaling over $71 million for ARS facility construction, some \nof them airdropped in conference.\n  During Senate consideration of this bill, I filed over 300 amendments \nto strike every earmark as well as cut funding to several USDA programs \nthat the President proposed for termination including the ARS \nfacilities account. It should come as no surprise that my amendments \nwere defeated at every turn by appropriators on both sides of the \naisle.\n  These projects may be meritorious and helpful to the designated \ncommunities, but considering our current budgetary crisis, it's \ninappropriate to include them on this year's agriculture spending bill, \nespecially when they have been identified for termination or reduction. \nI hope my colleagues will agree that we have higher spending priorities \nthat are directly related to the purposes of this agriculture bill. \nThis bill is intended to address farmers, women, children, and rural \ncommunities with the greatest need, not for piggybacking pet projects \nthat garner the support of special interest constituents.\n  I know that many of my colleagues have spoken about the economic \nstruggles of America's hardworking farmers and low-income families. The \nfarmers and struggling families I know are their tired of watching \ntheir hard-earned money go down the drain.\n  I will oppose this conference report and every other pork-laden bill \nthat comes before this body.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I submit pursuant to Senate rules a \nreport, and I ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Disclosure of Congressionally Directed Spending Items\n\n       I certify that the information required by rule XLIV of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate related to congressionally \n     directed spending items has been identified in the conference \n     report which accompanies H.R. 2997 and that the required \n     information has been available on a publicly accessible \n     congressional website at least 48 hours before a vote on the \n     pending bill.\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will pass H.R. \n2997, the Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010 conference \nreport.\n  This legislation will fund important programs, such as food safety \ninspection, agricultural research, and the Supplemental Nutrition \nProgram for Women, Infants, and Children. Programs such as these will \nbenefit the entire Nation. My constituents will additionally benefit \nfrom a number of projects located throughout the State of Hawaii.\n  The bill will stimulate food and agricultural development in Hawaii \nthrough projects tailored to the State's needs. It will fund continued \nagricultural development and resource conservation programs through the \nlocal, community-based leadership of Hawaii's four Resource \nConservation and Development Councils. It will foster food science and \nagricultural research that meets Hawaii's unique needs and that \nbolsters American competitiveness in such areas as floriculture, \ntropical fruit, and aquaculture.\n  Watershed and flood prevention projects in Hawaii also receive \nappropriate attention in this bill. Recent droughts underscore the \nimportance of watershed projects to increase water storage capacity, \ndelivery system efficiency, and water conservation. Projects on Maui \nand the Big Island will help make progress on the planning and \nconstruction of projects dealing with the limited natural resource of \nwater.\n  Funding in the bill also includes programs to control invasive \nspecies in Hawaii such as termites, brown tree snakes, coqui frogs, and \nother alien pests and weeds that threaten agricultural lands and \nsensitive ecosystems. Hawaii is the only domestic supplier of varroa \nmite-free queen bees for honey producers and pollinators, and therefore \nthe mite eradication efforts cultivated by this legislation are of \nnational importance. Similarly, farmers in the continental United \nStates will benefit from the establishment of a facility to provide a \nsecure supply of sterile fruit flies used to control fruit flies that \nare destructive to fruit crops. Hawaii offers a premier location for \nrearing sterile fruit flies as four pestiferous fruit fly species are \nalready established there.\n  In sum, this bill will fund programs meeting Hawaii's unique needs in \naddition to supporting local leadership that will aid agriculture \nnationally. I am glad to have advocated for this funding and thank the \nsenior Senator from Hawaii, the Chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, as well as the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate \nAppropriations Agriculture, Rural Development, and FDA Subcommittee for \ntheir work in crafting and managing this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be equally charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask for all the remaining time to be \nyielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KOHL.

Madam President, this is a simple motion to recommit the \nbill to put it at last year's funding level, plus the money for the \ncensus. The census is once every 10 years, and it will allow for that \nfunding increase.\n  But in this era of record deficits and uncontrolled Washington \nspending, we are living under last year's spending levels with this \nmotion. We need to get serious in this body about getting our spending \nunder control. We have to start with appropriations bills. We know we \nhave to cut spending on entitlements.\n  Let's start now by living under last year's spending levels, instead \nof the large increases we are having on appropriations bill after \nappropriations bill.\n  My motion allows the Appropriations Committee to determine what \nlevels programs would be at, but we are not going to allow across-the-\nboard increases.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I vigorously oppose the motion.\n  First, the bill is consistent with the budget resolution and the CJS \nsubcommittee 302(b) allocation.\n  Second, the bill is a product of bipartisan cooperation reported out \nof the Appropriations Committee unanimously.\n  Third, the consequences of cutting the CJS bill to 2009 levels by \nexcluding the census would be devastating. If you take out the census \nand do a cut, guess whom you are cutting. First of all, you are cutting \nFederal law enforcement. If you think this is a simple resolution, tell \nthat to the FBI. If you think it is simple, tell it to the marshals who \nare chasing sexual predators. If you think it is simple, tell it to the \nastronauts, who are waiting to make sure we put the money in the budget \nto keep them safe as they go into space.\n  There is nothing simple about this motion to recommit. I simply ask \nyou to reject the Ensign motion.\n  Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is this a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kerry) are necessarily absent.\n  The result was announced--yeas 33, nays 65, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 319 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--33\n\n     Barrasso\n     Bayh\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--65\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bennett\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kirk\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     LeMieux\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Byrd\n     Kerry\n       \n  The motion was rejected.\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 3548, which was received \nfrom the House. I further ask unanimous consent that a Reid substitute \namendment which is at the desk be agreed to; the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time and passed; the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, it is my understanding that we received \nthis an hour and a half ago. I have no doubt at the appropriate time we \nwill be able to work out some kind of agreement. But our side is going \nto need some time to look at it. We will need some Republican ideas or \namendments as well, and we will need a CBO score.\n  At this time, I will have to, on behalf of Members on our side, pose \nan objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I can just say--and I know others wish \nto speak on this issue--we have found a new stalling tactic. It is \npretty new. It is CBO. Now I am sure everything is going to be ``CBO.'' \nI am sorry the consent request was not granted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I was going to call up an amendment, but \nI think the Senator from New Hampshire wishes to speak. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senator from New Hampshire be recognized and I be \nrecognized after her.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, if I may ask my friend, the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, does he wish to speak?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct, 2 minutes.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't we let the chairman of the Judiciary Committee go \nfor 30 seconds to offer an amendment.\n\n[[Page S10285]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Baucus be recognized following \nSenator Leahy and then Senator Jack Reed.\n  Mr. REID. And then Senator Shaheen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the leader's request?\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Reserving my right to object, and I don't intend to, I \nwould advise my colleagues that somewhere in this line, I need a minute \nto call up an amendment I wish to have pending.\n  Mr. REID. Why don't you do that--you will have a minute following \nSenator Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized for 30 seconds.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2642\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nset aside the pending business and call up my amendment at the desk, \namendment No. 2642.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Leahy] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2642.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that further reading of the \namendment be dispensed with; and I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to continue for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To include nonprofit and volunteer ground and air ambulance \n        crew members and first responders for certain benefits)\n\n       On page 170, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 220. BENEFITS FOR CERTAIN NONPROFIT EMERGENCY MEDICAL \n                   SERVICE PROVIDERS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``Dale \n     Long Emergency Medical Service Providers Protection Act''.\n       (b) Eligibility.--Section 1204 of title I of the Omnibus \n     Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796b) \n     is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (7), by striking ``public employee member \n     of a rescue squad or ambulance crew;'' and inserting \n     ``employee or volunteer member of a rescue squad or ambulance \n     crew (including a ground or air ambulance service) that--\n       ``(A) is a public agency; or\n       ``(B) is (or is a part of) a nonprofit entity serving the \n     public that--\n       ``(i) is officially authorized or licensed to engage in \n     rescue activity or to provide emergency medical services; and\n       ``(ii) is officially designated as a pre-hospital emergency \n     medical response agency;''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (9)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), by striking ``as a chaplain'' and \n     all that follows through the semicolon, and inserting ``or as \n     a chaplain;'';\n       (B) in subparagraph (B)(ii), by striking ``or'' after the \n     semicolon;\n       (C) in subparagraph (C)(ii), by striking the period and \n     inserting ``; or''; and\n       (D) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(D) a member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew who, as \n     authorized or licensed by law and by the applicable agency or \n     entity (and as designated by such agency or entity), is \n     engaging in rescue activity or in the provision of emergency \n     medical services.''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by subsection (b) \n     shall apply only to injuries sustained on or after January 1, \n     2009.\n       (d) Offset.--The total amount appropriated under the \n     heading ``salaries and expenses'' under the heading ``General \n     Administration'' under this title is reduced by $1,000,000.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, more than three decades ago Congress \ncreated the Public Safety Officers Benefits Program at the Justice \nDepartment to provide assistance to the surviving families of police, \nfirefighters, and medics who lose their lives or are disabled in the \nline of duty.\n  The benefit, though, only applies to public safety officers employed \nby Federal, State, and local government entities.\n  With volunteers providing emergency medical service to many \ncommunities all across the country, my amendment would remedy this gap \nin the P-S-O-B program by extending benefits to cover nonprofit EMS \npersonnel who provide critical prehospital care.\n  We have been working to address this gap in the Federal program for \nsome time, and the tragic loss earlier this year of Dale Long--a \ndecorated EMT from Bennington, VT--reminded everyone that first \nresponders of many uniforms literally put their lives at risk every \nday.\n  These brave emergency professionals never let their communities down \nwhen a call comes in, and no one ever asks the lifesavers at an \nemergency scene whether they work for the Federal government, a State \ngovernment, a local government, or a nonprofit agency. My amendment \nwill erase that unnecessary distinction from the P-S-O-B program.\n  I would like to thank a number of first responder groups--including \nthe American Ambulance Association, the International Association of \nFire Fighters, the International Association of Fire Chiefs, and the \nFraternal Order of Police--for their assistance on this matter. I also \nwould note that this amendment is fully offset and cosponsored by \nSenator Sanders.\n  I hope the Senate can move quickly to approve this amendment, and I \nyield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2669\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 2669.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. Graham], for himself, \n     Mr. McCain, and Mr. Lieberman, proposes an amendment numbered \n     2669.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of funds for the prosecution in Article \n    III courts of the United States of individuals involved in the \n                 September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks)\n\n       At the appropriate place in title II, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Prohibition on Use of Funds for Prosecution of \n     9/11 Terrorists in Article III Courts.--None of the funds \n     appropriated or otherwise made available for the Department \n     of Justice by this Act may be obligated or expended to \n     commence or continue the prosecution in an Article III court \n     of the United States of an individual suspected of planning, \n     authorizing, organizing, committing, or aiding the attacks on \n     the United States and its citizens that occurred on September \n     11, 2001.\n       (b) Article III Court of the United States Defined.--In \n     this section, the term ``Article III court of the United \n     States'' means a court of the United States established under \n     Article III of the Constitution of the United States.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, the Senate is now considering the 8th of \n12 Appropriations bills reported by the Appropriations Committee this \nyear, the fiscal year 2010 Commerce, Justice, and Science \nAppropriations bill.\n  This bill includes total resources of $65.15 billion, an increase in \nfunding of $7.2 billion above the fiscal year 2009 enacted level. While \non first blush this level of funding may appear generous, Members need \nonly to look at the accounts in this bill to understand the need for \nthese additional funds.\n  Specifically, fiscal year 2010 is the peak funding year for \npreparations for the constitutionally mandated decennial census. As a \nresult, an additional $4.1 billion above the fiscal year 2009 omnibus \nenacted level is required for this account alone.\n  The next largest increase is for science. On August 9, 2007, then-\nPresident Bush signed into law the America Competes Act, legislation \nthat moved through this Chamber with 69 cosponsors and passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent.\n  That legislation called for the doubling of science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics funding for the purpose of investing in \nscientific innovation and education to improve the competitiveness of \nthe United States in the global economy.\n  This bill includes an increase of $1.7 billion for NASA, NOAA and NSF \nscience programs, all of which contribute to the goals of the America \nCompetes Act and bolster our economic competitiveness.\n  Finally, the bill provides for an increase of $580 million for the \nFBI which allows that agency to continue its efforts to fight both \nterrorism and violent crime in this country.\n  Senators Mikulski and Shelby have worked diligently to offer a strong \nbipartisan bill that tackles the needs of law enforcement, supports \nscientific research in both space and in our oceans, and invests in \nscientific innovation and education. I applaud them for their hard work \nand bipartisan cooperation.\n\n[[Page S10286]]\n\n  As with the other seven bills that have come before the Senate for \nconsideration to date, the committee supported their recommendations \nunanimously, and the bill was reported out of the Appropriations \nCommittee on June 25 by a recorded vote of 30 to 0.\n  This bill has been available for review by members for more than 3 \nmonths, so if a Member has an amendment, they should be willing to come \nto the floor today and offer it. At this point, it makes no sense for \nMembers to delay.\n  Vice Chairman Cochran and I, along with the other subcommittee chair \nand ranking members have worked diligently to restore regular order to \nthe appropriations process. We have come a long way in responding to \nwhat was asked of us at the beginning of the year.\n  But for us to succeed, it takes the cooperation of all Members of the \nSenate. Therefore, I strongly encourage my colleagues not to delay \naction on this bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to cosponsor today an \namendment to require the antitrust division of the Department of \nJustice to carry out oversight, information-sharing, and joint \nactivities concerning competition in the agriculture sector. Our \nNation's antitrust laws exist to promote competition, which ensures \nthat consumers will pay lower prices, and receive more choices of \nhigher quality products. The Department of Justice is charged with \nenforcing these antitrust laws. Yet there are few industries in which \nthere are more serious concerns about the state of competition than the \nagriculture sector. Small farmers are suffering because the prices they \ncan charge for many of their products continues to decline, and the \nlevel of concentration throughout the industry could have a negative \nlong-term impact on the prices that consumers pay and the choices they \nhave.\n  Since first coming to Washington, I have fought to help our family \nfarmers by ensuring a level playing field in American agriculture. The \nconsolidation in recent years throughout the agriculture sector has had \na tremendous impact on the lives and livelihoods of American farmers. \nIt affects producers of most commodities in virtually every region of \nthe country, and in my home State of Vermont, it affects dairy farmers. \nFarmers need a fair opportunity to compete in the marketplace and we \nmust prevent giants in corporate agriculture from repeatedly hurting \nthem with unfair, discriminatory, deceptive, and anticompetitive \npractices.\n  I held a field hearing last month in Vermont to assess competitive \nissues in the dairy industry. During that hearing, we heard from \nofficials from the Department of Justice and the United States \nDepartment of Agriculture. We also received first hand testimony from \nfarmers whose businesses are suffering at the hands of large \ndistributors. This crisis is real, and the Department of Justice has \npledged to take a renewed look at competitive issues in the agriculture \nsector as a whole. This amendment is another step to help ensure that \ncompetition exists in the agriculture sector.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, this amendment is simple, direct, and to \nthe point. It would prohibit the use of funds for the Department of \nJustice to prosecute the perpetrators of 9/11 in article III courts.\n  What does that mean? That means that Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and \npeople like him, who organized the attacks against our Nation on \nSeptember 11, 2001, would be tried by military commissions, not Federal \ncourts. They are not common criminals, they are war criminals. They \nshould be tried in a military setting, like other people throughout the \n200-year history of this country have been tried regarding acts of war \nagainst the United States.\n  The military commissions have been reformed. Thanks to Senator Levin \nand others, we have a great process that I would not mind our own \nsoldiers being tried in. At the end of the day, we need not criminalize \nthis war. There is a law of armed conflict awaiting the defendants that \nis fair and it is robust. It has adequate due process, but it \nrecognizes we are at war. And military commissions have been used \nthroughout the history of this country. They are better able to protect \nclassified information.\n  We need to be consistent. The people who planned the attacks of 9/11 \nare not common criminals. They are people who have taken up arms \nagainst the Untied States, and they should be adjudged accordingly in a \nmilitary tribunal, which I think we have now designed as the best in \nthe world.\n  There will be more to follow in this important debate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation? \nWhat is pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Graham amendment is pending to the CJS \nappropriations bill.\n\n\n                    Unemployment Insurance Extension\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n  Madam President, on another subject, I wish to say I am very \ndistressed that the other side objected to a request by the majority \nleader to pass legislation offered by himself, by myself, and Senators \nReed and Shaheen to extend unemployment insurance benefits.\n  Our country faces very high unemployment rates nationwide. In some \nStates, it is much worse than other States. It is only fair. It is the \nright thing to do for the U.S. Government to recognize those folks who \ndon't have jobs--to help tide themselves over until they get a job--\nwith extension of unemployment insurance benefits.\n  I think for every job that is available in the United States today \nthere are about six applicants. There are too many people unemployed--\npeople seeking jobs who cannot get jobs. So the right thing to do, as \nwe come out of this great recession, is to recognize those who are \nunemployed and help them tide things over to make sure they are \ncompensated.\n  The legislation we have introduced does that with 14 additional weeks \nfor all States, and also would provide additional weeks for the hardest \nhit States--6 weeks of additional benefits for those States hardest \nhit, those States with the highest rates of unemployment. This \nunemployment rate we are facing is going to continue. It is not just a \nshort-term phenomenon. There are estimates that we will see rates up to \n9.8 percent through most of even next year.\n  I am very disheartened myself, but more so for the folks who are \ngoing to be denied benefits by the action taken by the Republican side \nto object to extending benefits to those folks who are in need of them. \nI am hopeful at a later point in time--very soon in fact; hopefully by \nnext week--the other side will see fit to let this legislation pass \nbecause it is sorely needed. I urge my colleagues to vote for it when \nit does come up next week.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I rise today to add my voice to \nSenator Baucus in strong support of the Unemployment Compensation \nExtension Act. This bill, as the Senator said, is designed to help \nthose families who are struggling in all 50 States by extending at \nleast 14 weeks of unemployment benefits to workers across the country \nwho are going to exhaust their benefits by the end of this year.\n  I thank Majority Leader Reid and Chairman Baucus for bringing this \nbill to the floor, and the many Senators and staff who have worked so \nhard to get this done, particularly Senator Jack Reed, who is going to \nbe speaking, Senators Chris Dodd and Amy Klobuchar.\n  Through no fault of their own, many of those who lost their jobs \nmonths ago still cannot find work. Five million workers have been \nunemployed for more than 6 months. That is an all-time high, and it is \nwhy extending unemployment benefits in all 50 States is so important.\n  When I am back in New Hampshire and meeting families trying to get \nby, one thing is very clear: People want to go back to work, but they \nface one of the weakest job markets since the Great Depression. Until \nthat job market improves, we have a responsibility to help those \nworkers pay their mortgages and keep food on the table.\n  Another very important reason why we should support this, and why I \nam disappointed that our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nrefused to come forward in support of this, is that extending \nunemployment benefits is a proven boost to our economy. Unemployment \ncompensation is money that\n\n[[Page S10287]]\n\ngets spent immediately on necessities. People who are out of work need \nthis money to help pay the rent, pay their mortgages, buy food, pay for \ngas. Extending unemployment benefits is one of the most effective \nactions we can take to help get this economy moving again, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support this important extension and to quickly pass \nthis critical legislation.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I commend Leader Reid and Chairman Baucus \nfor the work they have done to get this bill to the floor. I also \ncommend Senator Shaheen for her valuable contribution to moving this \nforward.\n  I am disappointed, to say the least, that we cannot move this \nlegislation quickly. There are millions of Americans who are looking at \nthe prospect of losing their unemployment compensation, others who have \nalready lost it and, frankly, millions who may be working but, sadly, \nmay qualify shortly for unemployment compensation.\n  As my colleagues have pointed out, there are six job seekers for \nevery job. This unemployment crisis will continue, and the least we can \ndo is to provide people with some support while they look for jobs and \ntry to maintain their families.\n  One point I wish to make--which should be very clear--is that this \nlegislation is fully paid for. This is not something that requires a \nCBO score in order to determine how it is used and what the cost will \nbe and how it will be paid for. It is paid for by a continued extension \nof the FUTA surtax for a year and a half--through 2010 and the first \nsix months of 2011. So this is responsible legislation as well as \ncritically important legislation.\n  Again, as my colleagues indicated, this legislation will provide an \nadditional 14 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits throughout the \ncountry. But as we have done on numerous past occurrences, it will \nrecognize that even though there is pain everywhere, the pain is not \ndistributed equally. There are States, such as my home State, where the \nunemployment rate is extraordinarily high. It is a critical need in \nRhode Island where the unemployment rate is nearly 13 percent. So for \nthose States, there will be an additional 6 weeks, for a total of 20 \nweeks, for all States with an unemployment rate of 8.5 percent or \nabove.\n  This has to be done quickly, because as we speak there are 5.4 \nmillion Americans who have been unemployed for 6 months or more. There \nare signs that the economy may be recovering--credit markets, equity \nmarkets--but the unemployment markets still remain, unfortunately, in a \ndeep decline. We are trying all we can do to reverse that, but in the \ninterim we have to be able to give people a chance to simply get by, \nand that is what this does.\n  We are poised to pass this, and this unnecessary delay is not only \ninappropriate but inexcusable. This is something that affects every \nState in the country and it affects people who have worked hard all \ntheir working lives and now face unemployment, many for the first time. \nThe psychological shock is great. Add to that the financial reality \nthat they can't pay their bills, they can't pay the mortgage, and that \nadds another problem which I think cries out for immediate action, not \nwaiting for a score from CBO, not waiting to see if there is something \nancillary to this that could be attached. This is a time and a moment \nto meet the needs of the American public, to do so responsibly--and we \nhave because it is fully offset--and not to delay. I urge the speedy \npassage of this critical legislation. I hope Leader Reid will be \nprepared to make a UC the next time we are convened and that at that \ntime this measure can be passed unanimously.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I want to support the words of the \nSenator from New Hampshire and the Senator from Rhode Island about \nmoving the unemployment insurance extension forward.\n  We all know that joblessness is a tremendous problem in this country. \nWe can argue about which States should get the unemployment benefits \nand for how much time, but if you are unemployed, your household is 100 \npercent unemployed. It doesn't matter to you whether you are in a State \nwhere it is a 6-percent or a 9-percent or a 12-percent rate. If you \nhave been looking for a job for 26 weeks, you are in trouble and your \nfamily is in trouble.\n  It is hard to believe on an issue such as this, where you would think \nthere would be some comity--you know, I was on one of the TV shows with \nthe Senator from Texas and he agreed unemployment benefits should be \nextended. We talked about it on that show. Yet we are now holding \nthings up. But people can't wait. They have food to put on the table; \nthey have families to keep together. They have a work ethic. When you \ncan't find a job, try as you might, it eats at you. It is one of the \ngreat things about Americans.\n  I hope my colleagues will reconsider. I hope they will reconsider--\nyes, because the politics is not on their side here, but more \nimportant, because of the substance. We have the worst unemployment we \nhave had over a period of time since World War II, since the Great \nDepression. We can debate what we should ultimately do. We have to do \nmore, in my opinion, to get this country out of the economic problems \nin terms of jobs. We do not want to wait 2 or 3 or 4 years for \nunemployment to gradually come down. We can debate all that. Should \nthere be a second stimulus? Should we do other things? What should we \ndo about highway building? Should we extend the home credit? These are \nall legitimate considerations we should debate. There will probably be \nsome differences. But in terms of helping those unemployed, the vast \nmajority of whom are unemployed through no fault of their own, I don't \nthink there can be much of a debate. I don't think there will be much \nof a debate. When it comes to the floor through the good efforts of the \nSenator from Montana and the Senator from New Hampshire, my guess is it \nwill be overwhelmingly voted on.\n  Let's not delay. Let's move forward as quickly as we can to help \nthose who, through no fault of their own right now, cannot find a job, \ntry as they might themselves.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Is there a pending order of business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The appropriations act is pending, and there \nis an amendment pending to that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I rise to discuss an amendment I filed \nthat takes an important step to address the disturbing level of youth \nviolence in the city of Chicago. My amendment would allow the Attorney \nGeneral to dedicate up to $5 million from the Office of Juvenile \nJustice and Delinquency Prevention to community-based, street-level \nviolence prevention efforts.\n  It breaks my heart to read the Chicago newspapers and see the stories \nof senseless violence that occurs on a regular basis. Stories such as \nthat of Chastity Turner, a 9-year-old girl who was shot and killed last \nJune while she washed her pet dogs outside her home in Englewood. Or \nSimeon Sanders, an Army soldier who was on furlough back home in the \nsouth suburbs when he was fatally shot in front of a community center \nthis past July. Or 17-year-old Corey McClaurin, a high school senior \nshot and killed by a gunman while sitting in his car just a few weeks \nago. Many of us have seen the shocking, startling videotape of the \nbeating death of 16-year-old Derrion Albert, buried in Chicago last \nSaturday.\n  These stories simply overwhelm us. My heart goes out to the families \nand all the loved ones grieving for their loss. No one ever should have \nto face the tragedy of losing a child to such senseless violence.\n\n[[Page S10288]]\n\n  All too often this violence ends up involving school-age children. We \nlose a classroom's worth of schoolchildren each year to deadly \nshootings in Chicago and hundreds more are injured. Chicago is a great \ncity. I love representing that city and being part of it. It breaks my \nheart to think that for many people across America, this is a new \nimage, an image of children being killed in the streets, shot, beaten. \nIt isn't what the city is all about. It isn't the values of the city. \nBut we have to do better. Youth violence is devastating to families, \ncommunities and schools in Chicago and other urban centers.\n  Wednesday, Mayor Daley and the CEO of the Chicago public schools, Ron \nHuberman, met with Attorney General Eric Holder and the Secretary of \nEducation, Arne Duncan, to talk about ways to stop this epidemic of \nviolence. As this meeting demonstrated, officials at the local, State, \nand Federal level are committed to taking bold action. Starting this \nyear and using Department of Education dollars that were made available \nthrough the economic recovery package, the Chicago public school system \nwill provide an unprecedented degree of intervention and support for \nschool children who, according to statistical indicators, are at the \ngreatest risk of being caught up in violence.\n  This plan provides employment and adult mentoring for at-risk \nstudents. It provides structure and guidance to help prevent them from \nbecoming victims. This comprehensive youth violence plan will also \ninvolve coordination with law enforcement, particularly to help secure \nareas on the way to and from schools where kids tend to congregate and \nwhere violence often flares.\n  Ron Huberman is a very smart man. He runs our public school system in \nChicago. Previously, he had been a Chicago policeman. He tried to \nanalyze the school violence and come up an approach. What they did was \nto enlist some experts who did basically a statistical profile of both \nthe victims and perpetrators of violence over the last few years in \nChicago. Who are these young people? How do they find themselves in \nthese predicaments? What are indicators that they are likely to become \nviolent in their own lives or become victims of violence? He found \nrecurring patterns. What he has suggested, with the cooperation of \nMayor Daley, is intervention at an early age so we can get to these \nchildren before they become victims, before they turn to violent ways. \nIt is an innovative and thoughtful approach. I support it.\n  I am pleased the Justice Department is providing substantial \nassistance to Chicago to combat crime. It has been one of my priorities \nin recent years to make sure the Justice Department is doing all it can \nto partner with Chicago to try and stop youth violence.\n  Last year, then-Senator Obama and I asked Attorney General Mukasey to \ninclude Chicago in the Department of Justice's Comprehensive Anti-Gang \nInitiative. This is a program which provides extra money for selected \ncities for gang enforcement, prevention, and prisoner reentry \ninitiatives. At our request, the Justice Department included Chicago \nand has provided $2 million in additional Federal funding for this \npurpose.\n  I have also strongly supported the COPS Program and Byrne-JAG grants, \nand so many other areas where we have assisted law enforcement. Over \nthe last 2 years, we have been able to provide dramatic increases in \nlaw enforcement funding for Chicago and Cook County. In fiscal year \n2008, Chicago received $1.4 million in Byrne-JAG local law enforcement \ngrants. But this year, through the stimulus act passed by Congress at \nthe inspiration of President Obama and through the fiscal year 2009 \nJustice Department spending bill, we increased that amount to $35 \nmillion, bolstering police efforts in that area.\n  The Chicago Police Department recently was awarded funding for 50 new \ncops on the beat through the $1 billion program the stimulus act \nprovided for hiring new cops.\n  I know Attorney General Holder's commitment to this issue. I know he \nis genuine. I raised the matter with him at a Senate hearing earlier \nthis year. He made clear the administration's dedication to helping \nsolve this problem.\n  Arne Duncan also is a true champion of the city of Chicago, its \nschools and kids and families who depend on him. He wants to reduce \nviolence and is dedicated to it.\n  The efforts we are putting into Chicago have helped some. In the \nfirst 7 months of 2009, we saw an 11-percent drop in homicides and a 9-\npercent drop in all crimes. This is due, in large part, to the \ndedicated efforts of law enforcement. But while beefed-up law \nenforcement is essential, it is not enough. We have to do more to \nprevent children from turning to violence.\n  I have worked with a group called CeaseFire, which goes into the most \nviolent neighborhoods of Chicago and tries to treat violence as if it \nis a public health issue. How do you eradicate a public health issue? \nWith intervention. They do it on the streets. I have put--and I will \nuse the word--earmarks in continuing appropriations bills year after \nyear for CeaseFire, a community-based program to bring peace to the \nstreets of Chicago. No apologies. It is an earmark. I will put it in \nagain, if I get a chance, because I believe they are saving lives, and \nit is money well spent.\n  CeaseFire was reviewed by the Justice Department in an evidence-based \nstudy and was found to have a significant impact in reducing shootings \nand killings. The amendment I will offer, when we get a chance to \nreturn to this bill, will help enhance the efforts of crime prevention \norganizations such as CeaseFire. It only permits--it doesn't mandate--\nthe Attorney General to devote up to $5 million of grant money from the \nOffice of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention for community-\nbased violence prevention.\n  As Attorney General Holder mentioned Wednesday in Chicago, the \nadministration supports community-based programs. This gives them the \nresources to make that work. It doesn't require an offset. It simply \nbroadens the purposes for which the administration can use existing \nfunds.\n  The problem with youth violence is not new, and it is not exclusively \nChicago's problem. But it is not inevitable either. We must help \nprovide a safer, more stable environment for these kids. It will take a \nsustained commitment to do so. My amendment is a step in that effort I \nhope my colleagues will support. I urge adoption of the amendment when \nwe return to the bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Illinois for \nspeaking out for justice in his community and across the country.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 2 hours, time which I will \ncontrol and disperse to others, as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health care reform\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I take the floor tonight with my \ncolleagues Senators Merkley, Stabenow, Udall of New Mexico, Casey, and \nWhitehouse to talk about the public option and why the public option is \nso important to our Nation and to improving our health care system. I \nwill speak for the first 10 minutes. Then I will turn to Senator \nMerkley, who serves with me on the HELP Committee and has done such a \nterrific job helping to write the health care bill. I wished to start \nwith something I have done for several weeks and that is to share \nletters from people in Ohio who, by and large, have health insurance \nthey were satisfied with.\n  They thought they had a good health insurance policy. In these \nletters, typically, people tell me when they get sick, they have very \ncostly health problems, long hospital visits, doctor visits, tests. \nThey end up losing their health insurance. The insurance company cuts \nthem off because they have become too expensive, which is not even \ninsurance. That has happened too many times. That is one of the reasons \nthis is so very important.\n  I know Senator Stabenow gets letters from Lansing and Detroit. I know \nSenator Merkley gets the same kind of letters from Eugene and Portland, \nfrom all over his State.\n  Joyce from Ottawa County, west of where I live on Lake Erie, writes:\n\n       I am a 77-year-old great-grandmother who knows how the \n     expenses of health care create a constant worry for families. \n     My oldest\n\n[[Page S10289]]\n\n     daughter and her husband have three children and they are in \n     dire straights. He might lose his job soon and she recently \n     lost hers after 13 years with the company. Their health \n     coverage is due to expire in December and they have received \n     estimates for coverage of $1,000 a month. There is no way for \n     them to pay, and at age 54 and 61, they are not [close to \n     being] eligible for Medicare. My fear for my grandchildren \n     and great grandchildren is that they struggle day after day \n     to find a job, care for themselves with pride. They want to \n     go to college but they know they will owe tens of thousands \n     of dollars when they graduate and still not be able to find a \n     job or afford health care. Please fight for a public option \n     to help my family.\n\n  Joyce understands what the public option will do. It will bring \ndiscipline to the market to keep prices in check. It will make health \ninsurance companies honest so they can't dump people from their plans \nbecause they are more expensive or because they have a preexisting \ncondition. They can no longer discriminate based on disability or age \nor gender or geography.\n  Jill from Defiance, in northwestern Ohio near the Indiana border, \nwrites:\n\n       Later this month, I'll be losing my job due to the economy. \n     I will no longer have health insurance. Based on my \n     unemployment pay, I will not be able to afford COBRA . . .\n\n  COBRA is the extension of insurance for people who have lost their \njobs. Under COBRA, the insured person has to pay both her side of the \ninsurance policy and her employer's side. When they lose their jobs, \nthey rarely can to that.\n\n        . . . I will not be able to afford COBRA and pay for my \n     house, utilities, [other] bills, and food. Me and the other \n     150 people losing their job at the plant will be lucky to \n     find new jobs, let alone afford health insurance. We need \n     health reform now with a strong public option.\n\n  Jill understands, as does a majority of my colleagues and an \noverwhelming number in the House of Representatives and an overwhelming \nnumber of the public--by 2 to 1--that the public option matters because \nit will make sure people who don't have insurance now will go into an \ninsurance exchange and will have choices. They can choose CIGNA. They \ncan choose Blue Cross, Aetna. They can choose Medical Mutual, an Ohio \nnot-for-profit company, or they can choose the public option. It is all \nabout choice. People can decide: Do I want the public option? I like \nMedicare. Or do I want to go into a private plan.\n  The last letter I will share is from Brenda in Lorain County. She \nwrites:\n\n       My husband is retired but has to get insurance through a \n     private insurance company. Neither of us will be eligible for \n     Medicare. My husband for 3 years, me for 4 years. Our plan is \n     ridiculously overpriced and the premiums, deductibles, and \n     co-pays have almost doubled in the 3\\1/2\\ years since my \n     husband retired. All this is happening as we get older and \n     need health care. Please fight for health reform including a \n     public option. Every American citizen should have affordable \n     health care without exception.\n\n  As Brenda points out, people who are so often losing their jobs are \nin their fifties and sixties. Their health problems are increasing. \nPeople in their fifties and early sixties obviously have more health \nproblems than people in their thirties and forties. And that is when \nthey are losing their insurance.\n  That is why this legislation is so important for people and why the \npublic option will make our health insurance plan significantly better.\n  Some 77 years ago, President Roosevelt addressed the class of 1932 in \nmy mother's home State of Georgia. His task was not an easy one: to \ngive hope to young people beginning careers at the worst moment \npossible. He may as well have been giving hope to Americans today who \nhave lost a job and with it their health care.\n\n  FDR said:\n\n       The country needs and, unless I mistake its temper, the \n     country demands bold, persistent experimentation. It is \n     common sense to take a method and try it: If it fails, admit \n     it frankly and try another. But above all, try something. The \n     millions who are in want will not stand by silently forever \n     while the things to satisfy their needs are within easy \n     reach.\n\n  It is time to try something different. The insurance industry has had \nnearly a century to provide coverage to all Americans. It is safe to \nsay, if we rely on that industry to cover all Americans now, we will be \ndisappointed. If we rely on them to take charge of our health insurance \nsystem, as they have now--if we rely exclusively on them, we will be \ndisappointed again.\n  We need a public insurance option, one that is designed to compete \nfairly with private insurers but differs from them in two crucial \naspects. No. 1, the public plan will not pick and choose where to \nlocate. Instead, it will offer coverage in every corner of this \ncountry--from the Presiding Officer's State of New Hampshire, to \nSenator Merkley's Oregon, to Senator Stabenow's Michigan, to Ohio, and \nto Florida--it will offer coverage in every corner of the country that \nis affordable, continuous, and patient-focused. You do not see Medicare \nturning down somebody for a preexisting condition like the insurance \nindustry habitually does in the country.\n  Second, if the public plan takes in more premiums than it needs, it \nwill return those dollars to enrollees. Not a dollar will go to Wall \nStreet, not another dollar will go to huge CEO salaries--more on that \nin a moment--and not another dollar will go to massive ad campaigns.\n  For these and many other reasons, we need a public option. The public \noption will protect the public from price gouging. It will protect the \npublic from rescission tactics. That is an insurance company word--\n``rescission''--that disqualifies people who have insurance from \nkeeping their insurance. It will protect the public from insurance \nloopholes that deny you coverage, deny you care, and deny you financial \nprotection. The public option will protect the public from premium \nmarkups that pay for outrageous CEO salaries and sales trips to Tahiti.\n  I want to show, just for a moment, some of these CEO salaries for \n2008. This is in millions, in case you cannot see that directly on the \nchart: Aetna's CEO's salary, $24 million; CEO of CIGNA, $12 million; \nCEO of Well Point, $9.8 million; CEO of Coventry--it is not even an \ninsurance company I am particularly familiar with--$9 million; CEO of \nCentene, $8.8 million; CEO of AmeriGroup, $5.3 million; CEO of Humana, \n$4.8 million; CEO of HealthNet, $4.4 million; CEO of Universal \nAmerican, $3.5 million; and the poor man or woman at UnitedHealth \nGroup, that CEO is only bringing in $3.2 million.\n  The point is, these CEO salaries are from these same companies that \nturned down somebody in Findlay, OH, or denied care to somebody in \nWarren, OH, because of a preexisting condition, or they take a patient \nin Springfield, OH, who has been a little bit too expensive for their \ncompany, and they have this cap on their insurance costs, this annual \ncap, and they disqualify them from further care. They practice their \nrescission in order to pay these kinds of CEO salaries.\n  The public option will also protect the public from insurance that is \nunaffordable, unresponsive, and unreliable.\n  Our Nation should try something new when it comes to health reform, \nsomething that gives Americans more options and the insurance industry \na reason to cut out the fat from health insurance premiums.\n  Some of my colleagues in Congress believe a public insurance option \nwill harm the private insurance industry. That industry, however, has \nprofited from competing with Medicare. Taxpayers did not profit from \nthat deal, but that is a story for another day.\n  The insurance industry profited from competing with Medicare, and it \nwill profit from competing with the public option. There is simply no \nreason, when we have this competition, that the insurance companies \nwill not continue to make money. They are going to have 40 million new \ncustomers--40 million new customers. Several million will join the \npublic option, to be sure. But these insurance companies will continue \nto find a way to make money because they are competing. They will be \ncompeting on a level playing field with the public option.\n  The insurance industry claims to be infinitely more cost-efficient \nand capable than a public plan could ever hope to be. The same \nindustry, though, on the other hand, insists it will go under if forced \nto compete--level playing field or not--against a public option.\n  So think of it this way: On the one hand, the insurance industry \ntells us: We are going to be put out of business. The first thing the \ninsurance companies say is, the government cannot do anything right. \nThe government is bloated. The government is bureaucratic. The \ngovernment is inefficient. They just cannot do anything right.\n\n[[Page S10290]]\n\nBut then they say: This public option, it is just going to put us out \nof business because it is going to be so efficient.\n  So which way is it? Of course, we know how efficient Medicare is. \nWhat the public option is going to do is make these private insurance \ncompanies a lot more efficient and make them approach the levels of \nefficiency in Medicare.\n  The private insurance industry is not trying to help our Nation make \nthe right reform choices. It is trying to help our Nation put more tax \ndollars into insurers' pockets. I do not want to see all these 45 \nmillion people with government subsidies who are going to get insurance \nforced into insurance company plans with no choice.\n  The opponents to the public option are saying: These people should \nnot have choice, they should have to go with their tax dollars--in some \ncases, their subsidies or their own money--they should have to go into \nprivate insurance. We say: Let them choose to go into private \ninsurance, but give them the opportunity to go into the public option.\n  In my comments, I am not saying the insurance industry is evil. The \ninsurance industry is loyal to their shareholders. They want to make a \nbuck. They do not have rules. They are allowed to disqualify people. We \nare going to change the rules so they are not allowed to do that.\n  We need a public-private solution that addresses the needs of every \nAmerican and discourages wasted spending. That is why I support a \npublic option. That is why I believe my colleagues should too.\n  As FDR said, it is time to do something. It is time to do the right \nthing.\n  Madam President, I yield as much time as he would need to Senator \nMerkley.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Madam President, I thank very much my colleague from \nOhio, and I appreciate his advocacy for the working people of America, \nworking to make America work for working Americans, both in terms of \njobs and in terms of our health care system.\n  I rise tonight as well to address the importance of a public option. \nHere is where we are right now. We are within reach of a historic \nopportunity to provide accessible health care to every single American, \nand that would be tremendous. But if that accessible health care is \nunaffordable, then we have not reached our goal.\n  Right now, the cost of health care is doubling about every 6 to 7 \nyears, and the pace is accelerating. It doubled over the last 9 years, \nand now it is on pace to double in 6 or 7 years. So folks who could \nafford insurance just a few years ago cannot afford it today, and \nfamilies who can afford insurance today are not going to be able to \nafford it a couple years from now. So it is essential--essential--we \nbend the cost curve. Perhaps the most powerful instrument for bending \nthe cost curve is the public option because it is the public option \nthat brings competition and choice. This is as American as apple pie. \ncompetition and choice result in better service and lower costs.\n  Much of our Nation--our health care consumers--do not have a real \nchoice. A couple companies dominate the market, dictate the terms, deny \nfolks coverage, or drop coverage. So doesn't it concern all of us a \nlittle that after someone has paid their premiums for a decade or 15 \nyears or 20 years, and they get really sick, the insurance company \nsays: We are not renewing your insurance? That certainly is not a \nhealth care system.\n  When you do not have choices, you do not have improved service, you \ndo not have lower costs. But a public option changes that equation \nbecause it introduces real competition in every health care market in \nAmerica. It adds another choice for our citizens in every health care \nmarket in America.\n  This is important to stress. This is a choice. My colleague from Ohio \npointed out this point, but I will point it out again. Sometimes as to \nthe idea of introducing a community health plan or a public option, it \nis attacked by saying: What does government do well? Why would we want \na plan from the government? Then the same critics turn around and say: \nThe government is going to create a public option that is going to work \nso well it is going to drive every other option out of existence.\n  You cannot have it both ways, and neither extreme is accurate.\n  We have seen this idea work in many States in related areas. For \nexample, in the State of Oregon, 20 years ago, Oregon's workers' \ncompensation market was a mess. It is a form of insurance, and it is a \nform of health insurance. It is a form of insurance for workers on the \njob. We made reforms to that market in the last 20 years, including a \nredesigned public option that resulted in premium rates that are today \nless than half of what those rates were 20 years ago.\n  Let me repeat that. As a result of our reforms with a redesigned \npublic option in Oregon's workers' compensation market in the last 20 \nyears, it has resulted in premium rates today that are less than half \nof what they were 20 years ago. That is the result of introducing \ncompetition. That is the result of introducing choice.\n  The public option for workers' compensation was successful. It came \nunder fire from insurers who did not like competition. But it was our \nbusiness community that stepped up and saved it. Think how powerful it \nis for the success of a business to have good service and low premiums \non workers' compensation. Translate that: how important it is to the \nsuccess of our families to have good service and low premiums in their \nfamily health care premiums.\n  The public option in workers' compensation has been an economic \ndevelopment tool for the State of Oregon. During the last downturn, we \nrecruited Amy's Kitchen--an organic food producer--into southern Oregon \nbecause they could save $2 million a year in workers' compensation \nrates from the place they were formerly doing business.\n  Well, this is what we need to do with health care. We need to have \ncompetition in every corner of this country. We need to have choice in \nevery corner of this country. We need to empower consumers by giving \nthem a community health option or a public option.\n  Madam President, I am pleased to speak to the public option tonight, \nand I look forward to comments from my colleagues. I thank Senator \nBrown from Ohio.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Oregon. We will \nhear in a moment from Senator Stabenow, who is a member of the Finance \nCommittee, and who on that committee has been so active in helping \npreserve people's plans who have insurance who are satisfied with it, \nand building those consumer protections around those plans. She has \nalso been a strong advocate in the Finance Committee for the public \noption and all that comes with that.\n  I yield to Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I thank Senator Brown.\n  I want to thank my friend from Ohio--and before he leaves, my friend \nfrom Oregon as well. We are so proud and happy to have the Senator from \nOregon with us as one of our terrific Members, coming from being the \nspeaker of the house in Oregon, and leading on energy and being \npassionate on health care and jobs. It is just wonderful having the \nSenator with us. So we appreciate his advocacy on this important issue.\n  I want to thank my friend from Ohio. I think we have States that are \nmore alike than any two States I can think of in the Senate because of \nthe challenges that have undergone the auto industry and \nmanufacturing--the extent to which we understand that fair trade is \nimportant, that health care and jobs are critical. We also fight to \nprotect our Great Lakes. So we have many ways in which we are team \npartners in the Senate, and I want to thank the Senator from Ohio for \nhis leadership in bringing us together again to speak about a critical \npart of this health care reform effort.\n  I also want to recognize the Senator from New Mexico, whom I see on \nthe floor, whom we are very proud to have with us, as well, coming from \nthe House of Representatives, who has done such a wonderful job in \ntransitioning, hitting the ground running. And with the Presiding \nOfficer, the Senator from New Hampshire, who is presiding, we have a \nfantastic group\n\n[[Page S10291]]\n\nof Members who have joined us who are going to help us get health care \nreform done, as well as tackle energy and a number of different issues. \nSo it is a pleasure and honor to work with you.\n  As I speak about health care and the importance of having a public \ninsurance option, I first want to take just a moment to note another \nissue that is very much tied to health care but an action that was \ntaken a while ago--a very concerning action, again, where the Senate \nRepublican leadership chose to block us moving forward on the extension \nof unemployment insurance.\n  As our Presiding Officer from New Hampshire knows, having been a \nleader in bringing us together and putting forth a plan to be voted on, \nit was incredibly concerning to me that, in fact, the effort and the \nproposal to extend 14 weeks of benefits for all of the people in all of \nour States who are currently unemployed or who will soon be unemployed, \nwith an additional 6 weeks for States such as mine with the very \nhighest of unemployment levels, was blocked one more time on the Senate \nfloor. This is not what we ought to be doing.\n\n  When we look at what is happening in our State with about 15 percent \nunemployment, everyone understands the challenges we are going through. \nWe have people who want to work. They want to work. They are looking \nfor work. They may be piecing together income in a variety of ways. The \ndifference between their being able to keep a roof over their heads for \ntheir families and food on their tables right now has been the efforts \nof extending unemployment that we did with our great new President, \nPresident Obama, coming into office and making that a priority. We made \nit a priority in the Recovery Act. Now we are at a point where we need \nto extend that.\n  We expect in Michigan alone that 99,000 people will exhaust their \nunemployment benefits by the end of this year; tens of thousands of \npeople coming to the unemployment offices. So this is critical for us. \nWe are not going to go away. We are going to keep right back at it \nuntil we get this done.\n  The same thing is true with health care reform because there is a \ndirect relationship. As I start to speak about health care, I wish to \nsay one of the very positive things of the many positive things about \nthe legislation we will be voting on is that we want to strengthen it \nwith a strong public option. One of the very important pieces of this \nlegislation we worked on in the Finance Committee, and supported by the \nHELP Committee as well, creates a real safety net so if you lose your \njob, you don't lose your insurance. This is absolutely critical.\n  We are talking about extending unemployment benefits for people who \nhave been trying to find work and can't find work. Well, what we all \nknow is that when you lose that job, too many people also lose their \ninsurance. Then they lose the house. Then they lose whatever comes \nnext--the car or the kids can't go back to school. So it is all \nrelated. In our health care bill, we make sure there is a real safety \nnet and that people who lose their jobs know they will be able to have \ninsurance, and that is very important.\n  It is also critical, for people who are looking to purchase \ninsurance, that they can get the very best price. It is important that \npeople who have insurance can keep it; that they know what they are \npaying for they actually get, by the way, which is why the insurance \nreforms are so important; so you are not dropped right when you get \nsick or blocked from getting coverage. We know in order to create this \nnew pool for individuals and small businesses that can't find or afford \ninsurance that it is absolutely critical, if we are going to say \neverybody in the United States of America needs to have insurance, that \nit be affordable, that it be competitive in the marketplace, and that \npeople be able to have every choice possible available to them. That is \nwhat we are talking about tonight because, ultimately, this is about \nproviding real stability and security for American families.\n  I received a letter from a constituent of mine, Lynn, in Marshall, \nMI. She wrote:\n\n       In the space of two months, my husband's income was cut 25 \n     percent because of the economic downturn. At the same time, \n     our oldest son, 21 years old, was diagnosed with leukemia.\n\n  Every parent's worst nightmare.\n\n       To date his bills have totaled about $450,000 for \n     treatment. While we currently have insurance, I worry about \n     my son and how his ability to obtain adequate health care \n     will forever be affected by his illness. His leukemia has an \n     exceptionally high cure rate, but how will he afford his own \n     health insurance which will likely affect his ability to stay \n     healthy for the rest of his life. He is only 21 and on the \n     verge of graduating from college. Once he graduates, he will \n     lose his coverage under my husband's plan. His treatment \n     won't even be finished by the time he graduates. I lay awake \n     at night and worry how we will finish his treatment.\n\n  Lynn, everybody who has ever had a child worries about this kind of \nscenario and what could happen for their children. That is why we are \nhere tonight. In the richest country in the world, no parent should \nhave to lay awake at night worrying about how their son or daughter \nwould be able to find the health care they need.\n  In our reform in the Finance Committee, there is great news from part \nof what Lynn talked about, and that is we have extended health \ninsurance for young people on their parents' policies until age 26. \nThat is incredibly important and very positive. But when he then goes \ninto the marketplace to find insurance, will he be able to find \naffordable insurance in this new exchange we set up? The way to \nguarantee that happens is through a strong public option, a public \nchoice. You don't have to choose it. That is the great thing about \nAmerica. We are all about choices.\n  So we make sure there is a real competitor in the marketplace that is \npegged to the real costs of health care and that doesn't have to worry \nabout making a profit, that doesn't have to worry about marketing, that \ndoesn't have to worry about other costs, but strictly providing health \ncare and the costs of providing health care in the marketplace. Having \nthat kind of competitor will make sure everybody is honest about the \nreal costs associated with providing health care.\n  We know there are very powerful interest groups that have lined up to \nslow down or to stop this bill from passing, and they are bitterly \nopposed to a public insurance option. They know it will bring down \ncosts, it will hold insurance companies accountable, and will bring \ndown the overall costs for taxpayers because of what we are doing in \nhealth care reform, now and on into the future. We don't need to hear \nfrom more of those voices. We need to hear from our own constituents \nwho are struggling every day with the rising costs of health insurance.\n  That is why I created my online Health Care People's Lobby, so people \nin Michigan can have their voices heard. We have had over 7,000 people \nrespond. I am very grateful we have had hundreds of stories that have \nbeen shared with us. I am so grateful for all of those.\n  Lisa from Novi, MI, signed up for the People's Lobby, and she wrote:\n\n       I am one of the lucky ones. We have health insurance and \n     everyone is healthy. However, with just routine doctor \n     visits, the time spent deciphering bills and reconciling what \n     the insurance company paid and what we owe can be \n     overwhelming.\n\n  Haven't we all been through that?\n\n       Our insurance is a primary reason my husband has stayed \n     with his current employer at a lower salary, because most new \n     job opportunities don't offer coverage. I strongly believe \n     in a public option.\n\n  The reason we are here on health care reform and the reason we have a \nsense of urgency about it is because, as Lisa said, many new job \nopportunities don't provide health insurance, and we know we have to do \nbetter in this country. That is the point of creating a large pool for \npeople who can't find insurance, don't have it through their job, to be \nable to pool people together and have an insurance exchange. But as I \nsaid before, to make sure that works, to make sure it is really \naffordable for families and for small businesses, we need real \ncompetition of a public insurance option.\n  Another constituent, Glenn from Sterling Heights, is 62 years old. He \ngot laid off in December, and it doesn't look like he will be called \nback. He writes:\n\n       I am too young for Medicare. I have a preexisting \n     condition, so nobody wants to insure me. If I get sick before \n     I can get Medicare, my savings and everything will be wiped \n     out. This is not the way I pictured retirement was going to \n     be. I raised four children, got them through school, and \n     married. Paid taxes and did what I thought was right\n\n[[Page S10292]]\n\n     and moral things to do. I didn't create this mess, but I am \n     sure paying for it.\n\n  There are many people in Michigan in that very same situation that I \nam fighting for every day. In our insurance bill, first we have \npositive responses to this issue. We are going to stop the banning of \ninsurance because of preexisting conditions. That is extremely \nimportant. We have help in this bill for early retirees to make sure we \ncan help with the costs. But to make sure this whole system works \ntogether, we need a public insurance choice for Glenn so that if the \nother options don't work for him at 62 years old, he has a choice where \nhe can go to an option that is affordable and is focused totally on \nproviding health care for him. A public health option would give Glenn \nsome hope. It would give him security until he is able to get to \nMedicare, so that he wouldn't lose everything if he had a medical \ncrisis.\n  Glenn is not alone. We know 62 percent of bankruptcies occur because \nof the medical crisis. We know 5,000 people every day lose their homes \nto foreclosure because of the medical crisis.\n  I have literally received thousands of e-mails and stories from \npeople around Michigan, and I wish to thank everyone who has e-mailed \nme, who has shared their story. We have literally thousands of stories \nof people who have gone through so many different experiences of \nworrying about whether they are going to lose their insurance, trying \nto figure out how to pay for their insurance, not being able to find \ninsurance because of a preexisting condition, not being able to find \nsomething affordable as an individual going out into the marketplace. \nWe have heard thousands and thousands of stories from Michigan, and \nthey all say act now. Give us choice, real choice and competition.\n  We know having a public insurance option is the way we guarantee all \nof this fits together. So for my constituents--for Lynn, for her son, \nfor Lisa and Glenn, for the 11,000 others who have signed up for the \nPeople's Lobby--I urge all of my colleagues to join with us to make \nsure with all of the pieces we have put into these bills that are so \nimportant and so positive that we bring it all together by including a \npublic health insurance choice for people so that if the private, for-\nprofit companies in the exchange are not able to give people affordable \ninsurance, they know ultimately they can find it.\n  I thank you very much, Mr. President. I wish to thank my friend from \nOhio again for his passion and his time and efforts, and I yield the \nfloor back to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Thank you, Mr. President. I thank the Senator from \nMichigan for her steadfast leadership advocating for workers in \nMichigan and across the country.\n  We have been joined by Senator Udall of New Mexico, as well as \nSenator Whitehouse from Rhode Island, and Senator Sanders from Vermont. \nSenator Whitehouse and Senator Sanders played a role on the HELP \nCommittee to put this legislation together.\n  Before turning to Senator Udall, I wish to read another letter from \nPhil in Franklin County in central Ohio about his situation and then \ntalk to the Senator from New Mexico for a moment.\n  Phil writes:\n\n       When I was 8 years old, my father suffered a stroke despite \n     being a physically fit nonsmoker. Despite having employer-\n     based insurance, I still recall my mother in tears on the \n     phone with the insurance company arguing for something she \n     shouldn't have had to: That the insurance company cover the \n     care my father deserved and the care for which he paid.\n\n  In America, we are supposed to prize competition. It is the lack of \ncompetition that drives inefficiency in our health care system.\n  It has become clear that health insurers are either incapable or \nunwilling to reform themselves and control costs. Among the many \nreforms our system desperately needs, we need a public option to \npromote competition and keep private insurers honest.\n  We, your constituents, need help; we need you to represent us, not \nthe insurance companies. As consumers, the more choices we have, the \nbetter off we will be.\n  Phil understands this from his mother, who was pleading with the \ninsurance company to be fair and to live up to their side of the \nagreement. His father paid for insurance for years. He suffered a \ndebilitating stroke, and she had to push and push and push. With the \ncompetition that a public option would bring, those kinds of things \nwon't happen.\n  A moment ago, I was speaking with Senator Udall. We were talking \nabout competition. In my State, Ohio, one health insurer, WellPoint, \ncontrols 41 percent of the market. WellPoint and one other insurer \ncontrol nearly 60 percent of the market. We were looking at this map. \nOn this map, the dark purple illustrates those States where more than \n80 percent of the market is controlled by 2 companies. I am not a \nlawyer--and I am sure not an antitrust lawyer--but I know if 2 \ncompanies have 80 percent of the market, there are a lot of games being \nplayed.\n  When two companies have that percent of the market, you can see why \nthose CEO salaries I put up earlier are so high. Look at these \nsalaries. You can see what the CEO of Aetna makes, $24 million; Cigna, \n$12 million; and WellPoint, almost $10 million, in my State. In \nMontana, 2 companies have more than 80 percent of the market; North \nDakota, more than 80 percent of the market; Minnesota, more than 80 \npercent of the market. Two companies. In Iowa, 2 companies have more \nthan 80 percent of the market. The same is true in Arkansas, Alabama, \nAlaska, Hawaii, and Maine, 2 companies have more than 80 percent of the \nmarket. The lighter color on the chart--the medium color is where 2 \ncompanies have 70 to 80 percent of the market. No wonder these \ncompanies charge so much. No wonder insurance company salaries are so \nhigh. No wonder people are denied care and have nowhere to turn, \nbecause there isn't any real competition when you have 2 companies that \nhave 70, 75, 80, 90, or maybe 100 percent of the market.\n  In Senator Udall's State, which is not quite like mine, 2 companies \nhave only 50 to 70 percent. In Maine, it is 58 percent. I am not sure \nexactly what his State is. Even then, two companies have more than half \nthe market. Insurance prices in Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and Truth or \nConsequences--my favorite name of a town in New Mexico--are too high, \njust as they are in Lima, Findlay, Zanesville, and Cleveland, in Ohio; \nand the service those companies bring to customers isn't particularly \nhigh quality. Those customers are denied care because of preexisting \nconditions, because of discrimination, and because of annual caps and \nlifetime caps.\n  Again, I thank the Senator from New Mexico, Mr. Udall, for joining us \nto discuss some of these issues about his support for the public \noption.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for \nthose of us on the floor to be able to carry on a colloquy about a \npublic option.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I say to Senator Brown that \nthe number in New Mexico--the Senator from Ohio has a range on his \nchart, but the number in New Mexico is actually 2 companies controlling \n65 percent of the market. So we are talking about a situation that \nisn't very competitive. I think that is the bottom line of what we have \nbeen hearing.\n  We have had our colleague from Oregon, Senator Merkley, and we have \nhad Debbie Stabenow from Michigan, and other colleagues are here on the \nfloor, speaking to that situation in their States, and why we should \nproceed with a public option.\n  Let me first say to the Senator from Ohio, I appreciate his \nleadership. I know he was on the HELP Committee, which is the one that \nwrote the public option we have the opportunity to put in the final \nlegislation. He was on the committee. Some of us are getting into \nwriting the legislation now. But one of the best public options out \nthere is the one that came out of Senator Kennedy's committee. It has \nbeen passed for a couple of months. It is sitting right there ready to \ngo, if we just put it in.\n  When we talk about a public option, what exactly are we talking \nabout? I think people have a right to know a little bit about what we \nare talking about when we say public option. I think if I outline that \na little bit, people will see\n\n[[Page S10293]]\n\nwhy it is so important to have a public option, so let me give a little \nbit of an outline.\n  First, it would be voluntary. We are not forcing anybody to get into \nit. We are talking about a voluntary system. So you would have a choice \nto get into it, based on whether it would fit your particular \ncircumstances.\n  The public option would not be subsidized by the government. It would \nbe fully financed by premiums. So this would be something where people \nwould be paying premiums, the premiums would come in, and we wouldn't \nbe adding to the deficit. We would be creating a good, solid insurance \nsituation and insuring people.\n  We have heard, as Senator Brown has talked about here--he put up a \nchart about these incredible salaries. One of the things a public \noption would do is you won't make profit for the shareholders. You have \nthe opportunity to take those premiums and put them all back into \nhealth care. So that, once again, is something that is very important.\n  Let's look here at this chart Senator Brown has loaned me. Look at \nthe total compensation for CEOs of major health insurance companies in \n2008: Aetna, $24.3 million; Cigna; WellPoint; Coventry--look at these \nsalaries. There is a total, for these 8 or 10 companies, of $85 million \nin salaries.\n  What we are talking about is money being spent on health care for \npeople through a public option. One of the other things that I think \nwould be a hallmark of a public option would be having low \nadministrative costs, since it operates on a nonprofit basis. One of \nthe things you should know about these insurance companies where you \nhave these CEOs working is that they have administrative costs in the \nrange we have heard about, 30 percent administrative costs. So what \nhappens here is that the money comes in on the premiums, but they spend \nan incredible amount of time going back and forth denying claims, \ntelling doctors they should not put that in, they are not going to \ncover it, and it builds up into a big administrative cost.\n  The great thing about a public option is you don't have high \nadministrative costs. One of the comparisons there, as Senator Brown \nand Senator Sanders know, is that I think Medicare has 3 percent \nadministrative costs. Here you have a comparison of 30 percent to 3 \npercent.\n\n  One of the other parts of a public option I think makes a difference \nis exerting bargaining power to obtain discounts from providers. That \ncould make a big difference with the public option operating out there. \nWe would offer savings to subscribers with lower premiums. We should \nfollow the same insurance requirements as private plans. What we would \noffer, through a public option, would be low cost and high value.\n  Basically, what we are talking about here is keeping insurance \ncompanies honest, driving the costs down, and having a competitive \nmarket.\n  Senator Sanders well knows that the situation right now isn't serving \nthe American people. I know he wants to comment on his situation in \nVermont and what's going on there.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I do. I thank the Senator from New Mexico for his \nremarks and Senator Brown for his leadership efforts here. I will say a \nfew words.\n  If anyone in America does not understand what the function of a \nhealth insurance company is, let me give you the bad news. If you think \nthe function is to provide health insurance for people, sorry, you are \nwrong. The function of a health insurance company is to make as much \nmoney as it possibly can. Do you know what. They do that very well. We \nhave to acknowledge that. Insurers have increased premiums 87 percent \nover the past 6 years. Premiums have doubled in the last 9 years, \nincreasing four times faster than wages.\n  Profit at 10 of the country's largest publicly traded health \ninsurance companies in 2007 rose 428 percent from the year 2000 to \n2007, from $2.4 billion to $12.9 billion, according to the U.S. \nSecurities and Exchange Commission.\n  What we are seeing is that people are thrown off of health insurance \nbecause they committed the crime of getting sick, and they cannot get \nhealth insurance because of preexisting conditions. Well, that is the \nbad news. The good news is that CEO salaries are very high, and profits \nare doing very well.\n  At the very least--and I speak as somebody who believes in a \nMedicare-for-all, single-payer system--this country deserves a strong \npublic option to give people the choice about whether they want a \nprivate insurance company.\n  With that, I yield back my time.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nVermont.\n  I want to also yield to a Senator here and give him the floor--with \nSenator Brown's permission. Sheldon Whitehouse, from the great State of \nRhode Island, I believe was also on the committee and was intimately \nworking through the bill. It is wonderful to have him here with our \ncolleagues talking about the idea that we have to have a public option.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I thank the Senator. I had the real pleasure and \nhonor, along with Senator Brown, of being among the principal draftsmen \nof the public option in the HELP Committee. When I think back on the \neffort we put into it, and the plan we came up with, it is astonishing \nto me that it is now the public option that appears to be the most \ncontentious part of the American health care debate right now, because \nthe bill we passed out of the HELP Committee in July was very \nthoughtful. It includes a community health insurance option--a national \nplan, administered by the Secretary of the Department of Health and \nHuman Services. It will be available in every State and territory. It \nwould offer benefits that are as good as those available through the \nprivate insurance plans, or better. The Secretary would negotiate \nprovider payment rates to encourage doctors and hospitals to \nparticipate. Americans who need financial help to participate in the \npublic option would get it. And local advisory councils would assure \nthat the public option was sensitive to local conditions and local \nneeds.\n  To be clear, this plan includes no mandate for doctors to \nparticipate, no rate setting by the Secretary, no requirement that any \nAmerican buy a public option policy, and absolutely no direct link to \nthe Federal Treasury. Other than the initial capitalization, this plan \nwould operate solely on premium revenue--a completely self-sufficient \nfinancial model. It would have absolutely no baseline advantage over \nprivate insurance companies. The HELP Committee got here by approving a \nnumber of amendments by our friend from North Carolina, Senator Burr, \nto make sure of this.\n  Because this version of the public option was so sensitive to these \nconcerns from across the ideological spectrum, the House Blue Dogs, \nmoderates in the House, used a number of our provisions in the House \nbill to gain moderate support. In fact, the community health insurance \noption makes so much sense that Republicans have had to resort to \nillogical arguments to justify their opposition.\n  For example, they argue that the government should not be in the \nbusiness of providing health insurance, that it is a slippery slope to \nsocialized medicine. Well, hello, government-sponsored health insurance \nserves nearly half of Americans--78 million Americans--who are enrolled \nin Medicare, Medicaid, TRICARE, VA, and they get benefits from the \nFederal Employee Health Benefits Program, and so forth. We don't hear \nour colleagues on the other side talking about ending Medicare, closing \nup the trust fund, throwing our parents and grandparents out to the \ntender mercies of the private insurance companies. We don't hear that. \nI have not heard one Republican say they want to deny our Iraq and \nAfghanistan veterans all the Federal medical care they need when they \ncome home. I don't see Republican Members of Congress opting out in \ndroves or criticizing the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program.\n  Why? Because these programs work, because Americans rely on them, \nbecause they provide dignity and stability in the lives of millions of \nAmerican families and they have not led to a government takeover of our \nentire health care system. Indeed, ironically, the very best program is \nprobably the VA program where the level of government involvement is \nthe highest, where they own the hospitals and where they employ the \ndoctors.\n  Republicans have also been arguing that government involvement in the\n\n[[Page S10294]]\n\nprivate health insurance market will be uncompetitive and will push \nprivate companies out of business. We see the government competing \ncompetitively in a variety of markets in this country--private versus \npublic universities, private versus government student loans, workers' \ncompensation insurance, the Postal Service versus UPS and FedEx. The \nexistence of public options in these markets has not swallowed up \nprivate industry. What it has done is broadened the market and enhanced \nthe variety of competition consumers enjoy. Think how many people in \nAmerica right now have a higher education because a State university \nwas there as an affordable option, an alternative to private colleges.\n  Similarly, a public insurance option adds choice for consumers and \nadds competition in the market, and it gives private insurers a strong \nincentive to behave fairly and to keep their costs down. In fact, if \none thinks about it, there is hardly an industry in this country where \nthe big players are so far from being pushed out of the market. In \nfact, if you ask me, the for-profit health insurance industry has been \ndoing the pushing--pushing the American people around--for far too \nlong.\n  Let me give one example from my home State of Rhode Island. Two years \nago, United Health Care of Rhode Island proposed to send $37 million in \nexcess profits to its parent company, United Health Group, hundreds of \nmiles away instead of investing that $37 million back into the system. \nThat is $37 million in 1 year out of a State of only 1 million people \nin which this company only had a 16-percent market share. With a public \noption, that $37 million would have gone back into improving the health \ncare infrastructure in Rhode Island, into lowering premiums, into \nincreasing provider payments, into investing in our health information \nand chronic care sustainability projects and helping doctors buy \nelectronic health records and supporting our Rhode Island Quality \nInstitute. But no. And this after United had already sent $16.5 million \nout of our State in 2004, $13.4 million out of our State in 2005, and \n$17.1 million out of our State in 2006.\n  Competition is supposed to lower prices for consumers, create demand \nfor a better product, and push bad actors out of the marketplace. I \ndon't see that in the health insurance market. I see 10 States with the \ntwo largest health insurance companies controlling over 80 percent of \nthe market. I see a 120-percent increase in premiums from 1999 to 2007, \nwhile wages only went up 29 percent. I see a 109-percent increase in \nadministrative costs from 2000 to 2006--a 109-percent increase--as \ninsurers increasingly game the system rather than competing on better \nquality of care, better health, and lower cost.\n  As I have traveled around Rhode Island, I have seen how these \ncircumstances work out for individual Rhode Islanders.\n  David, a self-employed resident in Central Falls, described the \nastronomical rise in the cost of health insurance for him and his wife. \nYears ago, he paid $85 a month for his plan. Today, it is $19,000 for \ntheir annual health insurance. Despite the dramatic jump in price, the \nhealth insurance does not cover as much as it used to. David has been \nforced to drop dental coverage and increase the out-of-pocket expenses \nhe and his wife pay on their plan.\n  He wrote to me:\n\n       I'm almost afraid to get sick because today's health plans \n     have so many holes in them they can nickel and dime you to \n     death.\n\n  Charlotte is a self-employed consultant from Providence. She wrote to \nshare the difficulties she has faced as health insurance became the \nsingle largest expense for her company. She buys one of the least \nexpensive plans she can through a small business alliance, but the \npremium for her current coverage increased by 35.6 percent--more than a \nthird--just this past year, it is covering fewer and fewer tests and \nprocedures, and she has to pay more out of pocket for needed medical \ntreatments. She wrote to me that we needed to move forward on health \ncare reform because `the cost of health care is pulling the plug on my \nlivelihood.'\n  For these Rhode Islanders and for millions more, there has to be a \nbetter way. There has to be a new challenge in this marketplace, a new \nbusiness model, a new entrant to change the landscape of competition. \nInstead of competing to lure the healthiest patients, plans should have \nto compete on quality. Instead of developing a better claims denial \nprocedure, plans should have to develop a better customer service \ndepartment. Instead of paying executives tens of millions of dollars \nper year, they should make sure working-class Americans can afford safe \nand secure health coverage.\n  Need I remind us that our health care system is teetering on the edge \nof collapse and the status quo is not sustainable. Over 80 million \nAmericans were uninsured at some point during 2007 and 2008. As many as \n100,000 Americans are killed every year by unnecessary and preventable \nmedical errors. Life expectancy, obesity rates, and infant mortality \nrates are embarrassing by most international measures. The annual cost \nof our system is closing in on $3 trillion and is expected soon to \ndouble. We spend more of our GDP on health care than any other \nindustrialized country, double the European Union average. More \nAmerican families are bankrupted by health care costs than any other \ncause. There is more health care than steel in Ford cars. There is more \nhealth care than coffee in Starbucks coffee. It is out of control.\n  We have two choices: We can derail and delay this debate until \nunpalatable solutions, such as throwing people off Medicare, \ndrastically cutting coverage, or paying doctors much less, are our only \nremaining options or we can do what Americans have always done when \nfaced with a tremendous challenge, and that is to innovate our way out.\n  Government is not the enemy in this undertaking. Americans, with a \nhelping hand from their government, have done great things time and \ntime again. We put a man on the Moon and an explorer on Mars. We built \na Peace Corps and the Marine Corps. We virtually eliminated polio and \nsmallpox. We built the National Institutes of Health and the Federal \nHighway System. We have mapped the human genome. Government helped \nthen, and it can help now through an innovative public plan.\n\n  Let me make one last point. My Republican colleagues have argued that \na public option would drown out private competition and amount to a \ngovernment takeover. In many places from which they made that argument, \nthe facts at home disprove that contention. Twenty-five States actually \nprovide health insurance benefits through public plans. They actually \nprovide health insurance benefits through public plans in their \nworkers' compensation systems.\n  For example, Kentucky, represented so ably by our distinguished \nminority leader, is home to Kentucky Employers Mutual Insurance, a \nState-run public fund which has operated in the State since 1995 and \nnow provides health insurance benefits to 24 percent of the workers' \ncompensation market in a competitive market.\n  In Wyoming, the home State of the ranking member of the HELP \nCommittee, Wyoming's Worker Safety and Compensation Division delivers \nall the health care in the workers' compensation system. They have a \nsingle-payer public plan. There has been concern expressed that a \ngovernment plan will give terrible customer service. I doubt that the \nWyoming plan would last very long if it gave terrible customer service.\n  In Arizona, so ably represented in this Chamber by Senators McCain \nand Kyl, since 1925 SCF Arizona has provided health insurance benefits \nthrough the workers' compensation system, and it now has a 56-percent \nmarket share in a competitive market environment. To those who have \nsaid you cannot have a government plan because it will necessarily \ncrowd out private insurance by virtue of an unfair competitive \nadvantage, Arizona belies that argument. It has been that way for 80 \nyears, since 1925.\n  To my knowledge, those who criticize the idea of a Federal public \noption for health insurance have not criticized the role--often a \ndecades-old one--of public insurance plans in their own States' \nworkers' compensation insurance markets.\n  We have in front of us an opportunity for a new day in the American \nhealth care system where affordable, quality health care is available \nfor everyone; where doctors and hospitals are paid for value, not \nvolume; where you cannot lose coverage because of an illness\n\n[[Page S10295]]\n\nor preexisting condition; where insurance company bureaucrats do not \ncome between you and your doctor; where care is not rationed by your \nfamily's ability to pay; where every American gets the best health care \nthe country's medical system has to offer.\n  I support the public option because I see that vision for the future, \nand I think a public option can get us there. I also see this lesson of \nthe past: that an industry--the private insurance industry--that has \nput its own financial welfare in front of the physical and mental \nhealth of its customers for years, over and over again, cannot now be \ntrusted on its own to lead us into that future, not without a push in \nthe marketplace, not without the kind of push in the marketplace a \npublic option will give.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator. I was intrigued by \nmuch of what he said.\n  We are also joined on the floor now by Senator Bennet from Colorado, \nand Senator Casey and Senator Udall are still with us.\n  When the Senator from Rhode Island talked about the Rhode Island \nexperience, I remember while we were drafting the public option \nlanguage in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on \nwhich Senator Casey and now Senator Bennet sit, the Senator talked \nabout what a disaster Rhode Island's workers' compensation system was \nbecause of the corruption in private insurance and the high costs and \nthat the Senator from Rhode Island introduced a public option into \nprivate insurance there. Many States--I believe roughly half the \nStates--have a public option as Rhode Island does and the experience of \nthe Senator from Rhode Island with bringing in this competition.\n  My understanding--and correct me if I am wrong--is that the public \noption not only made private insurance operate more efficiently and \nmade private insurance more honest, if you will, and helped to sort of \nflush the corruption out, but I would guess competition from the \nprivate insurance industry made the public system a little bit more \nnimble, too, right?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. We actually pretty much had a complete meltdown in \nthe private insurance market, so we had to put in a public option to \nprovide any workers' compensation insurance. But the private insurance \ncompanies had written off our marketplace because their business model \nwas impossible to maintain for any reasonable cost. We knew that with \ngood reform in the system and with a public option to implement that \nreform, we could reduce those costs.\n  What has happened is two things. It used to cost $3.93 for 100 hours \nof payroll for workers' compensation, the year after this went through \nand got stood up. Today, it is $1.74. It is more than 50 percent \ncheaper in Rhode Island. The model that was set by the public option, a \nnew business model that focused on prevention, on getting people back \nto work, on better quality medical care, has actually attracted the \nprivate industry back into the market.\n  Mr. BROWN. So the private companies are making money.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. They are back in and making more with the leadership \nof the public option.\n  Mr. BROWN. A lot more honest and a lot more efficient.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. And they improved their business model, so they are \nnow delivering better quality care, getting people back to work sooner, \nreducing medical costs by getting people back to work, and providing \nbetter quality care. It has been a very successful story from a cost \npoint of view.\n  It used to be the worst issue for the Rhode Island business \ncommunity. They were nuts about workers' compensation. We literally had \ntorch-lit parades, and nobody has heard about the issue in a decade \nbecause the public option has led the way.\n  If you think the business community is scared about a public option, \ngo to a State where there is a workers' compensation public option. I \nthink you will find they support it.\n  Mr. BROWN. I think we can safely predict that 10 years after the \nPresident signs a good health care reform bill in November or December \nwhich has a strong public option similar to the language our Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee drafted and the House Energy \nand Commerce Committee passed, we will see the same kind of thing; we \nwill see a more efficient but still profitable health insurance \nindustry, with a public option disciplining the market and keeping \nprices in check. We no longer will have people denied care because they \nhave a preexisting condition or denied care because of an annual limit \nor a lifetime limit on coverage. We will no longer see the kind of \ndiscrimination in the marketplace we have seen from all of these \nprivate companies.\n  Before turning to Senator Casey, who has brought the bill to the \nfloor with him tonight to talk about the legislation itself which he \nhelped draft in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, I \nwant to mention that today we submitted a letter to Majority Leader \nReid that pretty much all of us on the floor signed. Some 30 Senators \nsigned a letter to him today calling on him to support the public \noption and putting that on the bill when we bring the bill to the floor \nin the next couple of weeks.\n  Again, before turning to Senator Casey, I wanted to read another \nbrief letter I received from Ohio--Kathy from Medina. Kathy writes:\n\n       I own a small business with three employees. With the \n     current economy, I can no longer make payments on our health \n     plan. We were paying $2,000 a month for our plans and were \n     told we needed at least 10 workers to negotiate a more \n     affordable plan. After dropping our plan, I had to see a \n     doctor because I had difficulty breathing. I now have to see \n     a cardiologist and endocrinologist. I am still in shock at \n     how quickly my health turned into a serious condition. In \n     just a month's time, I have almost $7,000 in medical bills \n     and I still have further tests and treatment ahead. Unless \n     there is health reform, I will be just another 55 and over \n     American not taking my meds or seeing a specialist when I \n     should because of the high medical bills. It's been upsetting \n     just being seriously ill, let alone facing financial \n     hardship.\n\n  I am certainly not a doctor, and I don't know Kathy except through \nthis letter, but you have to figure the anxiety of figuring out her \nbusiness and trying to manage her health insurance; going without \nhealth insurance and her fears are probably making her health and her \nsituation worse. That is why Senator Casey worked on helping us write \nthe legislation on what you do to give incentives to small business \nowners to buy insurance, understanding this whole bill will mean that \neverybody has insurance and so those with insurance no longer will have \nto subsidize--a tax, really, at $1,000 a year--all those uninsured.\n  Everyone who pays insurance pays about $1,000 a year more for their \ninsurance to compensate for those who go to emergency rooms without \ninsurance and go to doctors and don't pay. They have to recapture that \nmoney from somewhere, and it comes from all those who have health \ninsurance. That is one of the most important parts of this bill, to get \nat the cost.\n  Senator Casey.\n  Mr. CASEY. I wish to, first, thank Senator Brown for keeping us \norganized and focused on this issue. When we went through the work of \nour committee this summer--some 60 hours of hearings and many hours \nprior to that walking through the bill--there came a point in time when \nwe realized that if we were going to be strong supporters--and we were \nand still are--of the public option, we needed to define it, we needed \nto make it readable and understandable to people, and also we needed to \nfully articulate what it means to have a public option.\n  A number of people went to work on that--and the two principals of \nthat are with us tonight: Senator Brown and Senator Whitehouse--\nspending hours and hours trying to get this right. Contrary to what we \nhave seen in some of the debates and some of the coverage of this \nissue, this is not very mysterious and it is not theoretical. If you \nlook at the bill--and I will get to sections of the bill in a second--\nthis is meant to be a choice for people. It is voluntary. It is the \nfirst word of the section--and I will go through that in a moment.\n  What we did today, when we sent the letter to the majority leader \nthat Senator Brown referred to, we outlined very succinctly what this \nis all about. Let me read two or three sentences from the letter we \nsent today. In the second paragraph, we say:\n\n       Without a not-for-profit public insurance alternative that \n     competes with these insurers based upon premium rates and \n     quality,\n\n[[Page S10296]]\n\n     insurers will have free rein to increase insurance premiums \n     and drive up the cost of Federal subsidies tied to those \n     premiums.\n\n  In other words, unless we have some competition, the insurance \ncompanies have free rein to keep jacking up prices. That is what we are \nliving through right now. That is what virtually every American has a \nconcern about. We have a concern about cost. If we don't have \ncompetition for insurance companies, they will have that free rein to \nkeep driving up cost.\n  What is wrong with competition? I thought that was the American way. \nBut I think some people have lost their way in part of this debate. \nCompetition and choice, that is what this public option is all about.\n  Later in the letter we say this:\n\n       It is possible to create a public health insurance option \n     that is modeled after private insurance--rates are negotiated \n     and providers are not required to participate in the plan.\n\n  Very simple. Part of this legislation has features to it that are \nvery similar to Medicare--a public insurance program that has worked \nreal well for generations of Americans. But it will also have some of \nthe requirements that insurance companies have to live by. Let me go \nthrough a couple of those.\n  First of all, a public option, in terms of the process starting, \nwould have to get government funding to start. In the way of resources, \nthe government would pay for the first 3 months of claims as a way to \ncapitalize it initially, but then it has to pay back any kind of \ncapitalization over a 10-year time period.\n  What we are talking about is a program, State by State, that would be \nself-sufficient. It is very important for people to understand that. \nThis would be self-sufficient. Senator Whitehouse talked about this a \nmoment ago, and it needs repetition and reiteration. It would follow \nthe same rules as private plans by defining benefits, by protecting \nconsumers--we hope any entity would do that--finally, by setting \npremiums that are fair based upon local costs.\n  So this isn't some theory. This isn't some idea we don't know how it \nwill work. We know exactly, and the American people know exactly, how \nthis will work because we understand what it is like to deal with a \nsystem where the insurance companies have virtually unlimited power to \ndeny you coverage if you have a preexisting condition, for example. The \nbill also makes that illegal under the bill we passed in the HELP \nCommittee this summer. But also, insurance companies right now have \nfree rein to jack up their prices.\n  I know there are some State-by-State limitations on that, but mostly \nfree rein exists to do whatever they want. Without a public option, \nthat is what we will have going forward. So if you like costs going up, \nthen you should be against our proposal because costs going up is what \nwe are going to have more and more of if we don't have a public option.\n  One of the important features is that there be State advisory \ncouncils--councils set up in each State, made up of providers and \nconsumers to recommend strategies for quality improvement. So this \nisn't going to be some Washington control here. You are going to have \nlots and lots of accountability at the State level, and States would \nshare in the savings that result from that kind of accountability.\n\n  Finally, the notion it is a voluntary program. The providers would \nhave a choice of participating in the public option and there would be \nno obligation to do so. I point to the bill for this reason. When we \nwere in our States this summer, I remember going back to Pennsylvania \nand reading about Senator Brown's public forum in the State of Ohio and \nI was reading about others as well and learning about what was \nhappening in other States. We had our public forums. I spoke to \nthousands of people over the course of a couple weeks.\n  One of the things I would say to the audience when we had our public \nforums is, Look, if you walked in here today and you don't support the \npublic option, I ask you to do one thing: Read the bill. Well, the \nfinal version of the HELP Committee bill that I am holding right here \nwas 839 pages. I wasn't asking them to read every page, but what I said \nto them was: If you don't support the public option, just read that \nsection, which is right now 19 pages in the bill. Section 3106, \nCommunity Health Insurance Option. In the bill, it is from page 110 to \n129. So it is 19 pages in the bill. I said: Look, spend some time \ntaking a look at it.\n  I remember at the one public forum, someone who disagreed with my \npoint of view on the public option went at me verbally and said: You \nare going to force people to go into these public options. I said: That \nis not true. Of course, saying it doesn't always end the argument. So, \nthen, I would hold up the bill and I would say: Let's go to section \n3106, and I would read from section 3106--I know the camera can't see \nthis--subsection (a). The first two words of this section--other than \nthe heading of it--are ``voluntary nature.'' That is the subheading. So \nI would read part of that section and say: This is voluntary. Voluntary \nfor any American who goes into the exchange and may decide they want to \nstay with their own private insurance coverage or may want another--a \ndifferent--choice. So they can choose this.\n  It was important for people to understand that in a long bill we at \nleast spent 19 pages to get this right.\n  There is a solvency standard in here, for example. This isn't some \ntheory we dreamed up in Washington. We know solvency is important; that \na program such as this, in an option such as this, has to meet basic \nsolvency standards. Senator Whitehouse spent some time talking about \nthat and helping Senator Brown and others craft that, along with \nSenator Udall, who is with us here tonight. It is voluntary. It has to \nbe self-sufficient.\n  There is even an audit section. If you want to get into the detail, \nthere is even an audit section. So that when you have administrators, \nthere is a measure of accountability, in terms of auditing.\n  There are a lot of parts to this that we could go through. The \nimportant point, though, is that unless we inject some choice into this \nand some competition, I am not sure the American people will believe we \nhave done our job. We have said over and over again that among the \nbasic elements of any final health care bill is that we have to have a \ntotal commitment to prevention, so we can prevent disease and \nconditions from leading to bad results for an individual and their \nfamily, and prevention will also help us save money at the same time; \nthat any health care bill would have to have choices. If someone wanted \nto stay with their private coverage, they could do that, but if they \nwanted other options, we are trying to give them a public option; that \nany kind of health care reform would have to have quality standards. \nThis will help ensure more quality standards in our system. So I don't \nbelieve we can get to where we want to get to in the end unless we have \na public option.\n  Let me make two or three more points, and then I wish to have my \ncolleagues rejoin this discussion and also talk about what we are \ntrying to do. There are a lot of discussions--and I know my colleagues \nsaw these in these public forums where we would have someone stand and \nsay: I don't like a government program or I don't like government in \nour health care, as if we have a system now that is 99 to 1--99 percent \nprivate and 1 percent public. I would remind them--and these are some \noverall numbers, but it is important to remember--that we have a \nMedicaid Program right now that at last count had over 60 million \npeople in it--60 million Americans. We have a Medicare Program with \nabout 45 million Americans. Then you go to VA health care, and at last \ncount it has 7.8 million Americans.\n  So when you go down the list of programs right now that are \ngovernment-run programs for health care, you get a large number of \nAmericans--well over 100 million Americans--and their families who \nbenefit from those programs, and you get a commitment from the Federal \nGovernment year in and year out to make sure we have that kind of \ncoverage for those who happen to be poor, those who happen to have \nparticular health care challenges, those who happen to be over the age \nof 65, those who happen to be veterans and who need health care \ncoverage. So we have an American system right now that has a lot of \nprivate coverage, but there is a lot of coverage through government \nprograms that even people who oppose some parts of this bill, the last \ntime I checked, don't want to repeal. I haven't found anyone who wants\n\n[[Page S10297]]\n\nto repeal VA health care or who wants to repeal Medicare.\n  I think we have a system right now that is not working in large \nmeasure, but there are some things that are working well. We are trying \nto improve both ends of this, the public health care end of this and \nthe private health care part of our system.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CASEY. Sure.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. With respect to your observation that we don't see a \nlot of outcry about ending Medicare, about ending VA health care, and \nother government programs, Senator Brown has been remarkable about \ncoming to the floor regularly to read the true-life horror stories that \nour present health care system inflicts on Americans and American \nfamilies across the board. I have brought a great many Rhode Island \nstories to the floor. We all have this experience.\n  I am interested in the evaluation the Senator from Pennsylvania might \nmake in terms of his own experience and his own constituent contacts in \nterms of those heartbreaking stories you get. Do you hear a lot of \nheartbreaking stories from people in Medicare; people being thrown off \nfor preexisting conditions? Where in your experience have the real \nheartbreaking stories come from in Pennsylvania?\n  Mr. CASEY. I will give you an example. In our State, just in terms of \nage categories, we have, in terms of children up to the age of 18--we \nhave a 5-percent uninsured rate. It is still too high. Until it gets to \nzero, we have not done enough, but that number is way down. So we have \na diminishing number of children who are uninsured largely because of \nefforts and initiatives such as the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. Then, on the other end, those who are over the age of 65, they \nhave Medicare.\n  Where I am getting the real-life stories from people, people who send \ne-mails to our office just like to Senator Whitehouse, or people who do \nit the old-fashioned way, who actually write a letter or people you see \nin a public forum or on the street--they are coming to us in that age \ncategory, 19 to 64. In our State, that number of uninsured is 12 \npercent, more than double the number of uninsured children.\n  For example, I got a letter in February from Trisha Urban from the \neastern end of our State near Reading in Berks County. Here was her \nstory in summary.\n  She was working; her husband was working. But he was trying to \nadvance, as we always tell people we want them to get more education. \nSo he was trying to finish his doctorate. In order to finish that he \nhad to take an internship. The internship did not have health insurance \ncoverage. The coverage they had, ultimately they lost.\n  Here is Trisha Urban who was working, and her husband was working as \nwell. She was working four different jobs. They lost coverage and then \nthey started to run up bills. Then she became pregnant. While she was \npregnant, her husband, who had a heart problem, missed an appointment \nbecause they were worried about paying for the doctor visit for her \npregnancy and also worried about the doctor visit for his heart \nailment. So he skipped his appointment because of his heart problems.\n  Time goes by, a couple of weeks go by, and all of a sudden her water \nbroke. She was preparing to go to the hospital in a couple of hours, \nher husband went out and did a few errands, came back to the house, and \nas she was walking out of the house to go into the driveway to join him \nin the car to go to the hospital to deliver her baby, she looked in the \ndriveway, and her husband is on the pavement of the driveway dead \nbecause of his heart condition, a preexisting condition which, thank \nGod, in our bill, in the first section of our bill, we make illegal. It \nshould have been illegal a long time ago. I still find it hard to \nbelieve that we live in a country where we have allowed insurance \ncompanies to do that to people.\n  She went out and found her husband dead. An ambulance came to take \nher to the hospital to deliver her baby, and the other ambulance came \nto pick up her husband.\n  That is the kind of story we hear in Pennsylvania and across the \ncountry because of our system. There is no reason we should tolerate \nthis and let it go on any longer. We have a chance to change it.\n  One of the ways to move it forward is by making sure we have choices \nand competition in a public option.\n  Mr. BROWN. Could I ask Senator Casey a question? I thank him for that \nstory. Of these stories of people in private insurance, that is as \ntragic a story as you will ever hear. We have these letters I have read \nand these stories from Senator Whitehouse, Senator Bennet, Senator \nUdall, who have come to the floor and read these letters from people \nwho thought they had pretty good insurance and something happened and \nthey lost it because they have gotten too sick or they lost their job \nand they can't afford COBRA and all that.\n  I want to ask the Senator a question. You mentioned early in your \ncomments about the costs going up. I want to put this chart up and ask \nabout this. Senator Bennet from Colorado will speak in a moment. These \nare costs under Medicare Advantage. The government, as you know, \nprovides, in large part because of insurance company lobbying, plain \nand simple--the government provides all kinds of subsidies to Medicare \nAdvantage plans.\n  These are not most of the Medicare beneficiaries. Most Medicare \nbeneficiaries, 75 to 80 percent of them, are in what is called regular \nfee-for-service Medicare. Some are in a more privatized Medicare. The \ngovernment writes checks to insurance companies. You can see how \ninsurance companies have extracted more and more taxpayer dollars as \ntheir salaries have jumped and jumped. The poster that Senator Udall \nwas showing, that I showed earlier, the executive salaries of Cigna and \nAetna and these companies have gone into the tens of millions of \ndollars, in some cases. These subsidies--in 2004 they got $4 billion; \nby 2005, $5 billion. Now the insurance companies basically get a check \nfrom the Federal Government for $11 billion.\n  Talk for a moment, if you would, Senator Casey, about what if the \npublic option is competing with these insurance companies. What will it \ndo to these costs as these insurance companies continue to extract more \nand more money, with their lobbyists, from the government, as they have \ntried to privatize Medicare?\n  The public option, talk about what it would do about cutting costs so \npeople like your friend in eastern Pennsylvania--those kinds of things \ndon't happen to them.\n  Mr. CASEY. I think it stands to reason if you have, as we do in a lot \nof States, one or two or a very small number of insurance companies \nthat dominate the marketplace, sometimes a lot more than 50 percent of \nthe marketplace but in other cases--in our State we have two that have \ncontrol over at least half of the marketplace. That alone is bad \nenough.\n  Mr. BROWN. In this poster--we talked about it earlier; Senator Udall \nmentioned it too--some States, yours and mine are a little bit better. \nIn some States--Montana, Alaska, Hawaii--lets go down to Minnesota, \nIowa, Arkansas, Alabama, Maine--two companies have more than 80 percent \nof the market. Two companies control 80 percent of the market, which \nmeans there is no price competition. In some States it is 70 to 80 \npercent, in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island--I am sorry Rhode Island \nhas two companies more than 80 percent also. In all, about almost 10 \nStates.\n  But in our States--Pennsylvania, Ohio--large States, States with \npopulations over 10 million people, each of those has more than 50 \npercent. In my State one company has 41 percent; the two largest \ncompanies have 58 percent. In Pennsylvania, two companies also have \nmore than 50 percent.\n  Mr. CASEY. It just stands to reason. If you don't have competition, \nyou have no incentive, no pressure to keep your rates at an affordable \nlevel. I do not understand why anyone, in the midst of this debate, is \nagainst choice and competition. Both are the central pillars of why we \nneed a public option. What do we do for our health care system? I don't \nunderstand the logic.\n  One point we should make, and we address it in the bill--we will not \nspend a lot of time on it--we should all remember, you look around, we \nhave 100 Senators. Everyone in the Senate, and all of our families, \neverybody in the House, and then you add other millions\n\n[[Page S10298]]\n\nof Federal employees, we have a pretty good deal because we have a \nsystem where, as I look at some of the features of the public option, \nwe have a pooled purchasing power.\n  If you have millions of Federal employees and their families who are \nin the same pool, that brings costs down. We are trying to get more and \nmore Americans the same opportunities we have, to be in a pool that big \nand to keep costs down. For the life of me I cannot understand why \nsomeone would not like that, especially people who benefit from it and \ntheir families who benefit from what the Senate gets.\n  I have been blessed to have that kind of coverage because I happen to \nbe in the Senate. But every seat here, and then add millions more \nFederal employees, gets this opportunity because we are in a large \npurchasing pool. I don't know why a small business owner should not get \nthe same opportunity, a business owner paying through the nose.\n  I know Senator Brown has seen this in the State of Ohio. You have \nheard from small business owners, time and again, haven't you, about \nwhat they are paying every day? What we are saying is, if it works for \nand if it is good enough for Federal employees to get the lower cost/\nbenefit of a large and open purchasing pool, why isn't it good enough \nfor the rest of America?\n  I say it is not only good enough for them, but we should make sure \nthey have the same opportunities as small business owners or as part of \na family. That is one of the reasons the public option makes lots of \nsense.\n  Mr. BROWN. Let me read a note from a small business person. I get so \nmany letters from small businesses. You know, like most Americans, they \ncare enough about their employees, their fellow employees, their \nfriends, they want to provide insurance. Almost every small business \nperson I have talked to who is struggling with health insurance wants \nto find a way to pay for insurance for her or his employees, and so \noften they can't.\n  Let me read a letter, Kathy from Crawford County, which is Bucyrus, \nGallion, Crestline, just west of where I grew up. She says:\n\n       I am the owner of a small telephone contracting firm. \n     Needless to say, we've been hit hard by the recession.\n       But our main concern is the staggering cost of health care \n     for our employees. We started the company in 1990 when we \n     were able to fully pay for health insurance for our \n     employees.\n       But since 2000 our premiums have increased over 250 \n     percent. In 2008 our increase was 37 percent. In 2009, it was \n     24 percent. We have searched for other health insurance \n     companies but because of the pre-existing conditions of [some \n     of] our employees we cannot switch to anyone else.\n       Along with the economy, the cost of health care makes it a \n     challenge to stay in business.\n\n  This happens too often. That is why in the legislation we wrote in \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, we made special \nprovisions for small businesses. If you have 20 people or you have 5 \npeople, if 1 of them gets very sick and costs the pool of 15 or 20 \npeople exorbitant amounts of money, the insurance company either raises \npremiums so high--increases, as Cathy said, 37 or 24 percent--or the \ninsurance company sometimes cancels the insurance. Either way, it is a \nterrible hardship and a tragedy for the small business and a tragedy \nfor so many employees.\n  If we do this right, we enlarge the pool by allowing these insurance \ncompanies to go into the insurance exchange or the public option, if \nthey choose--an option. They also get a tax credit. They get a break \nthat way and they are much more likely to be able to afford their \ninsurance.\n  Let me turn to Senator Bennet, who is a new member of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee. He has been outspoken for the \npublic option. Senator Bennet?\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I actually am here to talk about something \nelse, but I was so inspired by what the Senator from Pennsylvania and \nthe Senator from Ohio and the others have said, I want to spend a few \nminutes on this issue. Part of it is I just don't understand what \nWashington doesn't understand about what our working families and small \nbusinesses are going through.\n  In my State over the last 10 years, median family income has actually \ngone down by $800 in real dollars. The cost of health insurance \npremiums have gone up 97 percent during the same period of time.\n  There are people who want to leave the system just the way it is, but \nthe result of having flat income for our working families and small \nbusinesses, and for those costs going up 97 percent--by the way, in my \nState the cost of higher education has gone up 50 percent at the same \ntime. The cost of health insurance, up 97 percent; the cost of higher \neducation up by 50 percent--this is tough on the middle class. It is \ntough on small business owners in my State.\n  The result is, if we keep the status quo--there is a great irony of \nthe arguments to keep the status quo--by default, we are putting more \nand more people off private insurance and more and more people either \non public insurance or having the benefit of uncompensated care.\n  We have seen in my State, you can see it on this chart--probably not \nall that well--small business spends 18 percent more for insurance than \nlarge business just because they are small, and fewer and fewer people \nin Colorado are able to get coverage at work. Before this recession \nstarted it had already dropped roughly 10 percentage points; the \npercentage of folks who were getting insurance from their employer, \nfrom our employer-based system. You can see, the Senator from Ohio \ncertainly can see, the percentage of small businesses in my State able \nto offer health insurance has declined dramatically.\n  Where do these people go? They either end up on Medicaid or they end \nup showing up in the emergency room where they are treated with \nuncompensated care, the most expensive way we can deliver health care \nin the United States of America.\n  We have a wonderful public hospital in Denver called Denver Health, \nwhere they do an amazing job at a much lower cost than a lot of other \nhospitals.\n  I was told by the woman who runs the hospital--her name is Patty \nGabow, a gifted administrator--that they had done a study and they \ndiscovered they had spent $180 million in 1 year on uncompensated care \nfor people who were employed by small businesses. These were not \nunemployed people, these were not people who could have had access to \nMedicaid, but people employed by small businesses who could not afford \nhealth insurance.\n  So I think one of the ironic things about the debate we are having is \nthe failure to recognize that the status quo is creating a situation \nwhere fewer and fewer people have private insurance and more and more \npeople are moving into public insurance. But it is not being done in a \nthoughtful way. It has not been constructed that way. So I think that \nis one of the reasons it is very important that we are having this \ndebate.\n  I tell the Senator from Ohio, I am sure he had this reaction when he \nwas on recess. I certainly did. I had townhalls all over the State. \nWhat I kept hearing from people is this, and this is the reason I \nsupport a public option. They would say to me: Michael, we paid every \nsingle year, year after year after year, into private insurance. Every \nyear, we did what we were supposed to do, and then when we needed it, \nit was not there for whatever reason. Because somebody on the other end \nof the telephone told them: You are not covered, or the fine print did \nnot cover you for that problem or your child for that problem. They \ndeeply resented the fact, as I would, that someone earned a profit off \nthat commercial transaction.\n  That is the thing about insurance. It is not like going to the store \nand buying a loaf of bread or a gallon of milk where you know what you \nare getting in return. Many people who buy private insurance year after \nyear don't know what they have until they need it and they don't know \nwhat they have lost until they lose it.\n  Having a choice, just another option that is out there, not a \ngovernment takeover of health care but a choice that empowers working \nfamilies in my State to make the decisions that are in the best \ninterests of their family or their children--as a father of three \nlittle girls under the age of 10, I can understand why people would \nwant that choice. I am not scared by the choice. We have to design it \nproperly, and the HELP Committee did a very good job\n\n[[Page S10299]]\n\ndesigning it, in answering a number of the charges that have been made \nagainst it. We may be able to do a better job in the final legislation.\n  The final thing I am hearing from people in Colorado is: If you are \ngoing to mandate that we have insurance, if you are going to require \nthat we have insurance, you better make it affordable. You better not \ntell me I have to have insurance and make it unaffordable. You better \nnot tell me I have to have insurance and I have to change the plans I \nhave for my family.\n  The public option provides one more choice for people, an affordable \nchoice for people. We have to do a lot more to drive down costs, as I \nand others have talked about on this floor. But we need to do this \nright.\n  I understand, I come from a State where we have a lot of diversity of \nopinion on a lot of things, and there is a lot of concern about the way \nthe system works today, and there is a lot of concern that we are going \nto make it even worse. I think we need to elevate the standard of the \ndiscussion we are having to the standard that we had, that the people \nof Colorado had in townhall after townhall, which, by the way, no one \nwould ever have any interest in putting on TV, I am proud to say. We \nneed to elevate the standard of the discussion in Washington so that we \ncan produce a result that has something other than double-digit cost \nincreases year after year for working families.\n  Mr. BROWN. Will the Senator yield for a question? I heard what you \nsaid about buying a loaf of bread and how buying insurance is \ndifferent. Before you were in the Senate, you were the superintendent \nof the Denver public schools and were very successful in business \nbefore that. When you talk about how insurance companies deny care and \ninsurance executives get paid well, talk for a moment about the \nbusiness plan. When you were an entrepreneur and you were a \nbusinessperson, you obviously had a business plan. Talk to us. Share \nwith Senator Udall and me and others what the business plan of a health \ninsurance company is in particular.\n  Mr. BENNET. I appreciate the question. I will say that I used to make \nmy living buying bankrupt companies. So these were companies that were \nactually fairly well managed but capitalized really poorly, and our \nopportunity was to buy them, capitalize them properly, produce a \nbusiness plan, as you are describing, and make sure the people who \nworked for them, the people who benefited from them continued to be \nable to do that.\n  You know, as a capitalist, I look at the state of our health \ninsurance industry and our health delivery system and I can almost not \nbelieve what I see. We have 44 counties in Colorado. Every one of those \ncounties has a convenience store, at least one, some many more than one \nbut at least one. With the exception of the loose beef jerky that is on \nthe counter, there isn't anything in there that doesn't have a barcode \non it. It is 1970s technology that our small business owners in \nColorado know is critical to managing their inventory, critical to \nallowing them to be competitive and giving their customers what they \nneed.\n  Only 3 percent of hospitals in this country have that technology. One \nout of every 25 doctors has that technology, which is a really simple \nthing. And it is the reason why--as a parent of three little girls or \nif you are caring for a parent of your own, it is so frustrating when \nyou go in and you have to explain over and over again what the last \nperson just told you simply because we don't have a system of \nelectronic medical records.\n  Then, on top of that is a business model where, unlike everything \nelse in our society, every year the cost goes up and the quality to the \ncustomer goes down, which is what we see with insurance. We don't see \nthat in other parts of our private marketplace. We don't see that in \nother parts of our private marketplace where people are incentivized to \ncompete on price, on quality, on customer service. And it is why it is \nnot just enough to have a public option. We need a public option, but \nwe also need commonsense regulation of insurance so that we start \ndriving a marketplace that actually makes sense.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Senator Bennet, one of the things that is \nhappening--and your chart there really explains it, and I wanted to get \nyou to talk about this a little bit--your chart says: Rising health \ncare costs are hitting small businesses the hardest and forcing all \nColorado businesses to make tough choices.\n  That is exactly what is happening in New Mexico, exactly what is \nhappening in Ohio. And really what we have going on here is very hard-\nworking, good small businesspeople who want to give their employees \ninsurance. I hear that. I know the Senator from Ohio said that a number \nof times when he read letters. They want to give that insurance, but \nthey can't. They search around, they can't find policies they can \nafford, and so they are really stuck. And I can give you a list of \nexamples in New Mexico.\n  One of the things you pointed out on your chart is that even before \nthe recession--even before the recession--fewer Colorado small \nbusinesses could offer coverage. I was wondering if you could talk a \nlittle bit about the small business situation because most of these \npeople are working without insurance.\n  Mr. BENNET. I appreciate the Senator from New Mexico raising that. I \nremember a florist I talked to, a family-owned business since 1972 in \nmy State, and he is now down to no employees, just his wife and \nhimself. They are running the shop. They had health insurance for many \nyears, and they took it, as so many small businesses do, as an article \nof faith that part of their job was to offer insurance to their \nemployees, to make sure their employees had the benefit of insurance. \nNow they are the only two employees. There is no one working for them. \nThey do not have health insurance themselves.\n  Their daughter has been admitted to the University of Colorado. He \nsaid to me last week: Michael, what was she supposed to do when she got \nto the box that said check the box if you have health insurance? If you \ndon't, you have to pay this terrible fee.\n  So, first of all, people are having to make choices they should not \nhave to make and they would not have to make in a rational private \nmarket that was working well. That is one of the issues.\n  The second thing is, as you know--I am sure it is true in New Mexico, \nand it is certainly true in Ohio--most of our jobs are created by small \nbusinesses. Depending on the numbers you look at, roughly 70 percent of \nour jobs are created by small businesses. And a higher percentage of \nthose jobs are going to be responsible for the recovery that hopefully \nwe are about to have in this country. It is harder and harder to do \nthat if you are carrying the freight of double-digit cost increases in \ninsurance every single year.\n  The last point I want to make--every small business owner understands \nthis--as small business owners try to hang on to insurance for their \nemployees and the price of that goes up and up, what that leads to is a \nchoice between holding on to the insurance and compressing the wages of \nthe employees because you can't do both. You can't give people the \nincreases they deserve in their compensation and at the same time hold \non to health insurance. So that is a reason we have seen all across \nthis country, actually, a decline in median family income. It has gone \ndown by $300 over the last decade in the country, $800 in my State, \nwhile the cost of insurance has gone up by 97 percent. That wage \ncompression is directly linked to the problems people have holding on \nto insurance.\n  I appreciate the question. I yield.\n  Mr. BROWN. I thank the Senator from Colorado for his good work and \nhis very good description particularly of how the cost of health care \naffects small businesses in such a negative way.\n  We will wrap up in the next 10 or 15 minutes.\n  Earlier today, a group of Democratic women Senators came to the \nSenate floor to talk about health care. And some of the things that \namaze a lot of us as we work through this, some of the things we hear--\nin several States in this country, being a victim of domestic violence \nis considered a preexisting condition. There are women in this country, \nbelieve it or not, who have been victims of domestic violence. \nInsurance companies have said: You cannot get insurance because of that \nbecause, presumably, you might be abused again, you might be hit again,\n\n[[Page S10300]]\n\nand it would cost us, the insurance company, far too much money. So, \nbelieve it or not, they actually can't get insurance because of that. \nObviously, this legislation makes that--as Senator Casey says, there \nwill be no more preexisting condition denials of care, no more \ndiscrimination based on gender, based on geography, based on \ndisability, based on age.\n  One of the other things the bill does that is important is it will \neliminate copays for things such as mammograms. We want people, \nparticularly when they get to be my age, when they are in their \nfifties, we want people to go in and get the right kind of preventive \ncare and get the right kinds of tests. People should have a colonoscopy \nwhen they are 50, and people should be tested by mammography and should \nhave mammograms and all of that. I mean, none of us probably goes in as \noften as we should for the preventive care and the tests, but an awful \nlot of people would like to do that and simply can't because of the \ncost.\n  This legislation would say: If you are going in for something like a \nmammograms or for something like a colonoscopy, there will be no \ncopays. It will encourage people to get into the system. Then, if they \nare diagnosed with cancer, they are diagnosed typically in the early \nstages, and it is certainly more likely to save their lives, and it is \nmuch less expensive as a result of going into the system earlier. So it \nultimately saves us money by telling insurance companies: You are not \ngoing to do that anymore.\n  That is so clear to me, that if we are going to do this right, we \nneed to make sure women are treated better by this system, no longer \npreexisting conditions and all that.\n  I will close and then turn to Senator Udall or Senator Bennet, if \nthey would like.\n  I have another letter I got--exactly what I was talking about.\n  Darlene from Mahoning County:\n\n       I lost my job in May 2007 after 27 years with the company. \n     For a while, I did not have any health problems. I paid for \n     private coverage with my unemployment check and savings. \n     Within the last year, I started having medical problems. I \n     was diagnosed with diabetes. I had back surgery in July to \n     relieve severe back pain. I now have to pay premiums with my \n     savings. When my savings run out, so will my insurance. \n     Please do something to help.\n\n  She is not yet eligible for Medicare.\n  So many of these letters just cry out: I am trying to get through the \nnext year or the next 3 years, the next 6 years, whatever, until I am \neligible for Medicare, I am just trying to get through. And it really \nis a call for help, and it really is a plea from people in my State, \npeople in Warren and people in Bellaire and people in Gallipolis and \npeople in Crestline: Please help us in these years when we are in our \nlate fifties, early sixties. We are going to be in Medicare pretty \nsoon. We know Medicare works for us. We know this government program \nworks, a program that doesn't look much different from the public \noption. But I need just a few more years. It is a time in my life when \nI am starting to get more aches and pains or worse. It is a time in my \nlife when I am much more likely to get sick, to get an expensive \nillness, when I am 56, 58, or 63.\n  These are people who know they will be embraced with a decent health \ncare system. They know they will be in a decent health care system when \nthey get to Medicare age, when they get to be 65.\n  They have friends who are in Medicare, and they know Medicare works \nfor them. That is as good a testament to the public option as there is. \nThose are the kind of letters I am getting from people saying: Please \ninclude a public option. I am 58 years old. I am not yet eligible for \nMedicare. I was diagnosed with diabetes. I need to do this; I need to \ndo that. That is what is so very important about the public option.\n  I yield to Senator Udall.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. One of those charts you put up over there \nemphasized the point of competition in the marketplace and how much we \nneed competition. We joined together with the majority of our \ncolleagues in the caucus to sign a letter to our leadership. I think \none of the paragraphs in this letter is particularly persuasive. The \nSenator's signature is the No. 1 signature on this letter, but we \nwrote:\n\n       Opponents of health care reform argue that a public option \n     presents unfair competition to the private insurance \n     companies. However, it is possible to create a public health \n     insurance option that is modeled after private insurance. \n     Rates are negotiated and providers are not required to \n     participate in the plan. As you know, this is the Senate HELP \n     Committee's approach.\n\n  This is the public option we are talking about that was passed out of \nthe Kennedy committee and is available to be inserted in the bill on \nwhich we are going to vote.\n\n       The major differences between the public option and for-\n     profit plans are that the public plan would report to \n     taxpayers, not to shareholders, and the public plan would be \n     available continuously in all parts of the country.\n\n  So small business people in New Mexico would have an opportunity to \nget into this public option insurance plan.\n\n       The number one goal of health reform must be to look out \n     for the best interests of the American people--patients and \n     taxpayers alike--not the profit margins of insurance \n     companies.\n\n  We have to get competition into the market. We know that health \ninsurance markets are effective monopolies or in some cases duopolies. \nIn New Mexico we have two companies that hold 65 percent of the market. \nThere is no incentive for competition. There is no incentive for lower \ncost. In fact, what we do under the law is, we allow these insurance \ncompanies to be exempted from antitrust laws. For most of the other \nbusinesses in America, we have those antitrust laws out there, and the \nJustice Department and various State attorneys general can move in to \nbring competition when there gets to be too much consolidation of \npower. We don't have that when it comes to insurance companies. As a \nresult, we see premiums skyrocket; in my home State of New Mexico, 120 \npercent skyrocketing premiums.\n  As I wrap up, I want to talk about a New Mexican, a woman from Raton. \nI met her at a townhall in August. She received a renewal notice. Her \npremium had gone up 24 percent alone this year. She can't afford an \nincrease, but she doesn't have any other option. A public option would \nbring that woman the ability to get into a health care plan and take \ncare of herself. That is what you and I are fighting for. We are going \nto keep doing this. We are going to keep doing this because we have a \nlot of days to keep pushing forward. We will make this happen.\n  With that, I know the Senator has a couple more things to say. You \nshould show the Presiding Officer Alaska on that map. What does it say?\n  Mr. BROWN. More than 80 percent of insurance is controlled by two \ncompanies in Alaska. That is a pretty compelling case.\n  I thank Senator Udall and also Senator Bennet from Colorado, as well \nas Senators Sanders, Whitehouse, Casey, Merkley, and Stabenow. It shows \nthe breadth of support for the public option because it injects \ncompetition into the system. It will keep the insurance companies \nhonest, and it will bring pressure to keep prices down.\n  My last 5 minutes I yield to Senator Bennet who has a sobering issue \nhe wishes to discuss.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Ohio for letting \nme have the last 5 minutes.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Bennet are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I listened very patiently to the last 2 \nhours about why we need a government-run plan. I want to concur with my \ncolleagues about the problems in the insurance industry. There is no \nquestion they are great. But the reason the problems are great is \nbecause there is no real competition today. The rhetorical question is, \nyou can't have it both ways. Nobody wants it both ways. The fact is, I \nsaw this on the Internet this week. I thought it was appropriate for \nwhere we are. Here is a youngster walking on a street. She says:\n\n       I'm already $38,375 in debt and I only own a doll house.\n\n  Everybody agrees we have a too costly health care system. Everybody \nagrees we need to fix that. What we don't agree on is how to fix it. We \nhave heard 2 hours of what is wrong with the private insurance industry \nthat has not been allowed to be competitive, has not been forced to be \ncompetitive. And yet\n\n[[Page S10301]]\n\nthe answer to that question is that we want the government involved. \nThe Senator from Pennsylvania talked about all the government programs. \nSixty-one percent of all health care today comes through the \ngovernment. Every government program is over budget, associated with \nfraud, and ineffective in its implementation on a cost basis. That \ndoesn't mean we want to get rid of them. It means we want to make them \nbetter. The real problem with having the government do more is, right \nnow 43 cents out of every dollar we are spending we are borrowing. We \ncreate a government plan. We put $60 billion into it, and we can create \ncompetition. But we don't have competition now. Everybody agrees with \nthat. Nobody denies that we don't have good competition. But we don't \nhave good competition because we have failed to act.\n  The Senator from Ohio showed a chart of CEOs' pay. If they were \nhaving to compete, that pay wouldn't be there, especially not at that \nlevel. I don't disagree with that. But the way to control that is real \ncompetition. Forty-three cents of every dollar we spend this year we \nwill borrow. And it will be worse next year. It will be 45, 46 cents \nnext year of what we spend we will borrow.\n  This picture doesn't talk about what she owes. This is just what the \ndebt is now, just the $11.8 trillion. What she owes is another \n$400,000, because we are paying out of Medicare what we have never \ncreated the tax base to fund. So in fact what we are doing is, we are \ngoing to charge this little girl for our Medicare. The impact of that \nis when she was born she owed $400,000. By the time she is 20, she will \nowe $800,000. What will happen to her?\n  There is no question we have positive benefits with Medicare. There \nis no question we are taking care of people who can't take care of \nthemselves through Medicaid. There is a question of how effective we \nare doing with Native American tribes in terms of that. We are seeing \nimprovements in veterans health care. We have all these different \nprograms that are run through the government. So when you only have 39 \npercent of the health care in the country to put into the market, it is \ngoing to be very difficult to lower costs.\n\n  What is the problem with health care in America today? The problem is \ncost. It is too expensive. It is about 40 percent more expensive here \nthan anywhere else in the world. Why is that? Well, there are a lot of \nreasons for it. But the first reason is, we will not allow real markets \nto develop in the health insurance industry. We have stopped it. And \nnow we come and say: We are unhappy with it, so we want to create a \ngovernment plan--a government plan that will compete.\n  I do not have any problem if you create a government plan if you fund \nit and make it competitive. But that is not what we are going to do. \nBecause what we are going to do with a government plan is we are going \nto turn it into another Medicare. It will supply people health care. It \nwill lower their costs. But we are going to transfer the cost to this \nlittle girl. It is just $440 billion spent on Medicare this year, of \nwhich $80 billion of it was fraud.\n  So the problem is, which solution do you think works better? Do you \nthink we have the history that says government-run health care is \nefficient and effective and, therefore, we ought to do more of it or \nshould we say: We know what works in the rest of the industries and \nmarkets in this country. Maybe we ought to allow markets to truly \ncompete--which nobody wants to do--to force the insurance industry into \na competitive structure where you can actually see what you are getting \nand you can see what you are paying.\n  The other problem about this little number is, not only does she have \n$38,000 in debt right now, and another $800,000 when she gets ready to \nbuy her insurance, we are going to tell her what she is going to buy. \nWe are going to take the freedom away from her to decide what is best \nfor her and her family. Then we are going to yoke her with a whole \nbunch more taxes.\n  There is no disagreement in this body that we need to make changes in \nhealth care; and the assumption that anybody would say that is \nabsolutely erroneous and fictitious. We recognize that. The question \nis, which way do you fix health care? Do you fix it with a government \nthat is bankrupt already, that has stolen the future from the next two \ngenerations, and add more on to them or do we get common sense back in \nand say: Well, first of all, we can eliminate 8 percent of the cost if \nwe have good tort reform in this country because 8 percent of the cost \nof health care is defensive medicine.\n  I read a study this week. It is interesting--and I have some passion \nabout this because I have been on the end of those lawsuits--I would \nnote that the vast majority of those who have been discussing health \ncare for the last 2 years are lawyers. They are not doctors. They never \nlaid their hands on a patient. They never stayed up 20 hours in a row \nto take care of somebody who needed them. They have all the answers, \nbut they have never been in health care.\n  Here are what the numbers are on malpractice lawsuits in the United \nStates: Eighty percent of all the cases that are filed are thrown out \nof court. Of the remaining 20 percent, 89 percent are thrown out of \ncourt. So 3 percent of the cases are legitimate in this country. What \ndo you think that is costing us? And we ignore it? We are not even \ngoing to talk about the fact that we have an extortioned service going \non in health care that does not cost the lawyers a thing? It costs \neverybody else in this country billions of dollars a year because we \nare doing tests that nobody needs, except the doctors to defend \nthemselves. And that is $200 billion a year out of $2.4 trillion. That \nis what the number is.\n  So when less than 3 percent of the people--and I am all for \ncompensating people who are truly injured. I have no problems with \nthat. As a physician practicing over 25 years, there is no question I \nhave made mistakes. There is no question. There are no doctors who are \nperfect, and, consequently, sometimes people are injured because of \ndoctors' mistakes. Most of the time they are not. And it is not about \nnot compensating the injured. It is about changing the mindset in this \ncountry that you can extort people into settling when you have no real \nclaim, and that is what is going on with 85 to 90 percent of the cases.\n  So the answer for health care is: controlling costs. So how do we \nbest do that? It is interesting, we have had the accusation that there \nare no other plans out there. My colleague from North Carolina and I \nintroduced the first plan in Congress for health care.\n  What does it do versus what the Baucus bill or the public option bill \nwill do, according to CBO? We cover 94 percent of Americans--identical \nto what the Baucus bill does. So 94 percent of all Americans will get \ncovered under our bill. We save the Federal Government $70 billion in \nthe first 10 years, close to $1 trillion in the second 10 years.\n  What does the Baucus bill do? It saves $88 billion, and nobody knows \nwhat it is going to save after that. But it costs the States billions. \nOur bill saves the States, in the first 10 years, $960 billion. We \ncover more people, with no increase in the cost to the Federal \nGovernment, versus a marked increase in the cost to the States by the \nBaucus bill, or by the public option plan.\n  It eliminates preexisting condition. We all agree we need to do that. \nNobody is fighting that. The question is, how do you do it? Do you do \nit in a competitive model that costs insurance companies pain if they \nare not covering the people properly? And if, in fact, there is an \nincentive to cover preexisting conditions, then you have an incentive \nfor the insurance companies to invest in the management of chronic care \nrather than ignore covering somebody.\n  I do not deny there is cherry-picking going on right now, but it is \nonly because we allow it. We do not have to allow it. But the answer \ndoes not have to automatically be another long-term, bankrupt plan run \nby the government. Nobody can deny the $95 trillion, 100-year unfunded \nliability for Medicare. That is GAO, that is CBO, and that is the \nMedicare trustees. You cannot deny that.\n  So we have a program that seniors are fairly happy with, except the \nBaucus plan is going to cut a half a trillion dollars out of it. But we \ncannot pay for it. So we are not doing anything to drive that cost \ndown, to drive in efficiency. What we are going to do is create more \ngovernment, to have another plan that is going to get in the same shape \nas Medicare.\n\n[[Page S10302]]\n\n  We all want the same thing. We want to get everybody covered in this \ncountry. We want the cost of health care to be affordable. And we do \nnot want to bankrupt our children. We have already bankrupted them. So \nthe danger of having a government-centered, government-centric, \ngovernment-run, government-devised, government-managed health care \nprogram--just by history, look at what we have done.\n  Medicaid costs tons more than it was ever supposed to cost. SCHIP \ncosts tons more than it was ever supposed to cost. Medicare costs tons \nmore than it was ever supposed to cost. Indian health care--it does not \ncost more because we just let them suffer. We do not put the money into \nit. VA costs tons more than it was ever supposed to cost. TRICARE costs \nmore than it was ever supposed to cost. They are all government \nprograms. They are all way over budget.\n  So the question the American people ought to ask is: If we all want \nto get everybody covered, and we all want to drive down costs, does the \ngovernment have a track record that says it has done that? No. As a \nmatter of fact, it has done the opposite of that.\n  So it is not a matter of whether you trust in government. We have 61 \npercent of health care running through government. And as a physician \nwho has practiced for over 25 years, I will tell you, it is my opinion \nthe reason costs are out of control is not because of the insurance \nindustry--and I am not a defender of them; as a matter of fact, I hate \nthem about as bad as I hate anybody telling me what I am going to do to \nmy patient--the problem is, we have directives coming from the \ngovernment that have disrupted the market in health care and created \nthis tremendous differential.\n  The other difference that we have in the Patients' Choice Act is that \nwe do not put another burden on the States, which all these bills do. \nThe States are swimming in debt. They are struggling to stay ahead, and \nwe are transferring billions, almost--we are transferring trillions of \ndollars of expense to the State. We are making it nice for four States. \nWe have picked four States and we have said: You don't have any cost \nthe first 5 years. We just, out of the hat--because they are having a \nlittle worse economic time than others, we have said: You don't have \nit. But for the rest of the States, it is the mother of all mandates, \nand they will never be able to afford it.\n  There is also another little sneaky provision in the bills--both in \nthe HELP bill, the House bill, and the Baucus bill--which is, we know \nwe are not going to cut doctors' fees 21 percent. The Presiding Officer \nwould agree to that, the Senator from Colorado knows we are not going \nto do that. But we are not going to recognize it. We are not going to \nrecognize that cost. So we are playing games with the American people. \nWe are saying: Here is what it costs, when we know it is going to cost \na lot more than that because we know we are not about to do that. But \nwe do not have the courage to admit that. We do not have the courage to \nask for an honest score.\n  The other difference is, we empower patients and States, not \nbureaucrats. We preserve the right, the inherent individual liberty \nright, of an individual to decide what is best for them rather than \nhaving the government decide what is best for them. In our bill, 9 out \nof 10 Americans get a tax cut.\n  So let me draw the parallel again. We do not have a government-run \nprogram. We save the Federal Government money. We save the States $1 \ntrillion. We get more people covered than any other plan that is out \nthere. Nine out of 10 Americans get a tax cut. We eliminate preexisting \nillness. And we bend the cost curve down considerably.\n  And, oh, by the way, we do not destroy innovation in health care, \nwhich is 75 percent of the innovation in the world, which will go away \nif any of these other plans are instituted--the incentive to put \ncapital at risk to create opportunity for medical innovation.\n  There is a lot I could say, but I think what I would like to do is \nyield to my colleague from North Carolina in terms of someone who has \nbeen with me, who knows health care, who has been from the start \nworking with us to try to put forward a plan that says we can \naccomplish this same thing and save tons of money.\n  Mr. President, I yield to my colleague from North Carolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank the doctor from Oklahoma, my \ncolleague, my friend. Let me say from the start, 3\\1/2\\ years ago, Tom \nCoburn and I sat down and realized health care was unsustainable at its \ncurrent level of investment.\n  The American people have complained because they have seen a process \nthat has gone too quickly. Well, in the Patients' Choice Act you find \n3\\1/2\\ years worth of work--a bill that was designed to take 4 years \nbefore we thought we had the right information we needed to do health \ncare reform adequately.\n  With the change in the administrations, the new President and his \ntimeframe, we accelerated it. But let me say, right from the start, it \nis unsustainable at its current level of investment. It is 17 percent \nof our gross domestic product. Health care has to be reformed.\n  I personally believed the debate we were going to have in Washington \nwas over what type of reform. Dr. Coburn raises a good point: cost. \nWhere are we from the standpoint of our Nation?\n  I happened to gaze, as I was waiting for the last speakers to finish, \non the page of this publication. It says: Baucus Bill Projected at $829 \nbillion. In the small box down at the bottom of the page--CBO: Deficit \nHits Record $1.4 trillion for Fiscal Year 2009.\n  Common sense would tell you that when you are in the type of \nfinancial shape the United States of America is in, not only do you \nstop spending, you begin to look for ways to curb spending and a way to \ninvest to reduce the deficit. Because the deficit is what our children \nand our grandchildren will inherit. If you believe it is unsustainable \nat its current level of investment, then you sort of understand where \nDr. Coburn and I are coming from.\n  The worst place we can start is: How much more money do we need to \nspend to do health care reform? But the truth is, the Baucus plan is \nnot health care reform. It is health care expansion. The debate in \nWashington is not about how to reform health care. It is about how to \nexpand health care. And once you determine the pool you are going to \nexpand it to, the $64 million question is: How do we pay for it so the \nCBO says we have paid for it?\n  What I would like to do is spend a little bit of time exploring how \nthe Baucus plan pays for it with the caveat up front of saying--as it \nrelates to Dr. Coburn and myself--we don't believe we have to spend \nmore to reform health care. I think from what he said about the \nPatients' Choice Act, we have made the point. We were the first two \npeople in the Congress--House or Senate--to introduce comprehensive \nlegislation. We cover the same amount of additional Americans that the \nBaucus plan covers. We do it without making additional taxpayer \ninvestments in the expansion of coverage. Why? Because in addition to \nexpanding coverage, we reform health care. We actually bend the cost \ncurve. We change the tax application to where it is fair and equal for \nall people.\n  What we have to realize is, the Baucus plan is a 10-year plan. We \ncollect revenues for 10 years and we pay out for the expansion in 6\\1/\n2\\ years. Let me say it again. We are collecting tax revenues for 10 \nyears, but we are only paying benefit expansions for 6\\1/2\\ years. We \nhave to look at years 10 through 20 if you want to see 10 years' worth \nof revenue collection and 10 years' worth of expenses. As a matter of \nfact, if you took the first 10 years and you applied what is done in \nthe bill and said: Well, if they started making payments in the first \nyear, this bill would actually cost $1.8 trillion, not $829 billion but \n$1.8 trillion.\n  Incorporated in the Baucus bill are cuts to Medicare, cuts that equal \n$449 billion. Dr. Coburn talked about the imminent reduction to \nphysician reimbursements: 21 percent projected. We all agree we are \nnever going to make that. One of the attractions for health care \nprofessionals was the Baucus bill said in year one, we are not going to \nmake those cuts. Well, they are going to cut Medicare over 10 years by \n$449 billion. This is giving with one hand and taking away with the \nother hand. Health care professionals around this country have realized \nthat, even though their association that represents them doesn't.\n\n[[Page S10303]]\n\n  The Baucus bill cuts $117.4 billion in Medicare Advantage. My \ncolleagues are probably saying: What is Medicare Advantage? Well, it is \nthe preferred plan of 20 percent of America's seniors. Twenty percent \nof our seniors on Medicare have chosen Medicare Advantage, a private \nsector option to traditional Medicare, where they have looked at the \ntwo and they said: I would rather have Medicare Advantage, because when \nI go in the hospital, Medicare is going to charge me a $750 deductible \nright off the bat. Medicare Advantage? Zero. For traditional Medicare, \nyou are going to have to have Part A, Part B, Part D. Medicare \nAdvantage, you get it all as one lump sum. You don't have to make \nseparate selections. They provide you the doctor coverage, the hospital \ncoverage, the drug coverage all in one plan.\n  Why is it under the target of some in Washington to cut $117 billion? \nThey say it is because we pay 114 percent of Medicare per person \nallocations to Advantage, where we pay 100 percent in traditional fee \nfor service. That is exactly right. I remember the debate we had in \nWashington when we did it. Because the objective then was: How do you \nget Medicare Advantage to offer this plan in rural America? To offer it \nin rural America meant you had to offer a greater reimbursement. This \nisn't reflective of a windfall for the insurance companies; it was an \nincentive to offer this choice not just to urban seniors but to seniors \neverywhere in America. In my State of North Carolina, 17 percent of all \nthe Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage. When \nanybody gets up and says pass this bill, the Baucus bill, and you can \nkeep your health care if you like it, there is a caveat to that. Unless \nyou are 17 percent of the seniors in North Carolina or you are 23 \npercent of the seniors nationally, you lose your plan. You are going to \ngo back into traditional Medicare. You are going to go back to where, \nwhen you enter the hospital, they are going to say write me a check for \n$750 annually; where your Part B is a separate payment; where your Part \nD is something you have to figure out as to which plan you want versus \nsomething that is seamless and covers everything. I will assure \neverybody a $117 billion cut to Medicare Advantage will eliminate that \nproduct from the marketplace. Nobody will offer it. Twenty percent of \nAmerica's seniors will lose the insurance they prefer, not keep it.\n  Medicaid expansion. It seems like a sensible way to go if you want to \nexpand coverage, which is where the debate has been in Washington. \nWell, let's simply take a coverage tool that is out there today--\nMedicaid--and let's raise the income limit so more people qualify for \nit. So instead of 100 percent of poverty, we raise it to 133 percent of \npoverty. It costs $345 billion. There is $33 billion in direct State \nspending. As Dr. Coburn said, four States are sort of split out of it, \nand they say: Well, we are not going to charge you because you are in \ntough economic times. Well, North Carolina is at 10.8 percent. Why \naren't we included? Our cost, when the Federal Government makes North \nCarolina ante up, is going to be south of $1 billion a year for a State \nthat had a $4 billion shortfall. Where is my Governor in her outrage at \nthe proposal to expand Medicaid to 133 percent of poverty?\n  The tough thing is, this plan has been sold that it is not going to \ncost anybody anything, and the truth is it is going to cost seniors, it \nis going to cost taxpayers, it is going to cost the unemployed but, \nmore importantly, it is going to cost people who have health care \ninsurance today. People who have the money to purchase theirs and \npeople whose employer offers them health care, their cost is going to \ngo up because of the restrictions and the mandates that exist within \nthe Baucus bill.\n  The Baucus bill would impose an annual $6.7 billion fee on insurance \ncompanies; $6.7 billion a year; over 10 years, $67 billion. So a $67 \nbillion new fee on the insurance companies that we are trying to make \nthe American people believe are going to reduce premiums, reduce costs, \nand we are sticking them with a $67 billion pricetag. There is nobody \nin America when they hear this who believes that health care is going \nto go down for the American people. For every person who currently has \na plan today, I will assure my colleagues their premium will go up. \nThey will pay more money, not less money.\n  We grow the IRS. There is something we haven't talked about because \nof the requirements in this bill to collect fees and to collect taxes. \nIt is estimated by the Lewin Group that the IRS would need a 25-percent \nincrease in their budget. The IRS currently gets $12 billion annually \nfor their administrative costs. The administration costs for \nimplementing the exchange subsidies would add nearly $40 billion from \nthe Baucus bill. We have additional costs at the IRS because we have to \nincrease by 25 percent the IRS requirements to go and collect and \nenforce this.\n  We tax the chronically ill. I thought this one was one of those myths \nthat late night TV talks about. We tax the chronically ill in the \nBaucus bill. Let me explain what I mean. Current law says that if your \nhealth care charges exceed 7.5 percent of your annual income, then you \ncan deduct that off your taxes. Clearly, the lower your income, the \nmore likely you are to utilize the 7.5 percent exclusion. So what does \nthe Baucus bill do to raise money? It raises the exclusion to 10 \npercent. Instead of at 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income being \nable to deduct anything that exceeds that, it says you have to exceed \n10 percent of your adjusted gross income. For somebody who makes $1 \nmillion a year, this is no big deal. They probably have more than \nenough insurance to take care of it. For somebody who is on a limited \nincome; for somebody who maybe doesn't have all the insurance they \nneed; for somebody who walks in and is chronically ill, has a chronic \ndisease and they are making payments, they are covering their copays, \nthey occasionally go to the hospital, they have that $50 charge for \nwalking in the door, even though they have insurance. They are making \nit at the end of the year, even though they make $20,000 or $25,000 a \nyear, and all of a sudden, 2\\1/2\\ percent of their adjusted gross \nincome is no longer a deduction they get. What is that? That is taxing \nthe chronically ill in this country.\n  Listen, I have to give them credit. They have left nobody out of this \nbill from taxes. They have left nobody out of this bill from \ninstituting a new fee. As a matter of fact, some of it we are going to \nhave to take for granted is going to be applied to us in an indirect \nway because incorporated in the Baucus bill we collect a new device \ntax. To the heart patient who goes in and gets a heart catheterization, \nto the senior who goes in and gets a hip replacement, it is a device. \nFor any medical device that is used, there is a $40 billion device tax \nover 10 years.\n  What does that do for the innovation of new devices? Dr. Coburn can \nspeak to it better than I can. When we were able to switch from open \nheart surgery to bypass surgery, we probably went from $40,000 or \n$60,000. When we were able to catheterize somebody and put a stent in, \nwe reduced significantly the cost, we reduced significantly the \ninvasion, we were able to raise the quality of life. We couldn't have \ndone that if somebody hadn't innovated a cath and a stent. We would \nstill be doing all bypass surgeries. You think through all the medical \nprocedures we do in this country and you think about all the devices \nthat have been created by companies and by doctors so they can be less \ninvasive because they understand every time they go into somebody, \nevery time they cut in, there is a fear of infection today; there is a \nconsequence of recovery. It means a stay in the hospital is longer.\n  When you see a new device enter into the marketplace, you actually \nsee a new efficiency come into health care. You see reduced health care \ncosts because you are taking either somebody out of an inpatient \nsetting and you are putting them in an outpatient setting, or you are \ntaking an inpatient patient and you are getting them out of the \nhospital faster. Actually, you could make the case that innovation of \nmedical devices is health care reform because it is driving down costs, \nbecause it is moving patients out, and the net result is the quality of \nlife goes up. But, in this bill, we raise $40 billion over 10 years, or \n$4 billion a year on taxes on devices.\n  If you listen to the things I have talked about, you are probably \nsitting at home trying to figure this out: I am going to pay more in \nhealth care because they are taxing devices. I am going to pay more in \nhealth care if, in\n\n[[Page S10304]]\n\nfact, I have a chronic illness because I am not going to be able to \ndeduct that out-of-pocket cost that is between 7\\1/2\\ percent and 10 \npercent of my adjusted gross income. I am going to have to cover, as a \ntaxpayer, a 25-percent expansion in the IRS. They are going to impose a \n$6.7 billion so-called fee on the insurance industry, or $67 billion \nover 10 years, while I have an insurance policy, so that fee is going \nto be passed through to me as a covered life under the insurance plan.\n  I am going to pick up, in the State in which I live, the increase in \nthe limitations on Medicaid when we go from 100 percent of poverty to \n133 percent of poverty. How can you make a claim that this bends the \ncost curve? If you tried to make the claim, it bends the cost curve up \nnot down.\n  Dr. Coburn and I listened very intently as the President kicked off \nthis debate: Create a program that provides coverage for as many \nAmericans as we possibly could. We did that. Bend the cost curve down. \nWell, we make a direct investment in prevention, wellness, and chronic \ndisease management--the only three direct areas of savings in health \ncare. We can talk all night about tort reform and about different \naspects. They are indirect and there are significant savings we can \nachieve by incorporating those reforms into health care.\n  In the Patients' Choice Act, we elected to keep it narrowly targeted, \nand we invest in prevention, wellness, and chronic disease management. \nWhy? Because we went to States, businesses, and self-insured companies \nthat went 4 years and didn't have an increase in health care costs. \nWhy? Because they changed the lifestyle of their workers. They actually \npaid their workers, in some cases, to quit smoking, to lose weight, to \nget exercise, or to take an education program on a chronic disease they \nhad to make sure they got the treatment they needed.\n  The net result? In every case, the per-enrollee savings were so \nsignificant that the companies continued to try to figure out how they \ncould spend more to reduce health care costs. The quality of life for \ntheir employees was better. The productivity of the employees was \nbetter, and they had no annual increase in their health care costs.\n  We are sitting here ignoring everything that has been learned in \nAmerica by private self-insured companies and by some insurers who are \ndoing creative things, targeting chronic disease, and actually paying \ndoctors to educate. We have ignored all of this. Why? Because we are \nhaving a debate in Washington with the Baucus bill about coverage \nexpansion, not about health care reform.\n  Coverage expansion costs a lot of money--$829 billion. We are having \nthat debate and telling the American people this is about reform. If \nyou read the fine print, the bottom of the page, and if you read the \npart they don't want you to remember, it says this year alone there is \na $1.4 trillion deficit. That is $1.4 trillion we didn't have that we \nhad to borrow.\n  The last thing we need is more money in health care. It is 16 percent \nof our GDP, and we cannot maintain that level of investment. The \nchallenge is on us to come up with the reforms that continue to invest \nand promote innovation, that expand coverage and, more important, \nreduce costs.\n  What do the American people want? They want health care costs to go \ndown, and they want quality to go up. We don't accomplish that in the \nBaucus bill, but you do in the Coburn-Burr bill. It is not perfect, but \nit heads in the right direction.\n  I yield to my good friend from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senator. I am sitting here thinking, if I was \nsitting at home tonight listening to this, how do I hear the story that \nI heard for 2 hours on having a government-run plan and how bad the \ninsurance industry is? As a physician, I don't like them a whole lot, I \ncan tell you that. I don't like some of their tactics. I certainly \ndon't like the way they cancel insurance policies on people. There is a \nlot about them I don't like. But I don't want to eliminate them. What I \nwant to do is create a real market where they have to be savvy and \ncompete and they have to be efficient and they have to help us help one \nanother get well.\n  We are going to hear a lot over the next month on health care. We are \ngoing to hear all these claims, much like we did from Congressman \nGrayson, who made an outlandish claim that my side of the aisle wants \npeople to die. That is what was said in the House of Representatives. \nWhat I want is people to live. I want this little girl in the picture \nto live too.\n  Do we have an unsolvable problem? No. Do we have ways of making \nhealth care costs much less in this country? Yes. Do we have ways of \nensuring increased innovation and advanced disease prevention in this \ncountry? Yes. Do we have ways to protect this little girl in the photo? \nYes. But the debate is over how we do that. One side says we do it by \nmaking the government a whole lot bigger--$1 trillion bigger, $3 \ntrillion bigger over the next 20 years. That is one side of the debate.\n  Our side of the debate says this is inefficient health care. We want \nto cover everybody. We never want anybody to go bankrupt or to be \ndenied care. We think you can do that without growing the government by \n25 percent. We think there are other ways to do it. We are honestly \nworried about our track record in Washington when we have a $1.4 \ntrillion deficit this year and a Medicare Program that is absolutely \nbankrupt--it will run out of money in less than 7 years from now, \ntotally out of money--and we are going to be borrowing it all then. Is \nthere another way to do it? So either we make a large jump in the size \nof the Federal Government and add to the $838,000 that this little girl \nis going to have, or maybe we can work together and say the insurance \ncompanies are bad, but can we keep something like that and make them \nefficient? Can we allow people to buy across State lines? Can we give \npeople opportunities to buy what they want to buy rather than being \nlimited? Do we trust people to make good enough decisions for \nthemselves?\n  The Baucus plan doesn't do that. It says we have three or four plans \nfrom which you get to choose, but we are going to tell you what you \nhave to buy. And, by the way, you have to buy insurance in this \ncountry. Think about that.\n  I carry with me a copy of the the U.S. Constitution all the time. \nEvery bill out there has said you don't have liberty because the \nFederal Government is going to tell you where you have to spend your \nmoney. You have to buy an insurance policy. So if you make a quarter \nmillion dollars a year, it doesn't matter if you want to fund that \nself-insurance, it doesn't count. You still have to do that. If you \ndon't, you are liable to a tax. If you don't pay the tax, a $25,000 \nfine. If you don't pay the fine, you are in jail for a year.\n  How do we get off telling people that and taking away that liberty, \nthat freedom that is supposed to be guaranteed under the Constitution? \nThe answer is, well, it is better for everybody because if we don't \nhave everybody covered, then it is going to cost more because that is \nthe big government answer to it. Maybe it will cost more if we force \nand drive competition, if we create transparent markets, where you know \nwhat something costs before you get it in health care. In fact, there \nis a real connection with the purchase of health care and the payment \nbecause everywhere we have tried that, it is working to control health \ncare costs. But we refuse to do it.\n  Frankly, the reason our idea is rejected, which is changing the Tax \nCode to treat everybody the same under the Tax Code, is because the \nlabor unions don't want that to happen. That is exactly why. Everybody \nknows that is the problem. Everybody in the country knows that is the \nproblem, but we don't have the political courage to face up to how to \nfix the problem.\n  As soon as you make everybody the same under the Tax Code, you \nempower 35 million Americans who don't have insurance today to get it. \nYou save the States $1 trillion over the next 10 years, and you give 95 \npercent of Americans a tax cut, and guys like me will pay a little bit \nmore for my health insurance and income tax. But we will not do that \nbecause the powers that deliver politicians to Washington are more \npowerful than the principles and the character to follow the pursuit of \nthe Constitution.\n  This little girl in the picture, and everybody like her in this \ncountry, is at risk today. We are going to have this great big debate \nand say how bad the insurance companies are and how bad\n\n[[Page S10305]]\n\nthe government programs are. But the fact is, we don't have a \nbipartisan bill. Our ideas were thrown out, 13-10, at both the Finance \nCommittee and the HELP Committee--13-10, 13-10, 13-10--because the idea \nis they didn't want a compromise bill. They didn't want to solve the \nproblems. They wanted their way or the highway.\n  So, consequently, we are going to get a bill. I have no doubt. But my \nlittle Lucy right here and her football--she is going to lose her \nfootball. She is not going to have any little Lucys because she is not \ngoing to be able to afford them. She is going to be paying off her \n$800,000 worth of government obligations starting at age 20, and she \nwill never climb out of the pit.\n  So when America thinks about health care, there are a lot of ways to \nsolve it. One is to trust what makes America great--granted, with some \nchanges--or the other is to trust the government to create more \ngovernment programs.\n  I will just add this one point. Do you realize that in the bill that \npassed the HELP Committee there are 88 brandnew government programs--\n88; 219 times we have held the Secretary of HHS to write in-depth \nregulations. Now, 88 programs interfering in health care are going to \nbe problem enough. But 219 new sets of regulations--oh, by the way, we \ncreated the comparative effectiveness committee with the stimulus bill, \nand we are going to have 26 people tell every doctor in the country how \nthey are going to practice medicine, what is right and what is not \nright. And, by the way, in all the committees a prohibition on \nrationing was voted down.\n  What are we to think? We are going to create a large government \nprogram and grow the government by $1 trillion over the next 10 years, \n$2 billion-plus, maybe $3 trillion in the next 10 years, and we are \ngoing to have Washington tell people how the physicians and caregivers \nwill treat, what they will use to treat, and all the time little Lucy \nwill not matter if she gets sick. We will have already made her sick \nbecause we have stolen her future, her absolute future.\n  It is a cute picture, but it sends a devastating message to us as \nleaders in this country. How dare we do that. I wanted to bring out my \nother charts tonight, but I didn't want to bore everybody. The fact is, \nthe appropriations bills that were passed--if we keep doing what we are \ndoing--America, hear this--we are going to double the size of the \nFederal Government in 3\\1/2\\ years.\n  We passed the Agriculture bill today, which is 22 percent bigger, and \nit was 15 percent last year, and that doesn't count any of the \nsupplemental and the stimulus money. It doesn't take long, if you are \ngrowing something at 22 percent, for it to double.\n  My gray hair comes from the fact that I think we are missing a great \nopportunity to work together. I think we can solve the health care \nproblem. I think we can do it without enlarging the Federal Government. \nEspecially when we pay 40 percent more than anybody in the world, there \nought to be savings that we can get to make health care cost less and \nto cover everybody else. I know we have seen the studies that show \nthat.\n  So why isn't it going to happen? Why isn't there going to be a \nbipartisan bill? It is all political. It is not about the people in \nthis country, it is about the political power structure in this \ncountry.\n  Problems can be solved, common sense applied to limited government \nand restoring freedom to individuals.\n  There are going to be so many lawsuits in this country, most of them \nlegitimate, over the health care bill. You will not be able to uphold a \nchallenge to the Constitution of forcing me to pay, take my money that \nI earn privately and spend it on what you say I have to spend it on. It \nis one of the greatest denials of liberty I ever heard of, and it is \ngoing to get challenged. It is going to go through the courts fast, and \nI suspect the courts are going to uphold the citizens of this country \nrather than the power center.\n  I yield the floor or I yield back to my colleague from North \nCarolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I thank Senator Coburn for yielding. Let me \njust say the reason he is gray is because he cares. This is a Member of \nthe Senate who typically on Monday morning delivers babies, and all \nweekend long. Before he comes back to Washington, he practices \nmedicine.\n  This institution looked at what he did and said: You can't charge for \nwhat you do even though it costs you $200,000 a year to keep your \npractice open, your license in place, to buy your liability insurance. \nThey said that is illegal under Senate rules.\n  So Tom Coburn is a unique individual. He sees women who are pregnant. \nHe delivers babies. But he doesn't take any payment for it. He keeps \nhis license up to date. To some degree, it is charity care because he \nbelieves it is the right thing to do. More important, he understands \nthat what we do here affects what our children and our grandchildren \nget in inheritance from us--not financial inheritance, in opportunity.\n  Why are we passionate about the debt? Why are we passionate about \ntrampling on the Constitution? Because every time we do it, we take an \nopportunity away from the next generation. We reduce their ability to \nbe successful, whatever their definition is.\n  Tom Coburn covered it very well. We are somewhat impassioned about \nour criticism toward the bills that passed out of the HELP Committee, \nthe Finance Committee soon, and the three bills in the House. Why? \nBecause we introduced our bill first. We laid our cards on the table. \nWe offered to work in a bipartisan way with anybody, and we had no \ntakers.\n  I believe when you lay it out there and you come up with a successful \nplan, you have every right to be critical. I do question the ones who \ndo not offer an alternative. But we have offered a solution, and that \nsolution was based on three fundamental principles:\n  One, it had to cover everybody. The way our bill is structured, every \nAmerican receives the same financial stipend regardless of whether they \nwork or whether they don't, regardless of where they live. We treat \neverybody the same.\n  Two, if you are going to get cost savings, then you have to make \ndirect investments in prevention, wellness, and chronic disease \nmanagement. The Patients' Choice Act makes direct investments in \nprevention, wellness, and chronic disease management.\n  Three, is it financially sustainable into the future? We probably \nshould have started with this one versus save it for last. Why in the \nworld would we create a health care system in America if it is not \nsustainable? If it is not financially sustainable, why would we even \nconsider that legislation in the Congress of the United States? If it \ndid not pass the test of time, why would it even be worthy of debate?\n  Unless we expect people outside of America to continue to finance our \nurge to spend, then I have to tell you, we are not going to have any \nmoney--either that or we are going to have to tax the American people \nto a point where they are not going to want to be successful, they are \nnot going to want to work overtime, they are not going to want to \nswitch jobs because the benefit to them of being successful is to be \npunished by taxes.\n  This bill is filled with new fees, new taxes. True reform that \nexpands coverage would pay for itself. Think about that. If you truly \nreformed health care, would the reforms through savings not pay for the \nexpansion? Shouldn't this be a net sum game?\n  We have left out of the bill shopping across State lines for \ninsurance. It saves money. The American people are sitting there: Why \naren't you doing this? Tort reform saves money. The American people are \nsitting there: Why aren't you doing this?\n  Let me end on one that I think the American people are really plugged \ninto. Congress, which plan are you putting yourself under? You designed \nthis plan for everybody in America. Is it the plan you are going to \nhave? You know what, in the Finance Committee, in the HELP Committee, \nin the House committees, there have been amendments that said Congress \nhas to take the plan they create for the American people. That \ngovernment option, that is what Congress has to be under. It has been \nrejected every time it has been offered.\n  But you see, Dr. Coburn and I took a different approach because in \nthe Patients' Choice Act, we had to set what the basic minimum plan was \ngoing to be. Do you know what we put? The Federal Employees Health \nBenefits\n\n[[Page S10306]]\n\nProgram. We didn't put them into the FEHBP, but we said it had to be \nequivalent to what Members of Congress had. How could we ask the \nAmerican people on a plan we create to have less than we have? The \nAmerican people expect us to look after them, they don't expect us to \ngive them less than we have.\n  It was rejected every time that was offered to move Congress to their \nplan. But I think it tells you a lot about the way Tom Coburn and I \napproached the bill we worked on because we never thought about taking \nus and putting us into their plan, we thought about taking them and \nraising them to our plan. There is a big difference in that. There is a \nbig difference in looking at the American people and saying, you should \nbe here; not the American people saying, you should be where we are.\n\n  We want people to be successful in this country. Tom Coburn said this \nis not a bipartisan bill. He is right. But I will end with this \ntonight: This is also not a reform bill. If you want to talk about \nexpanding coverage, it does an equal job to what the Coburn-Burr bill \ndoes. If you want to judge it based upon reform, it accomplishes no \nreform.\n  I encourage those who are not satisfied with the options that have \nbeen presented in the House or the Senate or that will be debated, go \non Tom's Web site, go on my Web site, Google ``Patients' Choice Act.'' \nRead the bill. It is only 200-some pages, it is not 1,000.\n  The truth is, if we have a real debate--at some point, we will have \none about health care reform--I could suggest to the American people \none word that would drastically reform health care, that could replace \nall 1,000 pages of a House or Senate bill. It is called portability. It \nis called the ability for an individual employee to take their \ninsurance from one employer to another, not to be construed in any way \nbecause they have a preexisting condition, but also to recognize the \nfact that when you do portability, you change drastically the way \ninsurers look at covered lives.\n  I think the American people would be shocked to know the average \nperson is under a health care plan for an average of 4\\1/2\\ years right \nnow. Ask yourself: If I am an insurer and I am going to invest in \nsomebody's lifestyle changes and I am only going to have them 4\\1/2\\ \nyears--how much are you going to invest? The answer is, probably very \nlittle. By the time they lose weight or quit smoking, you haven't \nreaped the benefits of those savings, and all of a sudden you create \nportability. That means a 24-year-old covered by an insurance company--\nthat insurance company has an opportunity to keep him until he is 64 \nyears old, 40 years. How much are you going to invest in that insured \nif you are going to have them for 40 years? You are going to invest a \nheck of a lot because you will want to keep him well as long as you \ncan. You are going to reimburse doctors to do the education; you are \ngoing to make sure you keep them out of the hospital; you are going to \nmake sure that if they go into the hospital you get them the treatment \nthey need to get them out as quickly as you can. You are not going to \ndeny a prescription a doctor wrote for them. You are not going to \nquestion a treatment a doctor chose because all of a sudden the doctor \nis a partner to the insurance versus just a cost to the insurance.\n  You see, true reform has to change health care across the board. It \nhas to change the relationship between patients and insurers, between \ndoctors and insurers, between hospitals and insurers.\n  Ask yourself: Does the Baucus plan accomplish any of it? The simple \nanswer is no, it does not. That is why it costs $829 billion, and that \nis why to pay for it you don't get it through savings, you get it \nthrough taxing and fees. You get it through the insurance costs of \neverybody who has it. You achieve the costs by cutting Medicare, by \nknocking seniors off the health care plan they prefer. You get there by \nincreasing the income limitations on Medicaid, making States actually \npay for the expansion of 11 million Americans who are going to be \ncovered under the most inefficient health care system in the country, \nMedicaid, where only 60 percent of the health care professionals will \neven see Medicaid beneficiaries because the reimbursements are so low. \nBut we are going to grow that population by 11 million people.\n  We are doing an injustice to these people to put them in a plan where \nonly 60 percent of the health care professionals will see them. They \nwill not get the education they need for chronic disease management. \nThey will not make the lifestyle changes because Medicaid does not pay \nfor prevention, wellness, or chronic disease management, nor does \nMedicare, nor does the VA, nor does Indian Health. Show me a government \nplan that pays for prevention, wellness, and chronic disease \nmanagement, and I will quit coming to the floor and quit talking about \nthe lack of reform.\n  The truth is, the Baucus plan tries to replicate what the Federal \nGovernment has, and it does not have prevention, wellness, and chronic \ndisease management today. It will not have it tomorrow, and it will not \nhave it next year.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for your patience. I assure you and our \nother colleagues that Dr. Coburn and I will be frequent visitors here \nas we get ready for this debate, as we have this debate, and probably \nafter this debate is over, depending upon the outcome of it.\n  But let me make it perfectly clear, if any Member in this debate is \nlooking to try to achieve a bipartisan solution to health care, you can \nsign Tom Coburn and Richard Burr up today to sit at the table with you, \nto forget about who is the author of legislation, to talk about real \nsolutions to real problems that deal with health care. I am committed \nto doing it, but I am not committed to rolling over and just accepting \nanother expansion of the Federal Government and Federal Government \nspending.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, as you could hear from the remarks of the \nSenator from North Carolina and the Senator from Oklahoma, there is \nagreement on some issues. We know the status quo is not going to work \nwhen it comes to health care. We know our families cannot endure \nanother decade of double-digit cost increases every single year in \ntheir health insurance premiums. We know we can do better than devoting \na fifth of our GDP to health care, when every other industrialized \ncountry in the world devotes less than half that to health care. We \nknow the biggest drivers of our outyear budget and debt--which we do \nneed to be enormously concerned about--are rising Medicare and Medicaid \ncosts, and the biggest drivers of those are rising health care costs.\n\n  I would say, again, as I have said before, I hope we can start on \nwhere the areas of agreement are and try to work from there. Because \nour small businesses and working families all across this country, \nincluding in my State of Colorado, cannot endure another 10 years like \nthe 10 years they have endured. We will not be able to compete \neffectively in this global economy, where we are devoting more than \ntwice what any other industrialized country in the world is devoting to \njust one sector of our economy--health care--and we are not going to \nkeep the kind of commitment the Senator from Oklahoma was talking about \nto the young girl in the photograph or, for that matter, to my three \ndaughters at home, who are 10, 8, and 5. I am deeply concerned about \nwhere we are with respect to our deficits and our debt.\n  So while we are disagreeing about the outcomes, I think there is a \ngrowing understanding that the current system just will not do.\n\n\n                              Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. President, I am here to talk a little bit about Afghanistan, and \njust for a few minutes because yesterday we reached the 8-year \nanniversary of the war in Afghanistan. On this occasion, we should \nremember how unified our entire country was over our mission there when \nit began. The Nation came together after 9/11 to support our military \nas it bravely took the fight to the Taliban and the terrorists in \nAfghanistan. We had one ultimate goal: Removing al-Qaida's safe haven.\n  Our military succeeded in toppling the Taliban government, which had \nallowed al-Qaida to use Afghanistan as a staging ground and a hiding \nplace. Once the Taliban was removed from power, an international \ncoalition, led by U.S. forces, went about the long and difficult task \nof defeating al-Qaida for good.\n\n[[Page S10307]]\n\n  Yet now, 8 years later and with a new administration trying to \ndetermine America's best way forward, many Americans are understandably \nconcerned and frustrated. Afghanistan is not where any of us want it to \nbe, and our ultimate goal has not yet been met. Al-Qaida is still there \nand in Pakistan as well. Afghanistan's Government has not been able to \ntake centralized control of the country. Elections there have not added \nto the legitimacy of the Karzai government. We have been left to \nreassess our position, and we must do this reassessment together.\n  Policymakers are asking the important and right question: What are \nthe proper goals for our military effort in Afghanistan? How best can \nwe accomplish them? Are these goals purely military goals? Can they be \nbetter solved with more troops or fewer? Do we need a more complex new \nmission in our future, which the military aspect is only one small \npart?\n  Unless we are sure, unless all of us are sure that more troops can \nhelp us meet our goals, we should not send them. Our soldiers already \nhave sacrificed much. This time, in particular, is a difficult one for \nservicemembers and their families, and it is also proving to be a \ndifficult one for those of us making policy.\n  As we decide what our direction will be in Afghanistan, the fallen \nbrave soldiers we lost from Fort Carson this week are solemn reminders \nof how consequential our decisions have been and will be. Those of us \nwho opposed going to war in Iraq, including President Obama, believed \nthen it was the wrong war at the wrong time. We believed that \nWashington's focus on Iraq was diverting precious resources from our \nefforts in Afghanistan. We are still dealing with the consequences of \nthe decision to focus on Iraq, both in Iraq and in Afghanistan.\n  Recalling recent history is so important because now we have to find \nnew wisdom on Afghanistan. At the same time, all 100 Members of this \nbody know we must take great care as we make decisions that will affect \nthe lives of our men and women in uniform and their families. For every \nsoldier who answers our Nation's call to serve in combat, a new \ndeployment is akin to a new decision to go to war. That is why our \nnational purpose and their mission must be absolutely clear.\n  That is also why, as Members of this body, we must be willing to ask \nhard questions. The country will be counting on the Senate to \nscrutinize and understand the purpose of any decision to deploy \nadditional troops. As we, together, debate a new approach to \nAfghanistan, I will be motivated by the memory of the Fort Carson \nsoldiers who died this past week, as well as all those who have fallen \nin rank and Afghanistan. I know all of us feel the same way. They \nserved honorably. So must we.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to \neight young men from Fort Carson in Colorado who perished last weekend \nin Afghanistan. This was the heaviest U.S. loss of life in a single \nbattle since July 2008, when nine American soldiers were killed in \nAfghanistan.\n  In highlighting the lives of these young soldiers, I do not want to \ndiminish the loss of other brave servicemen and women who have given \ntheir lives for our country. Before last weekend, Fort Carson alone had \nlost 270 soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we must continue to \nhonor the courage of our fallen, our wounded, and those who continue \nthe fight.\n  But I hope the stories of these eight young men today speak to the \nloved ones of all the brave men and women who have lost their lives in \nAfghanistan and Iraq in recent years. I honor their service, their \ncourage, their dedication, their love of country and family. I thank \ntheir wives, husbands, children, parents, and other family members and \nfriends for their support of these brave servicemen and women. And I \nwant to express my deepest sympathy to them as they mourn their loss.\n  These eight soldiers were all from the same platoon--Bravo Troop of \nthe 3rd Squadron, 61st Cav, 4th Infantry Division, based at Fort \nCarson. The 4th BCT has worked since May to secure territory throughout \na four-province region near Jalalabad in some of Afghanistan's most \nrugged terrain, training in the nearby hills to prepare for high-\naltitude battle. A major achievement included providing security for \nAfghanistan's presidential election in August, enabling local Afghans \nto go to the polls.\n  I met with the 4th BCT commander, COL Randy George, back in April in \nColorado, before Colonel George and his soldiers departed for \nAfghanistan. I know how hard Colonel George worked to get these \nsoldiers ready for the fight, and they were ready. These eight young \nmen and their fellow soldiers fought valiantly, taking on about 200 \ninsurgents in their remote outpost in Afghanistan's Nuristan province.\n  As MAJ Daniel Chandler, the rear detachment commander for the 4th\n  BCT, said: ``They were attacked, the unit fought bravely, and in the \nend, they won the day.''\n  I would like to say a few words about each of these men.\n  SPC Michael Scusa of Villas, NJ, was 22 years old. He joined the Army \nafter graduating from high school and was on his second tour in \nAfghanistan. A former teacher said: He was a boy any mom would be proud \nto have. He leaves behind his wife and 1-year-old son in Colorado, as \nwell as immediate family in New Jersey and Nebraska. SPC Christopher \nGriffin was 24 years old. He grew up in the small town of Kincheloe, \nMI. A high school classmate said that the ``whole town'' knew that \nChristopher would enlist someday. The Army was his calling--and he was \nvery proud of it. He leaves behind his family in Michigan.\n  PFC Kevin Thomson of Reno, NV, was 22, and joined the Army in April \n2008. Friends said that he could make anyone smile, that he valued \nfriendship, and that he had a strong relationship with his mother. His \nphoto hangs in Scolari's grocery store in southeast Reno, where he used \nto work. He leaves behind his family in Nevada and California.\n  SGT Vernon Martin of Savannah, GA, was 25 years old, and leaves \nbehind a wife and three children and family in Georgia and New York. He \njoined the Army 6 years ago and had served in Iraq before being shipped \nto Afghanistan. His wife said that he hoped to work with kids someday--\nand that Vernon was the best thing that ever happened to her and their \nchildren.\n  SPC Stephan Mace of Lovettsville, VA, was 21 years old, and is \nsurvived by his family in West Virginia and Virginia. His mother said \nthat he loved sports, wildlife, and the outdoors, and that he always \nhad a smile on his face. He learned about patriotism from his \ngrandfather, who served in the CIA during the Vietnam war, and had a \nstrong love of his country and the military. Stephan's youngest brother \njust graduated from boot camp at Fort Sill--he wants to join the Army \nlike his brother.\n  SGT Joshua Kirk--originally of Bonners Ferry, ID--was 30 years old. \nHe leaves behind his wife and 2-year-old daughter in Colorado and \nmother in Idaho.\n  SGT Joshua Hardt of Applegate, California, was 24 years old, and was \nan outgoing and athletic young man--so talented at high school football \nthat his helmet was retired. When Joshua was stationed at Fort Carson, \nhe and his wife moved to Colorado together. Joshua leaves behind his \nwife and immediate family in California.\n\n[[Page S10308]]\n\n  SGT Justin Gallegos of Tucson, AZ, was 27 years old. His friends \ncalled him ``a man of excitement, courage, leadership, and kindness,'' \nand a strong man, a go-getter. He leaves behind family and friends in \nTucson.\n  There is so much more to say about each one of these soldiers--and \nabout each of the men and women who have given their lives in the \nservice of our country. Now is a time to honor their memories and pay \ntribute to them for their tremendous sacrifice and dedication to our \nNation. We will not forget you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of the senior \nSenator from Colorado and his words about soldiers in his State and \naround the country. We all share that sentiment today in the Veterans' \nCommittee. We heard from soldiers and family members about people who \ndied in the line of service, not in battle but for other reasons--\ncontaminated drinking water in some cases, in other cases open-pit \nburning. It is important we honor our men and women, as Senator Udall \ndid, but also that we, frankly, treat them better when they are in the \nservice. Their commanding officers sometimes need to pay more attention \nto that and how we treat the families of our men and women, our \nsoldiers, and our veterans. But I thank the senior Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise today \nto recognize the tragic loss of nine soldiers stationed at Fort Carson, \nCO, who were killed this past weekend in Afghanistan.\n  Last Saturday, eight soldiers from the 4th Infantry Division's 4th \nBrigade Combat Team at Fort Carson were killed in a firefight by \ninsurgents in a remote area of Afghanistan. From what we know, as many \nas 200 insurgents attacked two of our mountain outposts, and U.S. and \nAfghan soldiers responded together. The fighting lasted most of the \nday. When it was over, Fort Carson had seen our most costly day since \nVietnam.\n  These eight young men made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. \nAll Coloradans and all Americans honor their bravery and their service. \nWe owe them and their families a great debt.\n  I wish to read the names of these courageous soldiers into the \nRecord, and recognize that a ninth tragedy has also apparently now \noccurred, and say a few words about each:\n  SGT Vernon Martin was 25 years old. He leaves behind a wife and three \nchildren. After joining the Army 5 years ago, Vernon had already served \nbravely in Iraq. His wife has told people that he hoped to work with \nkids in the future. She also said he was the best thing that ever \nhappened to her and their children.\n  SGT Justin Gallegos was 27 years old. A native of Tucson, AZ, his \nfriends described him as a man of excitement, courage, leadership, and \nkindness. He is remembered for his constant smile and his generosity. \nJustin leaves behind a 5-year-old son. His family and friends will miss \nhim dearly.\n  SGT Michael Scusa was 22 years old. After graduating from high school \nin New Jersey, he joined the Army to serve his country. Michael was \nserving his second tour in the region. Before he died, he had told his \nwife that if he was killed, he wanted to be buried in Colorado Springs \nto be close to his son. This son had been named after a friend of \nMichael's who was lost in Iraq.\n  SGT Joshua Kirk was 30 years old. He grew up in Idaho where his \nfamily still lives. He had followed his childhood dream of entering the \nArmy and was serving his second tour in Afghanistan. He is survived by \nhis wife and 2-year-old daughter.\n  SPC Stephan Mace was 21 years old. Born in Virginia, he grew up \nloving sports, wildlife, and the outdoors. His mother said that he \nalways had a smile on his face. His grandfather, who had served in the \nCIA, taught Stephan what it means to serve your country. Stephan \nrecently returned home for a 15-day leave trip, and his mother said \nthat he returned to his post without fear.\n  PFC Kevin C. Thomson was 22 years old. He joined the Army just last \nyear. Originally from Reno, his friends described him as the type of \nperson who could make anyone laugh. He cared little for material things \nand put more emphasis on the people around him. His photograph hangs in \nthe Reno grocery store where he worked after high school. He will be \nmissed by his family and friends in Nevada and California.\n  SGT Joshua Hardt was 24 years old. He was described by family and \nfriends as an extrovert and athlete. He was so talented on the field, \nactually, that his high school football helmet was retired. Seeing the \nsuccesses of his older brother in the military, he followed his brother \ninto the Army. He is survived by his wife, his hometown sweetheart, who \nmoved with him to Colorado after he was stationed at Fort Carson.\n  SPC Christopher Griffin was 24 years old. Coming from a small town in \nMichigan, friends say they knew he would end up serving his country. \nServing in the Army was his longtime goal. He played football and \nwrestled in high school, and made his friends laugh. Christopher's \nfamily in Michigan is proud of his service, and his hometown has made \nplans to name a street after him.\n  In addition, we recently have learned that a ninth Fort Carson \nsoldier was killed in Afghanistan this weekend in a separate attack. \nSPC Kevin O. Hill, of New York, died on Sunday. He was 23 years old.\n  At great personal risk, these nine men braved a war in a faraway \nland. They pushed forward into great danger to protect us here at home. \nWhen asked, they answered the call of duty and performed their missions \nwith distinction.\n  Coloradans are immensely grateful for their selfless dedication, and \nour thoughts and prayers are with their families and loved ones today. \nI hope their pain is eased by the knowledge that these soldiers will \nalways be remembered and honored.\n  Let us all remember the incredible sacrifices made by nine young \npeople for America's freedom and our safety here at home. I know I \nspeak for all 100 Members of the Senate in offering America's \ncondolences and gratitude to all nine of these mourning families on \nthis day.\n\n\n                  Pennsylvania's 56th Stryker Brigade\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize the contributions of \nthe 56th Stryker Brigade which recently returned to homes and families \nacross the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. For 9 months the 56th Stryker \nBrigade has been deployed in Iraq. Here these civilian soldiers, known \nas the Independence Brigade, worked side by side with Iraqi \ncounterparts to continue to bring stability and security to the Iraqi \npeople. On the front lines they patrolled neighborhoods, targeted \ninsurgents, and swept for improvised explosive devices. They performed \nmore than 800 combined operations, captured 7 brigade-level, high-value \ntargets, and discovered more than 80 enemy weapons caches. Any success \nwe have had in Iraq is not only the result of military achievements. In \nthis regard, it is equally important to recognize the $22 million in \nreconstruction efforts the 56th Stryker Brigade assisted with in \ncoordination with an embedded U.S. provincial reconstruction team.\n  While these young men and women are now home, we must also remember \nthose who fell in battle. Two members of the 56th gave, as Lincoln said \nso long ago, ``the last full measure of devotion'' to their country. \nSPC Chad Edmundson of Williamsburg was killed by an IED, and SSGT Mark \nBaum of Quakertown was killed by enemy small arms fire. To these \nsoldiers' families and friends, I express our condolences and gratitude \non behalf of the people of Pennsylvania for their sacrifice. Please \nknow that our prayers are with you and that we will never take for \ngranted their personal courage and sacrifice. We pray for Chad and \nMark, and we also pray for ourselves, that we may be worthy of their \nvalor.\n  While deployed, many things have changed for these members of the \nPennsylvania National Guard. Some members met their sons and daughters \nfor the first time. For all our troops, a time of readjustment and \nreintegration back into their communities and daily lives lies ahead. I \nwant the National Guard to know I will always be committed to helping \nthem during this battle. I know there are other guard members who bear \nscars from battle, whether visible or not.

The biggest corporation in \n     the world was making the largest one-time investment in U.S. \n     history.\n       Three banks of GM computers analyzed 1000 sites in 38 \n     States. Then (so the ad went) the top brass answered the \n     question: ``Where is the best place in America to build the \n     highest quality car at the lowest cost, a small car that will \n     compete with the Japanese imports?''\n       General Motors hadn't spent a penny yet advertising Saturn, \n     but the intense competitions for the Saturn plant made the \n     front pages for months during 1985. As a result, twice as \n     many Americans were able to identify a Saturn as could \n     identify a Pontiac even though Pontiac had been building cars \n     since 1926 and Saturns wouldn't be produced until 1990.\n       Governors had made fools of themselves making pilgramges to \n     Detroit and sitting on stools on Phil Donahue's television \n     show arguing the merits of their States. I hadn't done that \n     but had met GM President Roger Smith in a hotel room in \n     Memphis after he made a United Way Speech. I knew that the \n     big Nissan plant, which had just located in Symrna, would be \n     either the hook or the kiss of death. So I said to Mr. Smith, \n     ``Why don't you put your plant right next to your \n     competitor's plant, and tell your union and tell your \n     management, if the Japanese can do it, you can do it, too.''\n       That's is exactly what GM decided to do. The Nissan and \n     Saturn decisions put Tennessee on the map for companies \n     looking for plant sites. (Nissan was the largest Japanese \n     investment ever in the U.S.) Then, Tennessans had almost no \n     auto jobs and one of the country's lowest average family \n     incomes. Today, thanks to the good work of Governors \n     McWherter, Sundquist and Bredesen and Tennesseeans' work \n     ethic one-third of our jobs are auto jobs and our family \n     incomes are a good deal higher.\n       The Nissan plant became the most efficient auto plant in \n     North America and will begin making electric cars next year. \n     Its future seems secure--and so does that of hundreds of \n     suppliers--who have migrated to Tennessee because it is now \n     central to the American auto industry's most efficient \n     assembly plants as well as its market and because it is a \n     right-to-work State with one of the ``best 4'' lane highway \n     systems.\n       Saturn started off with a bang, created almost a cult \n     following of owners but never made a profit. Its apparent \n     death this week when Roger Penske couldn't find anyone to \n     make Saturns so he could sell them is like any death, sad but \n     full of memories.\n       Most of the memories are good. Saturn's life was a good \n     life, for Tennesseans. It helped put us on the map, job wise. \n     It helped raise our incomes. There is still that $5 billion \n     plant there, with another billion or so spent to improve it, \n     waiting for GM or someone else to start making cars again. We \n     Tennesseans will miss Saturn but are grateful for its short \n     but good life that truly made our lives better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/08/senate-section/article/S10309-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO MARLA AND TOM LETIZIA\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Marla and Tom Letizia \non their being named ``Menschen'' of the Year by Congregation Ner \nTamid. The award is intended to reflect the ultimate values of their \ncongregation, which is to give selflessly of oneself to benefit the \ncommunity. Marla and Tom have helped make Las Vegas and Nevada a better \nplace with their business and community involvement.\n  Mr. Letizia started out as an account executive for many Las Vegas \ntelevision stations including KLAS TV-8. He founded Letizia Ad Team in \n1974. The firm specializes in television, radio, newspaper, direct \nmail, internet and outdoor advertising. Mr. and Mrs. Letizia owned \nradio and television outlets in Reno, Las Vegas, Laughlin and Tonapah \nNV. They cofounded Tonopah's first radio station, KPAH-FM, which was \nsold in 1992, and the first radio station dual signal property in \nLaughlin/Las Vegas, KROL-AM, which was later sold in 1993. The Letizias \nwere part owners of the first independent television station in Reno, \nKAME-TV, which later became a FOX affiliate before being sold in 1994.\n  In 2001, Mrs. Letizia founded Big Traffic Mobile Billboards \nWorldwide, which implements trucks that provide four-sided advertising \nspace and environmentally friendly WOBI' walking billboards. \nShe has over 35 years of marketing and journalism experience, beginning \nher career with KLAS-TV 8 as an assistant production manager and \norganizer and was subsequently promoted to director of the live \ntelevision news broadcasts at 5 p.m. and 11 p.m. She gained distinction \nas the first female director in the history of Las Vegas, as well as \nthe first female hired in production in Las Vegas, running the audio \ndepartment during production and during live news broadcasts.\n  The Letizias help their community by acting as founding members of \nthe Board of Trustees for the Meadows School. They are also on the \nadvisory board of the Make-A-Wish foundation of southern Nevada. Marla \nand Tom also compassionately care about our planet Earth. One of their \ninnovations was a green friendly walking billboard.\n  With their innovative business approach and compassionate approach to \ntheir fellow Nevadans, Marla and Tom represent this country at its \nbest. They have achieved great things and I know their future, both as \na family and a business remains, as bright as the neon lights from the \nLas Vegas Strip. I congratulate Mr. and Mrs. Letizia on their \ntremendous accomplishment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/08/senate-section/article/S10309-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10309-S10310]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

This is the final report \nfor 2009.\n  The report shows the effects of congressional action through \nSeptember 30, 2009, and includes the effects of legislation since I \nfiled my last report on August 4, 2009. The new legislation is Public \nLaw 111-68, an act making appropriations for the legislative branch for \nthe fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and for other purposes. The \nestimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are consistent \nwith the technical and economic assumptions of S. Con.

The enactment of this\n  legislation followed an announcement by the Secretary of Transportation on June 24, 2009, of an interim policy\n  to slow down payments to states from the Highway Trust Fund. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that\n  P.L. 111-46 will reverse this policy and restore payments to states at levels already assumed in current\n  level.

As a result, current level\n  excludes these items.\n\\6\\ Periodically, the Senate Committee on the Budget revises the totals in S. Con.

Mr. President, in this chamber we have witnessed \nincredibly moving eulogies and remembrances of our departed colleague \nSenator Edward Kennedy. Obituaries in national and international \nnewspapers convey the historic milestones of his life that none could \nforget, as well as more personal stories of the man that fewer knew.\n\n[[Page S10311]]\n\n  So much has been said and written since Senator Kennedy's death \nAugust 25, 2009. Many of these stories paint the picture of his family, \nhis life, his accomplishments, his legacy all of it extraordinary. Many \nof us are students of history. Indeed Senator Kennedy lived history.\n  I am reminded of the recollections of one of my predecessors as U.S. \nSenator for Wyoming, and a dear friend of Senator Kennedy, Senator Al \nSimpson. In an interview from 1997 given to the Institute of \nInternational Studies at the University of California as part of their \n``Conversation of History'' project, Senator Simpson was asked: Who was \nthe finest legislator he had ever worked with? Senator Simpson replied:\n\n       The finest legislator I ever worked with was Ted Kennedy. \n     He had a magnificent staff, he even had a parliamentarian on \n     that staff of his. So when you were in the legislative arena \n     and you were bringing your lunch and staying late, you wanted \n     to get Ted on your side or at least use some of his \n     expertise. I would go to him sometimes early on and say look, \n     you'll have to trust me, what the hell do I do right now to \n     move this bill? Boy I'll tell you he had ways to do it and as \n     you can see he uses those skills on issues in which I was \n     totally on the other side. I can't remember them all there \n     were so many. We were never on the same side. But he is a \n     legislator.\n\n  And so he was. He was a quintessential legislator. There is no \nquestion about that.\n  Most of those who have so eloquently written and spoken since his \ndeath knew the Senator much better than I Presidents, Senators, world \nleaders, and other dignitaries, members of his family and friends back \nin New England. They recall the Senator all of us in the Senate knew, \neven if only briefly a kind, caring, passionate, and deliberate figure.\n  Others have detailed his accomplishments they are legendary and \nlasting. What can I add to these recollections?\n  I was neither a close friend, confidante, nor legislative partner to \nSenator Kennedy. I was a new Senator from Wyoming when I first met him. \nBut the story I have, I would like to share, as it is meaningful and \nillustrates his larger than life personality in the U.S. Senate.\n  On June 25, 2007, I was sworn in to the U.S. Senate. Senator Kennedy \nwas one of a handful of Democrats in the Chamber. As you would expect, \nI had a lot of family members in the gallery. Later, they joined me \nalong with Malcolm Wallop, former U.S. Senator for Wyoming, and Senator \nMike Enzi in a reception off this floor.\n  As I was walking up the center aisle to leave the Chamber, there was \na booming voice that reverberated through the Chamber. ``Senator, \nSenator!'' I was new. I had been a U.S. Senator at that point for all \nof 60 seconds, so I ignored the calls. At that moment a hand grabbed my \nshoulder, I turned and heard this booming voice again ``Hi, I'm Ted \nKennedy.'' Senator Kennedy through his voice and his presence knew how \nto get your attention.\n  All of those who came to see me sworn in--family, friends from \nWyoming--they heard it too and we all broke out laughing. ``Senator \nKennedy, we know who you are.''\n  Senator Kennedy began to tell me stories of his life and about his \nvisits to Wyoming. He spoke about a trip to Rock Springs, WY, when his \nbrother John was running for President. He spoke of Wyoming casting the \nvotes to secure the nomination for John.\n  He told me about the people he had met--members of the Wyoming \nDemocrat Party at the time--relationships he had built nearly 50 years \nago. He named one after another as if he was reading from text. It was \na stunning moment to watch Senator Kennedy recall places, events, and \npeople in my home State from 1960.\n  At my welcoming reception he took personal time with my son Peter and \nmy daughter Emma, both in college. He said to them, ``So you're the \nbrother and you're the sister--you know I had some brothers.'' He \ntalked about John and Robert and Joe. A living history lesson. He \ninvited them up to his office to show them pictures and other \nmemorabilia.\n  In his office in the Russell Building he must have spent half an hour \nwith Peter and Emma going over pictures of his father Joe, mother Rose, \nand the Kennedy kids. He shared letters, notes from history.\n  I think he enjoyed it nearly as much as we did. He beamed when he \nspoke about his family.\n  Senator Kennedy leaves behind an astonishing legislative record of \naccomplishment. He achieved his goals to a degree that perhaps no other \nSenator in history has. As a public servant, he has few equals.\n  But he was so much more. Ted also leaves us with the memory of the \nman--the memory of his kindness and grace, his humility.\n  Books will detail Ted Kennedy's legislative victories. His moments in \nhistory. I will remember the moments he took to warmly and unexpectedly \nwelcome this new Senator and touch the lives of my family that day as \nwell.\n  To Vicki, we extend our family's sympathy and hope the coming days \nare filled with more love, God's grace and strength to go on. Bobbi and \nI wish the Kennedy family our best and our prayers are with you.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I was deeply saddened by the passing of \nSenator Edward M. Kennedy in August, my colleague on the Health, \nEducation, and Labor Committee, a statesman in every sense of the word, \nand a Senator not just for the people of Massachusetts but for every \ncorner of the Nation. I am grateful for the time I shared with him as a \ncolleague and as a friend.\n  Senator Kennedy may be best known in this body for his consistent \nleadership on the big national issues. Whether you agreed with him or \nnot Senator Kennedy was ``all in'' on the issues he cared about, like \nhealth care and education, and a formidable force to be reckoned with.\n  While Senator Kennedy was firm in his convictions, he was open to the \nideas of other Senators, regardless of party affiliation. As most \nSenators who worked with him know, Senator Kennedy had an unequaled \nreputation for compromise and negotiation. As legislation was being \nwritten and developed, he recognized the importance of other Senators' \nperspectives on an issue, including mine, and was therefore willing to \nalter legislative proposals for the sake of cooperation and finding \nmiddle ground with Senators from any political party. The two years I \nspent on the HELP Committee with him as my chairman were truly a \nblessing.\n  There was so much to admire about Senator Kennedy's career. But the \nthing I really admired about Senator Kennedy was his ability to look \nbeyond the beltway to take up causes that might seem obscure to many in \nthis body--causes that offended Senator Kennedy's sense of justice. Let \nme offer a few examples from my State of Alaska.\n  Federal law requires agencies to reinstate civil servants who go on \nactive duty in the National Guard and Reserves when their service is \ncomplete. The law goes by the acronym USERRA. When Bob Traut of Palmer, \nAK, completed his active duty service with the Alaska National Guard, \nhe was not reinstated to his position in the Indian Health Service. His \nposition had been eliminated and he was not offered another. He filed a \nUSERRA complaint with the Department of Labor, which was passed around \namong investigators and ultimately lost. Several years after he started \nthis process he was offered a Federal position at a U.S. Coast Guard \nbase hundreds of miles from his home. He couldn't drive to his new \nworkplace--he had to fly there because Kodiak is an island not \nconnected by road to the rest of Alaska. Even then his back pay claims \nwere lost in a morass of bureaucracy, in spite of repeated inquiries \nfrom my office. Bob Traut's fortunes changed when Senator Kennedy \ndecided to hold an oversight hearing about USERRA focused on Bob \nTraut's case.\n  The Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, the 1971 law which resolved \nthe aboriginal land claims of Alaska's first peoples, is truly one of \nthe landmark pieces of federal Indian legislation. The administration \noffered Alaska's Native people 10 million acres of land. Senator \nKennedy came to the floor on several occasions to argue that the number \nof acres should be no less than 40 million. The ultimate settlement was \n44 million acres. A settlement which might not have been possible \nwithout Senator Kennedy's leadership.\n\n[[Page S10312]]\n\n  As the chairman of the Subcommittee on Indian Education, Kennedy \njoined a few other Senate colleagues on a trip to several Alaska Native \nvillages in April 1969. Kennedy recalls being stunned by the poverty \nand despair in the villages, many of which still lack basic sanitation \nand are plagued by high rates of sexual assault, domestic violence, and \nsuicide. It affected Senator Kennedy so deeply that he found it \ndifficult to ``numb the pain.''\n  The course of Senator Kennedy's life brought him many blessings and \naccomplishments. He was a father of three beautiful children and two \nstepchildren, a Harvard graduate, a nine-term Senator with the third \nlongest time serving in the U.S. Senate in American history, a veteran \nof the Army, a talented football player who almost went pro but opted \ninstead for a life of public service . . . the list goes on.\n  My condolences and blessings go out to his family, especially his \nwife and children. Despite Ted's passing, his spirit lives on. There is \nlittle doubt in my mind that this spirit will inspire generations of \nour colleagues in the years ahead to take up his causes and ensure that \nthe vulnerable in America, the often forgotten Americans who live in \nremote places like rural Alaska, are never forgotten.\n  Ted, thank you for your service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/08/senate-section/article/S10312-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10312-S10313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING SENATOR MEL MARTINEZ\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, it is always a bittersweet moment when we \nhave to say goodbye to a colleague who is retiring from the Senate. We \nare sorry to see them go, but we are also very appreciative of all they \nhave brought to our deliberations during their years of service to the \npeople of their home State and the Nation.\n  Mel Martinez is such a person--the kind who makes the Senate the \ngreat deliberative body that it is, for Mel has a great story to tell \nof his life and how he came to the United States to pursue his own \nversion of the American dream.\n  If you would have told Mel when he was young that he would someday \nserve as an elected official in the U.S. Government, I am not sure he \nwould have believed you. He began his life in a small city in Cuba, \nunder the repressive regime of Fidel Castro. At the age of 15 he \nescaped and began to pursue his destiny in the United States. At every \nstage of his life he was determined to do everything he could to make a \ndifference. Looking back, I think it's clear he has succeeded beyond \nhis wildest dreams.\n  From the time he first arrived in the United States, Mel was grateful \nfor the opportunities that were available to him, and he was determined \nto give something back to show his appreciation for them.\n  He began in his own backyard when he served as mayor of Orange \nCounty. As a former mayor myself, I know how difficult a job that can \nbe. For Mel, it was a chance to make the lives of his neighbors and \nfellow citizens better and that became his focus and his top priority.\n  He did a good job and quickly earned the respect and support of his \nfellow townspeople. He also caught the attention of then President-\nelect George Bush who was looking for someone to serve in his Cabinet \nwho had experience dealing with housing issues and the problems that \nwere facing our cities and towns. That is something that Mel had been \ndealing with in Florida, so he became the first Cuban American \nappointed to a President's Cabinet when he was named to serve as our \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development.\n  Soon after Mel was sworn in he found himself in the middle of a \nchallenge as great as any that had ever been faced by a Cabinet \nSecretary before. In the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of \nSeptember 11, Mel was assigned the responsibility of working on the \nreconstruction of lower Manhattan.\n  Then, having served on both the local and national level, Mel then \ndecided to take on another challenge--representing the people of \nFlorida in the Senate. Mel proved to more than up to the task as he has \ntaken on a variety of issues and served on several different \ncommittees. Through it all, he has worked hard to put his principles \nand values into practice every day and he has a great deal to show for \nhis service to the people of Florida in the Senate.\n  In the years to come, I will always remember Mel's remarkable life \nstory that stems from the years he spent in Cuba living under a \ndictatorship. They were a matter of great interest to me when I was a \nstudent, but for him, it was his life. While I had only read about and \nwatched the drama unfold during my years at George Washington \nUniversity, Mel had lived it. It was a time that helped to shape his \ncharacter and mold his destiny and make him appreciate the great gift \nof citizenship that far too many of us take for granted.\n  Mel has also impressed me as a man of great faith who takes his \nrelationship with God very seriously. He shared his belief with us at \none of our Prayer Breakfasts and he impressed us all with his great \nsincerity and his unshakeable belief that God had placed him where He \nneeded him and that was why he was in the Senate. He saw it as an \nopportunity to serve God and the people back home in Florida, as well \nas those he left behind in Cuba and many more just like them all over \nthe world.\n  Too often when we say goodbye to one of our fellow members, we forget \nthat there is just as much life outside of the beltway as there is \ninside it. Our focus on Washington and our work in the Senate sometimes \nmakes us think that this is the only place where we can pursue our \ndreams and make a difference in the world around us. Mel is proof \npositive that there are many ways that we can make this a better world \nand in the years to come, as this chapter in his life ends and another \nbegins, I have no doubt we will see Mel continue his efforts to address \nthe problems of this world to ensure that those who have lived for too \nlong in fear and oppression in Cuba and all over the world will someday \nclaim the rights and freedoms we all cherish as their own.\n  Good Luck, Mel. I hope you and Kitty enjoy the years to come. \nTogether you have made a great team and we know there is still much \nmore to come in this great adventure of your lives. Good luck and God \nbless.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in appreciation and \nadmiration of Senator Mel Martinez.\n  Mel lived the first 15 years of his life under communist dictatorship \nin Cuba. That experience gave him a special appreciation for the \nblessings of liberty. As Mel's own career in public service took him \nfrom Florida to Washington, he never forgot the people living under \ntotalitarianism in his homeland. And he never wavered in his conviction \nthat the people of Cuba deserved the same rights as the rest of us, \nespecially the rights to choose our leaders, worship as we please, and \nlive in freedom.\n  Mel distinguished himself as a lawyer in central Florida, then won \nelective office as mayor of Orlando, and was appointed by President \nBush to serve as his first Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. \nSecretary Martinez helped the people of lower Manhattan rebuild after \nthe terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and he worked to expand \nopportunities for home owners nationwide. Mel was proud that he was the \nfirst Cuban-American to ever serve in a President's Cabinet.\n  Mel was also the first Cuban-American to serve in the U.S. Senate. In \nthis Chamber, he raised his voice to strengthen our national defense, \nespecially the Navy's shipbuilding program. He supported the \ndevelopment of America's natural resources in an environmentally \nresponsible way. He had a heart for victims of Alzheimer's disease and \ntheir families, and supported greater Federal research funding to help \nfind a cure.\n  Senator Martinez and I shared a concern about waste, fraud, and abuse \nin Medicare and Medicaid. So earlier this year, he and I introduced \nlegislation to do something about it. The Seniors and Taxpayers \nObligation Protection Act or the STOP Act would give Federal agencies \ngreater tools and authority to detect waste, fraud, and abuse before \nthey happen. The STOP Act has sponsors on both sides of the aisle, and \nI believe its provisions should be a part of our efforts to reform our \nhealth care system.\n  Mel served less than a full term in the Senate, but he has helped \nshape legislation that will govern our Nation for years to come. He and \nhis wife\n\n[[Page S10313]]\n\nKitty are now back home in central Florida, and Sandy and I wish them \nboth the very best.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to remember a good friend who is \nleaving the Senate after a career of public service, Senator Mel \nMartinez.\n  Mel Martinez came to the Senate in 2005 after serving as Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development under President George W. Bush. Senator \nMartinez was the first Cuban American to serve in the U.S. Senate. Born \nin Cuba, Senator Martinez arrived in the United States at age 15.\n  During his tenure as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Mel \nMartinez addressed the National Congress of American Indians, pledging \nto strengthen the government to government relationship with tribes in \nthe Federal Indian programs administered by his agency. He was keenly \ninterested in ameliorating the third world housing conditions that \nexist in the Native villages of rural Alaska. Alaska's tribe and tribal \nhousing authorities benefit greatly from Federal funding available \nunder the Native American Housing Assistance and Self Determination Act \nand other Federal housing programs, which were strengthened under \nSenator Martinez' leadership at HUD.\n  Despite the fact that the States we represent are as far away \ngeographically as States can be, we have always been good friends.\n  I was proud to serve with Senator Martinez on the Energy and Natural \nResources Committee. Senator Martinez was a close ally on energy \nissues, and he was always a fierce advocate for the interests of his \nFloridian constituents. We shared a common interest in promoting \nFederal energy efficiency standards, responsible nuclear waste storage, \nand we worked together on the 2005 Energy Policy Act. He was a tough \nbargainer on the more recent 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act \nas he aggressively pursued the interests of his constituents with \nrespect to Federal Outer Continental Shelf energy development.\n  I wish Mel Martinez and his wife Kitty the best of luck in their \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/08/senate-section/article/S10313-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10313]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          MILITARY NOMINATIONS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Mr. President, on Tuesday, October 6, I introduced S. \n1756, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act.\n  To appreciate the need for this bill, consider the case of a hard-\nworking Iowan named Jack Gross. Mr. Gross gave the prime of his life, a \nquarter century of loyal service, to one company. How did that company \nreward him for his dedication and hard work? It brazenly demoted him \nand other employees over the age of 50, and gave their jobs to a \nyounger employee.\n  Expressly to prevent this kind of discrimination, over 40 years ago \nCongress passed the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, ADEA. The \nADEA, which made it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of age, was \nmodeled on and used the same language as title VII of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964, the law that prohibits employment discrimination on the \nbasis of race, sex, national origin and religion.\n  When Mr. Gross sought to enforce his rights, a jury of Iowans heard \nthe facts and found that his employer discriminated against him because \nof age. That jury awarded him almost $47,000 in lost compensation.\n  The case was ultimately appealed to the Supreme Court. This past \nJune, in Gross v. FBL Financial, Inc., five Justices rewrote the \nrules-- indeed, effectively rewrote the law--and ruled against Mr. \nGross and other older workers. In doing so, the Court made it harder \nfor those with legitimate age discrimination claims to prevail under \nthe ADEA.\n  For decades, the law was clear. In 1989, in Price Waterhouse v. \nHopkins, the Court ruled that if a plaintiff seeking relief under title \nVII of the Civil Rights Act demonstrated that discrimination was a \n``motivating'' or ``substantial'' factor behind the employer's action, \nthe burden shifted to the employer to show it would have taken the same \naction regardless of the plaintiff's membership in a protecting class. \nAs part of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Congress formally codified the \n``motivating factor'' standard with respect to title VII.\n  Because the Age Discrimination in Employment Act uses the same \nlanguage as title VII, was modeled off it, and had been interpreted \nconsistent with the Civil Rights Act of 1964, courts correctly and \nconsistently held that a victim bringing suit under the ADEA need only \nshow that membership in a protected class was a ``motivating factor'' \nin an employer's action--the same standard for plaintiffs claiming \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, or national origin. \nIf an employee showed that age was one factor in an employment \ndecision, the burden was on the employer to show it had acted for a \nlegitimate reason other than age.\n  In Gross, the Court--addressing a question on which it did not grant \ncertiorari--tore up this settled decades old standard. In its place, \nthe Court applied an entirely new standard that makes it prohibitively \ndifficult for a victim to prove age discrimination. According to the \nCourt, a victim of age discrimination bears the full burden of proving \nthat age was not only a motivating factor but the decisive factor.\n  This extremely high burden radically undermines older workers' \nability to hold employers accountable. Bear in mind that unlawful \ndiscrimination is often difficult to detect. Obviously, those who \ndiscriminate do not often admit they are acting for discriminatory \nreasons. To the contrary, they go out of their way to conceal their \ntrue intent. Discrimination cases rarely involve a smoking gun.\n  The reality, however, is that while employers rarely post signs \nsaying ``older workers need not apply,'' ageism in the workforce does \nindeed exist, as Mr. Gross and his colleagues learned the hard way. \nIndeed, according to an AARP study, 60 percent of older workers have \nreported that they or someone they know has faced age discrimination in \nthe workplace.\n  Countless thousands of American workers who are not yet ready to \nvoluntarily retire find themselves jobless or passed over for \npromotions because of age discrimination. Older workers often face \nugly, baseless stereotypes: That they are not as productive as younger \nworkers; that they cannot learn new skills; that they somehow have a \nlesser need for income to provide for their families.\n  These stereotypes--and the discrimination they feed--are wrong and \nimmoral. This is also harmful to our economy, inasmuch as it deprives \nus of the skills and talents of millions of older workers.\n  The timing of the Court's decision is particularly troubling. As our \neconomy continues to struggle, older workers are being hit particularly \nhard. According to the Department of Labor, there are 2 million \nunemployed workers over the age of 55. This is an all-time high since \nthe Bureau of Labor Statistics began matching age and unemployment in \n1948. According to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, in 2008 \nnearly 25,000 age discrimination claims were filed, a 30-percent \nincrease over 2007. Given the stereotypes that older workers face, it \nis no surprise that, on average they remain unemployed twice as long as \nall unemployed workers.\n  The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act reverses\n\n[[Page S10314]]\n\nthe Court's decision and restores the law to what it was for decades. \nThe bill makes clear that when an employee shows that discrimination \nwas a ``motivating factor'' behind a decision, the burden is properly \non the employer to show it complied with the law.\n  The act is modeled on part of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which \npassed the Senate 93-5. As under title VII of the Civil Rights Act, \nonce a plaintiff establishes that age was a motivating factor, the \nburden shifts to the employer. If the employer establishes that the \nsame decision would have been made regardless of discrimination, the \nemployer remains liable, but remedies are limited.\n  Only the employer is in a position to know his or her own mind and \noffer an explanation as to why a decision that involves discrimination \nwas actually motivated by legitimate reasons. By putting the entire \nburden on the worker to demonstrate the absence or insignificance of \nother factors, the Court in effect gave employers license to \ndiscriminate, so long as they do not actually say they are singling out \nan employee solely because of age.\n  Finally, the Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act \nmakes clear that the ``motivating factor'' framework applies to all \nantidiscrimination and antiretaliation laws.\n  In Gross, Justice Thomas defended the Court's radical departure from \nwell-established law by noting that the Court ``cannot ignore Congress' \ndecision to amend title VII's relevant provisions but not make similar \nchanges to the ADEA.'' In other words, the Court found that because \nCongress, in the Civil Rights Act, codified the ``motivating factor'' \nframework for title VII of the Civil Rights Act, but not for the ADEA, \nCongress somehow must have intended Price Waterhouse not to apply to \nany statute but title VII. This is a serious misreading of the intent \nof Congress.\n  Unfortunately, this reasoning in Gross has already had reverberations \nin other civil rights cases since many antidiscrimination and \nantiretaliation statutes utilize similar language as title VII and the \nADEA. As the Seventh Circuit recently held, ``[Gross] holds that, \nunless a statute (such as the Civil Rights Act of 1991) provides \notherwise, demonstrating but-for causation is part of the plaintiff's \nburden in all suits under federal law.''\n  The Protecting Older Workers Against Discrimination Act, therefore \nmakes clear that Congress is in no way questioning the ``motivating \nfactor'' framework in other antidiscrimination and antiretaliation \nstatutes.\n  The aim of this bill is very simple. It reiterates what Congress said \n40 years ago when it passed the ADEA: When an employer makes an \nemployment decision it is illegal for age to be a factor. A person \nshould not be judged arbitrarily because he or she was born on or \nbefore a certain year, despite the fact that he or she still has the \nability to contribute as much, or more, as the next person. This bill \nwill help ensure that all our citizens have an opportunity commensurate \nwith their abilities, for productive employment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/08/senate-section/article/S10314-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10314-S10315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMERICA'S ECONOMIC STATE OF MIND\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to submit for the Record a \nletter I received from the mayor of Evanston, WY, William Davis.\n  Evanston is a wonderful community located in the Bear River Valley of \nsouthwest Wyoming. The town was founded in the 1800's during \nconstruction of the First Transcontinental Railroad. Today, over 11,000 \npeople call Evanston home.\n  Mayor Davis wrote to me last week. He wanted me to know that \nindividuals and communities across Wyoming are feeling the impact of \nAmerica's current economic times. This does not come as a surprise. \nWhat I found of particular interest in Mayor Davis' letter was his \nobservations regarding the primary factor driving our economy: \nAmericans' anxiety about the future.\n  Like Mayor Davis, I hear regularly from the people of Wyoming who are \nconcerned about the future of our country. They are anxious about the \nchanges being proposed in Washington. They are concerned about losing \ncontrol over their own lives to Federal bureaucracies. They are angry \nabout the financial train wreck called the Federal deficit that is \npicking up steam and headed their way.\n  Mr. President, the mayor's sentiments are shared by thousands of \npeople across Wyoming. I would ask that his letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    City of Evanston, Wyoming,\n\n                                               September 28, 2009.\n     Senator Mike Enzi,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Senator John Barrasso,\n     Dirksen Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Representative Cynthia Lummis,\n     Longworth House Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Sirs and Madam, you have already heard that sales tax \n     revenues in Wyoming have been plunging for quite some time as \n     the economic times continue to challenge the people who live \n     and work here. I am also confident that you are all well \n     aware of the impact that these lost taxes have on local \n     governments in the state-- Uinta County's sales taxes for \n     this fiscal year are down nearly 35% from this same time last \n     year. Evanston's last distribution from the Department of \n     Revenue was 48% less than for this same month last year!\n       It goes without saying that we are spending many hours \n     looking into our budgets for ways to provide city services to \n     our residents and citizens while facing head on the loss of \n     such important revenues. We will survive but it will be \n     painful to say the least.\n       This brings me to the reason for this letter. I have been \n     giving much thought and consideration to the reasons that \n     people are not spending their money on those items that \n     generate sales taxes that the local governments depend so \n     heavily upon. Without trying to pick a fight I think that \n     Congress shares much of the burden for the fears and feelings \n     that arc keeping citizens and businesses from spending money.\n       Every day we hear the news of a new $800 billion program \n     here or a $1 trillion overhaul of the healthcare system. \n     Seniors hear about a potential loss of Medicare benefits that \n     will cost them more out of pocket for many of their daily \n     needs. Young families see the prices of groceries and \n     utilities on the rise. It is harder for them to afford the \n     basic needs of their children when it comes to school \n     supplies and new clothes. They hear that energy costs to heat \n     their homes and drive their cars are going to go up because \n     of a new cap and trade bill already passed by the House \n     and awaiting action in the Senate. Businesses are stagnant \n     as well while their owners and managers wait to see just \n     what the federal government is going to change that will \n     affect the way they do business. What costs will increase? \n     Will I have to pay even more out from my shrinking bottom \n     line to cover increased costs of unemployment? Healthcare? \n     Utilities? With shrinking sales can I even afford to keep \n     my current employees let alone hire anyone additional? The \n     list just seems to go on and on.\n       Why would a business seek to expand or hire someone else \n     until these issues are all ironed out? Why would a mother and \n     father plan a vacation or purchase almost anything that is \n     not a necessity when there is so much that is unknown about \n     their future? Will there be an income? Will I have any \n     benefits? Will the prices continue to rise? How can I save \n     for my kids education expenses? What will my taxes be in the \n     future? How much higher can my credit card interest rate go?\n       These are the questions in the real world that I live in \n     everyday. I don't have to travel back to Wyoming to get this \n     perspective. I hear about it everyday when I go the store or \n     out to dinner. People share their fears and anxieties with me \n     almost everywhere I go these days. Try as I might to offer \n     some assurances that we can work together to make things \n     better my efforts are not very successful.\n       My quick solution to these problems? Tell Congress to back \n     off for awhile. Certainly there are many problems that need \n     to be addressed on the national level. We all want to have a \n     clean and healthy environment but we all want to have a job \n     as well. All of us would like to see roads and bridges \n     improved and made safer but we also need food to eat and \n     clothes to wear. No one wants to see someone suffer because \n     they don't have adequate health insurance but no one wants to \n     lose that benefit themselves because their employer just laid \n     people off or, worse yet, just closed the doors. In most \n     communities people are used to rallying and supporting their \n     neighbors when they face a sudden illness or get a terminal \n     diagnosis, but if they can't pay the rent they can't do much \n     for their neighbor either.\n       They read that the national debt ceiling just had to be \n     raised but only by a couple of trillion dollars, so not that \n     much more. The people that talk to me aren't stupid. They \n     know the day of reckoning for all of this spending is coming. \n     They are trying their best to be ready for it but they also \n     know that they won't be able to save enough today to be ready \n     for that tomorrow. They see the treasury print more money or \n     sell more of our debt to a foreign nation and they know that \n     this is not good. They used to be able to get some money to \n     cover their debts from their house but this has gone away. \n     They used to have some retirement funds in the market but \n     this has gone away. They used to\n\n[[Page S10315]]\n\n     think about retirement at some point in their lives but now \n     figure they will be working much longer now than they had \n     once thought.\n       Their decisions to not spend money really hurt on the local \n     level in Wyoming. I suspect the same is true in many other \n     states because we (local governments) do not have the means \n     to reach directly into their pockets to get the necessary \n     funds for our services like the federal and state governments \n     do.\n       People and businesses are hunkered down and holding tight \n     while they wait to see when the Congress is going to quit \n     proposing massive and expensive changes to the entire \n     landscape of the country. If this were a battlefront I would \n     say that the current strategies being employed are a well \n     thought out and all encompassing assault. We are effectively \n     being surrounded. We have no open flanks to escape through. \n     Almost every aspect of our lives appears to be exposed and we \n     have no way to cover it up.\n       I ask the question then: are we creating more panic and \n     fear with all that is going on? If we just settled down and \n     got out of crisis mode would businesses begin to expand on \n     their own? Would people once again shop without fear this \n     could be their last shopping trip for awhile? If everyone \n     just stopped and took in a very deep breath and exhaled \n     slowly would the increased flow of oxygen into the body bring \n     clearer thoughts and a more relaxing mood?\n       It is almost the first of October. It just doesn't seem to \n     me that we need to disarm and dismantle all of the world's \n     nuclear arms; create a massive overhaul of the world's best \n     healthcare system; return the atmosphere to a pre 1950's \n     condition; balance a federal budget; save every endangered \n     species; find a cure for H1N1 virus; create a vaccine for \n     HIV/AIDS; declare what is left of the public lands in the \n     west as wilderness; save the polar ice cap; become energy \n     self sufficient; tear down all of the coal fired generation \n     facilities; replace every incandescent light bulb with a \n     fluorescent one; paint every roof top in the United States \n     white; and do everything else that is being talked about and \n     have it all done by the end of this year. It makes no sense \n     to me and I don't think it makes much sense to anyone else.\n       I realize that none of you belong to the party currently \n     ``in power'' (such an awful term), but there may be something \n     that you can do to just slow things down some. The people of \n     this country need time to catch their breath.\n       Thank you for letting me share my thoughts with you. We \n     will continue to do the best we can at picking up the pieces \n     that are left to us. We will also continue to hope for bigger \n     pieces to come our way.\n           Respectfully yours,\n                                                 William R.

FORREST M. BIRD\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, today I am proud to honor and \ncongratulate Idaho resident Dr. Forrest M. Bird for a lifetime of \nservice and achievement. I had the pleasure today of meeting with Dr. \nBird and his wife Pam, and very much enjoyed that short visit. Dr. Bird \nis well and widely known around the world for his lifesaving \ninventions: the Bird Mark 7 respirator, which was the first reliable \nand low-cost respirator in the world; and the Baby Bird respirator, \nwhich has greatly decreased infant mortality rates. In addition to \nbeing a brilliant inventor and scientist, Dr. Bird is a former pilot \nand founder of the Bird Aviation Museum and Invention Center, which is \nlocated in Sagle, ID, where his company, Percussionaire Corporation, \nproduces his lifesaving medical devices. He has been the recipient of \nnumerous awards, including two Lifetime Scientific Achievement awards, \nand has been inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame. In \n2008, he was awarded the Presidential Citizens Medal by President Bush \nand received the National Medal of Technology and Innovation by \nPresident Obama just this week.\n  Dr. Bird's interest in aviation and his invention of the world-\nrenowned Bird respirators are remarkably intertwined. His father served \nas a pilot in World War I, and, after earning a degree in aeronautics, \nDr. Bird served as an Army Air Corps pilot in WWII. At the time, \nairplanes were designed to reach higher altitudes, but pilots were \nincreasingly unable to breathe as the altitude increased. Dr. Bird's \nconsideration of this problem, and his attendance at medical school \nafter the war, eventually led him to the invention of the famous Bird \nrespirator. In 2007, his twin interests of aviation and invention led \nhim to open the Bird Aviation Museum and Invention Center.\n  Clearly there is good reason for the impressive list of honors that \nDr. Bird has received throughout his life. It has been a life of \nservice that has made an incredible mark upon the world. His inventions \nhave touched, transformed, enhanced and saved the lives of millions \naround the world. His museum provides a great service to his community \nby educating and inspiring young visitors and by bringing long-lost \nmemories alive for older visitors. For his groundbreaking contributions \nto America and the world, Idaho is proud to have produced such an \nimpressive citizen. We appreciate and honor his remarkable \nachievements.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/08/senate-section/article/S10315-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10315-S10316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        REMEMBERING BRIGADIER GENERAL MILDRED INEZ CAROON BAILEY\n\n Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today I honor a woman of great \ncharacter; a woman who provided unquestionable leadership to our Nation \nand a woman who proudly hailed from North Carolina. Our State motto, \n``Esse Quam Videri,'' ``To be, rather than to seem,'' richly describes \nBG Mildred Inez Caroon Bailey; a trailblazer who thrived on challenges, \nespecially when she was told, ``it can't be done.'' As a member of the \nSenate Armed Services Committee, I am proud to recognize General \nBailey's contributions to the U.S. Army in this Chamber today.\n  Brigadier General Bailey was born in 1919 in Fort Barnwell, NC, and \nraised in nearby Kinston. Inez, as she was known to her friends, \ndirected the Women's Army Corps, WAC, from 1971 to 1975. Enlisting at a \ntime when a woman's role in uniform was unclear, she experienced \nunquestionable changes for women in the military throughout her 33-year \ncareer. General Bailey was the third female to be promoted to brigadier \ngeneral, a rank she never sought, but would never have thought to turn \ndown.\n  When she wasn't studying her favorite subject, French, Inez worked in \nher parents' grocery store. Upon graduation, she enrolled in Flora \nMcDonald College in Red Springs, NC, and later transferred to the \nWoman's College of the University of North Carolina--now the University \nof North Carolina at Greensboro. She graduated in 1940 with a degree in \neducation and one professional goal--to be a French teacher. She \neventually accepted a job teaching French in Taylorsville, NC.\n  When World War II broke out, this North Carolina French teacher \nthought a job in the Army Air Corps might be interesting, but it wasn't \nuntil a friend dragged her along to Fort Bragg that she really gave the \nmilitary a second thought. The Army needed women to take the place of \nmale soldiers who worked nonbattlefield jobs in order to free them for \nservice on the front lines. Six months after Pearl Harbor, Inez joined \nthe Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, WAAC, the predecessor to WAC, at Fort \nBragg. Although her parents were unhappy about her decision, they \nsupported her nonetheless. Although women held primarily \nadministrative, clerical and supply-type positions, she was encouraged \nto discover that women were also packing parachutes and were even \nmechanics. Due to her college degree, General Bailey was eligible for \nofficer candidate school.\n  Her first unit command was at George Field Army Air Base in Illinois. \nThere, she became very good at marching. She said, ``I didn't know any \nwomen who didn't like marching. We thought it was fun and we were proud \nof our marching, we could keep a good beat with the Colonel Bogey \nMarch!'' They even added words to the march, ``Duty is calling you and \nme. We have a date with destiny. Ready, the WACs are ready. Our hearts \nare steady, the world to set free. Service, we're in it heart and soul. \nVictory is our only goal. We love our country's honor, and we'll defend \nit against any foe.''\n  Eventually the Army made use of her background as a French teacher, \nassigning her to teach English to freed French prisoners of war who had \nbeen held in Morocco. She was thrilled to teach the soldiers because \nthey were excited to learn, unlike the high school students she taught \nbefore joining the Army. At the end of the war, the debate about women \nserving in the military continued. Brigadier General Bailey could have \nleft, but by then she was married and making, as she recalled, ``a \nmagnificent sum of $166.60 and 2/3 cents a month--much more than a\n\n[[Page S10316]]\n\nteacher's salary.'' She commanded a WAC attachment in the 98th General \nHospital in Munich, where she was the highest ranking first lieutenant, \nmale or female, in the European Command. She made first lieutenant \nwithin 6 months after she joined the service and had many great \nassignments that she described as ``wonderful assignments--but there \nwere no promotions involved, because women weren't promoted.''\n  Eventually General Bailey returned to the States where she was \ninitially assigned to intelligence work in the Military District of \nWashington before reporting for duty as a recruiter in charge of \nrecruiting women in the seven Southeastern States; including North \nCarolina. Recruiting was a turning point for Inez Bailey. She \ndiscovered she was a ``ham and loved being interviewed on television \nand making speeches.'' She led a team of recruiters who exhibited \naround the country with a program that highlighted the historic \ncontributions of women in every branch of the military. The exhibit \nincluded Belle Boyd, a Confederate spy who was a captain and honorary \naide de camp to GEN Stonewall Jackson. After recruiting, Brigadier \nGeneral Bailey became the Army's Senate liaison. She said for the first \nfew weeks, all she saw were the backs of the Senators' heads from the \nSenate galleries.\n  After 29 years of service, she was assigned to Fort McClellan, AL, as \nthe deputy commander of the training center. When General Westmoreland \nsummoned her to Washington, she asked if the meeting could be postponed \nbecause she was involved in a theater production she didn't want to \nmiss. All the while she thought, ``If General Westmoreland suggests I \nmight be the new director of the Women's Army Corps, I'm just going to \nsay no thank you. If I'm your first choice, then take the second \nchoice.'' She didn't get a chance to argue when he told her she would \nbe the new WAC director. She was needed because the Army needed to \nrecruit more women. Under her tenure the number of women in the Army \ntripled; from 13,000 to 39,000. And for the first time, women were \nallowed to command men.\n  She retired from the Army with the rank of brigadier general. Her \nmilitary decorations included the Distinguished Service Medal and the \nLegion of Merit. General Bailey will be interred at Arlington National \nCemetery on October 14. Her husband, Marine Sergeant Major Roy C. \nBailey, died in a traffic accident in 1966.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/08/senate-section/article/S10316-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING THE INTERNATIONAL FERTILIZER DEVELOPMENT CENTER\n\n Mr. SHELBY.

The Act takes effect on the date that the \nPresident certifies to the Congress that (1) an applicable waiver that \nhas been granted by the World Trade Organization (WTO) is in effect, or \n(2) an applicable decision in a resolution adopted by the United \nNations Security Council pursuant to Chapter VII of the Charter of the \nUnited Nations is in effect. The Act remains in effect during those \nperiods in which, as certified by the President to the Congress, such \nan applicable waiver or decision is in effect.\n  On July 29, 2003, the President certified that the WTO General \nCouncil had adopted a decision granting a waiver pursuant to Article IX \nof the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization \nconcerning the Kimberley Process Certification Scheme for rough \ndiamonds.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deny \nthe deduction for advertising and promotional expenses for prescription \npharmaceuticals; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nProtecting Americans from Drug Marketing Act. Health care spending is \nout of control, and this bill represents a small but significant step \ntoward reigning in unnecessary health care costs.\n  Right now, the Federal Government gives pharmaceutical companies a \ntax break every time you see a drug advertisement on TV--and for every \nfree mug your doctor receives that has a pharmaceutical company logo on \nit. These tax breaks add up to billions of dollars of lost revenue for \nthe Federal Government.\n  Pharmaceutical companies are getting a huge boost at a time when \nthousands of Americans are going bankrupt because of health care bills, \nand millions more are struggling to pay for health insurance coverage. \nThis legislation will remove these unfair tax benefits so \npharmaceutical companies can focus their dollars on developing new \ndrugs, not excessive marketing schemes.\n  Nationwide, prescription drug spending rose 500 percent between 2000 \nand 2005, from $40 billion to $200.7 billion per year. But while costs \nto patients are growing exponentially, the pharmaceutical industry is \nspending an astonishing $30 billion annually on marketing. Of course, \nthese companies have the right to advertise. But taxpayers shouldn't be \nsubsidizing these expenses.\n  Research has shown that glossy advertisements and logo-laden pens \ndon't add any value to our health care system. Instead, drug companies \nare trying to use both consumers and doctors as pawns in order to \nmaximize profits. The Federal Government should not subsidize these \nactivities.\n  It is challenging enough to navigate our health care system; the \nrecent explosion of prescription drug ads on television, on the \nInternet, and in magazines just confuses things further. Many ads \nencourage consumers to use expensive drugs over cheaper alternatives \nthat may work just as well. Other ads provide a skewed view of what the \ndrug does, minimizing the risks while overemphasizing the benefits. \nHealth care already costs enough--taxpayers shouldn't be paying to \nsubsidize these unhelpful and confusing messages.\n  Drug companies are capitalizing on this confusion. Studies have shown \nthat every dollar spent on advertising to consumers yields an \nadditional $4.20 in sales for drug manufacturers. This is a very high \nreturn on investment, and so not unsurprisingly companies have \nincreased spending on ads to consumers by 536 percent from 1996 to \n2007. That is 536 percent. In 2007 alone, pharmaceutical companies \nspent nearly $4.8 billion on these excessive marketing campaigns. This \nspending is passed on to consumers, resulting in higher prescription \ndrug costs for Americans. This bill will simply take away tax breaks \nthat encourage drug companies to do this.\n  The Protecting Americans from Drug Marketing Act is also needed to \nmake sure doctors and other providers are making decisions based on the \nbest scientific evidence. Today, doctors frequently receive information \nabout prescription drugs from the drug companies themselves. The \nProtecting Americans from Drug Marketing Act also takes away the tax \nbreak that drug companies receive for sending representatives to \nhospitals and doctors' offices to encourage them to use their drugs. \nThese representatives are the ones who leave behind the pens and coffee \nmugs--or even nicer gifts--that you see at the clinic, logoed with the \nnames of specific drugs.\n  We have created a culture in which doctors receive far too much \nbiased information about drugs--and how they can be used in unapproved \nways--from pharmaceutical reps who aren't doctors, often have no \nscientific training, and most certainly have a vested interest in \nselling the newest, most expensive products. This bill won't end that \npractice, but it will end the lucrative tax breaks that encourage it. \nFor this reason, it will help providers make medical decisions based on \nobjective, peer-reviewed research--not on biased materials from \ncompanies standing to profit from doctors' prescription pads and \npatients' wallets.\n  The Federal Government could save up to $3.5 billion every year by \neliminating these tax breaks used every day by drug companies. In this \nsmall way, we can help stem the tide of confusing and misleading drug \nads that you and your family see every day on TV and in magazines. Just \nas importantly, we can bring down the cost of health care, make \nprescription drugs more affordable for all Americans, and help pay for \nthe cost of health reform that is so sorely needed.\n  Americans are struggling just to keep their health insurance and pay \ntheir bills. Let us end this counterproductive subsidy and spend our \ntaxpayer dollars more wisely. I thank Senators Whitehouse and Brown for \njoining me in introducing this important legislation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to work with us to include it in health reform legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Brown, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Schumer, and Mr. Burris):\n  S. 1765. A bill to amend the Hate Crime Statistics Act to include \ncrimes against the homeless; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Hate Crimes \nAgainst the Homeless Statistics Act of 2009. I am joined in this effort \nby Senator Collins. I am also joined by the Presiding Officer, Senator \nBrown, Senator Mikulski, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator Schumer.\n  This week marks the 1-year anniversary of the tragic murder of John \nRobert McGraham. Mr. McGraham was a well-known member of the Wilshire \nneighborhood of Los Angeles, CA, for more than 20 years. On October 9, \n2008, he was doused with gasoline and set ablaze as he slept. By the \ntime neighbors and residents ran to his rescue, his clothes had been \nburned off and his face blackened. The attacker apparently had a \ndislike toward homeless individuals. Known for rarely asking for money \nand not bothering anyone in the community, Mr. McGraham lost his life \nbecause of his homeless status. Days after his murder, hundreds of \npeople gathered at the spot of his death and created a memorial for \nhim.\n  Mr. McGraham is just one of many homeless individuals who have \nsuffered hate crimes because they were homeless. In a popular men's \nmagazine, under the blurb titled ``Hunt for the Homeless,'' the \nfollowing was displayed: ``Kill one for fun. We're 87 percent sure it's \nlegal.'' We have heard the horrific stories: A woman sleeping was \npushed into a river; a man was beaten, soaked in beer and urine and \ncovered with trash; a woman was beaten in the face with a tire iron; \nand many more unfortunate stories. This behavior should not and cannot \nbe tolerated in our society. What kind of society would we be if we \nallowed these types of attacks to continue without standing up against \nthem?\n  The Hate Crimes Statistics Act of 1990 requires the Department of \nJustice to collect data from law enforcement agencies about ``crimes \nthat manifest evidence of prejudice based upon race, religion, sexual \norientation or ethnicity.'' In 1994, Congress expanded coverage to \nrequire reporting on crimes based on disability. Data collection \nprovides the needed information to policymakers, law enforcement, and \ncommunities so they can make informed decisions as to how best to \nproceed with the problem presented to us. The Hate Crimes Against the \nHomeless Statistics Act will again expand coverage by adding ``homeless \nstatus'' to the list of categories required to be reported on by the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  In order to measure the level of bias-motivated crimes, data is \nneeded. Currently, there is a significant problem in establishing a \nbaseline for meaningful comparison. The best way to prove or disprove \nan issue's validity is data collection. According to the National \nCoalition for the Homeless, which has tracked these types of attacks \nsince 1999, they have reported an increase in the number of hate crimes \ntargeted at\n\n[[Page S10321]]\n\nhomeless individuals in the last decade. If we take the statistics \nprovided by this coalition and compare them to the available statistics \ncurrently being collected by the FBI under the Hate Crimes Statistics \nAct, the results are startling.\n  The number of hate crimes resulting in death among listed members, \nthose in the statute, is lower than the known number of fatal attacks \non homeless individuals. Between 1999 and 2007, there were 94 hate \ncrime fatalities among the listed individuals, compared to 218 \nfatalities in the same period directed at homeless individuals. I am \nintroducing this bill today in an effort to get uniform data collection \non these attacks so that we have a uniform basis on which to know how \nserious the problem is.\n  There are approximately 3.5 million people a year who are likely to \nexperience homelessness. They are mothers, fathers, and children, and \nthey are among the most vulnerable members of our society. Veterans \naccount for 20 percent of our homeless population. Families displaced \nbecause of domestic violence make up another 28 percent of the homeless \npopulation. With increased funding to provide housing for the homeless, \nthe previous administration had seen a 20-percent drop in family \nhomelessness. However, because of the current economic crisis, an \nincrease in the homeless population has been reported.\n  The 2008 annual homeless assessment report to Congress revealed that \nthe number of homeless families, particularly those in suburban and \nrural areas, has increased. The number of families seeking shelter has \nincreased by 9 percent overall and by nearly 56 percent in suburban and \nrural areas. Our current economic crisis has reversed the progress that \nwe made between 2005 and 2007. There is also evidence that when State \nand local budgets are cut, homeless services are affected. With an \nincrease in the vulnerable population, with the government unable to \nprovide funding, at a minimum we have a duty to report senseless \nviolence against this risk population.\n  That is what I am asking, pure and simple, that we find out exactly \nhow many homeless people are being victimized in a uniform way by \nhaving reliable data and information so that we, the policymakers, can \nmake the right policy decisions.\n  Homeless people are part of America.
