Mr. President, it is my understanding the time until 7:10 \nis equally divided and controlled; is that right?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I designate the majority whip, the Senator \nfrom Illinois, Dick Durbin, to have control of that 10 minutes on our \nside.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time do we have on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, please let me know when 1 minute \nremains.\n  Mr. President, we are here on this early Saturday morning, as we lead \nup to Christmas Day, to finish work on the Defense appropriations bill. \nBut the country knows the focus of our attention, the reason we are \nhere, is because of the health care debate. We are in our 20th \nconsecutive day of considering health care, and we still do not have a \nfinal bill. In other words, we do not yet know what we are voting on, \nhow much it costs, or how it affects the American people.\n  On October 6, 2009, eight Democratic Senators wrote the majority \nleader a letter which expressed the view also of all 40 Republican \nSenators, and it said what ought to be obvious: that when debating even \na minor bill, but certainly a major bill of this magnitude, the \n``public's participation in this process''--so the letter went--``is \ncritical to our overall success of creating a bill that lowers health \ncare costs and offers access to quality and affordable health care for \nall Americans.''\n  The letter from the eight Democratic Senators continues:\n\n       Every step of the process needs to be transparent, and \n     information regarding the bill needs to be readily available \n     to our constituents before the Senate starts to vote on \n     legislation that will affect the lives of every American.\n\n  The letter continues:\n\n       The legislative text and complete budget scores from the \n     Congressional Budget Office of the health care legislation \n     considered on the Senate floor should be made available on a \n     website the public can access for at least 72 hours prior to \n     the first vote to proceed to the legislation. Likewise, the \n     legislative text and complete CBO scores of the health care \n     legislation as amended should be made available to the public \n     for 72 hours prior to the vote on final passage of the bill \n     in the Senate. Further, the legislative text of all \n     amendments filed and offered for debate on the Senate floor \n     should be posted on a public website prior to beginning \n     debate on the amendment on the Senate floor. Lastly, upon a \n     final agreement between the House of Representatives and the \n     Senate, a formal conference report detailing the agreement \n     and complete CBO scores of the agreement should be made \n     available to the public for 72 hours prior to the vote on \n     final passage of the conference report in the Senate.\n\n  Mr. President, that is wise advice from Senator Lincoln, Senator \nBayh, Senator Landrieu, Senator Lieberman, Senator McCaskill, Senator \nNelson, Senator Pryor, and Senator Webb. What they are saying is, \nbefore we vote on a health care bill that affects nearly every 1 of all \n300 million Americans we ought to have 72 hours to read the bill and \nknow what it costs. We know the current version, when fully \nimplemented, will spend $2.5 trillion, which the Chief Actuary of the \ngovernment says insofar as we know it will increase the cost of health \ncare rather than reduce it. We know that the version we have seen so \nfar will take $1 trillion out of Medicare when the bill is fully \nimplemented and not use it to strengthen Medicare--which is becoming \ninsolvent in the years 2015 to 2017, according to the trustees of \nMedicare--but instead would spend that money on some other program. We \nknow it would--as David Brooks in a New York Times column said \nyesterday--create a huge tax, $1.42 trillion in the second decade of \nits operation to help pay for this, which the Director of the \nCongressional Budget Office has said would inevitably be passed along \nto consumers and cause premium costs to go up, not down. And we know it \nwould expand Medicaid, the other large government program we already \nhave for low-income Americans, sending a bill of $25 billion to the \nStates that has been roundly denounced by almost every Governor in the \ncountry, Democratic and Republican.\n  Because at a time when the States are struggling more than they have \nsince the Great Depression with their own budgets, when they cannot \nprint money, when they have to balance their budgets, we are expanding \nhealth care and sending them a huge bill to help pay for it. This \ninevitably will force States to raise taxes, raise college tuition; \nand, in my State, the Governor is considering releasing up to 4,000 \nnonviolent offenders from the prisons as a result of some of the \nbudgetary pressures that are on him.\n  So that is what we do know about the bill. But we do not have the \nfinal version of the bill. Yet it is said we should vote on this by \nChristmas when, in fact, most of the provisions of the bill do not take \neffect until 2014. That is 4 years from now. Only a few provisions \nstart right away. Mr. President, $73 billion in taxes start right away. \nMedicare cuts start right away. Mandates start right away. A few \nbenefits start right away.\n  But, basically, the thrust of this massive legislation that affects \n17 percent of our economy does not take effect for 4 years. So if we do \nnot have the bill, and if most of the legislation does not take effect \nfor 4 more years, then why are we spending this time staying up all \nnight, rushing to enact the bill by Christmas?\n  I believe it is because the majority knows the longer the public sees \nthe bill, the more they know about it, the less they will like it, and \nthey want to try to pass it before people know what is in it. \nOtherwise, we would already have the bill. Otherwise, we would be \ntaking the time we took with the farm bill, with the Education bill, \nwith the Energy bill, with other major legislation that takes 5, 6, 8, \n10 weeks. Otherwise, we would have worked across party lines and had \nmany different kinds of views. So this is a rush.\n  There has been a lot of talk about making history on health care. The \nproblem is, there are different kinds of history. In this case, the \nDemocratic majority seems to be determined to pursue a political \nkamikaze mission toward an historic mistake. If it succeeds, the \nresults will be disastrous for the Democrats in 2010, I would predict. \nBut, unfortunately, it will be a bigger disaster for our country.\n\n[[Page S13473]]\n\n  Now, this will not be Congress's first historic mistake. The Smoot-\nHawley tariff of 1930 ``to buy American'' sounded pretty good. It \nsounded like a good way to protect jobs by keeping foreign products \nout. But historians agree it was an historic mistake, setting off \nretaliatory waves, tariffs, and making the Great Depression worse.\n  The Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 sounded good too. The idea was, \nlet's protect the country from enemies within our midst, mostly French \nthen. But that turned out to be an historic mistake encouraging more \nprotests and offending our traditions of free speech.\n  In 1969, the Congress found 155 Americans who were not paying taxes \nand said: Let's have a millionaires tax. That sounded good too. It \nturned out to be another historic mistake. Last year, it caught 28 \nmillion Americans before we rushed to patch it, to fix it for a year.\n  More recently, there was the Catastrophic Coverage Act of 1988 to \nhelp seniors deal with financial losses. The trouble is, seniors \nresented paying for it, and angry crowds surrounded the chairman of the \nHouse Ways and Means Committee in his home district. Congress repealed \nthat mistake, and the leader of those angry seniors is now a \nCongresswoman from Illinois.\n  Then there was the luxury tax on boats in 1991. That sounded good: We \nare going to get all those people who have boats that cost more than \n$100,000. The trouble was, it raised about half the revenue projected, \nand it nearly sank the boat industry, putting 7,600 people out of work. \nA change in Congress repealed that one too. Rather than make history of \nthis sort, Congress should learn from history. We should take Governor \nSchwarzenegger's advice this week.\n  He suggested:\n\n       So I would say, be very careful to the federal overnment \n     before you go to bed with all this. Let's rethink it. There's \n     no rush from one second to the next. Let's take another week \n     or two and come up with the right package.\n\n  The Governor, of course, was concerned about the Medicaid expansion \ncosts in his State--$3 billion for California. He said:\n\n       [The] last thing we need is another $3 billion of [state] \n     spending when we already have a $20 billion deficit.\n\n  So why the rush? We do not have the bill. We have plenty of time to \ndeal with this. Most of it does not take effect for 4 more years. And \nwhat if in trying to fix everything all at once we get it wrong--will \nCongress be rushing back to fix health care again? Because if Congress \nmakes another historic mistake, it will not be nearly as easy to fix as \nrepealing a boat tax.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we met before 7 a.m. on this Saturday \nmorning, and I am reminded of the famous quote:\n\n       Neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays \n     these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed \n     rounds.\n\n  A snowstorm has struck Washington, DC. Yet 100 Members of the Senate \nwill be called on in less than half an hour to be on the floor of the \nSenate to vote at this early morning hour. And for any who are hale and \nhearty and up watching or following this debate, the obvious question \nis, why? Why is the Senate in? What is it doing?\n  Well, we are in because the Republican Senators are filibustering the \nDepartment of Defense appropriations bill. This is the money for our \ntroops, for our military, for their families, for their health care, \nfor their equipment, for their paychecks. It is a bill which usually \npasses with a few patriotic speeches and little controversy. Yet the \nRepublicans have held us now. This is the third day on the floor \nbecause they are filibustering the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill.\n  You might ask yourself: What is happening? Has the Republican Party \nturned on America's military? I do not think so. I think, in fact, they \nsupport America's military. But they are willing to use them and use \ntheir spending bill as part of their parliamentary procedure.\n  We know what this is all about. It is about delaying the business of \nthe Senate and not just health care. They want to delay everything in \nthe Senate. That is their strategy. That is what they have to offer to \nthe American people. Not ideas, not alternatives, not solutions, but \ndelay.\n  I suppose they think that is a winning way. The Senator from \nTennessee just predicted in the next election the American people will \nrally behind this strategy of theirs of doing nothing, of failing to \nrespond to the challenges facing America. I see it otherwise. I have \nthis simple analysis of why I am here. The people of Illinois sent me \nhere to try to do a good job for them and make some good judgments on \nthe Senate floor, but basically to help improve their lives. If you do \nnothing, if you deny, if you filibuster, if that is all you do, you \ndon't have much to show for it at the end of the day.\n  The record is pretty clear. We have been debating health care reform \nfor more than 2 weeks, about 19 or 20 days of debate, on a 2,000-page \nbill. The Senator from Tennessee complains: Well, we just don't know \nwhat is in this bill. This bill has been posted on the Republican \nSenate Web site for more than 2 weeks. I think they know what is in it.\n  Do you know how many amendments they came up with to change the \nlanguage of this bill in the span of 20 days? How many bright, creative \nRepublican ideas came up to change this bill in 20 days? Four, four \namendments in 20 days. The combined wisdom of the Republican Senate \ncaucus came up with four amendments to this bill of 2,000 pages in 20 \ndays and six different motions to send the bill back to committee and \nstop talking about it.\n  Now the Senator tells us: We just need more time.\n  You have had time. You have had plenty of time. You have had time to \noffer your substitute. We have been waiting on the Republicans to come \nforward, if they think America's health care system could be improved, \nwith their ideas. The Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, has said he \nhas a plan. He never offered it. I don't know if he tried to offer it, \nif the Republican leadership turned him down. He never offered it.\n  Senator Grassley from Iowa said on the Senate floor: We have a plan.\n  Where is this secret plan? Where is the Republican plan for reforming \nhealth care? Carefully hidden, secreted away in a cloakroom? Is it \nunder a snowdrift in a parking lot? What have you done with your plan? \nYou don't have one. If you go to the Republican Senate Web site and \nlook for health care reform, you will find it. You will find the \nDemocratic bill because, frankly, they have nothing to offer.\n  Now comes the Senator from Tennessee and he says stop what we are \ndoing. Let's stop right now. Our plan is to slow down, filibuster the \nDefense appropriations bill, and then slow down everything that comes \nafter it in the hope that we will stop and do nothing. He argues that \nis good for the American people. Let me tell my colleagues what the \nSenator from Tennessee will risk for the American people if he has his \nway.\n  We know immediately--immediately--the doughnut hole in the Medicare \nprescription Part D for seniors is going to be filled across America. \nWhat it means is seniors who have a gap in insurance coverage for \nprescription drugs will have that filled. Eight million seniors in 2007 \nhit that doughnut hole because they had medical bills more expensive \nthan what Medicare covered. We are going to fill that doughnut hole. By \n2010, seniors across America, immediately, will see the benefit.\n  The Senator from Tennessee says: This bill will destroy Medicare. Not \nquite true. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office says this bill \nwill put Medicare on sound footing. Medicare untouched will go broke in \nabout 8 years. Medicare, because of this bill, will have another 10 \nyears of sound financial footing--exactly the opposite of what has been \nstated on the floor of the Senate.\n  How many parents get worried because their kids are in college and \nthey are on their family health care plan and they are about to \ngraduate and they wonder if they are going to have health insurance. \nWell, in most places across America, most policies, by age 24 your \ndependent child is no longer covered by your family plan. Immediately, \nwith the passage of this bill, we are going to extend coverage, \nproviding immediate help for 13 million to\n\n[[Page S13474]]\n\n14 million young Americans no longer in college and not covered by \ntheir own employment insurance, not eligible for their parents' \ncoverage. They are going to have coverage under this plan.\n  Only 6 months after the enactment of this bill, insurers will be \nrequired to permit children to stay on family policies until age 26, in \nthe year 2010. So when the Senator from Tennessee says nothing happens \nuntil 2014 except collecting taxes, he is mistaken. That happens. \nIt happens immediately.\n\n  Free prevention services are going to be available as well--\nprevention services that will help a lot of people avoid serious \nillness. Today, many Americans pay 20 percent of the cost of many \npreventive services. Millions have no access to them at all. The Senate \nbill will require coverage of prevention and wellness benefits. For \nseniors, the Senate bill is going to provide free annual wellness \ncheckups, immediately.\n  There is insurance reform as well. The Senator from Tennessee keeps \noverlooking this, and he shouldn't. One of the biggest ripoffs for \nAmerican consumers are health insurance companies that turn you down \nbecause of preexisting conditions and a variety of other reasons they \nfind not to cover you. This Senate bill will give Americans the \nopportunity to focus on healthy living, will put patients first. It \nwill eliminate abuses by insurance companies. It immediately bans \nrescissions, the practice where health insurance companies cancel your \npolicy. Six months after enactment in 2010, insurers are prohibited \nfrom imposing lifetime limits on benefits. These are immediate \nbenefits.\n  We know what the Republican playbook is because they gave it to us--\nmaybe not intentionally. But early on, 8 months ago, the Republican \nstrategist Frank Luntz sent out a memo before the bill was even written \nand said: Here is how we can defeat health care reform. That suggests \nto me there was never a good-faith effort at the top in the Republican \nParty to even consider health care reform. Frank Luntz went through all \nthe things to defeat health care reform even before the bill was \nintroduced, talking about rationing and denial and talking about \ngovernment programs and so forth and so on--buzz words. Then, the \ncurrent inspiration of the Republican National Party, Michael Steele, \nthe Republican National Committee chairman, a man I am sure the Senator \nfrom Tennessee holds in the highest esteem, recently shared with us the \nfollowing in a memo. Chairman Steele wrote:\n\n       I urge everyone to spend every bit of capital and energy \n     you have to stop this health care reform. The Democrats have \n     accused us of trying to delay, stall, slow down, and stop \n     this bill. They are right.\n\n  Chairman Steele says, his words: ``Delay, stall, slow down, and \nstop.'' And for 8 months that has been the Republican strategy.\n  Unfortunately, that strategy now applies to the Department of Defense \nappropriations bill which we will vote on this morning. One hundred \nSenators will trek through the snow and come in early this morning to \nvote on a bill which we should all support unanimously. They will try \nparliamentary efforts to stop the bill, derail the bill, even though \nthe continuing resolution expired last night.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I hope we can gather enough bipartisan support for our \ntroops this morning, have a cup of coffee, and go home to our families \nsoon to celebrate the holiday season.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 5 of the 10 \nminutes I have be reserved for the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. President, I withdraw that request.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I will be using some of the leader's \ntime, and if the leader decides to step in, all he has to do is signal.\n  I wish to, first of all, say how much I appreciate the leader, \nSenator McConnell, the Republican leader for the heroic efforts he has \nmade in the last few weeks to try to assure that the American people \nknow what is in the bill that will be put before us very soon. Now, I \nsay put before us very soon because we don't know what the substitute \nbill is that has been worked on for the last few days. We haven't seen \nit yet. I think that brings up an important point.\n  I am hoping the distinguished majority leader, who is also on the \nfloor, will allow America, as well as Senators certainly, to see the \nmanagers' amendment which includes all of the changes in the bill that \nis before us before we are forced to vote on this monumental piece of \nlegislation.\n  When I am talking to my constituents back home, my friends, the \npeople who just come up to me on an airplane, they say: What are you \ndoing? Why is this being rushed through when it is one-sixth of our \neconomy, when it is quality of life for every American, when we are \ntalking about jobs in the private sector that will be sacrificed for a \nbig government takeover, more government jobs, fewer private sector \njobs. People are saying: What are you doing?\n  When I was talking about the taxes that are going to take effect in 2 \nweeks, before the bill takes effect 4 years from now, people were \nsurprised. Even very informed people who read all the major newspapers, \nthey said: What? The taxes are going to take effect 4 years before the \nbill takes effect? I mean, what are you all doing? Has Congress ever \ndone that before?\n\n  I couldn't remember a time when Congress would pass taxes for 4 \nyears, purporting to put together a new program, and then all of a \nsudden, after 4 years, the program would start but the taxes have \naccumulated, and it is going to be $75 billion that will have \naccumulated before any implementation of the bill that is before us.\n  So I have heard the criticism on the floor that Republicans are \ntrying to slow this down, that they are trying to stop this bill. It is \nvery important that this health care bill be slowed down so that not \nonly the Senate but the people of America can look at this and \ndetermine how it affects them personally, so they can look at what the \nproposed options are going to be. They can look at the taxes. They can \nlook at the mandates. They can look at the small business requirements \nthat could actually cost jobs.\n  Now, one might say: Well, if it costs a few jobs, maybe there is a \ngreater good. We are in the toughest recession we have been in since \nthe 1940s, since World War II. We are in the toughest recession we have \nbeen in, and here we are maybe stopping job increases or maybe adding \nto the unemployment figures which are the highest in 40 years in our \ncountry.\n  So I know the American people are saying: Why? Why push this through? \nWhy push it through so fast when we are talking about maybe losing jobs \nin an economic downturn, when people are already hurting. Even the \npeople who are employed are afraid that maybe they are going to be laid \noff because times seem to be getting tougher out there. We hear that \nthe buying season, the Christmas season, is not going as well as \nretailers have come to expect to try to make their yearly requirements \nto make their profits.\n  What does that mean? If we do not make those profits, then people are \nnot buying and people are not going to be hired and maybe people are \ngoing to be laid off.\n  I do not think this is the time to be talking about losing jobs, \nsomething that is going to increase the burden and the mandate and the \ntaxes on our business.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I strongly support the Defense \nappropriations conference report for 2010, H.R. 3326. This bill \nprovides funding for our troops in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere. I \nthank the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee, Senators Inouye and Cochran, as well as other committee \nmembers, for their efforts to develop this vital legislation.\n  This bill keeps our commitments to our troops and military families. \nThe bill provides a 3.4-percent military pay raise, $29.2 billion for \nthe Defense Health Program, including $120 million for traumatic brain \ninjury and psychological health research. The measure also includes \n$472 million for family advocacy programs which include quality \nchildcare, job training for spouses, and expanded counseling for \nfamilies experiencing stress due to deployments.\n\n[[Page S13475]]\n\n  In order for our military to continue to perform at its best, we must \ncontinue to provide ample funds for training and readiness accounts. \nThis bill provides $154 billion to increase the readiness and training \nof our troops. Funding is being adjusted to ensure that we are training \nfor the conflicts of today and those in the future.\n  Continuing our strong support for our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nthe bill includes over $23 billion for equipment to be used in the \nregion. This includes $6.3 billion to complete procurement of over \n6,600 Mine Resistant Ambush Protected, MRAP, all-terrain vehicles to \nprotect our troops; $1.1 billion for High Mobility Multi-Purpose \nWheeled Vehicles, HMMWVs; and $950 million for the National Guard and \nReserve equipment accounts.\n  I am also pleased that this bill includes just under $200 million for \ndefense projects in the State of Hawaii including many of the projects \nwhich I requested. This includes a standoff improvised explosive \ndevice, IED, detection program, a virtual combat training program, and \nan anti-corrosion effort to extend the life of weapons systems. These \nare examples of programs in which innovators in Hawaii produce systems \nand products which will enhance military capabilities.\n  In addition to doing right by our troops, this bill also includes \nmeasures that will help other segments of our country.\n  Small business represents a vital part of our economy, but many small \nbusiness owners are having difficulties securing loans in today's \neconomic climate. This bill includes a measure which will allow the \nSmall Business Administration, SBA, to extend enhancements to its loan \nguarantee program which will free up capital by making loans more \nattractive.\n  The bill also includes an extension of unemployment insurance \nbenefits. As many of our citizens continue to navigate a difficult \nlabor market, it is vital that we continue to provide benefits for the \nunemployed.\n  In addition, this bill includes an extension for COBRA subsidies. It \nextends from 9 to 15 months the 65-percent COBRA health insurance \nsubsidy for individuals who have lost their jobs. This vital program \nwill help those who have lost jobs keep their health insurance.\n  These are just some of the projects and programs this important bill \nwill fund for the 2010 fiscal year. I appreciate the hard work of \nChairman Inouye, Ranking Member Cochran, and the rest of the \nAppropriations Committee for bringing this conference report before us, \nand I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I strongly oppose this fiscally \nirresponsible and misguided bill. While the bill includes many good \nprovisions, it will also fund a massive troop surge in Afghanistan that \nwill overburden our troops and will likely hurt, not help, our efforts \nto eliminate the global threat posed by al-Qaida and its affiliates. \nAnd it is stuffed with earmarks and wasteful spending, such as $2.5 \nbillion for 10 C-17s that the Defense Department does not want and $130 \nmillion for a Presidential helicopter program that has been cancelled.\n  While I will vote against the Defense appropriations bill, I am not \ngoing to be part of a partisan and cynical effort to delay passage of \nthe Defense bill in order to block the Senate from considering health \ncare reform. That is why I voted to end debate on the Defense \nappropriations bill, so the Senate could conduct a final vote on that \nbill and return to debating and voting on health care reform \nlegislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I hope we can have a bill that will be bipartisan \nthat we can all support.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, my understanding is there is 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I direct this question to my distinguished \ncolleague, Senator McConnell, who is on the floor. Is my distinguished \nfriend going to use any of his leader time this morning?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. No.\n  Mr. REID. To my friend from Texas, whom I care about a great deal--\nshe is a member of the Appropriations Committee. I am disappointed she \nspent all morning not talking about the bill before us; namely, the \nbill that is going to fund our troops. That is why she is here. It is \njust after 7 in the morning in Washington. It is just after 4 a.m. in \nNevada. Those watching around the United States may be wondering why we \nare voting at this rare hour, early on a Saturday morning, in what is \nshaping up to be the worst snowstorm in Washington's history.\n  The reason is very simple. We have work to do. We are going to \nsupport the troops, to make sure they have all the resources they need. \nI am confident my Republican colleagues will join with us in that \nregard.\n  I also say to my friend from Texas and others, it is as if they are \nin some other universe. First of all, we offered a unanimous consent \nrequest as soon as these proceedings started dealing with health care. \nI said:\n\n       I ask unanimous consent that no amendment be in order to \n     the Reid substitute amendment . . . unless the text . . . of \n     the amendment is posted on the home page of the official \n     Senate Web site of the Member of the Senate who is sponsoring \n     the amendment prior to the amendment being called up for \n     consideration by the Senate and the amendment is filed at the \n     desk. Further, that this unanimous consent request be in \n     effect for the duration of the consideration of [this bill].\n\n  That is pretty direct. Offer an amendment and people should be able \nto see it. Guess what. The Republicans objected to that. Here is \nexactly what the senior Senator from Wyoming said:\n\n       In light of some of the trust problems and transparency \n     problems we have, while this appears to lead to greater \n     transparency . . . I object.\n\n  Something that creates transparency, they object because it does not \ncreate transparency.\n  Let me just say, we are going to finish this Defense bill. We are \ngoing to move on, at the appropriate time, and vote on the so-called \nmanagers' package, which will save lives--along with the other bill \nthat is now before the Senate on health care--save money, and save \nMedicare. There are immediate deliverables.\n\n  I don't know what in the world the Senator from Texas was talking \nabout. Something that is picked up on talk radio? I don't know. But it \nis not anything that deals with reality. We are going to do away with \npreexisting disabilities. The letters we receive from around the \ncountry, what insurance companies do is incredible. We will insure 31 \nmillion new people--pretty good, 31 million. Thousands of primary care \nphysicians will be created and thousands of community health centers, \nwhich we should have been doing a long time ago.\n  I can remember, as a new Senator, that seat right there in the back \nof the Chamber was held by the famous Pat Moynihan. We were, at that \ntime, dealing with homelessness. That was the issue of the day. He \nturned around to me, a new Senator, and said: This is ridiculous. The \nreason there are so many homeless is because we did not do our job. \nWhen the insane asylums, the mental institutions were emptied, because \nwe had medicine that would take care of these people in institutions, \npart of the deal was we would have community health centers to have \nthem come and get their medication, have them taken care of. We didn't \ndo that, and that is why we have so many homeless people. This bill is \ngoing to alleviate most of that.\n  We have something in this legislation called the CLASS Act, which \nwill offer for the first time in the history of this country for people \nwho are working to plan ahead in case they become disabled. It is fully \npaid for. CBO said, in the far future, decades and decades into the \nfuture, it is paid for. I did not use a penny of that money for the \nbill that is before the Senate.\n  Again, I say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I am sorry \nthis has been such a method of just saying no to everything--\neverything, everything. It is too bad we didn't have a little more \nhelp. We received none. We hope they will join with us, the minority, \nas did the Republicans in the House of Representatives, and support the \ntroops, 395 to 34. Out of 435 Members, only 34 voted against that bill. \nDemocrats and Republicans--overwhelming majorities--over 90 percent of \nDemocrats and Republicans in that\n\n[[Page S13476]]\n\nHouse supported that bill. That is what we need to do in a show of good \nfaith for the men and women fighting around the world.\n  For example, in Afghanistan, I read the morning news from Nevada. The \nNevada National Guard, in the mountains of Afghanistan, had a vicious \nfirefight lasting more than a day, chasing these evil people through \nvillages. Many of them were killed. One Nevadan was wounded. That is \nwhat this legislation before this body is about.\n  I hope we can do what needs to be done.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the motion to concur in the House \namendment to the Senate amendment with amendments, and I ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I regret that I was unable to be \npresent to vote for the final passage of H.R. 3326, the Department of \nDefense Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010, but had I been \npresent, I would have supported it.\n  This Act will provide $636.3 billion in funding for the Department of \nDefense, including nearly $125 billion in funds that will directly \nsupport the men and women fighting at the frontlines of this Nation's \nwars. I am honored to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, \nwhich drafted the law authorizing these funds, and thank my colleagues \non the Senate Appropriations Committee, led by Chairman Daniel Inouye, \nfor their hard work guiding this bill to its final approval.\n  This bill will do much to both protect our service members overseas \nand improve their lives at home. It will provide $6.3 billion to \nprocure additional\n\n[[Page S13477]]\n\nmine resistant ambush protected, MRAP, vehicles and more than 6,600 \nMRAP all-terrain vehicles, MRAP-ATVs, which will save countless lives \nin Iraq and Afghanistan. For our service members and their families, it \nwill also provide a 3.4-percent pay raise, additional funding for the \nDefense Health Program, and $120 million to support research for \ntraumatic brain injury and psychological health research.\n  I am particularly proud of the critical role that Connecticut plays \nin supporting our Nation's defense, a role that this act reaffirms. \nConnecticut workers are essential to building critical equipment and \nsystems that account for nearly 15 percent of the $104.4 billion in \nprocurement funds provided in this bill. These include the Virginia \nclass submarine, the Blackhawk family of utility helicopters, the \nengines that power the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the powerful radar on \nthe Joint STARS aircraft, and even the Colt carbine that our soldiers \ncarry at the frontlines of battle. There truly is a Connecticut worker \nsupporting every member of the U.S. Armed Forces.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to my friend, the Senator from \nOklahoma, and he thinks this is appropriate. He wants to speak, and we \nhave known that for some time. So I ask the following unanimous consent \nrequest: I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of 10 minutes \nfor Senator Stabenow and 10 minutes for Senator Durbin, Senator Coburn \nbe recognized; that at the conclusion of his remarks--and he said he \nwill probably take a couple of hours--the Senate then stand adjourned, \nafter he completes his remarks, until 1 p.m. tomorrow, Sunday, December \n20; that on Sunday, following the prayer and pledge, the Journal of \nproceedings be approved to date, the morning hour be deemed expired, \nand the time for the two leaders be reserved for their use later in the \nday, and that the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 3590, and that \nthe time until 1:30 p.m. be equally divided and controlled between the \ntwo leaders; that beginning at 1:30 p.m. and until 11:30 p.m., Sunday, \nthere be alternating hour blocks of time, with Republicans controlling \nthe first hour block; that at 11:30 p.m., Sunday, the Senate then \nrecess until 12:01 a.m., Monday, December 21; that following the prayer \nand pledge, the time until 1 a.m. be equally divided and controlled \nbetween the two leaders or their designees, with the majority leader \ncontrolling the final 10 minutes prior to 1 a.m., and the Republican \nleader controlling the 10 minutes immediately prior to that; that at 1 \na.m. the Senate proceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on the \nReid and others managers' amendment; and that today the debate of \nSenators Durbin, Stabenow, and Coburn be for debate only; and that also \nfor Sunday the same thing. I did not mention that before.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I do \nnot intend to object, but I want to make a parliamentary inquiry prior \nto us doing that. And the inquiry is this: Based on the second-degree \namendments just filed by the majority leader, as well as the \nelimination of their language, is it, in fact, the effect that no other \namendments will be allowed on this bill?\n\n[[Page S13479]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are no available amendment slots at this \ntime.\n  Mr. COBURN. Further in my parliamentary inquiry, if there were \namendments available, could they be filed on this bill?\n  Mr. REID. I am sorry, I could not hear my friend.\n  Mr. COBURN. If, in fact, amendments were available, could amendments \nbe filed to this bill and made pending?\n  I will restate my inquiry to the Chair. Is it, in fact, a fact that \nbecause of the filling of the tree by the majority leader, the \nopportunity to amend the bill before us will be limited?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. Thank you.\n  I do not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this may surprise everyone, but tomorrow is \nthe shortest day of the year, December 21. We start longer days after \nthat.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I just want to take this opportunity to \nthank the clerks. I know it has been a challenging experience to have \nto read for the last 7 or 8 hours, but I just wanted to thank them for \ntheir good work and good spirits in the holiday season; and for those \nwho substituted during the process, I hope you will extend to them our \nthanks as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is very nice of the Republican leader to \nrecognize them. I join in his remarks, and not only the reading, but \nthe long, long hours they have had to bear over the last several weeks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I do not see the Senator from Michigan on \nthe Senate floor. I hope she will not be upset if I go first. I had \nspoken to her earlier about a 10-minute statement, and she is to have a \n10-minute statement, as well, relative to this managers' amendment.\n  We just spent the last 7\\1/2\\ or 8 hours having the clerks dutifully \nread this 383-page amendment. During that period of time, many of us \nhave had a chance to read it ourselves. We have had staff explain it to \nus, and for those who are wondering what has happened, we can tell them \nthe following.\n  Originally, we offered this bill--2,074 pages--on health care reform. \nIt was offered by Senator Reid, after a merger of the bills created by \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee as well as the \nFinance Committee. Then an effort was made to perfect this bill and \naddress some other provisions that were not included. That effort was \nunderway for a lengthy period of time because the Congressional Budget \nOffice had to look at each suggestion to see whether it had an impact \non the cost of the bill or the goal of the bill, which is to make \nhealth insurance more affordable.\n  Finally, the Congressional Budget Office has given its report--not in \nits entirety--but at least its preliminary report, and the news is very \nencouraging. Many of my colleagues come to the floor--the Senator from \nOklahoma, who will speak after Senator Stabenow and I--and talked about \nour Nation's deficit. It is appropriate that issue be raised and taken \nseriously.\n  But I hope the Senator from Oklahoma and others who raise that issue \nwill acknowledge something; this health care reform bill, as amended, \nis the greatest deficit reduction bill in the history of the United \nStates. We have now been told by the Congressional Budget Office this \nbill will not only reduce our deficit over the next 10 years by over \n$130 billion, but in the following 10 years, their new calculation is \nit will reduce the deficit of the United States up to $1.3 trillion. \nHow does it achieve this? It achieves this by achieving the goal of \nthis bill: to bring down the increase in costs in health care.\n  The Congressional Budget Office tells us--and this is an independent \ngroup that looks at these things--we are achieving our goal to start \nbringing down the cost of health care in America. For those who will \ncome to the floor and make speeches about our deficit and debt, please \ngive credit where it is due. This bill will do more to reduce the \ndeficit than anything ever proposed in Congress.\n  The second thing I wish to say is the basics of this bill remain. At \nthe end of the day, 94 percent of the people in America will have \nhealth insurance, the highest percentage insured in our history. \nThirty-one million uninsured Americans will have health insurance \nbecause of this legislation.\n  In addition to bringing down the costs of medical care and health \ninsurance, in addition to extending the protection of insurance to over \n30 million Americans currently uninsured, this bill will also provide \nprotections to individuals against discrimination by health insurance \ncompanies. The new amendment which has been introduced today goes even \nfurther than the original bill. I think it will be a source of great \nconsolation to many families across America to know this new amendment \nwill say, in a very brief period of time, that every child under the \nage of 18 will be entitled to health insurance regardless of \npreexisting conditions. That is an amazing statement. It is an \nincredible statement. It says we are going to move forward quickly on \nthis protection of the bill to eliminate the discrimination against \npeople because of preexisting conditions and we will start with those \nunder the age of 18 and do it in short order. That, to me, is a \ndramatic change.\n  Then, it says health insurance companies are now going to have to \nassert that the premiums collected are actually used to pay medical \nexpenses. We will require of them that the medical loss ratio of \ncertain companies be 80 percent and others up to 85 percent, which \nmeans the money collected in premiums--that money, up to 85 percent--\nhas to be spent on actual medical expenses. That reduces the amount of \nmoney for these health insurance companies to spend on advertising, on \nsalaries, on bonuses, on clerical help to deny claims. It says: Focus \nthe money on helping people or rebate the money to those who pay the \npremiums.\n  In addition to that, this bill is going to make certain, with this \nnew amendment, that patient health insurers have to abide by patient \nprotections; for example, that protect an individual's right to choose \ntheir own doctor; also, ensuring access to needed care and guaranteeing \nan opportunity to appeal any denial of coverage. This bill, with its \nnew amendment, is going to offer alternatives that aren't available \ntoday. I look at all these things in the bill, and I think of the \nprofound impact some of them will have.\n  One of the provisions in this bill is going to dramatically expand \ncommunity health centers across America. Senator Bernie Sanders of \nVermont has been credited with being the leader on this, and he should \nbe. He has done an extraordinary job. What a legacy he will leave and \nthis bill will create: 10,000 more clinics and health care centers \nacross America providing primary care in towns large and small. Rural \nand underserved communities will have opportunities tomorrow they don't \nhave today because of this.\n  In addition to these things, this bill expands the small business \nhealth care affordability tax credit. I am not going to go into depth \non this because Senator Stabenow from Michigan has been our leader on \nthat, and she will tell you how. To the critics on the other side of \nthe aisle who say this bill raises taxes and doesn't help people: Wait \nuntil you hear from Senator Stabenow what this bill does for small \nbusinesses. It expands tax credits to small businesses so they can \nprovide health insurance to their employees. What a breakthrough this \nwill be for many businesses that can't afford to do it today.\n  We also have provisions in here to engage in more direct efforts to \ntry to find ways to reduce medical malpractice and the lawsuits that \nfollow. It is an aggressive effort to find ways to protect victims of \nmedical malpractice and yet reduce any lawsuits which should not be \nfiled to the lowest possible number.\n  This bill increases access to workplace wellness programs, something \nall of us believe is the way of the future.\n  Let me also tell my colleagues that this bill has a provision in it \nwhich I have included, and I thank the leadership for accepting, on \ncongenital heart research. This is near and dear to me and my family. \nThe problem we have\n\n[[Page S13480]]\n\nrun into is many children born with congenital heart defects end up \nliving into adulthood without the necessary surveillance to determine \nwhat is the best practice to keep them alive and healthy and \ncomfortable. This is a very tiny part of this bill, but it is so \nimportant to so many families that we will finally have surveillance of \nthese patients around America with congenital heart defects and find \nthose therapies that work best, those surgeries that will succeed. It \nwill bring peace of mind to a lot of families to know we are going to \nmake this extra special effort with a birth defect which affects \nliterally hundreds of thousands of Americans.\n  I think this bill has been improved by this amendment. I know the \nSenator from Oklahoma is going to speak about the issue of amendments. \nI wish to say for the record that this is the 20th day since we brought \nthis bill to the floor. In the 20 days the Senate has been considering \nthis bill, the Republican side of the aisle has offered four amendments \nto change the bill--four amendments in 20 days. They offered another \nsix motions to send the bill back to committee and stop the \ndeliberation on the Senate floor but only four substantive amendments. \nWe have been promised over and over there would be a substitute \namendment which is even better than ours. It has never been introduced \nby the Republican side of the aisle. It certainly has never been \ncleared with the Congressional Budget Office. If they had a better \nidea, where has it been for 20 days? The amendments which they offered, \nmany of them, related directly to the Medicare Advantage Program.\n\n  I think they offered at least two of their four amendments to protect \nthat program. It is a private health insurance program, heavily \nsubsidized by the Federal Government and one that, frankly, is wasting \ndollars that should be spent to help people and expand their care under \nMedicare. They have tried, time and again, on behalf of these health \ninsurance companies to continue the subsidy, but we know it is wasteful \nand we know there is a better expenditure.\n  So I would say to those who would complain now while here, we are \nalmost out of time to offer amendments, where have you been? For 20 \ndays, for almost 3 weeks, where have you been? Where have your \namendments been? You had your chance. Your leadership could have \nbrought them to the floor but, instead, we had six motions to commit--\ntake the bill off the floor--instead of amendments that dealt with the \nbasic substance of the bill.\n  I think we have a good bill, and I think we have reached the point \nwhere we should vote, have an up-or-down vote. The Senate has \nconsidered this for a year. We have no Republican alternative that has \nbeen cleared by the Congressional Budget Office that indicated it is a \nviable alternative, and now we should bring the one bill before us that \ncan make a difference in America: make health care more affordable, \nexpand its coverage to 94 percent of our people, give our families and \nindividuals across America a chance to bargain effectively with health \ninsurance companies that say no. That, to me, is a good bill.\n  The bill that has just been read on the floor has been posted on the \nInternet now for more than 4 hours. Go to Senate Democrats, take a \nlook, you will find it, and when you do, you will find the original \nbill and this amendment. All of America will get a chance to read this \nbill in its entirety today, tomorrow, and Monday, before the vote is \ngoing to be taken as to whether we are going to proceed with this \nmanagers' amendment, 72 hours before there is a vote on Tuesday \nmorning, so America will have a chance, as it should, because it is a \ncritically important issue.\n  The last thing I wish to do--Mr. President, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent for 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Congressional Record an article written by Victoria Reggie Kennedy, \nwhich will be published tomorrow in the Washington Post Sunday edition. \nIt is entitled, ``The moment Ted Kennedy would not want to lose.''\n  There are many things said here which we can expect, but the one \nparagraph I wish to read into the Record is as follows, from the wife \nof Senator Ted Kennedy:\n\n       Still, Ted knew that accomplishing reform would be \n     difficult. If it were easy, he told me, it would have been \n     done a long time ago. He predicted that as the Senate got \n     closer to a vote, compromises would be necessary, coalitions \n     would falter and many ardent supporters of reform would want \n     to walk away. He hoped that they wouldn't do so. He knew from \n     experience, he told me, that this kind of opportunity to \n     enact health care reform wouldn't arise again for a \n     generation.\n\n  This bill has been called many things. It is officially titled the \n``Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.'' I am going to refer to \nit as ``Kennedy Care'' because Ted Kennedy, throughout his public \ncareer, cared deeply about this health care issue.\n  Our time is here, and in his name and in his memory, we need to pass \nthis historic legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             The Moment Ted Kennedy Would Not Want To Lose\n\n                      (By Victoria Reggie Kennedy)\n\n       The Washington Post--Sunday, December 20, 2009; A19--My \n     late husband, Ted Kennedy, was passionate about health-care \n     reform. It was the cause of his life. He believed that health \n     care for all our citizens was a fundamental right, not a \n     privilege, and that this year the stars--and competing \n     interests--were finally aligned to allow our nation to move \n     forward with fundamental reform. He believed that health-care \n     reform was essential to the financial stability of our \n     nation's working families and of our economy as a whole.\n       Still, Ted knew that accomplishing reform would be \n     difficult. If it were easy, he told me, it would have been \n     done a long time ago. He predicted that as the Senate got \n     closer to a vote, compromises would be necessary, coalitions \n     would falter and many ardent supporters of reform would want \n     to walk away. He hoped that they wouldn't do so. He knew from \n     experience, he told me, that this kind of opportunity to \n     enact health-care reform wouldn't arise again for a \n     generation.\n       In the early 1970s, Ted worked with the Nixon \n     administration to find consensus on health-care reform. Those \n     efforts broke down in part because the compromise wasn't \n     ideologically pure enough for some constituency groups. More \n     than 20 years passed before there was another real \n     opportunity for reform, years during which human suffering \n     only increased. Even with the committed leadership of then-\n     President Bill Clinton and his wife, reform was thwarted in \n     the 1990s. As Ted wrote in his memoir, he was deeply \n     disappointed that the Clinton health-care bill did not come \n     to a vote in the full Senate. He believed that senators \n     should have gone on the record, up or down.\n       Ted often said that we can't let the perfect be the enemy \n     of the good. He also said that it was better to get half a \n     loaf than no loaf at all, especially with so many lives at \n     stake. That's why, even as he never stopped fighting for \n     comprehensive health-care reform, he also championed \n     incremental but effective reforms such as a Patients' Bill of \n     Rights, the Children's Health Insurance Program and COBRA \n     continuation of health coverage.\n       The bill before the Senate, while imperfect, would achieve \n     many of the goals Ted fought for during the 40 years he \n     championed access to quality, affordable health care for all \n     Americans. If this bill passes:\n       Insurance protections like the ones Ted fought for his \n     entire life would become law.\n       Thirty million Americans who do not have coverage would \n     finally be able to afford it. Ninety-four percent of \n     Americans would be insured. Americans would finally be able \n     to live without fear that a single illness could send them \n     into financial ruin.\n       Insurance companies would no longer be able to deny people \n     the coverage they need because of a preexisting illness or \n     condition. They would not be able to drop coverage when \n     people get sick. And there would be a limit on how much they \n     can force Americans to pay out of their own pockets when they \n     do get sick.\n       Small-business owners would no longer have to fear being \n     forced to lay off workers or shut their doors because of \n     exorbitant insurance rates. Medicare would be strengthened \n     for the millions of seniors who count on it.\n       And by eliminating waste and inefficiency in our health-\n     care system, this bill would bring down the deficit over \n     time.\n       Health care would finally be a right, and not a privilege, \n     for the citizens of this country. While my husband believed \n     in a robust public option as an effective way to lower costs \n     and increase competition, he also believed in not losing \n     sight of the forest for the trees. As long as he wasn't \n     compromising his principles or values, he looked for a way \n     forward.\n       As President Obama noted to Congress this fall, for Ted, \n     health-care reform was not a\n\n[[Page S13481]]\n\n     matter of ideology or politics. It was not about left or \n     right, Democrat or Republican. It was a passion born from the \n     experience of his own life, the experience of our family and \n     the experiences of the millions of Americans across this \n     country who considered him their senator, too.\n       The bill before Congress will finally deliver on the urgent \n     needs of all Americans. It would make their lives better and \n     do so much good for this country. That, in the end, must be \n     the test of reform. That was always the test for Ted Kennedy. \n     He's not here to urge us not to let this chance slip through \n     our fingers. So I humbly ask his colleagues to finish the \n     work of his life, the work of generations, to allow the vote \n     to go forward and to pass health-care reform now. As Ted \n     always said, when it's finally done, the people will wonder \n     what took so long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to thank our distinguished \nassistant majority leader for being on the floor, for his passion, for \nhis commitment to the issue of health care, affordable health care for \nevery American. I thank him always for his comments.\n  The bottom line for all of us is, this legislation is about saving \nlives, saving money, and saving Medicare. I would also say it is about \nsaving jobs.\n  That is certainly a big focus for me, coming from the State of \nMichigan. The reality is that this year 45,000 people lost their lives \nbecause they couldn't find affordable health insurance. Forty-five \nthousand families during the holidays will have one less person sharing \ndinner and exchanging gifts. We can do better than that in this great \ncountry. This morning, 14,000 people got up with health insurance and \nthey will go to bed tonight without it and that happens every day, \nevery day, every day. We can do better, and this bill does better than \nthat.\n  As Senator Durbin indicated, in addition to other provisions in the \nbill, this amendment would dramatically expand community health centers \nacross the country where people can have the opportunity to go into the \nneighborhood community health center, see a doctor, see a nurse, and \nget the care they need--incredibly important.\n  This bill saves money. It saves money at every level. This bill has \nover $400 billion in tax cuts for small businesses and families in it. \nI am very pleased and proud to have been part of an effort with other \ncolleagues, including the chair of the Small Business Committee, Mary \nLandrieu, and the distinguished Senator from Arkansas, Blanche Lincoln, \nand other colleagues to strengthen the provisions for small business \nthat are in this amendment. It is very important.\n  The 35-percent tax credit for small businesses with up to 25 \nemployees will start next year. So right out of the gate, that is \nsomething that will be available for small businesses. We also expand \non the provisions that would add to the benefits for that particular \ntax cut. Going forward, the whole point of creating an insurance pool \nthat small businesses can buy into and self-employed individuals can \nbuy into and people without insurance is because, right now, big \nbusinesses already provide insurance, for the most part, and they get a \ngood deal because they have enough employees to negotiate a better \nrate. So health insurance reform, in terms of new coverage, is very \nmuch about small businesses.\n  Most of the people who don't have health insurance work. They don't \nqualify for Medicaid for low-income individuals. They are not in a big \nbusiness that has health insurance.\n  They are working for a small business or maybe they are working one \npart-time job, two part-time jobs, or three part-time jobs without \ninsurance or maybe they had a job and then lost their job and, like \nmany people in my great State, lost their job on day one and lost their \ninsurance on day two. This is very much tied to small business and \nfilling the gap.\n  Of the people who have insurance now, about 60 percent of the public \nwill keep what they have. They will benefit from the insurance reforms, \nso they are getting what they are paying for, and people with \npreexisting conditions will be able to find insurance that they cannot \nfind today. Those who have public plans, such as Medicare, will be able \nto continue with a strengthened plan. I want to talk about that in a \nminute.\n  For that 15 to 20 percent today who cannot find affordable insurance, \nthat is what this health reform is all about--to make sure small \nbusinesses and individuals working out of their homes, their garages--\nthe next entrepreneur, the next Bill Gates down the road--have the \nopportunity to find affordable insurance through a large group pool. \nThat is what this is very much about.\n  I am very pleased to say we have increased the amount of tax cuts for \nsmall businesses and tax cuts overall in this bill to help people \nafford to buy health insurance.\n  Also, as a part of saving money, we are for taxpayers saving dollars \nand reducing the deficit over the first 10 years, the second 10 years, \nand beyond. The Congressional Budget Office now says that during the \nfirst 10 years, we will decrease the deficit by $131 billion, not the \nhuge increases that are being talked about on the other side of the \naisle, and in the second 10 years, we are looking at up to $1.3 \ntrillion in reduced deficits.\n  For my large businesses that compete internationally, where we do not \nhave a level playing field right now, in many ways because of health \ncare costs, we are going to be able to bring those costs down. It is \nabsolutely critical for us if we are going to stay competitive and be \nable to create good-paying middle-class jobs in this country.\n  We also know we have to stop the insurance company abuses that are \noccurring today, whether it is dropping people when they get sick \nbecause of a technicality, blocking people from getting care, putting \non artificial caps, lifetime caps that stop people from getting \ncoverage, or whether they are spending way too much on administrative \ncosts and on profits rather than putting it into medical care. We \naddress all of those issues in this bill, and this amendment \nstrengthens that as well.\n  We are very much about saving Medicare. We stop overpayments to for-\nprofit insurance companies and put that money back into closing what \nhas been a gap in prescription drug coverage. We add preventive care \nwith no out-of-pocket costs for seniors, and we lengthen the life of \nthe Medicare trust fund.\n  I have to take just a moment because we have reached a milestone in \nall of the delaying tactics that have gone on this year, much of it \nfocused on stopping us from passing health care reform that benefits \nAmericans.\n  We have now reached 101 different Republican objections to moving our \ncountry forward as of today. The party of no has blocked us from moving \nforward 101 times. People oftentimes say: What does that mean? How can \nthey do that?\n  The rules of the Senate are such that each Member has the ability to \nobject to something going forward. Most of the time, we operate in a \nway where people agree and we do not object. But if someone objects and \nyou are trying to get something done, you have to go through motions \nand time clocks and things that become very difficult for people who \nare following this to understand.\n  The reality is, if there is an objection, our leader has to do what \nhe has done today. He files a motion to get past a filibuster, we have \nto wait 2 days, then we vote on stopping the filibuster, then we wait \n30 hours, and then we vote on whatever it is--the amendment, the bill, \nwhatever it is we are trying to do. After that, we then move on to the \nnext step. There is an objection again, as there has been on health \ncare, the leader has to file a motion to stop the filibuster, wait 2 \ndays, vote to stop the filibuster, wait 30 hours, and then vote on \nwhatever it is. This goes on and on.\n  We have seen historic numbers--what I view as an abuse of the \nprocess--historic numbers in order to block us not just from health \ncare reform but from funding the troops with the Department of Defense, \nextending unemployment insurance for unemployed Americans--I can go on \nand on.\n  At every step of what we have tried to do this year--and we have done \nsome historic things--every step of the way, we have had to maneuver \nthrough an unprecedented effort to block and stall and say no. Mr. \nPresident, 101 times now this has happened.\n  Despite that, we have accomplished many very important things. We are \nnot done. I am not going to be done until we make sure everybody who \nwants to work has a good job in this\n\n[[Page S13482]]\n\ncountry, and we are all focused on that. We have a tremendous amount to \ndo together to tackle the debt, to make sure we are supporting efforts \nfor good-paying jobs to be created. But this health reform is a \ncritical part of that because it does, in fact, affect costs in this \ncountry. It saves lives. We should care about that.\n\n  In this amendment, we add additional funds for prenatal care and to \nsupport families who want to adopt children with a refundable tax \ncredit. We put in place other items to support women who are pregnant \nto make sure they have the health care they need so they and their \nbabies can be healthy moving forward.\n  This saves lives, saves money, saves Medicare. It is the right thing \nto do, and it is time to get it done. Now is the time to get this done.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am going to spend a few minutes talking \nthis afternoon. I apologize in advance because the staff is going to \nstay here, but this is an issue so big, this country has never faced it \nbefore. So the inconvenience for us to be here in the Senate Chamber is \ngoing to be very well worth it to the American people.\n  We just heard the assistant majority leader and the Senator from \nMichigan explain how great what is getting ready to happen is, and I \nwant to tell you, there is a different perspective coming from a \ncountry doctor from Oklahoma who has practiced under Medicare and \nMedicaid for a number of years.\n  What we heard was, and it is important to the American people \nlistening to this--I am going to go through what the Federal Government \nhas been doing for the last 3 or 4 years, if you want to stay tuned for \na civics lesson about the tremendous amount of incompetency and waste \nin this Federal Government.\n  We just heard the assistant majority leader talking about amendments. \nWhat he did not tell the American people is that the majority required \nunanimous consent for us to get an amendment and they limited us to 10 \namendments over the last 2 weeks. They strung it out so we could not \nget our amendments up.\n  The other point I wish to make is that we now have a new amendment--\nthe one offered by the majority leader--to this bill, which we have no \nopportunity to amend. It is one-sixth of the bill, but there is no \nopportunity to amend it. So now we have a $2.5 trillion bill that has \nhad 10 substantive amendments offered to it. The American people should \nnot trust that process.\n  We heard the Senator from Michigan just say it saves lives. I want to \ntell you, as a practicing physician, this bill is not going to save \nlives. It is going to cost lives because we are going to allow the \nFederal Government to determine what treatment you can get, when you \ncan get that treatment, and who is going to give it to you. That is the \nultimate result of this bill. Over the next few days, we will be \nexplaining and showing why that is the case.\n  The Washington-speak of ``it saves Medicare,'' a program that is \nbankrupt now, that has an infinite $85 trillion unfunded liability--we \nare going to cut $1 trillion out of it over the next full first 10 \nyears of this program. And the American people are supposed to expect \nthis is going to save Medicare? It is not going to come anywhere close. \nAnd save money? The assistant majority leader quoted the CBO. Let me \nread to you what he did not quote:\n\n       It is unlikely that key cost containment provisions that \n     are in this bill will remain intact.\n  That is what CBO said today. You did not hear that statement from the \nassistant majority leader.\n  Here is the other thing:\n\n       It reduces payments to physicians by 21 percent starting in \n     2011.\n\n  Do you really think we are going to reduce payments to physicians 21 \npercent in Medicare in 2011? One of the first bills we will see on this \nfloor come January will be $250 billion that will be stolen from our \nkids to adjust the sustainable growth rate formula for Medicare. It \nwill not be paid for, and that is one of the reasons this thing \nlooks for--that is why the CB0 said: Wait a minute, before you claim \nthis thing is so good, recognize that you are not accounting for $250 \nbillion you are going to call an emergency and not pay for it.\n\n  Here is the third thing he did not mention:\n\n       An unaccountable, unelected board of bureaucrats must make \n     arbitrary budget cuts to ensure the cost containments in this \n     bill.\n\n  We are saying we are going to have cost containment, but we are going \nto pin that on three different programs, boards, and panels in this \nbill that are not going to cause you to save lives. It certainly might \nsave us money, but it certainly is not going to increase the quality of \ncare and it certainly is not going to save Medicare.\n  Here is the other thing he did not mention:\n\n       CBO cannot predict that the quality of care will not \n     decline.\n\n  That is what they are saying.\n\n       It is unclear whether such a reduction in growth rate can \n     be achieved and, if so, whether it would be accomplished \n     through greater efficiencies in the delivery of health care \n     or would reduce access to care or diminish the quality of \n     care.\n\n  That is from the CBO.\n  Here is the other thing the assistant majority leader did not \nmention:\n\n       The long-term budgetary impact could be quite different if \n     key provisions of the legislation were ultimately changed or \n     not fully implemented.\n\n  The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended a change in \nbreast cancer screening. They did it based on cost. We reversed it. I \nwill bet a dollar against a nickel that the next three or four they \nrecommend, we will not do, either, which are counted on in CBO's score \nfor us to do. So the numbers on this do not make any sense.\n  CBO says this will reduce the deficit, but people who understand the \nCBO from the inside out admit even their best estimates are \nprofessional guesses with lots of uncertainty.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the comments of \nDonald Marron, Alice Rivlin, and Phil Ellis.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n          Will the Reid Health Bill Really Reduce the Deficit?\n\n          (Claim: CBO says this bill will reduce the deficit)\n\n\n  People who understand CBO from the inside out admit that even their \n    best estimates are professional guesses with lots of uncertainty\n\n       Donald Marron, former Acting Director of CBO, said that \n     ``the Congressional budget process demands specific estimates \n     of how much proposed legislation will cost, so that's what \n     CBO produces. But reality is much more complex, and the \n     actual costs will undoubtedly be more or less. That \n     uncertainty can be frustrating, but it's unavoidable.''\n       Alice Rivlin, CBO's founding director in 1975, said that \n     ``Everyone in the process--especially the CBO--knows that it \n     is very, very difficult to make these estimates and that \n     they're no more than very educated guesses . . .''.\n       Phi Ellis, head of CBO's health insurance modeling unit, \n     admitted this in an October Washington Post article, saying: \n     ``We're always putting out these estimates: This is going to \n     cost $1.042 trillion exactly. But you sort of want to add, \n     you know, `Your mileage may vary.' ''\n       The Washington Post ran a front page story in October with \n     the headline: ``In health debate, those numbers are just \n     numbers,'' saying that ``the CBO's price tags are educated \n     guesses, but guesses nonetheless.''\n\n\n Examine Washington's record of estimating the cost of health programs\n\n       Washington has just run a $1.4 trillion budget deficit for \n     fiscal 2009, even as we are told a massive, new health-care \n     government program will reduce deficits by raising and \n     spending about a trillion dollars over 10 years.\n       To believe that fantastic claim, you have to ignore \n     everything we know about Washington and the history of \n     government health-care programs.\n       Some argue that more federal control or ``competition'' \n     will restrain costs and make health care more affordable. The \n     problem with this argument is that it ignores history.\n\n\n  Look at the record of Congressional forecasters in predicting costs\n\n       Start with Medicaid, the joint state-federal program for \n     the poor. The House Ways and Means Committee estimated that \n     its first-year costs would be $238 million. Instead it hit \n     more than $1 billion, and costs have kept climbing.\n       Medicaid now costs 37 times more than it did when it was \n     launched--after adjusting for inflation.\n       Its current cost is over $250 billion, up 25% or $50 \n     billion in fiscal 2009 alone, and that's before the health-\n     care bill covers millions of new beneficiaries.\n\n[[Page S13483]]\n\n Medicare has a similar record. In 1965, Congressional budgeters said \n that it would cost $12 billion in 1990. Its actual cost that year was \n                              $90 billion\n\n       The Medicare hospitalization program alone was supposed to \n     cost $9 billion but wound up costing $67 billion. These \n     aren't small forecasting errors. The rate of increase in \n     Medicare spending has outpaced overall inflation in nearly \n     every year (up 9.8% in 2009), so a program that began at $4 \n     billion now costs $428 billion.\n       The Medicare program for renal disease was originally \n     estimated in 1973 to cover 11,000 participants. Today it \n     covers 395,000, at a cost of $22 billion.\n       The 1988 Medicare home-care benefit was supposed to cost $4 \n     billion by 1993, but the actual cost was $10 billion, because \n     many more people participated than expected. This is nearly \n     always the case with government programs because their \n     entitlement nature--accepting everyone who meets the age or \n     income limits--means there's no fixed annual budget.\n\n\nOne of the few health-care entitlements that has come in well below the \n     original estimate is the 2003 Medicare prescription drug bill\n\n       Those costs are now about one-third below the original \n     projections, according to the Medicare actuaries. Part of the \n     reason is lower than expected participation by seniors and \n     savings from generic drugs.\n       But as White House budget director Peter Orszag told \n     Congress when he ran the Congressional Budget Office, the \n     ``primary cause'' of these cost savings is that ``the pricing \n     is coming in better than anticipated, and that is likely a \n     reflection of the competition that's occurring in the private \n     market.''\n       The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services agrees, \n     stating that ``the drug plans competing for Medicare \n     beneficiaries have been able to establish greater than \n     expected savings from aggressive price negotiation.'' It adds \n     that when given choices, ``beneficiaries have overwhelmingly \n     selected less costly drug plans.''\n\n\nThe record is clear: government cost estimates are educated guesses and \nnot completely reliable because of Congressional spending. Our country \n   needs real health reform, to lower cost and increase choices, not \n                       increased federal control\n\n       Yet today, Democrats in Congress still fight against \n     private-competition, instead preferring government \n     intervention and price controls--through a Medicaid \n     expansion, a Medicare board of bureaucrats, federal mandates \n     and regulation of all health insurance, and\n       This is all headed in the wrong direction. The Majority \n     wants to increase the role of the federal government in \n     health care and prevent private health plans from really \n     competing.\n       Congress can hold insurers accountable and cover pre-\n     existing conditions without increasing federal control of \n     health care. The government does not have a good record with \n     programs.\n       The government already controls too much of health care. \n     Uncle Sam is directly or indirectly financially directing \n     nearly two thirds of all health care. Roughly one out of 3 \n     Americans is already on Medicaid and Medicare--programs which \n     are going bankrupt.\n       The lesson here is that spending on nearly all federal \n     benefit programs grows relentlessly once they are \n     established. This history won't stop Democrats bent on \n     pushing for a massive new tax hike and cuts to seniors on \n     Medicare to raise money for new handouts.\n       Every Member who votes for the Democrats' plans is \n     guaranteeing larger deficits and higher taxes far into the \n     future. And that is a future we cannot afford.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, let's look at Washington's estimate of the \ncost of health care. We have just run a $1.4 trillion deficit this last \nyear. It is going to be bigger next year. It is going to be bigger. And \nwe are going to have a brandnew health care system where we are going \nto start collecting taxes with some very minor changes in the health \ncare system.\n  We are going to have the CLASS Act that is going to collect $72 \nbillion over the next 12 or 13 years, but we are not going to reduce \nthe deficit because we refuse to make the hard choices to do so.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nCBO's key caveats on the pricetag of the Reid amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            CBO's Key Caveats on Price Tag of Reid Amendment\n\n\n      Unlikely That Key Cost Containment Provisions Remain Enacted\n\n       ``These longer-term calculations assume that the provisions \n     are enacted and remain unchanged throughout the next two \n     decades, which is often not the case for major legislation. \n     For example, the sustainable growth rate (SGR) mechanism \n     governing Medicare's payments to physicians has frequently \n     been modified (either through legislation or administrative \n     action) to avoid reductions in those payments, and \n     legislation to do so again is currently under consideration \n     in the Congress.''\n\n\n      Reduces Medicare Payment To Physicians By 21 Percent In 2011\n\n       ``The legislation would maintain and put into effect a \n     number of procedures that might be difficult to sustain over \n     a long period of time. Under current law and under the \n     proposal, payment rates for physicians' services in Medicare \n     would be reduced by about 21 percent in 2010 and then decline \n     further in subsequent years.''\n\n\n   Unaccountable, Unelected Board Of Bureaucrats Must Make Arbitrary \n                 Budget Cuts To Ensure Cost Containment\n\n       ``At the same time, the legislation includes a number of \n     provisions that would constrain payment rates for other \n     providers of Medicare services. In particular, increases in \n     payment rates for many providers would be held below the rate \n     of inflation (in expectation of ongoing productivity \n     improvements in the delivery of health care). The projected \n     longer-term savings for the legislation also assume that the \n     Independent Payment Advisory Board is fairly effective in \n     reducing costs beyond the reductions that would be achieved \n     by other aspects of the legislation. Based on the \n     extrapolation described above, CBO expects that Medicare \n     spending under the legislation would increase at an average \n     annual rate of roughly 6 percent during the next two \n     decades--well below the roughly 8 percent annual growth rate \n     of the past two decades (excluding the effect of establishing \n     the Medicare prescription drug benefit).''\n\n\n      But CBO Cannot Predict That Quality Of Care Will Not Decline\n\n       ``It is unclear whether such a reduction in the growth rate \n     could be achieved, and if so, whether it would be \n     accomplished through greater efficiencies in the delivery of \n     health care or would reduce access to care or diminish the \n     quality of care.''\n\n\n       One Change Could Blow Up The Deficit Neutrality And Costs\n\n       ``The long-term budgetary impact could be quite different \n     if key provisions of the legislation were ultimately changed \n     or not fully implemented. If those changes arose from future \n     legislation, CBO would estimate their costs when that \n     legislation was being considered by the Congress.'' \n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the other statement the assistant majority \nleader made was that no bill was offered that they would not allow to \nbe scored. There are four comprehensive bills out there that they have \nnot allowed to be scored.\n  Tomorrow afternoon, on this same floor, Richard Burr and I will go \nthrough the Patients' Choice Act which saves billions, saves the States \ntrillions, covers exactly the same number of people or more, gives \neverybody freedom of choice and gets the government out of health care, \nrequires competition, requires coverage of preexisting illness, \naccomplishes everything we say we want to accomplish in this bill.\n  So now we are getting ready to turn over $2.5 trillion more of health \ncare to the Federal Government. What kind of job have we done? Let's \nlook at it for a second.\n  Here is what we have done this year: 43 cents out of every dollar we \nspent in the Federal Government we borrowed against our children. It is \ngoing to be 45 cents next year. As we spend our taxpayers' money--and, \noh, by the way, I recall that the Senator from Michigan stated that we \nare going to improve people's lives. We are going to improve \neverybody's lives except the generation that follows us and their \nchildren. We are going to damage their lives.\n  So 43 cents of every dollar that the Federal Government spends, we \nare borrowing. How have we been doing? The claim is Medicare isn't \nbroke. Anybody with a high school accounting class knows it is broke. \nThe reason we know it is broke--and it is not only broke fiscally, it \nis broke in terms of methodology--is because it is a Ponzi scheme. We \nhave robbed the money. We have promised benefits for years and never \nraised the taxes to pay for them. We now manage 60 percent of the \nhealth care in the country.\n  Medicare is broke, the State Medicaid Programs are broke, the census \nis broke. We heard this week that Fannie and Freddie aren't going to \nrequire just $400 billion--that is a government-run mortgage insurance \ncompany that the Congress created--it is going to require $800 billion, \nalmost $1 trillion to get us out of that. Social Security, we know, is \ngoing to be broke. It is fiscally unsustainable. The U.S. Post Office \nbusiness model is broke; cash for clunkers; the highway trust fund is \nbroke. We can't even get the $8 billion we need to continue to run it. \nWe have done a great job managing that. Now we are going to put another \n20 percent\n\n[[Page S13484]]\n\nof health care in this country under the auspices of the very people \nwho run the broke programs that have created $1.4 trillion worth of \ndeficits.\n  What is the meaning of that? How does it affect you? Well, right now, \nevery child, every person, every grandparent in this country owes \ndirectly $39,000 in Federal debt, and that doesn't count everything \nthey owe. That just counts what is external debt. That doesn't count \ninternal debt, which is another $39,000. What do we know with regard to \nMadelyn here? She says: I an already $38,375 in debt--and, by the way, \nthat was in October; it is over $39,000 now--and I only own a \ndollhouse.\n  What we know is, this Federal Government spent $33,880 per household \nthis last fiscal year, the highest total in history. The Federal \nGovernment collected $18,000 in taxes, and the remaining $15,000 we \nborrowed, mostly from the Chinese. Over 40 percent of everything we are \ndoing, we can't fund. The inefficiencies of the programs we have \ncreated--but with no oversight and we won't manage--we continue to \nallow to fail.\n  It is good for us to learn from our Founders. I will quote Thomas \nJefferson:\n\n       My reading of history convinces me that most bad government \n     results from too much government.\n\n  Creating $2.5 trillion in new health care programs and damaging the \nhealth care programs we have today isn't going to save lives, it isn't \ngoing to improve health care, and it certainly isn't going to save \nmoney. Nobody can name one thing the Federal Government does that saves \nmoney. Nobody can--that saves money. So I thought I would spend this \nafternoon kind of going through the last 4 years of oversight so people \ncould actually get an opportunity to see some of the examples.\n  It is interesting that in the last 12 days of Christmas, here is what \nthe Congress will have done: On Sunday, December 13, we spent $445 \nbillion on an omnibus package; on Saturday, December 19, we spent $626 \nbillion on fiscal 2010 DOD, plus billions in pork; and on December 24, \nwe are going to create a health care program that is going to consume \n$2.5 trillion over a 10-year period--or truly $250 billion per year--\nand run it through the government.\n  So in the 12 days of Christmas, the Senate is on pace to spend $1.942 \ntrillion--in the 12 days leading up to Christmas. We are on pace to \nspend $6.7 billion an hour in the 12 days before Christmas. Then, \nbefore you know it, we will have to raise the debt limit by $190 \nbillion. Then we are going to have to come back and raise the debt \nlimit another $1.8 trillion because, statutorily, we can't borrow money \nwe don't have, and we will not make the hard choices to cut wasteful \nspending. So what we are going to do is we are going to borrow it \nagainst our children's future.\n  I have never voted for a debt increase. I have no intention of ever \nvoting for one in the future. I have every intention to try to stop any \ndebt increase we might vote on because the only thing that will cause \nus to make the hard priority choices in this country is not having the \nability to borrow money from our children and our grandchildren.\n  If you go to the Web sites of Members--and you can go to \ncoburn.senate.gov--or any other Member site--and look at oversight \nreports--I thought I would go through a few of them so the American \npeople can see where the waste is in the Federal Government. I am going \nto spend the time to talk about it because it is ludicrous what we have \ndone and what we continue to do.\n  Here is the Justice Department. We put out a report this last year \nshowing $10 billion worth of waste a year in the Justice Department. \nThat is $100 billion every 10 years. Here is a synopsis. Here is the \nreport we put out. Nobody in Congress read it, other than my staff and \na few other Members who are concerned about our spending:\n\n  There were $500 million in grants allowed to recipients who were not \nlegally capable of receiving them; $1.6 billion in unspent, unobligated \nfunds. They are the only Federal agency that has unobligated funds that \nis allowed to keep them, and we have no management over it.\n  We have this debate on earmarks--that we ought to be directing--but \nwe will not do anything about allowing the Department of Justice to \nsave the money at the end of the year that they don't spend and then \nspend it any way they want. We will not even do an oversight hearing on \nit.\n  Here is $312 million on conferences for the Department of Justice--\n$312 million for conferences. In 2007 alone, they lost 125,476 hours to \nemployees who were supposed to be there that didn't check out, weren't \non paid leave, weren't on sick leave, weren't taking unpaid time off, \nwe paid them, and they didn't show up for work. Here is $529.7 million, \n1,500 special projects that were earmarked from DOJ funding.\n  What is an earmark? An earmark is something that benefits somebody \npolitically and benefits somebody parochially and 98 percent of them \nare never competitively bid. What they are is they are the corruption \nof this Congress. Yet here we see $529.7 million worth of earmarks \nthrough the Justice Department.\n  I will not go into the details, but if you want to go to our Web \nsite, you can see this report and you can see how $10 billion of your \nmoney was wasted in the Justice Department.\n  How about the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention? A 115-page \nreport detailing the waste and mismanagement at the CDC and wasting \nbillions of dollars in taxpayer money. We have offered amendments to \nclean up this stuff. They never pass because Members of Congress don't \nwant to make the hard choices. They do not want to offend anybody.\n  They had $45 million in conferences just last year, $1.7 million for \na Hollywood liaison program, where we pay tax dollars to tell Hollywood \nstudios how to get it right in terms of how they portray things. That \nis a wonderful use of our tax dollars, when we are borrowing $1.4 \ntrillion a year.\n  Again, a 115-page report outlining instance after instance of waste \nthat the Congress will not do anything about with regard to the CDC.\n  Here is a special little one that the American people, I know, will \nlove. We are spending hundreds of millions of dollars a year putting \nsand back on beaches that nature says shouldn't be there. So the people \nwho live in States on beaches share the tax dollars of people who don't \nrather than pay for it themselves because most of these are earmarked. \nThe lobbying method of choice to get a beach replenished is to get an \nearmark. So hundreds of millions of dollars every year go out of here \nto put sand back that we put back 2 years ago, but because of the \nnatural occurrence, it normally washes away.\n  That is not a Federal responsibility. We are confused about our \nresponsibility. But we are so enamored of the power to look good at \nhome, we send taxpayer money home that is not a priority so we can get \nreelected.\n  Here is a report on highway transportation waste: $78 billion has \nbeen obligated over the last 5 years for purposes other than the \nconstruction and maintenance of highways and bridges. Let me say that, \nagain: Over the last 5 years, $78 billion from the Transportation \nDepartment has been spent on things other than highways and bridges and \ntransportation, and we wonder why the highway trust fund is belly up \nand broke.\n  This is all detailed. You can go to our Web site and find all the \ndetails of the stupid stuff, the low-priority stuff, the things that \ndon't matter in the context of the problems we have and the situation \nwe find ourselves in today of borrowing this kind of money against our \nchildren's future.\n  Then we had a nice little Christmas gift last year--``The Worst Waste \nof 2008.'' We will be coming up with ``The Worst Waste of 2009.'' There \nwas $2.4 million for a 3D space theater in Indiana--an earmark--so \npeople in Colorado, i would remind the President pro tempore, got to \npay for that. I know that has to be a priority. At a time when our \ncountry is struggling with 10 percent unemployment and a $1.4 trillion \ndeficit, we are doing that kind of stuff. How about $2.8 million for a \nvisitor center for a hatchery in Missouri? They have the hatchery, but \nwe spent $2.8 million to create a visitor center in the worst economic \ntimes we have ever seen.\n  How about $100,000 for studying Chinese video game habits? That has \nto be\n\n[[Page S13485]]\n\na priority for our country. We have to know what the habits are of the \nChinese population in terms of playing video games. A $298,000 earmark \nto develop a potato for high-end restaurants or $82 million in SBA \nloans to liquor stores. That is wonderfully good for our society. Here \nis $13 million for an art museum in Iraq--not for us, for them. We are \ngoing to spend $13 million for that. Then we spent $784,000 for \ntraining classes for casino workers in Kansas.\n  That is a high-quality project. You know, if you have casinos in \nKansas maybe you ought to train your own workers rather than take the \nmoney from Colorado and Oklahoma to do that.\n  If you would like to see that, this is a wonderful little--it has \nSanta Claus on the front, cheery--fits with our time.\n  Then we put out two stimulus reports. We have a burr under the saddle \nfor some people but, you know, dad-gummit, if we are going to spend \n$787 billion, and the inspector general says of that $787 billion at \nleast $50 billion is going to get wasted--let me say that again: at \nleast $50 billion is going to get wasted; that is the expectation from \nWashington--then we ought to be talking about where it is getting \nwasted and who is benefiting from it. The fact is that the vast \nmajority of the funds that have gone out from the stimulus project so \nfar have not been competitively bid, so the well-connected--those \npeople who give campaign contributions--are the ones who are getting \nthe contracts. Those who are most connected with people who are \nappropriators get the contracts. They do not have to competitively bid \nit, it is a gift.\n  The first stimulus report outlined $5.5 billion. Remember, we have \nonly sent $200 billion out the door on the stimulus, and we have \nalready listed $12 billion in two stimulus reports of pure waste or at \nleast nonpriority items.\n  How about guard rails for a road over a nonexistent lake in my home \nState, $1 million? So we have one boondoggle in our State where the \nCorp of Engineers builds a lake where no water ever comes--never has \ncome and never will come--and then we are going to spend $1 million on \nthe road rather than close the road around a nonexistent lake--but that \nis the kind of priority we have?\n  We are going to spend $10 million to renovate a train station that \nhas not been used in 30 years and call this a priority rather than fix \nbridges that are crumbling in this country. Or how about the town of \nUnion, NY, given a grant to spend money it did not request for a \nhomeless problem it does not have, according to local officials? Or \ngive a Nevada nonprofit a contract to do weatherization after it had \nbeen previously fired by the government for not doing good quality \nwork? But we give the same money back to the same people? I wonder if \nthere was any political connection. That is the first stimulus report.\n  In the second one we sent out $350 million to get a broadband map \nthat we could have bought for $35 million, but we spend 10 times what \nit was worth to get that done. How are we doing? Do you think we are \ndoing a good job? Do you think we have our eye on the ball? Do we have \na priority? Are we spending the American people's money wisely? No, \nbecause the Senate refuses to do significant oversight on spending. \nThere is a reason for it because, when you oversight it, you expose the \nconnectedness of the well-connected to Congress. So we do not want to \ndo that.\n  Then we talk about the census. The census is going to cost at least \ndouble what it did 10 years ago.\n  Where do we find ourselves? We find ourselves with a government we \ncannot afford and there is not any other way you can describe that. If \nwe were borrowing $1.4 trillion last year, and we are going to borrow \n$1.5 trillion this year, and the Senate has refused every attempt \nthrough the amendment process to cut spending in any area, every \nattempt--they may pass it when we have the bill, but when it comes out \nof conference it is always gone. So they want to look good, and then \nthey can deny they knew it was taken out when they vote for the \nconference report.\n  So not once in the last 5 years have we passed an amendment that has \nstuck, that reduced the spending in this country on waste and junk, \nlike I just outlined.\n  On January 1, 2009, the national debt was $10.6 trillion. It now \nstands at $12.1 trillion. That is not President Obama's fault. Do not \nconfuse this with a partisan attack. My attack is on the Senate and on \nthe Congress and the irresponsible behavior of Members of Congress who \nsay they want to do one thing and then in the dark do something totally \ndifferent. Our debt is rising $4.2 billion a day. In January 2009 the \nunemployment rate was 7.6 percent. Today it is 10 percent. That is not \nPresident Obama's fault either. That is our fault. It is the fault of \nthe Members of Congress because in fact we created Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. We allowed it, we failed to do the oversight. When we had \nan opportunity to fix it we got it struck down because of the well-\nconnectedness of the financially influential people associated with \nthat program.\n  What it means is that we lost 12,210 jobs every day since January 1, \nand we saw an uptick in that this last week.\n  That debt, as I show in the picture of Madelyn, is $39,000 per \ncitizen. But it is important to think long term, which is my own \ncriticism of my colleagues in the Senate. We think about the next \nelection. We don't think long term. We think: How does this look for \nthe next election?\n  What the next election is going to show us is that we are going to be \n$14 trillion in debt; that every young person who is 25 years of age or \nyounger in this country, they and their children when they are 45--that \nis 20 years from now--will each be responsible for debt and unfunded \nliabilities of $1,119,000.\n  Let me say that again. Twenty years from now everybody in this \ncountry who is 45 years of age or younger will be responsible for \n$1,119,000 worth of debt and unfunded liabilities. Those are unfunded \nliabilities they will get no benefit from. Those are for the people who \ncame before them. So they will be paying about $70,000 per year per \nindividual just to fund the interest on the debt obligation that we are \ncreating for them because we refuse to eliminate the silliness. We \nrefuse to make priorities. We refuse to make the tough choices that may \nmake somebody uncomfortable with us because we are thinking about the \nnext election rather than the next generation.\n  While individuals, families all across this country are worried about \nhaving a job next year, Congress is busy trying to keep their jobs by \npassing out earmarks; by trying not to offend the well-connected and \nwell-heeled in this Nation.\n  We have talked a lot about earmarks in the last year. Earmarks went \ndown 6 percent this year in total number. They went down to 12,099 \nearmarks. Divide that by 100 Senators and see what you get. But the \ncost of them went up.\n  In the last 11 months, Congress has passed trillions of dollars in \nnew spending on everything from a multibillion-dollar lands omnibus \npackage stuffed with 100 parochial bills benefiting only a few and \nendangering the property rights of Americans across the country, to a \nstimulus bill meant to generate economic growth and create jobs, the \nvast majority of which hired more government workers and transfer \nstatements to States rather than created true economic activity.\n\n  We bailed out the auto industry, we loaned hundreds of billions of \ndollars to private companies, we passed another omnibus spending bill \njust this past weekend with a price tag of $500 billion, including $3.7 \nbillion in additional earmarks. Now we hear we are doing another \nstimulus, another jobs package.\n  Where are we going to get the money? Where does the House say we are \ngoing to get the money? We are going to take the money from TARP that \nhad not been borrowed yet, so we are going to borrow the money for \nanother stimulus package against our children and grandchildren.\n  The Congressional Budget Office had this to say about our fiscal \nsituation, and we have had the Congressional Budget Office quoted:\n\n       Over the long term, beyond the 10-year baseline projection, \n     the budget remains on an unsustainable path. Unless changes \n     are made to current policies, the nation will face a growing \n     demand for budgetary resources caused by rising health care \n     costs--\n\n  Not lowering health care costs, contrary to what we have heard in \nthis body--\n\n\n[[Page S13486]]\n\n\n     rising health care costs and the aging of the population. \n     Continued large deficits and the resulting increases in \n     Federal debt over time would reduce long-term economic growth \n     by lowering the national saving and investment rates. Unless \n     revenues were increased correspondingly--\n\n  And remember what we are talking about: significant, steep, severe \ntax increases on the American public--\n\n     annual deficits would climb and the Federal debt would grow, \n     significantly posing a threat to the economy. Alternatively, \n     if taxes were raised to finance the rise in spending, tax \n     rates would have to reach levels never seen in the United \n     States--\n\n  Never. We have had it up as high as 90 percent, I remind my \ncolleagues--\n\n     some combination of significant changes in benefit programs, \n     rationing, and other spending and tax policies will be \n     necessary in order to attain long-term fiscal balance.\n\n  We actually find our deficit situation endangering our national \nsecurity now because so much of the value of the dollar is now \ndependent upon what China does because we have not been good stewards \nof the American people's money.\n  If we want to reduce government spending, Congress has to start \nsomewhere, even if it is just eliminating waste. I am going to go \nthrough $350 billion worth of waste that occurs every year in the \nFederal Government--$350 billion. I will not go through every bit of it \nto allow the clerk and the Presiding Officer and the staff to go home, \nbut I am going to go through enough of it so people get a flavor of \nwhere the waste is.\n  The cover of Newsweek's December 7 issue entitled: ``Steep Debt, Slow \nGrowth, and High Spending Kill Empires--And America Could Be Next'' \nwarns that our current fiscal situation is putting our country at risk \nand calling into question our position of power in the global economy.\n\n       This is how an empire declines. It begins with a debt \n     explosion. It ends with inexorable reduction in the Army, \n     Navy and Air Force. . . .\n\n  What did we just pass? A 4-percent increase for the military and an \naverage 11 percent increase for every other branch of the Federal \nGovernment. We are already starting to see it. We actually increased \nour own budgets 6 percent, but what did we do to our military? What \nthey are predicting in Newsweek we are already doing. We are destroying \nthe ability to defend ourselves because, financially, we are not secure \nbecause we do not have the courage to make the hard choices in \nWashington.\n  Government has grown to such an enormous size it is almost impossible \nto fully grasp just how huge the Federal operation has become. The \n2008-2009 U.S. Government Manual now is nearly 700 pages long and \nprovides details on 15 executive branch agencies and nearly 60 \nindependent establishments and government corporations--60. We have 60 \ngovernment corporations.\n  The Government Accountability Office found that 13 different Federal \nagencies spent nearly $3 billion from 2004 to 2007 to fund 207 Federal \nGovernment programs to encourage students to enter the fields of math \nand science.\n  Let me read that again:\n\n       Thirteen different Federal agencies spent nearly $3 billion \n     . . . to fund 207 Federal programs to encourage students to \n     enter the fields of math and science.\n\n  Why wouldn't we just have one? Why do we have 207 programs run from \n13 different agencies to encourage people to go into math and science? \nThat is the idiocy of what we are doing.\n  Another example, the GAO report said with $30 billion, the Federal \nGovernment ``funds more than 44 job training programs, administered by \n9 different Federal training agencies across the Federal \nbureaucracy.''--$30 billion, 44 programs by 9 different agencies. The \nright hand doesn't have any idea what the left hand is doing. Why not \none agency? Why not all job training programs in one agency? We do not \nhave the courage to change that?\n  How about Federal domestic assistance? Fourteen departments within \nthe Federal Government, forty-nine Federal agencies operating exchanges \nfor study-abroad programs.\n  Let me say that again. We have 14 different departments within the \nFederal Government, and 49 independent agencies operating study-abroad \nprograms.\n  Why not one? And why not ask the question, Is that a role for the \nFederal Government rather than the State government? Yet despite the \ndecades of government spending hundreds of billions of dollars on \nprograms that address every possible issue from homelessness to job \ntraining to obesity to education and everything in between, all these \nproblems are actually worse--they still exist and they continue to \nworsen.\n  This calls into question if mortgaging our children's future and \nendangering the country to spend money we simply do not have on \nprograms that are working is truly an effective way to address the \nchanges we face as a Nation. We have to address these issues.\n  The reason I am spending time on our fiscal nature is because the \nthing that got us in trouble in health care, the thing that causes our \nproblem in health care is the lack of any Federal restraint. Now we are \ngoing to move one-sixth of our economy under the purview of the Federal \nGovernment. Let me outline quickly $387.7 billion worth of waste that \ncould be cut from the Federal Government: The general government in \ntotal, $150 billion; Department of Agriculture, $9 billion; Department \nof Commerce, $5.9 billion; Department of Defense, $36.6 billion; \nDepartment of Education, we could cut $6 billion, nobody would ever \nnotice the difference; Department of Energy, $2.2 billion; Department \nof Health and Human Services, we could cut $1.8 billion and nobody \nwould ever notice the difference. Medicare, by all sorts of studies \nnow, we know that at least there is $100 billion worth of fraud in \nMedicare. We know that. The bill we are so proud of that our colleagues \nare going to pass without significant amendments on our part goes after \n$2 billion of that over 10 years. So they are going to go after two-\ntenths of 1 percent of the fraud and say they have done something \nrather than go after the fraud. Medicaid, we could cut $48 billion from \nit in waste, duplication, and fraud; Indian Health Service, the \ninefficiency in the AIDS program; Department of Homeland Security, $1.5 \nbillion; Department of Housing and Urban Development, $4.8 billion; \nDepartment of the Interior, $2 billion; the Corps of Engineers, $1 \nbillion; Department of Justice, at a minimum $1.6 billion. We have this \nreport that outlines $10 billion of waste. They have $1.6 billion left \nover at the end of almost every year. They are the only agency that \ngets to keep their unexpended balances. We have no control over how \nthey spend it. We haven't changed that. We have offered amendments to \nchange it. They have been rejected. We have offered amendments to have \nthat money come back to the Treasury. They have been rejected. \nDepartment of Labor, $12.4 billion worth of waste; Department of State, \n$2.5 billion; Department of Transportation, $4.3 billion; Department of \nVeterans Affairs, $1.3 billion. That comes to $387.7 billion a year \nwhich tomorrow would markedly improve the value of the dollar and could \nmarkedly change the long-term curve that we are going to have.\n  Here is what it is. People need to pay attention to this. Every year \nwe don't get rid of the $387.7 billion and continue to waste it speeds \nthis curve up. Because this chart, which shows where we are now, shows \nthe debt held by the public as a percent of GDP versus where it is \ngoing. So if you have a child today who is 1 or 2 years old or you are \nlike Madelyn, the little girl who is 3, where is she going to be in 40 \nyears? Forty years from now puts her at 2050. That means 300 percent of \nher GDP will be held by the public. What happens when we do that? No \ngrowth. Look at the lost decade of Japan. What is the implication for \nthat? The implication is opportunity gets stolen. It is paramount that \nwe change how we operate in the Senate and we start thinking long term. \nIt is not a partisan issue. What it is is a careerism issue and a \nparochialism issue.\n  If we care about what our oath is to this little book, the oath that \nevery one of us took to uphold and defend the Constitution, and if we \ncare about what the future holds, we should be worried about this. \nBecause quite frankly, right here the interest on the debt will become \n$1 trillion a year, and that is irreversible. That will happen. By \n2020, the interest on the U.S. debt will be at least $1 trillion a \nyear. That is 10 years from now. We are going to be borrowing money and \nadding to the debt to pay the interest on the debt. That is called \nbankruptcy. That is why\n\n[[Page S13487]]\n\nthe Chinese are so worried about what we are doing and the fact that we \nare not effectively managing our government. At the end of World War \nII, with all the debt we had, we were only at 109 percent of our GDP; \nin 2080, if we don't change what we are doing, 600 percent of our GDP.\n  Translate that into what that means for somebody's individual life. \nThat means my grandchildren and their children will never be able to \nbuy a home. They will never own a home. They won't send their kids to \ncollege to advance their education. They may not even be able to buy \ntransportation for themselves. The reason it is important is because it \nis counter to the heritage we have. We are the first generation in this \ncountry, in its whole history, to leave the next generation worse off. \nNobody seems to be worried about it. Nobody is willing to sacrifice \ntheir position in Washington to make the hard choices to fix what is \nwrong with the country. That doesn't mean I don't want to fix health \ncare. I do. I have seen the experience, in 25 years of practicing \nmedicine, of what government-run health care does to health care. And \nwith all these other systems that are broke and all these different \nagencies that are broke and all this duplication and we won't fix it, \nwhat makes you think we will fix it this time?\n  There is a rumble in America. I said that on the floor the first time \n4\\1/2\\ years ago. It is growing. It is getting big. For the first time \nin America, independents poll higher than either Democrats or \nRepublicans. There is a reason for it. They can't stand us. We refuse \nto make the hard choices they send us here to make. Consequently, they \nare discouraged. There is a crisis of confidence in America about a \ngovernment that is supposed to be serving them instead of them serving \nthe government.\n  As this rumble builds, we should make no mistake about what the long-\nterm consequences are, as many of us won't be here because Americans \nhave had enough. If the average American knew what was in this book, \nthe things we have allowed to happen and continue to allow to happen, \nthey should fire every one of us today. There should be a recall \nelection for every one of us. Because no matter where you are on the \npolitical spectrum, none of us has done enough to fix what is wrong. \nNone of us has lessened the risk that will happen to our children. None \nof us has changed the curve of government dominance over liberty. Until \nwe start doing that, that rumble is going to grow.\n  The only way that rumble calms down is when we start taking the oath \nto the Constitution and recognizing the enumerated powers and having \nrespect for the tenth amendment that says specifically, everything that \nis not specifically mentioned in here as a role for the Federal \nGovernment is explicitly reserved to people and their States. All you \nhave to do is look at the health care bill that is going to pass \nChristmas Eve. We are taking a valuable freedom away in that bill. We \nare taking away a right. We are going to say if you are an American \ncitizen, you have to buy something. That is a big leap on the commerce \nclause that we have never had before. It is going to get challenged \nconstitutionally. There is no question. But we are stealing liberty \nwith that one little section called an individual mandate; you have to \nbuy something in this country.\n\n  What should be our goal in the sunset years of our lives, after \nserving in this body, is that we should have preserved or increased \nfreedom for people, not lessened it. Whether it is under Republican \ndomination or Democratic domination, liberty has shrunk. As the \ngovernment grows, liberty declines.\n  Another one of Thomas Jefferson's sayings:\n\n       Compelling a man to subsidize with his taxes the \n     propagation of ideas which he disbelieves and abhors is \n     sinful and tyrannical.\n\n  That last word is an important word in America. They see tyranny. You \nare going to tell me I have to buy a health insurance policy. What if I \nhave $250,000 in the bank and I don't want to buy a health insurance \npolicy; you are going to tell me I have to buy it? I have to buy it? \nThat is tyranny. There is no freedom in that. There is no freedom to \nmake an economic choice. There is no freedom to be responsible and \naccountable. We have said the government will know best.\n  I will put some information on my Web site so that the Federal \nGovernment doesn't have to spend money. If we quit publishing this \nevery day--it is available on line--we could save $6.5 million a year. \nNobody reads them. Everybody looks at them on the computer. We could \nsave $6.5 million a year if we quit doing this. But we won't quit doing \nit. It is $6.5 million peed down the drain every year for something \nthat goes and gets recycled. But we won't do it. We won't do it. Those \nare the little examples. If you take 100 $6.5 million programs, you get \n$650 million worth of savings. There is thousands of $6.5 million \nprograms we could all get together and eliminate. But we don't do it. I \nwill make this available on my Web site.\n  I had my staff use data from the Office of Personnel Management, the \nOffice of Management and Budget, take data from those two areas \ncompiled by the Congressional Research Service. Here is what I came up \nwith in terms of Federal employees. It is pretty revealing. We now have \nin the Postal Service 762,000 employees; in the Department of Defense, \ncivilians, 677,000 employees; in all the rest of the remainder of the \nFederal agencies we have 1.247 million employees. The direct \ncompensation, the direct pay cost per person in the Postal Service is \n$55,614 a year. The Department of Defense civilian is $70,201. The \nremainder of the Federal agencies is $81,271. That is the direct pay. \nThe benefits, however, at the Postal Service are $24,743 a year. \nDepartment of Defense civilian, not our soldiers, not our military, is \n$18,796 a year. And the remaining of the Federal agencies is $31,754 a \nyear.\n  So the total per capita compensation for active Federal employees \nright now is $113,000 a year--2\\1/2\\ times what it is in the private \nsector across this country.\n  So the next time somebody comes to me and says: We need to increase \nthe wages of Federal employees, I am going to lay down and stop it \nuntil we create the opportunity our children deserve to have that was \ngiven to us. We have wonderful Federal employees, but that is part of \nthe things on which we have to start making a decision. We cannot \ncontinue to increase, increase, increase when we are borrowing all the \nmoney that we use to increase.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from South \nDakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Before the Senator from Oklahoma leaves--and I understand \nthe staff needs to get out of here, and the weather is not cooperating \nin Washington today--I am interested in his discussion and the points \nhe was making about the liabilities we continue to rack up and how that \nis going to impact future generations.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Oklahoma might respond to a question \nwith regard to the current debate. Because it strikes me, in light of \nall the spending and borrowing the country is doing, the concerns it is \nnow creating about not only the economy in the near term but also the \nimpact this could have on our country's strength in the long term, the \nway some of our creditors, the people who actually buy our debt, are \nviewing the debate about health care--in fact, when the President was \nin Asia recently, the discussion with the Chinese was more about, their \ninterest was about what is going to happen with health care in this \ncountry, not because they cared about whether there was a public option \nin the bill, not because they cared about whether it was universal \ncoverage, but because they were interested in what it was going to do \nto the debt, what it was going to do to the deficit. They were worried \nabout their investments.\n  I think it is fair to say having this last fiscal year rack up a $1.5 \ntrillion deficit--and looking to be somewhere in that ballpark again \nthis year--that we cannot sustain over time this pace we are on of \nborrowing, spending, and continuing just to mortgage the future of \nfuture generations, and that bears on the debate we are having today. \nBecause under the best case scenario, this health care expansion, when \nit is fully implemented, is going to be a $2.5 trillion expansion. And \nthe managers' amendment, which was laid down today, actually increases \nthe cost.\n  I do not know if the Senator from Oklahoma has--I am sure he has\n\n[[Page S13488]]\n\nlooked at this, but it was $848 billion, and now it is $871 billion. \nThat is their first 10-year number, which I suspect means the fully \nimplemented number, the $2.5 trillion number --\n  Mr. COBURN. It is $2.73 trillion.\n  Mr. THUNE.--is equally larger. The tax increases went up as well. The \ntaxes that were in the original bill were $493 billion. It is now $518 \nbillion. The Medicare payroll tax, which was going to be a half a point \nincrease is now nine-tenths of a point. That, of course, impacts the \nMedicare trust fund, for which this will be the first time I think that \na payroll tax will be levied that does not go to the trust fund; it \nactually goes to create a new entitlement program.\n  But I just wonder what the Senator from Oklahoma thinks about how the \nhealth care debate and the spending that is going to be associated with \nthat is going to impact the scenario he was describing, the fiscal \ncondition of our country as we head into the future, and whether we \nwill be able to really keep the cost at the $2.5 trillion, and whether \nthe tax and the Medicare cuts--which the CMS Actuary says it is \nunlikely, on a permanent basis, that those cuts will be sustainable--\nhow does this thing get paid for? It seems to me it gets paid for by \nputting more on the debt, by putting more on future generations.\n  I am interested in the reaction of the Senator from Oklahoma to that.\n  Mr. COBURN. I think it gets paid for by rationing health care to \nAmericans. That is how I think it gets paid for. You have three \ndifferent programs within this bill, three different panels that are \ngoing to mandate what I as a physician can do with my patients. Once it \ngets applied, there is not going to be an exception to it. For 80 \npercent of Americans that is going to be fine. The real key is to \nratchet it down by rationing care.\n  What do we know? We know $1 out of every $3 that is spent on health \ncare today does not help anybody. Do we fix that in this bill? No. We \nknow that $1 out of every $3 does not prevent anybody from getting sick \nand does not treat anybody's illness. Did we fix that in this bill? No. \nWe did not do anything about it.\n  I will tell the Senator from South Dakota, the tenent of medicine is \nyou do not treat symptoms. You find the disease and you treat the \ndisease. The bill we have before us is a bill that treats the symptoms. \nIt does not attack the disease. Because that $600 billion a year, at a \nminimum, that does not help anybody get well and does not prevent them \nfrom getting sick--if we just took half of it, we could cover everybody \nwho is not covered in this country today. We could cover everybody and \nnot spend a penny more on health care. But we have not attacked the \ndisease. We are treating symptoms. We are not working to solve the real \nproblems underlying health care.\n  The problem in America for health care is access to services. The \naccess limitation is because of cost. If you cut costs 15 percent \ntomorrow, you would increase the same number of people who are \nincreased in the bill in terms of availability. If you had real \ntransparency in the insurance industry, where people could see and \nactually compete and buy all across this country what they wanted, and \nwe hammered the insurance industry in terms of transparency of \noutcomes--the same for doctors--you would cut the cost even further. In \nother words, you put the patient in charge. We have a government-in-\ncharge bill that we are going to be voting on instead of the patients.\n  So we are treating symptoms. We are not treating the disease. We are \ntreating those who are screaming the loudest, but we are not fixing the \nproblem. We are just making the problem worse and bigger.\n  Mr. THUNE. If the Senator from Oklahoma would yield for another \nquestion, does the CMS Actuary and the Congressional Budget Office \nconclude, when it is all said and done, that the overall cost of health \ncare goes up, not down? It seems to me, at least, that as to the points \nthe Senator mentioned, if we were sincere about reforming health care \nin this country, what most small businesses, what most individuals, \nwhat most families want to see is health care costs going down. This \nactually bends the cost curve up, according to the CMS Actuary, with a \n$234 billion increase in health care costs over 10 years.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, it is a $160 billion \nincrease in health care over 10 years. So there is a slight difference \nin terms of their analyses, but both conclude that health care costs \nwill go up. The amount we spend on health care as a part of our total \neconomy in this country----\n  Mr. COBURN. Will rise to 21 percent.\n  Mr. THUNE.--will be 21 percent. It is currently about 17 percent or \nin that ballpark. So it seems to me, at least, we have done very \nlittle----\n  Mr. COBURN. You are not fixing the disease.\n  Mr. THUNE. If anything, to address that problem.\n  So I simply would ask the Senator from Oklahoma, some of the things \nthe Senator talks about in terms of actually attacking the disease \ncould be the basis upon which we could put together a consensus bill \naround here that actually does reform health care in a way that drives \ndown the cost rather than raise it and does not rely on all these tax \nincreases, does not rely on the $1 trillion in Medicare cuts, which the \nCMS Actuary says are unlikely to be substained on a permanent basis, \ntherefore, again putting more and more of the burden of the cost of \nthis new expansion on future generations.\n  I just see this as a very dangerous path to be on when you are \nrunning $1.5 trillion deficits, when you have an economy in recession, \nand unemployment is about 10 percent. We are talking about tax \nincreases that are going to be passed on in the form of higher premiums \nfor most Americans.\n  To be fair, there will be some Americans who will benefit. Most will \nnot. Most will see their premiums go up. We are going to see Medicare \ncuts. The program will be cut, but not to reform it or make it more \nsustainable or extend its life but, rather, to create a new entitlement \nprogram.\n  How can we move forward with legislation such as this and call it \nreform? Wouldn't it be fair to suggest that if our colleagues on the \nother side were serious about reforming health care, they would sit \ndown with us in a way that is constructive that would actually \nrepresent the common ground we could find and not write these bills, as \nthey have, behind closed doors and then spring it on us today on a \nSaturday morning, and try to push this thing through to passage before \nThursday of next week or Friday on Christmas Day?\n  Mr. COBURN. The Senator has asked a lot of questions. There is an \norganization that is based out in Oklahoma. It is called Safeway. \nSafeway has 200,000 employees. They have had a zero percent increase in \ntheir health care costs in the last 5 years, doing the things that we \ntalk about in the Patients' Choice Act: using market forces, getting \npatient participation.\n  What have they found out? Their workers are healthier. Their \nabsenteeism rate has gone down. They have lost cumulatively thousands \nand thousands of pounds. Their work product is better and their company \nis healthier because they are not spending more.\n  What has happened to their wages? Their wages are going up. One of \nthe statistics most people do not understand is that for every 3.5 \npercent rise in health care costs, you lose 2.5 percent in real wages. \nIn other words, if health care costs would stay flat, you would get a \n2.5-percent increase. If they go up 3.5 percent, you are going to lose \nthat 2.5 percent. If they go up 7 percent, you are going to lose 5 \npercent. So controlling the costs, when we have a third of it wasted \nanyway, should be our goal, and that is not where we are headed.\n  So the disappointment is not that we do not need to fix health care. \nWe do. The disappointment is that--which I think I have outlined here \ntoday--the government is highly inefficient at everything it does, and \neffective only on a limited basis on the things we do fund, and then we \nare going to move another 20 percent of health care under the control \nof an organization that has proven itself ineffective at what it does.\n  That is insanity. The direction of the bill is one that treats the \nsymptoms so we will feel better for a while, but we still die. If we \npracticed medicine that way, we would be run out of town on a rail. You \ndo not treat symptoms. Symptoms cover up worsening disease. You treat \nthe real disease, and the real\n\n[[Page S13489]]\n\ndisease is lack of transparency, lack of accountability, lack of \nreform, lack of tort reform, and lack of a competitive nature, both in \nthe health insurance industry as well as in providers like myself.\n  Make me compete based on quality and price, and make sure my patients \ncan see it, so that a consumer can make a real choice. If we were to do \nthat--which this bill does none of that--if we were to do that, \nAmerican consumers could get a much better deal.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, if I might say, the Senator from Oklahoma \nhas put forward a comprehensive approach to health care reform. It has \nbeen argued here many times on the floor that Republicans do not have \ntheir own ideas. We have argued throughout the course of this debate \nthat we ought to be approaching this not in sort of a radical overhaul \nof an expansion of the Federal Government's role in our health care \ndelivery system, which this legislation would do, but, rather, look at \nways we can provide more competition and create a more robust private \nsector health care delivery system. Instead, this approach relies \nheavily on growing the government footprint with regard to health care, \nas is evidenced by the $2.5 trillion cost of the legislation.\n  But the Senator from Oklahoma and our colleague from North Carolina \nhave come up with a comprehensive solution, which is very, in my view, \nbold and does represent true reform that moves us away from the system \nwe have today, which has demonstrated, as the Senator from Oklahoma has \npointed out, that it continues to increase in cost and continues to \nprobably--I think it will be argued--deliver less in terms of quality \nand makes the failures in the current system even bigger and worse, \nwithout doing anything to address the fundamental underlying problem or \ndisease.\n  So I would say that inasmuch as the Senator from Oklahoma has a \ncomprehensive solution, we also support what I would call more step-by-\nstep approaches. One, of course, is interstate competition, allowing \npeople to buy insurance across States lines. One would allow pooling, \nallowing small businesses to join a larger group, thereby getting the \nbenefit of group purchasing power.\n  As the Senator from Oklahoma mentioned, medical malpractice reform is \nsomething we all believe needs to be done. The Congressional Budget \nOffice, by the way, has said all these various solutions bend the cost \ncurve down, not up. But those are all things we could be doing to \nimprove upon the system we have today.\n  Frankly, I think we need to have a fair debate of the proposal of the \nSenator from Oklahoma, which is a comprehensive approach, which does \ntake us away from the employer-based system, which empowers individuals \nthrough the form of tax credits to buy their own health insurance to \nmake them more informed consumers. We always talk about a consumer-\ndriven model. That is exactly the approach that his legislation and his \nreform proposal would employ.\n  So I would like to see us have an opportunity to debate that. We are \nnot going to get that chance, I do not think, because it sounds as if \nthe amendment tree has been filled. The bill that is before us now with \nthe managers' amendment will prevent other alternatives, other \namendments from being offered. That is unfortunate because I think the \ndirection we are headed is a train wreck, as has been described by \nmany, because it leads to more spending, more taxing, Medicare cuts, \nand I would argue, in the end, more borrowing, frankly, does little to \nsolve the underlying problems that exist in our health care system \ntoday.\n  Mr. COBURN. Would the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. THUNE. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. COBURN. There is one area I needed to cover that I didn't, and I \nwill do so rather quickly.\n  Since 1977, this country has said we are not going to take Federal \ntaxpayer dollars to pay for abortions. That is a divisive issue. The \nonly way we change that issue is to change people's hearts in this \ncountry. So we are going to have to all agree to disagree on abortion \nin this country, and it is about a 50-50 split. What is about a 70-30 \nsplit is that the vast majority of Americans don't think their tax \ndollars, whether they are pro-choice or not, should be used to pay for \nsomebody else's abortion.\n  What we saw come through the Senate this morning is something that \nevery significant pro-life group in this country, including the \nCatholic Bishops, including Right to Life, including this doctor who \nhas delivered thousands of babies and understands the issues of life, \nis going to abhor. What we have done is ultimately eliminate the Hyde \namendment, and come next September 30, throughout the Federal \nGovernment as well as in this bill, the Federal Government is now going \nto allow taxpayer dollars to be used to pay for abortion.\n  Congressman Stupak, who is a friend of mine, who made sure the House \ndid not allow that to happen, has recently been quoted today saying \nthis is absolutely unacceptable, and it should be. We should not be \nusing Federal funds for that procedure to end the life of an unborn \nhuman being.\n  With that, I yield the floor and yield back my time.\n  Mr. THUNE. I appreciate that. I appreciate and share the Senator's \nview with regard to the changes or proposal that was unveiled this \nmorning and how it treats the issue of abortion.\n  As was noted, the House of Representatives and Congressman Stupak \ncame up with a clear, unequivocal policy position that extends the \npolicy, essentially, that has been in place now for the past 30 years \nin this country regarding the use of taxpayer funds for abortions. The \nlanguage that supposedly was negotiated between the Senator from \nNebraska and the Democratic majority does not follow through or \nmaintain that policy and, in fact, opens the door to allowing Federal \nfunding to be used for abortions.\n  Irrespective of which side you come down on, on this issue, there has \nbeen widespread and broad American support for a very long time. I \nthink it is something both Republicans and Democrats have agreed upon, \nand we should not deviate from that. The American people have made it \nvery plain that they believe--60 to 70 percent, in most surveys--the \nFederal Government should not be using taxpayer funds to finance \nabortions. The funding is clearly in the Senate version that now has \nbeen negotiated. As the Senator from Oklahoma mentioned, the opposition \ncomes from the Catholic Bishops, the opposition comes from the National \nRight to Life. It is very clear that this provision that is now \nincluded in the managers' amendment does not maintain the long-held \npolicy we have had in this country supported by so many Americans that \nwe not use taxpayer funds for abortions. So that, too, is something \nthis bill falls short on, along with all of the other many things I \nhave mentioned.\n  I think we are going to have many opportunities over the course of \nthe next several days to continue to discuss this issue. We just \nreceived the managers' amendment this morning, and I think it is \nimportant, as the debate over the managers' amendment begins and we \nhave some votes that are going to be coming up in the next few days, \nthat we continue to talk about why this is the wrong approach for \nAmerica, why it is the wrong approach for health care, why it is the \nwrong approach for our economy, and why it is the wrong approach for \njobs. We can do so much better by the American people. This needs to be \ndone in a step-by-step way. It needs to be done right.

AMENDMENTS TO SUBTITLE F.\n\n       (a) Section 1501(a)(2) of this Act is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(2) Effects on the national economy and interstate \n     commerce.--The effects described in this paragraph are the \n     following:\n       ``(A) The requirement regulates activity that is commercial \n     and economic in nature: economic and financial decisions \n     about how and when health care is paid for, and when health \n     insurance is purchased. In the absence of the requirement, \n     some individuals would make an economic and financial \n     decision to forego health insurance coverage and attempt to \n     self-insure, which increases financial risks to households \n     and medical providers.\n       ``(B) Health insurance and health care services are a \n     significant part of the national economy. National health \n     spending is projected to increase from $2,500,000,000,000, or \n     17.6 percent of the economy, in 2009 to $4,700,000,000,000 in \n     2019. Private health insurance spending is projected to be \n     $854,000,000,000 in 2009, and pays for medical supplies, \n     drugs, and equipment that are shipped in interstate commerce. \n     Since most health insurance is sold by national or regional \n     health insurance companies, health insurance is sold in \n     interstate commerce and claims payments flow through \n     interstate commerce.\n       ``(C) The requirement, together with the other provisions \n     of this Act, will add millions of new consumers to the health \n     insurance market, increasing the supply of, and demand for, \n     health care services, and will increase the number and share \n     of Americans who are insured.\n       ``(D) The requirement achieves near-universal coverage by \n     building upon and strengthening the private employer-based \n     health insurance system, which covers 176,000,000 Americans \n     nationwide. In Massachusetts, a similar requirement has \n     strengthened private employer-based coverage: despite the \n     economic downturn, the number of workers offered employer-\n     based coverage has actually increased.\n       ``(E) The economy loses up to $207,000,000,000 a year \n     because of the poorer health and shorter lifespan of the \n     uninsured. By significantly reducing the number of the \n     uninsured, the requirement, together with the other \n     provisions of this Act, will significantly reduce this \n     economic cost.\n       ``(F) The cost of providing uncompensated care to the \n     uninsured was $43,000,000,000 in 2008. To pay for this cost, \n     health care providers pass on the cost to private insurers, \n     which pass on the cost to families. This cost-shifting \n     increases family premiums by on average over $1,000 a year. \n     By significantly reducing the number of the uninsured, the \n     requirement, together with the other provisions of this Act, \n     will lower health insurance premiums.\n       ``(G) 62 percent of all personal bankruptcies are caused in \n     part by medical expenses. By significantly increasing health \n     insurance coverage, the requirement, together with the other \n     provisions of this Act, will improve financial security for \n     families.\n       ``(H) Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of \n     1974 (29 U.S.C. 1001 et seq.), the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 201 et seq.), and this Act, the Federal Government \n     has a significant role in regulating health insurance. The \n     requirement is an essential part of this larger regulation of \n     economic activity, and the absence of the requirement would \n     undercut Federal regulation of the health insurance market.\n       ``(I) Under sections 2704 and 2705 of the Public Health \n     Service Act (as added by section 1201 of this Act), if there \n     were no requirement, many individuals would wait to purchase \n     health insurance until they needed care. By significantly \n     increasing health insurance coverage, the requirement, \n     together with the other provisions of this Act, will minimize \n     this adverse selection and broaden the health insurance risk \n     pool to include healthy individuals, which will lower health \n     insurance premiums. The requirement is essential to creating \n     effective health insurance markets in which improved health \n     insurance products that are guaranteed issue and do not \n     exclude coverage of pre-existing conditions can be sold.\n       ``(J) Administrative costs for private health insurance, \n     which were $90,000,000,000 in 2006, are 26 to 30 percent of \n     premiums in the current individual and small group markets. \n     By significantly increasing health insurance coverage and the \n     size of purchasing pools, which will increase economies of \n     scale, the requirement, together with the other provisions of \n     this Act, will significantly reduce administrative costs and \n     lower health insurance premiums. The requirement is essential \n     to creating effective health insurance markets that do not \n     require underwriting and eliminate its associated \n     administrative costs.''.\n       (b)(1) Section 5000A(b)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986, as added by section 1501(b) of this Act, is amended to \n     read as follows:\n       ``(1) In general.--If a taxpayer who is an
