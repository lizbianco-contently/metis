Under the previous order, the \nSenate will observe a moment of silence in honor of Officer Jacob J. \nChestnut and Detective John M. Gibson of the United States Capitol \nPolice who fell in the line of duty defending this Capitol on this day \nin 1998.\n  (Moment of silence.)\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there are a select few men and women who \ncome to work every day with one primary job: to protect those of us who \nare fortunate enough to call the U.S. Capitol Building our office and \nall who come here from all corners of the country to see for themselves \nthe heart of our democracy.\n  Special Agent John Gibson and Officer Jacob Chestnut were two such \nmen. Every day for almost two decades they kept us safe. Eleven years \nago today, as the Chaplain announced in his prayer, they gave their \nlives while protecting us. On this day in 1998, a madman came through \nan entrance on the east side of the building in midafternoon and shot \nOfficer Chestnut at pointblank range. Officer Chestnut died instantly. \nAgent Gibson confronted the man, shooting him and stopping him. Gibson \nwas himself hit, and he died later that day.\n  I can clearly remember both these brave men, both of whom were in \ntheir 18th year of service as Capitol policemen when they were killed.\n  I can remember when my wife became ill at a congressional retreat we \nhad in Virginia. It was Agent Gibson who ran to her side. I can \nremember how he was so focused and had run so far from the Capitol \nPolice headquarters to our room, he was sweating profusely, and how he \ntreated her with kindness and care. Agent Gibson, who was from \nMassachusetts, would, every morning, race to the back of the sports \nsection when baseball season was on to find the box score for his \nbeloved Boston Red Sox. He was a generous neighbor and loving father to \nhis daughter and two sons.\n  Officer Chestnut, whom everyone called J.J., was a father of five who \nloved his job and loved his country. He had served in the Air Force for \n20 years. He fought in Vietnam. At the time of the shooting, he was \njust weeks away from retiring.\n  Gibson and Chestnut lay in honor in the Capitol Rotunda, just steps \nfrom where they were murdered, a distinction Congress has conferred \nupon only a handful of Americans, including Abraham Lincoln, John \nKennedy, and our unknown soldiers. Jacob Chestnut was the first African \nAmerican to ever be so honored in the Capitol Rotunda.\n  On this solemn anniversary, we pause to appreciate not just the \nbravery of two men who saved so many others but each and every Capitol \npolice officer who does his or her job so valiantly every single day of \nthe year.\n  On behalf of the entire Senate, everyone who works and visits here, I \nextend my appreciation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, when we stand in this Capitol dedicated \nto freedom, we must remember freedom's costs. So I rise to speak\n\n[[Page S8068]]\n\nabout Jacob Joseph Chestnut and John Michael Gibson.\n  Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson, both of the Capitol Police, \ngave their lives 11 years ago today in defense of the men and women who \nwork in and visit the Capitol.\n  A plaque in this building commemorates their bravery. Their names \nhave been etched upon the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, \nwhich stands 1 mile from here. And the headquarters of the U.S. Capitol \nPolice bears their names.\n  Officer Chestnut, or J.J. to his friends, was a 20-year veteran of \nthe Air Force, and had 18 years of service to the Capitol Police. John \nGibson also had 18 years of Capitol Police service, and until that day \nhad never had to draw his weapon.\n  Both men left behind their wives, children, beloved family members, \nand friends. Both men were part of an elite team. Capitol Police \nofficers, with their unique mission, are charged with protecting not \nonly our lives but our very system of government.\n  My friend, the majority leader, a former Capitol Police officer \nhimself, knows both the honor and the danger that comes with the job. \nAnd so as we honor Officer Chestnut and Detective Gibson today, we also \nhonor every man and woman of the Capitol Police who have bravely \nvolunteered for this hazardous but important duty.\n  So today the Senate honors J.J. Chestnut and John Gibson. We are \ngrateful for their heroic sacrifice, and we remember their families, \nwhom we embrace as we would our own.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/24/senate-section/article/S8068-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8068]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I came to the floor this morning to take a \nfew minutes to reflect on this week's developments on the issue of \nhealth care reform. For me, the week began with an inspiring essay by \nthe man who has led the crusade for fixing American health care for \nmore than 40 years, the man who continues to lead this body in our \nefforts to fix health care. I am referring to the wonderful essay by \nSenator Kennedy. I encourage all Senators to read his article because, \nas usual, Senator Kennedy lays out the challenge ahead. He says on the \nfront page of the magazine, ``We're Almost There.'' That might be a \nlittle much for some folks, given the developments of the week, but as \nusual, there is a lot of validity in what Senator Kennedy has written \nin Newsweek magazine.\n  There is widespread agreement on some very significant areas of \nhealth care policy. For example, we have bipartisan support in the \nSenate for fundamentally changing the inhumane model of private health \ninsurance.\n  Today, private health insurance is essentially about cherry-picking. \nIt is about going out and finding the healthy people and sending the \nsick people over to government programs more fragile than they are. \nThere is widespread agreement that needs to be changed. For example, 15 \nSenators are on legislation that would make it illegal to discriminate \nagainst those with preexisting illnesses. That is a fundamental change, \na dramatic change in the way the insurance industry does business. \nDemocrats, Republicans, both major committees--the committee Senator \nKennedy chairs, the committee led by my chairman, Max Baucus--Democrats \nand Republicans support fundamental changes in the way private health \ninsurance operates. If someone had told me 3 years ago that there would \nbe such strong bipartisan support for fundamentally altering the model \nof how private health insurance is sold in our country, I probably \nwould have asked them what hallucinogenic substance they were smoking. \nBut it is an indication, as Senator Kennedy writes in his article, that \nwe have made a lot of progress.\n  Suffice to say, as Senator Kennedy notes again, there is a lot of \nheavy lifting to do. In particular, if we go to the President's Web \nsite, the three areas he is focused on are lowering costs, increasing \nchoices, and maintaining quality. Those are the three areas the \nPresident has focused on, very correctly. Those are the three areas on \nwhich our President has made clear he is going to spend his political \ncapital. This is what he is going to use his bully pulpit for. This is \nwhat he is going to put in these killer hours for. Having met with him \nrecently, I can tell my colleagues that President Barack Obama is \nmaking that kind of effort with his political capital, using the bully \npulpit, and putting in the hours to get the job done.\n  With respect to lowering people's premiums and lowering costs, one of \nthe areas the Congressional Budget Office has said will generate real \nsavings in the next few years is increasing individual choice, giving \nall Americans the opportunity, as we have in the Congress, to choose \nfrom a variety of plans--big plans, where we spread cost and risk, \nwhere they can't discriminate. When an individual makes a wise \nselection from one of those plans, the individual puts that money in \ntheir pocket. That is what the budget office folks have said they will \nscore as real savings for the system, for people's individual premiums \nin the next few years.\n  The challenge for our committees is that in many respects, these \nbills don't give all Americans free choice. They don't give all \nAmericans the choice the Senator from Virginia has--I note the presence \nof the distinguished leader from Kentucky--these bills don't give all \nAmericans the kinds of choices we have as Senators. Choice and the \nrequirement that companies compete for people's business is what \ncompetition is all about. It is what holding premiums down is all \nabout.\n  I have developed legislation called the free choice proposal. It \nprotects the employer-based system on which we know well over 150 \nmillion Americans rely. It also gives us a chance to improve on it. It \ncreates more options for employers and for employees to hold costs \ndown. For employers, our free choice proposal gives them more leverage \nwith their insurance company so they can tell their insurer: I have \ndone business with you for a lot of years. You better give me a better \ndeal or I will take my business somewhere else.\n  It also says to an employer--hypothetically, in Virginia, Oregon--if \nyou want to take all of your employees to what is called the insurance \nexchange, kind of a farmers market arrangement, the employer would have \nthe ability to take their workers to the exchange, and the employer \ncould get a discount for doing that against strengthening the \nemployer's role in the effort to hold down cost.\n  For the worker, what it means is, for example, in Virginia or Oregon, \nif your employer's share of your health care coverage is, say, $13,000 \nand you can find a plan on the insurance exchange for $12,000, the \n$1,000 goes into your pocket. Again, you get a financial reward for \nshopping. Members of Congress get to shop. I would like to see \neverybody get to shop, everybody have those individual choices.\n  It is also good for the system because right now, really since the \n1940s, since the middle of the last century, the individual has been \ndisconnected from the health care system. The individual does not get \nmany choices. Eighty-five\n\n[[Page S8069]]\n\npercent of the employers who offer health care coverage do not offer \nchoice--not because they are evil. They would love to do it. They \ncannot afford it. The administrative costs are too crushing.\n  So, again, if we get employers and employees into these larger \nsystems, where they will have clout in the marketplace, there will be \nthe ability for everybody to choose, not just folks who are unemployed \nor uninsured or small business, but give everybody, over the next few \nyears, the ability to have these choices and be in a position to help \ndrive more competition and more accountability and hold down their \npremiums in the private sector.\n  We can do that on a bipartisan basis. We have 15 Senators of both \npolitical parties on legislation that does it now. It could fit with \nthe structure of several of the bills that are being considered. We can \ndo this, as Senator Kennedy suggests in his wonderful essay, on a \nbipartisan basis. Both Democrats and Republicans have a good point.\n  I believe my party is right on the issue that you cannot fix this \nsystem unless you cover everybody. The reason that is the case is, you \ncannot build a market unless you cover everybody. Unless you cover \neverybody, there is too much cost shifting. The people who are \nuninsured shift their bills to the insured.\n  But my colleagues on the other side of the aisle--the distinguished \nleader from Kentucky and I have had this conversation on a number of \noccasions--they have valid points too. The Congress ought to be very \ncareful about freezing innovation, about restricting private choice, \nabout setting up price controls.\n  There is the sweet spot for a bipartisan bill: Democrats with good \nideas, as Senator Kennedy lays out in his wonderful essay, about \nexpanding coverage; Republicans bringing creative ideas to the table \nabout innovation and choice. Both sides have some valid points. That is \nwhat Senator Kennedy is saying in his wonderful essay.\n  I see the leader on the floor. I hope colleagues will go to our Web \nsite. That is where we lay out this free choice proposal. I think it is \nconsistent with the idea of not blowing up the employer-based system \nbut not saying we cannot improve on it. It gives new tools to both \nemployers and employees to hold down costs. It ensures that all \nAmericans will have choices, not just some.\n  I submit to colleagues, if folks in Virginia and Kentucky and Oregon \ncome away from this and say that only some people got choices, that is \nnot going to go down very well. Let's do what the President says on his \nWeb site and give all Americans choices--choices such as we have in \nCongress from these big insurance pools, where you cannot discriminate \nand you have some leverage in terms of holding costs down.\n  It has certainly been a tumultuous week on this health care issue. \nBut I hope colleagues, this weekend, will pick up a copy of Newsweek \nand read the inspiring essay by Senator Kennedy, who has led our body \nfor more than 40 years--led the country--on this issue, and continues \nto lead us because there is a lot for us to build on now to finally end \nthis injustice that we have not been able to fix our system so we hold \ncosts down and all Americans get good, quality, affordable coverage. We \ncan do it. We can do it this year, on the President's timetable, by \nworking together.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/24/senate-section/article/S8069-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8069]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise this morning to speak on an issue \nthat so many of us, not only here in Washington in the Senate and in \nthe Congress, generally, but across the country have been concerned \nabout, talking about, debating; and it is the issue, of course, of \nhealth care.\n  We have a long way to go over the next couple weeks and months. I \nknow there is a lot of coverage and debate about timing and what is \ngoing to happen this week or next week or by the August break. But I \nbelieve we are going to get this done, and I think it is important we \nhave a good debate about it.\n  I think too often in this debate we have focused on conflict and \ncontroversy as opposed to looking at some substantive parts of this \nlegislation. I start this morning, as I have so many times when I have \nbeen discussing this issue over the last couple months, with a \nconstituent, one person, but I think a person who speaks for many \npeople across Pennsylvania and across the country. Her name is Trisha \nUrban.\n  She sent me a letter back in February that I have noted before. This \nletter, I think, tells us an awful lot about all we need to know about \nwhat is wrong with our health care system right now. Despite all the \npositive features of it--great hospitals and medical personnel and \npeople we can be justifiably proud of and boast about--there are \nproblems with our health care system.\n  Trisha Urban, when she sent this letter in February, was recounting \nwhat had happened in her life just a few weeks before. She talked about \nher husband Andrew, who had to change positions in life, change jobs \nbecause he was completing an internship. She said:\n\n       Because of pre-existing conditions, neither my husband's \n     health issues nor my pregnancy--\n\n  She referred earlier to the fact she was pregnant at the time of the \nletter--\n\n     . . . neither my husband's health issues nor my pregnancy \n     would be covered under private insurance.\n\n  She said:\n\n       I worked 4 part-time jobs and was not eligible for any \n     health benefits.\n\n  She says later in the letter that they lost their health insurance \ncoverage, and they had close to $100,000 worth of medical bills. Then \nshe says:\n\n       Concerned with the upcoming financial responsibility of the \n     birth of our daughter and the burden of current medical \n     expenses, my husband missed his last doctor's appointment \n     less than one month ago.\n\n  And this is how the story ends for this family. She talks about--just \na few weeks before this letter--what happened to her. She says:\n\n       My water had broke the night before, we were anxiously \n     awaiting the birth of our first child. A half-hour later, 2 \n     ambulances were in my driveway. As the paramedics were \n     assessing the health of my baby and me, the paramedics from \n     the other ambulance told me that my husband could not be \n     revived.\n\n  That is her story--a story of not having the kind of health care \ncoverage that she and her husband and her new baby should have--the \nstory of her husband missing his last doctor's appointment because of \nfinancial burdens and, of course, the tragic part of that story, which \nis the loss of her husband, the same day her daughter was born.\n  I do not think every story we have told about our constituents ends \nthe same way. But the blessing here of this story, of this letter, is \nthis: Trisha Urban could have said: Do you know what? I have a terrible \nburden and I can't handle this, and I am not going to try to talk to \nanyone about it. I am going to carry this burden myself. And she could \ngo off and not be heard from again.\n  But she took the time to write to me. This is how she ends the \nletter. She does not just tell her tragic story and just say: Can you \nhelp me? And: I am in trouble. She thinks beyond herself. She thinks of \nan issue that is affecting so many Americans, and she says this:\n\n       I am a working class American and do not have the money or \n     the insight to legally fight the health insurance company. We \n     had no life insurance. I will probably lose my home, my car \n     and everything we worked so\n\n[[Page S8070]]\n\n     hard to accumulate in our life will be gone in an instant.\n       If my story is heard, if legislation can be changed to help \n     other uninsured Americans in a similar situation, I am \n     willing to pay the price of losing everything.\n\n  That is what Trisha Urban says to us. I would note that in this \nSenate Chamber, you can go to every single desk--100 Senators, \nincluding myself--every single desk, and if you were to ask a Member of \nthe Senate: Do you have health care coverage? They would say: Of \ncourse. I am a Federal employee, and I get to choose a lot of options. \nYou could say the same of people who work in the House and in the White \nHouse and in executive branch agencies. So individual Senators are \ntaken care of pretty well.\n  So when Trisha Urban says to us in a letter: ``I am willing to pay \nthe price of losing everything,'' when she says that, I believe she is \nnot just saying it to tell us what is on her mind, what is in her heart \nin the aftermath of the tragedy, I believe that line and her letter and \nher whole story are emblematic of the stories of Americans across the \ncountry. I believe all those sentiments and all those details of her \nlife present a challenge to us.\n  I am willing to pay the price of losing everything, she says to us.\n  The question is--or I should say one of the important questions is--\nover the next couple of weeks and months, as we debate this issue, what \nare we willing to lose? What are individual Members of the Senate \nwilling to do and willing to lose to get this done? I believe part of \nthat is having a constructive and thorough and far-reaching debate \nabout not just the issues but what is in the legislation. I will spend \nsome time on that this morning and I will for the next couple of weeks.\n  As a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, \nwe have a bill. Sometimes the fact that there is a bill and there is a \nlot of positive features to it gets lost in Washington. There is a lot \nof talk about conflict between Democrats and Republicans; there is a \nlot of talk about controversy or issues that are sometimes easy to \ndebate or cover, but what has been lost in a lot of this debate over \nthe last couple of weeks is what is in the bill. We are going to get to \nthat. We won't get to all of it today, of course.\n  I believe the bill does a couple of things. First, it ensures that \nover time we are going to have stable costs. That is one thing American \nfamilies are looking for, some kind of stability or peace of mind with \nregard to costs and with regard to other issues as well. So stable \ncosts.\n  I also believe this legislation and the bill we are going to send to \nPresident Obama this fall will also have secure choices. If you like \nwhat you have, you like the plan you have, you can keep it. It is not \ngoing to change. If you want to make a change, you are going to have \noptions.\n  Thirdly, it is about the quality of care. I believe the American \npeople have a right to expect that we are going to control costs, that \nwe are going to provide them with secure choices, but that we are also \ngoing to provide quality care. Any old health care, in my judgment, \nisn't good enough.\n  I believe the bill does all three things: stable costs, secure \nchoices, and quality of care.\n  One of the threshold questions we have to answer in this debate is--\nbecause it is going to be a choice. We are not going to have a choice \nbetween 10 options on health care in a general sense or 5 options; we \nare going to have a basic, fundamental choice, as we do on a lot of \nissues. It is going to be one or the other, A or B, or A versus B, \nmaybe, and here is the choice. The first question we have to answer is \ndo we want to keep the status quo, do we want to keep perpetuating a \nsystem which has costs out of control for families and for businesses, \nfor government, which doesn't offer the kind of quality care across the \nboard--some get it, we know that, and it is good care--but is there \nenough quality care across the board? I would argue there isn't. Are we \ngoing to offer that and say it got too tough and we weren't willing to \ntake some risks with an important bill, we decided to not do anything? \nThat is the status quo. That is what we have now.\n  The other choice is change and reform. President Obama, fortunately, \nas a new President of the United States, has chosen to be about the \nbusiness of reform and change. He has said to us, and I believe the \nAmerican people have said to us: We cannot stay where we are. We cannot \nallow a system to perpetuate the problems we have right now. So that is \nthe fundamental choice: the status quo, do nothing; or change and \nreform, working with President Obama and listening to the voices of the \nAmerican people, people such as Trisha Urban and so many others.\n  So when we debate this--the status quo, stay where we are, versus \nchange and reform--we have to begin to examine some of the questions \nthe American people are worried about. They are worried about costs. \nThey are worried about change and legislation not leading to a control \nof costs, the kind of stability we want.\n  One of the questions we are not spending much time in Washington \ndebating is: What is the cost of doing nothing? What is the cost of \ndoing nothing? What is the cost of the status quo? Well, fortunately, \nsome people have begun to examine that. One of the examinations of that \nis a report by Families USA, and the report is entitled ``The Clock Is \nTicking.'' It says: ``More Americans Losing Health Coverage.'' One of \nthe points it has made--and of course I won't read the whole report--\nbut one of the points it has made in the report is this: Here is what \nthe status quo means, here is what no change means: 44,230 more people \nlosing health coverage every week. The report also goes on to talk \nabout what it means in individual States; a State such as Pennsylvania \nwhere they are projecting over the next couple of years tens and tens \nand tens of thousands of people losing their coverage. By one estimate \nin this report, 178,000 more people just in Pennsylvania--just in \nPennsylvania--losing their coverage.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this report, ``The Clock Is Ticking,'' \nby Families USA be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                          [From Families USA]\n\n                          The Clock Is Ticking\n\n\n                 more americans losing health coverage\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       In this turbulent economy, Americans are not only losing \n     their jobs and their homes they are also losing their health \n     coverage at an alarming rate. The latest data from the Census \n     Bureau indicate that some 45.7 million Americans lacked \n     health coverage in 2007, and economists believe that the \n     situation has only worsened in the intervening months as the \n     economic downturn has taken its toll.\\1\\\n       Health reform is needed now more than ever. As health care \n     costs rise, more and more families are priced out of health \n     coverage. Increasing numbers of employers, especially small \n     businesses, are no longer able to offer their employees \n     affordable coverage, or in some cases, any coverage at all. \n     If current economic trends continue, more and more Americans \n     will lose the health coverage they currently have. National \n     experts have predicted that at least 6.9 million more \n     Americans will lose their health coverage by the end of \n     2010.\\2\\\n       In this report, Families USA provides the first ever state-\n     by-state illustration of the number of people who may lose \n     health coverage between the beginning of 2008 (the period \n     immediately after the last Census Bureau report on the number \n     of uninsured) and the end of 2010 (the close of the current \n     111th Congress).\n\n                              Key Findings\n\n       With each passing week that meaningful health care reform \n     is not enacted, more families in every state are losing \n     health coverage (see table on page 2):\n       44,230 more people are losing health coverage each week.\n       191,670 more people are losing health coverage each month.\n       2.3 million more people are losing health coverage each \n     year.\n       Families USA based its state numbers on national estimates \n     published in the peer-reviewed policy journal Health Affairs \n     in May 2009. These estimates project that 6.9 million more \n     Americans, primarily people in working families, will lose \n     health coverage by the end of 2010.\\3\\ The Health Affairs \n     analysis, which focused on the time period between 2008 and \n     2010, is based on a model that assumes that, during this time \n     period, there will be no policy changes with respect to the \n     health care system. It further assumes that personal income \n     growth and per capita health spending among insured adults \n     will follow the latest projections from the Congressional \n     Budget Office and the Office of the Actuary at the Centers \n     for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), respectively.\n       This time period is appropriate for Families USA's analysis \n     because it captures potential losses of coverage between the \n     most\n\n[[Page S8071]]\n\n     recent Census Bureau calculations of the number of uninsured \n     Americans (which reflect calendar year 2007) and the end of \n     the 111th Congress (December 2010), which has taken up health \n     reform as one of its major legislative goals.\n       In order to generate state-level numbers, Families USA \n     calculated the share of uninsured, nonelderly individuals \n     residing in each state using the most recent data reported in \n     the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey for 2006-2007. \n     We assumed that state losses in health coverage would \n     parallel this distribution, and we apportioned the national \n     estimate accordingly. The data suggest that the health care \n     crisis is continuing to deepen across the nation, and that \n     the longer Americans are forced to wait for health reform, \n     the more people will lose coverage.\n\n                               Discussion\n\n\n                  Health Insurance Premiums Are Rising\n\n       Over the last decade, health insurance premiums have risen \n     at rates that far outpace inflation. Between 1999 and 2008, \n     the average annual family premium more than doubled, soaring \n     from $5,791 to $12,680, an increase of 119 percent.\\4\\ During \n     the same time period, the Consumer Price Index, which \n     measures inflation, rose by only 29.2 percent.\\5\\ In the \n     current economic downturn, working families are already \n     struggling to afford basic necessities like groceries, car \n     payments, gas, and housing costs.\\6\\ Paying for skyrocketing \n     health care premiums is putting additional strain on families \n     that are already financially strapped.\n\n\n              Higher Premiums Lead to Less Health Coverage\n\n       These high and continually rising premiums affect families \n     as well as employers, and the combined result is that more \n     and more Americans are losing health coverage. Employers that \n     do continue to offer health coverage are being forced to pass \n     on the rising costs to their employees by imposing higher \n     premiums or copayments or by offering plans that cover fewer \n     benefits. Other employers are choosing not to offer coverage \n     at all because it is simply too expensive. Between 2000 and \n     2008, the share of firms offering health coverage declined by \n     6 percentage points, with small businesses being the most \n     likely to drop coverage.\\7\\ Among firms with fewer than 200 \n     employees that do not offer their employees health coverage, \n     a total of 70 percent cited high premiums as either the most \n     important reason (48 percent) or the second most important \n     reason (22 percent) that they do not offer coverage.\\8\\\n       Even if families are fortunate enough to have access to \n     health coverage, either through job-based plans or through \n     the individual market, they are still at great financial \n     risk. In 2009, nearly one in four non-elderly Americans with \n     insurance--53.2 million people--will spend more than 10 \n     percent of their pre-tax income on health care.\\9\\ The \n     problem is even worse for an estimated 14.3 million non-\n     elderly Americans with insurance who will spend more than a \n     quarter of their pre-tax income on health care in 2009. This \n     financial burden means that some Americans are literally \n     becoming impoverished in order to pay for health care \n     costs.\\10\\\n       When families are pushed to the brink by the current health \n     care crisis, some must make tough choices between paying for \n     health coverage and paying for other necessities, while \n     others have no choice at all--they are simply forced to go \n     without coverage. A previous Families USA report found that \n     during the two-year period from 2007-2008, an estimated 86.7 \n     million Americans under the age of 65--one in three non-\n     elderly Americans--were uninsured.\\11\\ The majority of these \n     individuals (79.2 percent) were from working families where \n     at least one family member was employed full- or part-time. \n     These individuals either work for an employer that does not \n     offer health coverage, or they cannot afford the coverage \n     that is offered. The data presented in this report show that \n     the number of people who find themselves in this situation is \n     growing in every state (see table on page 2).\n\n\n      Growing Unemployment Contributes to Further Coverage Losses\n\n       Since the data presented in this report are based primarily \n     on working Americans, they do not account directly for the \n     effect that growing unemployment is having on losses of \n     health coverage. Nonetheless, with the economy in recession, \n     rising unemployment is almost certainly fueling additional \n     increases in the number of people who are losing coverage. \n     The Urban Institute estimates that every 1 percent increase \n     in the unemployment rate leads to a 0.59 percent increase in \n     the number of adults under the age of 65 without health \n     coverage.\\12\\ Between January 2008 and June 2009, \n     unemployment swelled by 4.6 percent, so it is safe to assume \n     that states will experience even greater losses of coverage \n     between 2008 and 2010 than can be captured by our Key \n     Findings.\\13\\\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       With each passing week, more Americans are losing their \n     health coverage, and they will continue doing so if current \n     economic patterns hold. Recent polling data show that \n     Americans fear that instability in the availability and \n     affordability of their health coverage will continue if \n     health reform is not enacted.\\14\\ In order to stem the rising \n     tide of uninsured in this country and to provide American \n     families with stable health coverage that they can depend on, \n     Congress should act expeditiously to pass health reform \n     legislation. As this report suggests, the longer Congress \n     waits to enact meaningful health reform, the more American \n     families will lose coverage in each and every state.\n\n\n                                Endnotes\n\n       \\1\\ Paul Fronstin, Sources of Health Insurance and \n     Characteristics of the Uninsured: Analysis of the March 2008 \n     CPS Survey (Washington: Employee Benefit Research Institute, \n     September 2008).\n       \\2\\ Todd P.

I will submit for the Record only two pages of this; it is \na long report. It includes the cover page and then a page on \nPennsylvania which I will briefly refer to, and then I wish to talk \nabout how the report implicates and examines the information on the \nchart I have on my left.\n  Here is what the report says on page 86 for Pennsylvania. It is true \nof a lot of States, but unfortunately for Pennsylvania, it is a higher \nnumber. I am quoting from part of page 86:\n\n       By 2016----\n\n  Just 7 years away----\n\n     Pennsylvania residents will have to spend nearly $27,000, or \n     close to 52 percent of median household income to buy health \n     insurance for themselves and their families. This represents \n     a 93 percent increase over 2008 levels and the sixth highest \n     premium cost in the country.\n\n  So in Pennsylvania, if we do nothing, if we stay on that road to the \nstatus quo, which I believe is the road to ruin when it comes to the \nbudgets of our families and our businesses--if we stay on that road, \nfor Pennsylvania, it means that by 2016, the people of Pennsylvania \nwill be paying 52 percent of their median household income to buy \nhealth insurance for themselves and their families. That is what it \nmeans. That is what the status quo is. That is where we are headed if \nwe say, Well, we couldn't get the job done here in Washington.\n  The chart on my left is also a chart that reflects the work of the \nNew America Foundation, ``The Cost of Doing Nothing.'' These are U.S. \nnumbers between 2008 and 2016. The cost of premiums now, as of 2008, is \n$13,244, going up to $24,291; in just 8 years, an 83.4 percent \nincrease. That is the status quo. That is where we are headed. That is \nwhere we are going if we listen to the voices in Washington that say it \nis too tough to do this. People are not ready for this yet. There are \ntoo many powerful special interests telling us not to do it. It might \nbe insurance interests, it might be business interests, or it might be \nvery partisan politicians telling us we shouldn't do this. That is the \ncost of doing nothing. That is the status quo.\n  I will go to the next chart which again is from this report, ``The \nCost of Doing Nothing,'' and this is a U.S. number as well: Share of \nhousehold income spent on premiums climbing. As I said, in \nPennsylvania, where the share of median household income would go up to \n52 percent, in those few short years, 7 or 8 years--the U.S. number \nfortunately for the rest of the country is a little less, but it is \nstill very high. So if we do nothing, if we stay where we are and do \nthe same old thing--runaway costs, lower quality, no prevention, all of \nthe things we are not doing now--we will go from a median family \nincome, them paying 26 percent of their income for health care, which \nis high in and of itself, to paying over 45 percent of their income for \nhealth care. Again, this chart depicts the status quo, the cost of \ndoing nothing.\n  When we talk about costs here, we have to talk about the cost of \ndoing nothing. What people are paying now is in my judgment too high. \nWe ought to try to bring that number down, but we should certainly \navoid at all costs that number going up for the American people.\n  I don't know too many families out there--maybe there are a few--but \nI don't know too many families in America and I don't know any in \nPennsylvania who have come up to me and said, You know what. Don't \nworry about getting health care done because in 7 or 8 years I will be \nable to afford 52 percent of my income to go to health care. I haven't \nheard that from anybody in my State. I doubt there is anybody in \nAmerica who will say, You know what. Let's not do anything. Let's stay \non the road we are on. I can afford and my family can afford to pay 45 \npercent of our income to health care in a couple of years. Don't worry \nabout it. We are going to be fine. So that is what the status quo is, \nand that is where we are headed.\n  Finally, I would conclude with this. When we listen to the voices of \nthe American people, people such as Trisha Urban, as I mentioned \nbefore, who in her letter to me of February, right in the middle of the \nletter said this: She talked about her husband having to make a change, \nthat he had to leave his job for 1 year to complete an internship \nrequirement to complete his doctorate in psychology. So as he is trying \nto advance his education, he pays a health care price. That is another \nwhole part of this story, before he died. She said the internship was \nunpaid and they could not afford COBRA.\n  Why should a change in someone's life to improve their education to \ncomplete a doctorate affect their health care? That is the system we \nhave. That is the status quo.\n  But then she says:\n\n\n[[Page S8073]]\n\n\n       Because of preexisting conditions, neither my husband's \n     health issues nor my pregnancy would be covered under private \n     insurance.\n\n  Because of preexisting conditions. So because her husband had a heart \nproblem and because she was pregnant, that works against them. That is \nthe system we have for too many families.\n  So when people talk about: Oh, the HELP Committee passed a bill, the \nAffordable Health Choices Act, which I believe does stabilize costs and \nensures quality and secures our choices, it is more than that, it is \nmore than the headlines and the descriptions. We can go right to the \nbill language and show how this legislation, in a very specific way in \na number of instances, responds to what Trisha Urban has told us in her \nletter, what she has challenged us with. She didn't write to me to say, \nWell, this preexisting thing is kind of a nuisance. It was a bar, an \nimpediment to her and her family getting health care, basic health \ncare. Why should this even be something we have to legislate about? One \nwould think that in America today, with all of the wealth we have and \nall of the great power, we would have fixed this years ago, but we have \nfamilies who are not getting health care because the insurance company \nsays you have a preexisting condition. Sorry, you have to wait; or \nsorry, you get no treatment at all.\n  That is the status quo, and that is one of the costs of doing \nnothing. How do you calculate a preexisting condition being a bar to \nyou getting coverage? I don't know. I know one thing: Despite all the \ntalk in Washington about what this might mean, who is arguing with \nwhom, what the debate is about between Democrats and Republicans, in \nthis bill we answer Trisha Urban's question on preexisting conditions. \nHere it is.\n  This is bill language not some talking point or some general \ndescription. This is in the bill that sometimes people in Washington \ndon't want to examine because the language is reform. The language is \nagainst the status quo. The language on this provision, especially, is \na dramatic change in policy--something the insurance companies have not \nwanted to do on their own. The American people are finally saying, \nthrough their elected representatives and this bill, that we are going \nto make sure preexisting conditions don't bar treatment, that \npreexisting conditions don't prohibit Trisha Urban and her family from \ngetting the kind of health care they deserve.\n  Here is what section 2705 says:\n\n       Prohibition of preexisting condition exclusions or other \n     discrimination based on health status.\n\n  The American people want to know what is in the bill.\n\n       A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering \n     group or individual health insurance coverage may not impose \n     any preexisting condition exclusion with respect to such plan \n     or coverage.\n\n  It is right in the bill. There are some people here who would not \ntalk about that because they would rather debate no bill. They would \nrather debate, well, we have a suspicion that it is going to cost too \nmuch. But they don't show any evidence, and they don't have a competing \nargument or a bill. This is right in the bill--``may not impose any \npreexisting condition.''\n  That is a dramatic change in health care policy in America in 2009. \nIt is not part of the debate. For the next couple of weeks and months, \nwhat we are going to do is tell people a lot about what we have been \nworking on in Washington. Day by day, we will tell them what is exactly \nin this bill, and we will keep talking about it so more people \nunderstand it.\n  Unfortunately, some would not understand it because the special \ninterests in Washington would rather talk about the perceived \ncontroversy.\n  I suggest that people go to the Web site for the committee that \nworked on this bill. The HELP Committee Web site is help.senate.gov. Go \nto that Web site and review the language on preexisting conditions or \nanything else. I believe at the end of the day, it is going to be very \nclear who stands for the status quo and doing the same thing and no \nchange versus what the President and a lot of us are trying to do, \nwhich is change, reform, and give people, such as Trisha Urban, some \npeace of mind, some stability to know that she and her family--which \nis, now that her husband is gone, she and her daughter would not have \nto worry about this ever again.\n  Isn't that what we ought to be doing? I think we can do that together \nand in a bipartisan way. I believe we have no choice but to turn away \nfrom the status quo and go down the path of change and reform.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination \nof Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be the Associate Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Last week, the Judiciary Committee held 4 days of hearings in Judge \nSotomayor's nomination, including 2\\1/2\\ days of testimony from the \njudge herself.\n  I came away from these hearings deeply impressed with her intellect, \nthoughtfulness, demeanor, and integrity. These characteristics, already \nplainly evident in her judicial record and lifetime of accomplishment, \nshone even more brightly in last week's hearing.\n  Her respect for the law, for precedent, and for the prerogatives of \nthe Congress will help ensure that the Supreme Court is a place where \nevery party, whether powerful or powerless, can get a fair hearing.\n  In short, the hearings confirmed that Judge Sotomayor has all the \nessential qualities that will enable her to serve all Americans well, \nand the rule of law, on our Nation's highest Court.\n  Mr. President, my support for Judge Sotomayor is even stronger given \nour current economic circumstances. One might ask, what is the \nconnection between our national economy and the Supreme Court \nnomination? The answer lies in the fact that today, while we have a \nreal need for significant financial regulatory reform, we also face a \nSupreme Court too prone to disregard congressional policy choices.\n\n  I raise the economic crisis, and the regulation that will be \nnecessary to prevent the next crisis, because I am concerned that the \ncurrent Supreme Court is overly protective of corporate interests at \nthe expense of everyday Americans.\n  As I watch this Court, I am reminded of the recent observation by \nlegal commentator Jeffrey Toobin that the record of the current Chief \nJustice ``reflects a view that the court should almost always defer to \nthe existing power relationships in society.''\n  As Toobin reports, in every major case the Chief Justice sided with \nthe corporate defendant over the individual plaintiff. In business \ncases before today's Supreme Court, I am worried that it is possible to \npredict the outcome simply by knowing the parties and the nature of the \ndispute. The facts and the law sometimes seem secondary. For example, \nin Leegin v. PSKS, the Court overturned 96 years of precedent and \neffectively legalized agreements between manufacturers and retailers to \nfix prices. In Exxon v. Baker, the Court sided with a company that \nrecklessly destroyed the livelihoods of tens of thousands of Alaskans, \ndramatically reducing their punitive damages award that represented \njust a small percentage of the company's earnings. In Gross v. FBL \nFinancial Services, the Court made it more difficult to prove age \ndiscrimination. And in Ledbetter v. Goodyear, the Court made it \nimpossible for many plaintiffs to recover for unequal pay based on \nintentional sexual discrimination. So egregious was the Ledbetter \ndecision that the Congress made sure legislation overturning it was the \nfirst bill to reach President Obama's desk. And legislation is pending \nthat would overturn\n\n[[Page S8074]]\n\nLeegin as well. Congress shouldn't have to pass every bill twice.\n  It is essential for our economic recovery that the Court respect the \nintent of Congress when it acts to regulate the markets. And make no \nmistake, we must reform our financial markets. The last 2 years have \ngiven us the final grade on an economic theory that is deeply \nsuspicious of regulation and trusts the markets to police themselves. \nThe grade was an F. America will no longer stand for a system that \npermits financial institutions to profit from risky bets and then beg \nthe taxpayer for a bailout when those bets go bad. Three decades of \nderegulation has gone too far. The ability of the greedy and the \npowerful to enrich themselves at the expense of the taxpayer must be \nstopped.\n  Congress can and will enact a dramatically improved regulatory \nsystem. The President can and will make sure the relevant enforcement \nagencies are populated with smart, motivated, and effective agents. My \nconcern is that a Supreme Court resistant to Federal Government \ninvolvement in and regulation of markets could undermine those efforts. \nI am not suggesting that we face a return to the New Deal-era Court, a \nCourt determined to strike down regulatory reform as beyond the \nauthority of Congress, but a Court predisposed against government \nregulation might chip away at the edges of reform, materially reducing \nits effectiveness.\n  That is why my questioning of Judge Sotomayor focused on her \nexperience with business and business cases. She worked as a commercial \nlitigator and business lawyer for 8 years. For the past 17 years, she \nhas served on the most active Federal courts for business disputes--6 \nyears on the Southern District of New York and 11 on the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. Based on that extensive record, and her answers to \nquestions last week, we now know not only that she possesses enormous \nexpertise in business litigation but also that she calls these cases \nright down the middle, without any bias or agenda. For Judge Sotomayor, \nthe facts and the law, not the identity of the parties, drive the \nresult.\n  When Justice Souter announced his retirement in May, I suggested that \nthe Court would benefit from a much broader range of experience among \nits members. My concern at the time wasn't the relative lack of women \nor racial or ethnic minorities on the Court--though that deficit is \nglaring. I was pointing to the fact that most of the current Justices, \nwhether they were Black or White, women or men, share roughly the same \nlife experiences.\n  Judge Sotomayor will bring a much needed breadth of experience to the \nCourt. Unlike the other Justices, who lack extensive experience with \nprivate industry and any experience on the trial court, Judge Sotomayor \nunderstands the motivation and needs of the businesses that come before \nher. Judging from her ability to communicate her thoughts and ideas \nduring the committee hearings last week, I am confident that other \nJustices, and by extension the entire Court, will benefit by the \naddition of Judge Sotomayor's voice to its deliberations in business \ncases.\n  As we undertake financial regulatory reform and other fixes for our \ndamaged economy, having judges who leave the lawmaking to lawmakers is \nabsolutely essential. Judge Sotomayor told me she understands that \n``policymaking is up to the Congress'' and that ``judges can't \nsubstitute their own judgment'' for that of the Congress, regardless of \ntheir view of the wisdom of a policy or regulation.\n  Throughout her career, she has taken each case that comes without \npredilection, giving full consideration to the arguments of both sides \nbefore reaching a decision. That is precisely the approach to judging \nwe need on today's Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, Judge Sotomayor has a superior intellect, broad \nexperience, superb judgment, and unquestioning integrity that would \nmake her an outstanding nominee at any time. But given our current \neconomic crisis and the likely role of the Court in reviewing \nlegislative responses to that crisis, I submit she is the ideal nominee \nat this time. Her extensive experience as a commercial litigator, \nbusiness lawyer and judge in business cases, and the passion for the \nlaw she has demonstrated throughout her career suggests she will be a \nleader on the Court at a time when such leadership is essential.\n  I urge my colleagues to confirm Judge Sonia Sotomayor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe violence that continues to plague our southern border region by \nMexico's well-armed, well-financed, and very determined drug cartels.\n  Last weekend, I went to Yuma, AZ, and met with Border Patrol and \nCustoms and other law enforcement agents who do such an outstanding job \nfor our country.\n  By the way, the temperature was approximately 115 degrees, and our \nmen and women, who are serving so well, were out there trying to secure \nour border and keep our country safe.\n  Despite the increased efforts of President Calderon to stamp out \nthese bloodthirsty and vicious drug cartels, violence has increased \ndramatically, claiming over 6,000 lives in Mexico last year alone. The \nmurderers carrying out these crimes are as violent and dangerous as any \nin the world. Many have extensive military training and carry out their \nillegal activities with sophisticated tactical weapons and no regard \nfor human life.\n  Last week, the Washington Post reported that 12 Mexican Federal \nagents were murdered and left alongside a mountain road in retaliation \nfor the arrest of the leader of the country's most violent drug cartel, \nLa Familia. According to the article, this act represents ``the highest \none-day death toll for Federal forces in the 3-year-old drug war.'' The \narticle provides the deadly details of the violent attack, reporting:\n\n       The attacks began at dawn on Saturday . . . shortly after \n     the arrest of the right-hand man of La Familia founder \n     Nazario Moreno Gonzalez. After La Familia gunmen were \n     repelled in their attempt to free (the leader), they went \n     on what police described as a shooting rampage to \n     ``avenge'' his capture. The attacks, in which convoys of \n     gunmen mounted surprise assaults on government positions \n     in eight cities, went on for 10 hours Saturday and \n     continued sporadically Sunday.\n\n  The bodies of these brave law enforcement officers were accompanied \nby a note promising future violence from La Familia if the Federal \nGovernment continues its law enforcement efforts. I remind my \ncolleagues that this is the same drug cartel that, according to the \nWashington Post, ``announced its presence 2 years ago by rolling five \ndecapitated heads into a dance hall.''\n  Earlier this month, two American citizens with dual citizenship were \ndragged out of their homes and shot several times in the head in the \nMexican state of Chihuahua. The reason was that the victims, according \nto the Associated Press:\n\n       helped lead the town's approximately 2,000 inhabitants in \n     protest against a May 2 kidnapping. The residents refused to \n     pay the $1 million ransom kidnappers requested and \n     demonstrated in the Chihuahua state capital to demand \n     justice. Even after (the kidnapped victim) was released \n     unharmed a week later, the (town's) people continued to lead \n     marches demanding more law enforcement in the rural, isolated \n     corner of Chihuahua state. They also set up a committee to \n     report any suspicious activities in town to police, quickly \n     becoming an example for other Chihuahua communities.\n\n  Yesterday's Washington Post front-page story about these events \nstates:\n\n       Chihuahua today is the emblem of a failed state, run by \n     incompetent authorities who have little ability to protect \n     the citizens.\n\n  The violence that has terrorized Mexican citizens continues to seep \nacross the border, devastating families and crippling communities. In \nmy hometown of Phoenix, there have been over 700 reported kidnappings \nin the past year. This has led to Phoenix being declared the \n``kidnapping capital of the United States,'' second only to Mexico City \nin the world. In many cases, kidnap victims are intertwined with \ncriminal elements of society, involved with illegal cross-border \nsmuggling operations.\n  The police chief of Phoenix testified in April before the Senate's \nHomeland Security Committee that Phoenix is a transshipment point for \nillegal drugs and smuggled humans, both coming to Phoenix before being \nshipped to other points throughout the United States.\n\n[[Page S8075]]\n\n  Immigrants illegally crossing the border with paid ``coyotes'' are \ntreated like expendable cargo to be bought, sold, traded, or stolen. In \nmany cases, the immigrants' families are ransomed for additional funds \nby bajadores, or takedown crews, to guarantee safe delivery of their \nloved ones.\n  As detailed in a Newsweek article from earlier this year:\n\n       Kidnap victims have been found bound and gagged, their \n     fingers smashed and their foreheads spattered with blood from \n     pistol whippings. When the bajadores abduct illegal \n     immigrants--hoping to extort more money from relatives--they \n     will sometimes kill someone off immediately to scare the \n     others. There was a case last year where they duct-taped the \n     mouth and nose of one individual and had the others watch \n     while he asphyxiated and defecated on himself.\n\n  These are not pleasant things. They are not pleasant things to \ndescribe. But they are going on right now as we speak.\n  Aside from the horrible toll these cartels extract from their victims \nand the victims' families, they also severely tax the resources of law \nenforcement agencies of border communities. The police chief of Phoenix \nalso testified that the Phoenix police receive a kidnapping report \nalmost every night, which can require the efforts of up to 60 officers \nto find, rescue, and protect kidnap victims.\n  Lest you believe these activities are limited to border communities, \nlast year the bodies of five Mexican men were discovered bound, gagged, \nand electrocuted in Birmingham, AL, in an apparent hit by a Mexican \ncartel. In recent years, arrests of Mexican cartel members have \noccurred across the South, including Tennessee, North Carolina, and \nGeorgia.\n  There is no sign that the number of these drug-related arrests will \nabate in the near future, which is why I support efforts to complete \nthe proposed 700 miles of double-layer fence. But, as we have seen, \nfencing alone fails to take into account the realities of the southern \nborder and should not be treated as a panacea. These criminal smuggling \nenterprises are very sophisticated and are not easily deterred, which \nis why we must work to truly secure our border, not merely fence it.\n  This past weekend, as I mentioned, I visited the border in Yuma, AZ, \nand witnessed the extraordinary lengths these cartels go to smuggle \ntheir goods across the border. One cartel spent upwards of $1 million \nusing sophisticated GPS-directed drilling equipment to develop their \ntunnel far below the surface to move goods underneath fencing and out \nof sight of law enforcement agencies.\n  In Nogales, AZ, drug traffickers have used the city's sewer system to \nchannel drugs across the border. Every other month tunnels are \ndiscovered underneath the border. Since 1990, 110 cross-border tunnels \nhave been discovered. Twenty-four tunnels were discovered in 2008 \nalone.\n\n  Not to be deterred, our outstanding law enforcement officials have \ndeveloped investigative strategies and tunnel detection equipment to \nlocate and identify subterranean cross-border tunnels.\n  The latest, by the way, on the part of the drug cartels, is the use \nof ultralights. Ultralights now are being flown at extremely low \naltitude, loaded with drugs, across the Mexico-Arizona border and all \nacross the border.\n  We must also increase personnel on the border to put an end to \nillegal immigration and protect our citizens from the drug cartel \nviolence occurring in Mexico. For this reason, I was disappointed that \nthe administration rejected Arizona Governor Brewer's request--and the \nrequests of the Governors of California, New Mexico, and Texas--who \nalso requested National Guard troops to bolster the Joint Counter-\nNarcotics Terrorism Task Force. But, as we know, the coyotes are \naggressive and creative despite our efforts to secure the border with \nmore personnel, more fencing, and more surveillance technology.\n  The United States must keep its focus on securing our southern border \nand doing all it can to assist President Calderon in his efforts \nagainst these violent drug cartels. The prosperity and success of \nMexico is essential to the prosperity and success of our own country. \nWe share a border, our economies are intertwined, and we are major \ntrading partners with each other. The United States must show its \nsupport for our neighbor to the south and support the Mexican people \nand the Calderon administration in this fundamental struggle against \nlawlessness and corruption.\n  We have a big problem. We have a big problem with these drug cartels. \nThe Mexican Government now has a problem. They just lost an election \nbecause the people of Mexico, many of them, believe these drugs are \njust going through Mexico, intended for the United States of America.\n  Violence is at an incredibly high level not only on the border but \nthroughout the country of Mexico and, tragically, corruption reaches to \nvery high levels in the government. We have the Merida Initiative. We \nare working with the Mexican Government. But there is no time like the \npresent, in my view, because we need to not only enforce and increase \nour efforts on our side of the border but also work as closely as \npossible with the Mexican Government and people.\n  It is horrific what is taking place: beheadings of people, bodies \nhung from overpasses. These are amongst the most cruel and terrible \npeople who inhabit this Earth. It is a lot about drugs. It is a lot \nabout a $16-billion-a-year business, of drugs coming into the United \nStates of America. That is how they can afford to spend easily $1 \nmillion to build a tunnel underneath the border between Yuma, AZ, and \nMexico.\n  I know we have a lot of issues that are affecting the future of our \ncountry, including two wars, including relations with countries, \nincluding the Iranian situation, but I hope we can focus a lot of our \nattention on the problems that are bred on our border by the drug \ncartels and the human smuggling and the terrible mistreatment of people \non both sides of the border as a result of that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the articles in the Washington \nPost and Newsweek be printed in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 23, 2009]\n\n                         Ambushed by a Drug War\n\n                           (By William Booth)\n\n       Colonia Lebaron, Mexico--Mormon pioneer Alma Dayer LeBaron \n     had a vision when he moved his breakaway sect of polygamists \n     to this valley 60 years ago: His many children would live in \n     peace and prosperity among the pretty pecan orchards they \n     would plant in the desert.\n       Prosperity has come, but the peace has been shattered.\n       In the past three months, American Mormon communities in \n     Mexico have been sucked into a dust devil of violence \n     sweeping the borderlands. Their relative wealth has made them \n     targets: Their telephones ring with threats of extortion. \n     Their children and elders are taken by kidnappers. They have \n     been drawn into the government's war with the drug cartels.\n       This month, a leader of their colony was abducted by \n     heavily armed men dressed as police, then beaten and shot \n     dead 10 minutes from town. Benjamin LeBaron, 31, whom \n     everyone called Benji, had dared to denounce the criminals, \n     while refusing to pay a $1 million ransom demanded by \n     kidnappers who had grabbed his teenage brother from a family \n     ranch in May.\n       Amid the blood and mesquite at the site of his last breath, \n     Benjamin LeBaron's killers posted a sign that read: ``This is \n     for the leaders of LeBaron who didn't believe and who still \n     don't believe.''\n       ``We're living in a war zone, but it's a war zone with \n     little kids running all around in the yard,'' said Julian \n     LeBaron, a brother of the slain leader. Like most members of \n     the Mormon enclave, he has dual Mexican-American citizenship \n     and speaks Spanish and English fluently.\n       These Mormons, some who swear and drink beer, are the \n     latest collateral damage in the Mexican government's U.S.-\n     backed war against criminal organizations.\n       Here in Chihuahua, the border state south of Texas and New \n     Mexico, conditions are rapidly deteriorating. The violence \n     has left more than 1,000 dead in Ciudad Juarez this year, \n     even though the government has sent 10,000 troops and police \n     officers into the city.\n       Increasingly the violence is moving from the big cities \n     into the small, usually placid farm towns of the rugged \n     desert mountains. Criminal bands have ambushed the governor's \n     convoy along the highway, and they have assassinated local \n     police at stop lights and political leaders at will. Gunmen \n     executed the mayor of Namiquipa last week.\n       ``The northeast of Chihuahua is now a zone of \n     devastation,'' said Victor Quintana, a state lawmaker, who \n     reports an exodus of business people fleeing kidnappers and \n     farmers refusing to plant their crops because of extortion.\n       The columnist Alberto Aziz Nassif wrote in El Universal \n     newspaper, ``Chihuahua today is the emblem of a failed state, \n     run by incompetent authorities who have little ability to \n     protect the citizens.''\n\n[[Page S8076]]\n\n       Many of the Mormons have fled north to the United States, \n     and Julian LeBaron said he fears for his life. He has reason. \n     In Ciudad Juarez, a three-hour drive to the north, hand-\n     painted banners were hung from overpasses last week \n     threatening the extended clan.\n       ``All we want to do is live in peace. We want nothing to do \n     with the drug cartels. They can't be stopped. What we want is \n     just to protect ourselves from being kidnapped and killed,'' \n     said Marco LeBaron, a college student who came home for the \n     funeral of his brother, the slain anti-crime activist. Marco \n     LeBaron is one of 70 Mormons who have volunteered to join a \n     rural police force to protect the town. The Mexican \n     government has given them permission to arm themselves.\n\n\n                        Dragged Into Drug Fight\n\n       For all the violence swirling around them, the Mormons have \n     mostly stayed out of the fight. Their ancestors first settled \n     in Mexico in the 1880s, during the reign of dictator Porfirio \n     Diaz, who offered the religious outcasts refuge from the \n     harassment and prosecution they faced in the United States \n     for their polygamist lifestyles. Some men in Colonia LeBaron \n     and surrounding towns continue to follow what early Mormon \n     prophets called ``the Principle,'' marrying multiple wives \n     and having dozens of children, though the custom here is \n     fading. Polygamy was banned by the Church of Jesus Christ of \n     Latter-Day Saints, the official Mormon Church, in 1890.\n       The Mormon community based in Colonia LeBaron, numbering \n     about 1,000, has one motel, two grocery stores and lots of \n     schools. There are no ATMs and no liquor sales. Many Mormons \n     are conspicuous not only for their straw-colored hair and \n     pale skin, but also for their new pickup trucks, large \n     suburban-style homes with green front lawns, and big tracts \n     of land for their pecans and cattle. They are wealthy, by the \n     standards of their poor Mexican neighbors. Most of the Mormon \n     men make their money working construction jobs in the United \n     States; a young Mormon might work 10 years hanging drywall in \n     Las Vegas before he has enough money to buy a plot of land to \n     start his own pecan orchard here.\n       The Mormons were dragged into the drug fight on May 2, when \n     16-year-old Eric LeBaron and a younger brother were hauling a \n     load of fence posts in their truck to their father's ranch in \n     the Sierra Madre. According to the family's account, five \n     armed men seized Eric and told his brother to run home and \n     tell his father to answer the telephone. When the kidnappers \n     called, they told Joel LeBaron that if he ever wanted to see \n     Eric again, he must pay them $1 million.\n       The next day, 150 men gathered at the church house in \n     Colonia LeBaron to debate what to do. They had no confidence \n     in the local police. One of their members, Ariel Ray, the \n     mayor of nearby Galeana, reminded them that someone had put \n     an empty coffin in the bed of his pickup. Some men argued \n     that they should hire professional bounty hunters from the \n     United States to get Eric back. Others wanted to form a \n     posse.\n       ``But we knew the last thing we could do was give them the \n     money, or we would be invaded by this scum,'' Julian LeBaron \n     said.\n       Another brother, Craig LeBaron, told the Deseret News in \n     Salt Lake City: ``If you give them a cookie, they'll want a \n     glass of milk. If we don't make a stand here, it's only a \n     matter of time before it's my kid.''\n       A caravan of hundreds of the LeBaron Mormons, along with \n     Mennonites and others, went to the state capital to protest \n     the crime. This kind of public advocacy is almost unheard of \n     among the Mexican Mormons, who keep to themselves. Led by \n     Benjamin LeBaron, the protesters met with the governor and \n     state attorney general, who quickly dispatched \n     helicopters, police and soldiers to the area. The \n     government forces erected roadblocks and searched the \n     countryside.\n       Eric LeBaron was freed eight days after his abduction. His \n     kidnappers simply told him to go home. But soon after, \n     another member of the community, Meredith Romney, a 72-year-\n     old bishop related to former Republican presidential \n     candidate Mitt Romney, was taken captive. The state governor \n     sent Colombian security consultants to LeBaron. The Mormons, \n     led by an increasingly public and outspoken Benjamin LeBaron, \n     formed a group called SOS Chihuahua to organize citizens to \n     defend themselves, report crimes and demand results from \n     authorities. LeBaron was featured prominently in the local \n     media. He gave a speech to a graduating class of police \n     cadets. He staged rallies. He got noticed.\n\n\n                         Attack on Family Home\n\n       Early on July 7, four trucks loaded with men passed through \n     a highway tollbooth, where they were recorded on videotape \n     outside Galeana, where Benjamin LeBaron lived in a sprawling, \n     new stucco home with his wife and five young children. Two \n     trucks stopped at the cemetery outside town and waited. Two \n     pickup trucks filled with 15 to 20 heavily armed men, wearing \n     helmets, bulletproof vests and blue uniforms, came for \n     LeBaron.\n       They smashed in his home's windows and shouted for him to \n     open the door, as his terrified children cried inside, \n     according to an account given by his brothers. LeBaron's \n     brother-in-law Luis Widmar, 29, who lived across the street, \n     heard the commotion and ran to his aid. Both men were beaten \n     by the gunmen, who threatened to rape LeBaron's wife in front \n     of her children unless the men revealed where LeBaron kept \n     his arsenal of weapons.\n       ``But he didn't have any, because I promise you, if he did, \n     he would have used them to protect his family,'' Julian \n     LeBaron said.\n       LeBaron and Widmar were shot in the head outside town. A \n     banner was hung beside their bodies that blamed them for the \n     arrest of 25 gunmen who were seized in June after terrorizing \n     the town of Nicolas Bravo, where they burned down buildings \n     and extorted from business owners. According to Mexican law \n     enforcement officials, the gunmen are members of the Sinaloa \n     drug cartel, which is fighting the Juarez cartel for billion-\n     dollar cocaine-smuggling routes into El Paso.\n       After the men killed LeBaron and Widmar, a video camera \n     captured their departure at the highway tollbooth--the make, \n     model and year of their vehicles and the license numbers, \n     according to family members. There have been no arrests.\n       Who killed Benji LeBaron--and why? These questions are \n     difficult to answer in Mexico's drug war, and the unknowns \n     fuel the fear of those left in Colonia LeBaron.\n       The state attorney general, Patricia Gonzalez, blamed the \n     group La Linea, the Line, the armed enforcement wing of \n     former police officers and gunmen that works for the Juarez \n     cartel. A few months ago, Gonzalez said La Linea was an \n     exhausted remnant of dead-enders whose ranks had been \n     decimated by infighting and arrests.\n       After Gonzalez said the Juarez cartel was responsible for \n     the killings, banners appeared in Ciudad Juarez that read: \n     ``Mrs. Prosecutor, avoid problems for yourself, and don't \n     blame La Linea.'' The message stated that the LeBaron \n     killings were the work of the Sinaloa cartel. On Wednesday, \n     another banner was hung from an overpass, suggesting that \n     Benji LeBaron was a thief: ``Ask yourself where did all his \n     properties come from?''\n       At the LeBaron funeral, attended by more than 2,000 people, \n     including the Chihuahua state governor and attorney general, \n     Benji's uncle Adrian LeBaron said, ``The men who murdered \n     them have no children, no parents, no mother. They are the \n     spawn of evil.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From Newsweek, Mar. 14, 2009]\n\n                            The Enemy Within\n\n                 (By Eve Conant and Arian Campo-Flores)\n\n       As Manuel exited the Radio Shack in Phoenix with his family \n     one afternoon last month, a group of Hispanic men standing in \n     the parking lot watched him closely. ``Do it now, do it \n     now,'' one said to another in Spanish, according to a \n     witness. One of the men approached Manuel, pointed a revolver \n     at his head and tried to force him into a Ford Expedition \n     parked close by. ``Please, I'll get into the car, just don't \n     touch me,'' Manuel pleaded as he entered the vehicle, his \n     wife told police. Nearby, she said, another man in a Chrysler \n     sedan aimed a rifle or shotgun out the driver's side window. \n     At some point, shots were fired, said witnesses, although \n     apparently no one was hit. Then the vehicles tore off with a \n     screech of tires.\n       Later that evening, the phone rang. When Manuel's wife \n     picked up, a male voice said in Spanish, ``Don't call the \n     police,'' and then played a recording of Manuel saying, \n     ``Tell the kids I'm OK.'' The man said he'd call again, then \n     hung up. Despite the warning, Manuel's wife contacted the \n     cops. In subsequent calls, the kidnappers told her Manuel \n     owed money for drugs, and they demanded $1 million and his \n     Cadillac Escalade as ransom.\n       When two men later retrieved the Escalade and drove off, \n     the cops chased them and forced them off the road. Both men, \n     illegal immigrants from Mexico, said they'd been paid by a \n     man (who authorities believe has high-level drug connections) \n     to drive the vehicle to Tucson. So far, police say, Manuel \n     hasn't reappeared, and his family has been reluctant to \n     cooperate further with law enforcement. ``He's a drug dealer, \n     and he lost a load,'' says Lt. Lauri Burgett of the Phoenix \n     Police Department's recently created kidnapping squad. ``He \n     was probably brought to Mexico to answer for that.''\n       Surprising as it may seem, Phoenix has become America's \n     kidnapping capital. Last year 368 abductions were reported, \n     compared with 117 in 2000. Police say the real number is \n     likely much higher, since many go unreported. Though in the \n     past most of the nabbings stemmed from domestic-violence \n     incidents, now the majority are linked to drug-trafficking \n     and human-smuggling operations that pervade the Arizona \n     corridor. It's still unclear to what extent the snatchings \n     are being directly ordered by Mexican cartels, but \n     authorities say they're undoubtedly a byproduct of the drug-\n     fueled mayhem south of the border. ``The tactics are moving \n     north,'' says assistant police chief Andy Anderson. ``We \n     don't have the violence they have in Mexico yet--the killing \n     of police officers and the beheadings--but in terms of \n     kidnappings and home invasions, it has come.''\n       That raises an unnerving prospect: that the turmoil in \n     Mexico--where drug violence claimed more than 6,000 lives \n     last year--is finally seeping across the border. According to \n     a December report by the Justice Department's National Drug \n     Intelligence Center, Mexican drug-trafficking organizations \n     have established a presence in 230 U.S. cities, including \n     such remote places as Anchorage, Alaska, and Sheboygan, Wis.\n       The issue is preoccupying American officials. ``This is \n     getting the highest level of attention,'' including the \n     president's, says Homeland Security Secretary Janet \n     Napolitano. She tells NEWSWEEK that the\n\n[[Page S8077]]\n\n     administration is dispatching additional Customs and Border \n     Protection and Immigration and Customs Enforcement personnel \n     to the border, and it's reviewing requests from the governors \n     of Arizona and Texas for help from National Guard troops. \n     Earlier this month, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, visited Mexico to discuss assistance and to \n     share potentially relevant lessons that the United States has \n     learned in Iraq and Afghanistan, says a senior Pentagon \n     official familiar with details of the trip who wasn't \n     authorized to speak on the record.\n       All the attention has stoked public debate on a \n     particularly fraught question--whether Mexico is a failing \n     state. A U.S. Joint Forces Command study released last \n     November floated that scenario, grouping the country with \n     Pakistan as a potential candidate for ``sudden and rapid \n     collapse.'' Such a comparison is excessive, says Eric Olson \n     of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Mexico Institute in \n     Washington, D.C., though the Mexican government confronts \n     ``real problems of sovereignty in certain areas'' of the \n     country. Administration officials are striving to tone down \n     the rhetoric and focus on ways to help. Among the priorities, \n     says Olson: to cut American demand for drugs, to provide \n     additional training and equipment to law-enforcement and \n     military personnel in Mexico, and to clamp down on drug \n     cash--an estimated $23 billion per year--and assault weapons \n     flowing into the country from the United States.\n       As the violence continues to spiral in Mexico, reports of \n     cartel-related activity are on the rise in American cities \n     far removed from the border. Last August the bodies of five \n     Mexican men were discovered bound, gagged and electrocuted in \n     Birmingham, Ala., in what was believed to be a hit ordered by \n     Mexican narcotraffickers. A few months later, 33 people with \n     cartel ties were indicted in Greeneville, Tenn., for \n     distributing 24,000 pounds of marijuana. In neighboring North \n     Carolina, ``there are cartel cells . . . that are a direct \n     extension from Mexico,'' says John Emerson, the Drug \n     Enforcement Administration's special agent in charge in the \n     state.\n       Law enforcement in Atlanta, where a maze of interstates \n     provides distribution routes throughout the Southeast, has \n     dubbed the city ``the new Southwest border.'' ``All those \n     trends are coming here,'' says Fred Stephens of the Georgia \n     Bureau of Investigations. ``We are seeing alarming patterns, \n     the same violence.'' He ticks off a spate of cartel-linked \n     crimes in the state--assaults, abductions, executions. Last \n     May authorities in Gwinnett County found a kidnap victim, \n     along with 11 kilos of cocaine and $7.65 million in shrink-\n     wrapped bundles, in a house rented by an alleged Gulf cartel \n     cell leader. A few months later, a suspected drug dealer in \n     Lawrenceville was abducted by six men, dressed commando-style \n     in black, and held for a $2 million ransom (he escaped).\n       Nothing rivals the rash of kidnappings in Phoenix, however. \n     As border enforcement has tightened the screws on the \n     California and Texas crossings, Arizona has become a prime \n     gateway for illicit trafficking--in both directions. ``The \n     drugs and people come north, the guns go south,'' says \n     Elizabeth Kempshall, the DEA's special agent in charge of the \n     Phoenix division. Arizona is mostly dominated by the Sinaloa \n     cartel, which authorities say is trying to assert greater \n     control over the U.S. drug trade. Yet analysts believe the \n     organization has fractured--most notably last summer, when \n     the Beltran Leyva brothers reportedly split from leader \n     Joaquin (El Chapo) Guzman.\n       That internecine conflict, along with cartel encroachment \n     north of the border, has created something of a free-for-all \n     in Phoenix's criminal underworld. Among the groups that have \n     stepped into the breach: roving Mexican gangsters called \n     bajadores, or ``takedown'' crews, who are responsible for \n     many of the city's kidnappings. Often operating in packs \n     of five, they typically cross the border to commit crimes, \n     then retreat south, say police. Some work as enforcers for \n     the cartels, collecting payment from dealers who have \n     stiffed the capos or lost their loads. Others function as \n     freelancers, stealing shipments of drugs or illegal \n     immigrants from traffickers. ``We've seen an uptick in the \n     bajadores since last summer,'' says Al Richard, a Phoenix \n     police detective. ``We are seeing a lot more professionals \n     coming up here now.''\n       Bajadores are renowned for their ruthlessness. Kidnap \n     victims have been found bound and gagged, their fingers \n     smashed and their foreheads spattered with blood from pistol-\n     whippings. When the crews abduct illegal immigrants--hoping \n     to extort more money from relatives--''they will sometimes \n     kill someone off immediately to scare the others,'' says \n     Richard. ``There was a case last year where they duct-taped \n     the mouth and nose of one individual and had the others watch \n     while he asphyxiated and defecated on himself.'' Some \n     bajadores have branched out to home invasions. In one \n     incident last June, a gang broke into a home, outfitted in \n     Phoenix police gear and Kevlar vests--a hallmark of criminal \n     enterprises across the border.\n       To combat the problem, police in Phoenix created the \n     kidnapping squad--known officially as Home Invasion \n     Kidnapping Enforcement--last September. Led by Lieutenant \n     Burgett, the team of 10 lead investigators has already busted \n     31 crime cells and made more than 220 arrests. But ``it never \n     stops,'' she says. ``It's like a Texas ant hill.'' One of the \n     squad's main objectives: to keep the abductions confined to \n     the criminal world. ``Most of the time, our victims are as \n     bad as our suspects,'' says Sgt. Phil Roberts. ``We give them \n     five to 10 minutes to hug their wife, and then they are off \n     to jail themselves.'' If average citizens begin to get \n     ensnared, the result could be widespread panic. ``We don't \n     want what happens in Mexico to happen here, where they are \n     kidnapping bank presidents,'' he says. ``We don't want the \n     president of Wells Fargo to need a bodyguard.''\n       Last Tuesday afternoon, the squad was working a case \n     involving a suspected marijuana middleman. As police later \n     learned, a few days earlier, he'd allegedly brokered a deal \n     between a group of sellers and two buyers for 150 pounds of \n     pot. But when the parties gathered at a suburban house, the \n     two buyers held up the others and made off with $40,000 worth \n     of dope and cash. The man tried to escape, but a woman at the \n     house pulled a gun on him. ``You're not leaving,'' she said, \n     according to the middleman's subsequent account to police. \n     ``You set up this deal.'' The stolen goods were now his debt. \n     Eventually released, he scrambled to cobble together $40,000 \n     worth of possessions--three vehicles, 10 pounds of pot, some \n     cash--while a man who called himself ``Chuco'' rang him every \n     hour. But it wasn't enough. On Tuesday morning, Chuco arrived \n     at the man's house. ``I've got to go,'' the man told his \n     girlfriend, according to her statements to police. ``If I \n     don't pay, they're going to hurt me.'' His abductors, he \n     said, worked for El Chapo (an unconfirmed allegation).\n       Later that day, the man's girlfriend arrived at the police \n     station. Sleepless and frantic, she fielded repeated calls \n     from her boyfriend, who pleaded for her to raise additional \n     cash. The cops urged her to remain calm. ``I know you are \n     stressed, but you need to keep talking,'' said one of the \n     detectives. ``You are the only one who can do the \n     negotiating.'' She had already called some family members and \n     asked them to draw money from an equity line. But it wasn't \n     arriving quickly enough. ``I don't have it yet, baby,'' she \n     told her boyfriend on a subsequent call, as he grew more \n     distressed. ``I'm doing everything I can.''\n       Unbeknownst to the woman, the kidnapping squad had received \n     information on her boyfriend's possible location. As cops \n     approached the suspected house a little after midnight, an \n     SUV suddenly sped away. Police pursued it and pulled it over. \n     ``Tell us where he is!'' a detective told the passengers. \n     Just then, a Chevy Impala took off from the house. Another \n     chase ensued, and eventually the driver was forced to stop. \n     Inside were four passengers, with the middleman in the rear, \n     flanked by two men armed with weapons. Back at the station, \n     detectives questioned the parties; as of late last week, \n     charges were likely against four abductors, but not the \n     victim, due to a lack of evidence in the suspected marijuana \n     deal. But now he's on the cops' radar, says Burgett. ``We do \n     proactive follow-up on victims as well.''\n       Though much of Phoenix's kidnapping epidemic stems from \n     alleged drug deals gone awry, plenty are linked to the human-\n     smuggling trade. That work used to be dominated by small \n     ``mom and pop'' outfits, but in time, the cartels have \n     muscled in on it. Any group that wants to use their \n     trafficking routes has to pay up--about $2,000 per week for \n     Mexicans and $10,000 per week for ``exotics,'' like Chinese \n     and Middle Easterners, says Richard, the Phoenix detective. \n     That added business cost has encouraged some smugglers to try \n     to extort more money from their human loads--known as pollos, \n     or ``chickens''--once they've crossed the border. More and \n     more, pollos may change hands several times among duenos, or \n     ``owners''--a new, more violent breed of smugglers. The drop \n     houses used to stash immigrants are also becoming more \n     barbaric.\n       One recent night, the Human Smuggling Unit of the Maricopa \n     County sheriffs office received a tip on a drop house in a \n     middle-class neighborhood in Phoenix. Relatives of an \n     immigrant being held there had received an extortion call \n     demanding $3,500. Joined by a SWAT team, the unit made its \n     move, breaching windows and doors, which were boarded up (a \n     typical precaution taken by smugglers). A half dozen men \n     tried to escape but were grabbed, says Lt. Joe Sousa, the \n     unit commander. Inside were several dozen illegal immigrants, \n     all shoeless and famished. Authorities confiscated two \n     pistols, a sawed-off shotgun and a Taser-like device--''used \n     against people when they're put on the phone, begging their \n     relatives for cash,'' says Sousa. It was a good bust, he \n     says, but ``within a week or two, that same organization will \n     be back up and running.'' Sousa moved to Phoenix because he \n     thought it was a nice place to raise a family. But the \n     violence is out of control, he says. ``Soon as I retire, I'm \n     out of here.''\n       Many area residents who have had encounters with the \n     smuggling world share the sentiment. At a takedown of a \n     suspected drop house a few days earlier in nearby Avondale, a \n     neighbor became inconsolable describing the terror he \n     experienced living next door to what locals fear is a home to \n     ruthless criminals. ``It's been hell,'' said the man, who \n     refused to be named because he was scared. ``I have five \n     kids. I've been sleeping with two machine guns under my bed \n     for two years.'' He's planning to foreclose on his property \n     and flee with his family as soon as possible. Despite the \n     bust, the smugglers ``will be back,'' he said. ``Right now, \n     they are headed to the border, they'll chill out for a month, \n     and they'll be back.'' As overwrought as he may have been, he \n     was probably right.\n\n[[Page S8078]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n               [From the Washington Post, July 15, 2009]\n\n                 12 Federal Agents Are Slain in Mexico\n\n                           (By William Booth)\n\n       Nuevo Casas Grandes, Mexico, July 14.--Mexican authorities \n     said Tuesday that a super-violent drug cartel called La \n     Familia was responsible for torturing and killing 12 federal \n     agents whose bodies were found dumped alongside a mountain \n     road in the western state of Michoacan late Monday.\n       The agents, who included one woman, had been investigating \n     organized crime in Michoacan, where gunmen launched a series \n     of highly coordinated commando attacks against police \n     officers and soldiers over the weekend.\n       The abduction, torture and execution of such a large group \n     of federal agents marks a steep escalation in President \n     Felipe Calderon's war with the drug cartels. Though drug \n     mafias often clash with local police officials they fail to \n     intimidate or corrupt, a direct counterattack against federal \n     forces is almost unheard-of. The 12 agents represent the \n     highest one-day death toll for federal forces in the three-\n     year-old drug war.\n       Placed beside the corpses of the agents, who were off-duty \n     when they were abducted, was a sign threatening police, Monte \n     Alejandro Rubido, a senior federal security official, said at \n     a news conference.\n       Federal officials say they think the attacks by La Familia, \n     a mini-cartel that announced its presence two years ago by \n     rolling five decapitated heads into a dance hall, were \n     carried out in retaliation for the capture of one of the \n     group's leaders.\n       The attacks began at dawn Saturday in Michoacan's capital, \n     Morelia, shortly after the arrest of Arnold Rueda Medina, \n     reported to be the right-hand man of La Familia founder \n     Nazario Moreno Gonzalez, known as ``El Mas Loco,'' or the \n     Craziest One.\n       After La Familia gunmen were repelled in their attempt to \n     free Rueda, they went on what police described as a shooting \n     rampage to ``avenge'' his capture. The attacks, in which \n     convoys of gunmen mounted surprise assaults on government \n     positions in eight cities, went on for 10 hours Saturday and \n     continued sporadically Sunday.\n       Mexican law enforcement officials say La Familia is a \n     different kind of cartel, combining a code of extreme \n     violence with a commitment to protect Michoacan residents \n     from outsiders--which would include federal agents and army \n     soldiers.\n       Members of La Familia are recruited from rural militias and \n     drug treatment centers. Federal authorities swept into city \n     halls in Michoacan and arrested 10 mayors in May on suspicion \n     of colluding with the gang.\n       La Familia is fighting for control of cocaine-smuggling \n     routes that lead from the port of Lazaro Cardenas toward the \n     United States. The group also operates clandestine \n     methamphetamine labs and marijuana farms in the mountains.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I would like to address the nomination of \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  The Constitution confers upon the Senate the power to provide advice \nand consent on judicial nominations as one of the most solemn \nresponsibilities we have. Supreme Court Justices have always had \ntremendous power within our constitutional system of separated and \nenumerated powers. In recent decades, growing concern has arisen over \njudicial activism on the Court, which has the necessary consequence of \ntaking power away from the elected representatives, and thus the people \nthemselves, and conferring it to those with life tenure, unelected \njudges who have occasionally used this power conferred upon them in the \nConstitution to impose their own views and their own agenda on the \nAmerican people and substituting that for the views of their elected \nrepresentatives.\n  We now see that five votes on the U.S. Supreme Court can invent new \nrights that are not found in the Constitution or narrow the scope of \nrights that generations of Americans have come to view as fundamental. \nEach Justice serves for life, so every time a nominee comes before us I \nthink it is entirely appropriate, indeed required, that we exercise due \ncare in exercising this power of advice and consent.\n  Yes, Senators exercise the power, and also the responsibility we have \nunder the Constitution with great care and I believe with great respect \nfor every nominee. Sadly, over recent years we have seen judicial \nnominees treated with the opposite of respect and fairness. Some \nnominations have become quickly politicized, before the nominees have \neven had a chance to speak for themselves or to answer important \nquestions or, perhaps, to put their record in context. We have seen \noutrageous accusations used to score political points and to damage a \nnominee in the court of public opinion before they have had an \nopportunity to even answer those concerns themselves.\n  It is no secret that I remain deeply frustrated by the treatment of \nnominees such as Miguel Estrada, who was nominated by President George \nW. Bush to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, sometimes \nacknowledged as the second highest court in the land. Mr. Estrada was \nfilibustered seven times by the Democratic minority and refused an up-\nor-down vote on the Senate floor--something that was literally unheard \nof in previous times. Many Senators share my view that had he been \nconfirmed to the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, he could have \nbeen the first Hispanic nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court. Instead, \nthat honor goes to the nominee we have before us, Judge Sonia \nSotomayor.\n  From the beginning I was determined to make sure Judge Sotomayor's \nnomination process and hearing would be different from that given to \nMiguel Estrada and others. When I first met with her in June, I pledged \nto her that I would do everything in my power to see that she was \ntreated with fairness and respect. When individuals, and some \norganizations, said or did things that cheapened the process, I said \nso. When supporters and opponents of Judge Sotomayor made accusations \nof racism, I repudiated them because I believe all such accusations are \nincompatible with the respectful and dignified consideration of her \nnomination.\n  In the end, I was pleased that Judge Sotomayor said she could not \nhave received a more fair hearing and more fair treatment during the \nconfirmation process.\n  I believe a fair process and fair hearing means neither prejudging \nnor preconfirming a judicial nominee. Fair treatment means looking at \nthe judge's record, including her public statements about the role of a \njudge in our separated powers of government. Fair treatment means \ngiving the judge, the nominee, an opportunity to explain her record and \nher comments, and to put those in the appropriate context.\n  Going into the hearings, I found much to admire about Judge \nSotomayor's record. She is an experienced judge with an excellent \nacademic background. She appears to be a tough judge--which may be to \nher credit--and demands a lot of the lawyers who appear in oral \nargument before her court. For the most part, her decisions as a \ndistrict court judge and as a member of the court of appeals were \nwithin the mainstream of American jurisprudence.\n  Yet going into the hearings I also had some very serious questions \nthat I thought it was appropriate to ask her and that she needed to \nanswer. While, as I said, her judicial record is generally in the \nmainstream, several of her discussions demonstrated cause for concern \nabout the kind of liberal judicial activism that has steered the courts \nin the wrong direction over the past few years, and many of her public \nstatements reflected a surprisingly radical view of the law.\n  Some have said we just have to ignore her public statements and \nspeeches and just focus on her decisions as a lower court judge. I \ndisagree with that position. Judges on the lower courts; that is, the \ndistrict court and the court of appeals, have less room to maneuver \nthan a Supreme Court Justice who is not subject to any kind of \nappellate review. Supreme Court Justices can thus more easily ignore \nprecedents or reject them.\n  This is why Judge Sotomayor's speeches and writings on judicial \nphilosophy should matter, and they concern me a great deal. These \nspeeches and writings contain very radical ideas on the role of a \njudge. In her speeches she said things such as there is no objectivity, \nno neutrality in the law, just a matter of perspective. She said courts \ndo, in fact, make policy and seemed to say that was an appropriate role \nfor the courts of appeals. She even suggested that ethnicity and gender \ncan and should impact on a judge's decisionmaking process.\n  For 13 years of my life I served as a State court judge, a trial \njudge, and a member of the Texas Supreme Court. I strongly disagree \nwith the view of the law that says there is no impartiality, no \nobjectivity, no law, with a capital\n\n[[Page S8079]]\n\n``L,'' that a judge can interpret. It is, to the contrary of Judge \nSotomayor's statements, merely a matter of perspective. There is no \nimpartial rule of law.\n  I don't know how one can reconcile her statement that there is no \nobjectivity, no neutrality in the law, with the motto inscribed above \nthe U.S. Supreme Court building which says ``Equal Justice Under the \nLaw.'' If there is no such thing as objectivity and neutrality, only a \nmatter of perspective, how in the world can we ever hope to obtain that \nideal of equal justice under the law? I just don't know how one can \nreconcile those.\n  Despite my concerns about some of Judge Sotomayor's decisions, as \nwell as some of her statements about judging, I went into the hearing \nwith an open mind. I believed she deserved the opportunity to explain \nhow she approached some of the most controversial cases on which she \nhas ruled and to put her public statements in context. I hoped she \nwould use the hearings to clear up the confusion many of us had, trying \nto reconcile the Judge Sotomayor who served for 17 years on the bench \nwith the Judge Sotomayor who made some of these statements and \nspeeches. The hearings were an opportunity for Judge Sotomayor to clear \nup these things and ultimately, in my view, resulted in a missed \nopportunity to do so.\n  Regarding her public statements about judging, I was surprised to \nhear her say she meant exactly the opposite of what she said; that she \nhad been misunderstood every single time and that she doesn't believe \nany of these radical statements after all and that her views are \naligned with those of Chief Justice John Roberts.\n  Regarding some of her most controversial decisions, she refused to \nexplain them on the merits. She did not explain her legal reasoning or \nthe constitutional arguments she found persuasive, instead choosing to \nexplain those in terms of process and procedure whenever she could.\n  She assured us her decisions would be guided by precedent, even when \nmany of her colleagues, both on the court of appeals and the majority \nof the Supreme Court of the United States, disagreed. At the end of the \nhearing, I found myself still wondering who is the real Sonia Sotomayor \nand what kind of judge will she be when she is confirmed to the Supreme \nCourt.\n  Some have argued if I am uncertain, or if another Senator is \nuncertain about the answer to that question, that we should go ahead \nand vote to confirm Judge Sotomayor. I disagree with that. Voting to \nconfirm a judge, this judge, or any judge, despite doubts, would \ncertainly be a politically expedient thing to do, but I do not believe \nit would be the right thing to do, nor do I believe it would honor the \nduty we have under the Constitution, providing our advice and consent \non a judicial nominee.\n  We all know the future decisions of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates will have a tremendous impact on all Americans. The Court, for \nexample, could weaken the second amendment right of Americans to keep \nand bear arms, and Judge Sotomayor's decisions on that subject reflect, \nI believe, a restrictive view that is inconsistent with an individual \nright to keep and bear arms for all Americans.\n  The Court could fail to protect the fifth amendment private property \nrights of our people from cities and States that want to condemn their \nprivate property for nonpublic uses. Judge Sotomayor has rendered \ndecisions on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals that tend to support \nthe views that she has an opinion of the rights of the government to \ntake private property for private uses, not for public uses, and that \nconcerns me a great deal.\n  The Court could, in fact, invent new rights that appear nowhere in \nthe Constitution, as they have done in the past, based on foreign law, \na subject that Judge Sotomayor has spoken and written on, but she did \nnot settle any concerns many of us had about what role that would play \nin her decisionmaking process when she is confirmed.\n  I believe the stakes are simply too high for me to vote for a nominee \nwho can address all of these issues from a liberal activist \nperspective. And so I say it is with regret and some sadness that I \nwill vote against the confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. I will \nvote with a certain knowledge, however, that she will be confirmed \ndespite my vote.\n  I wish her well. I congratulate her on her historic achievement. I \nknow she will be an inspiration to many young people within the \nHispanic community and beyond. And I hope, I hope, she proves me wrong \nin my doubts.\n  The Justice she is replacing, after all, has proved to have a far \ndifferent impact than the President who nominated that judge believed \nthat judge would have. So perhaps Judge Sonia Sotomayor will surprise \nall of us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senate is in morning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/24/senate-section/article/S8079-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8079-S8084]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Presiding Officer. I am going to take a few \nminutes, if I can, to talk about health care again. I did on Wednesday \nevening, and I intended to speak yesterday, but there was an objection \nraised to having any morning business yesterday while we were \nconsidering the Defense authorization bill. So as a result of that, I \nwas unable to come to the floor and talk about the health care issues \nin our country and the pending legislation in this body and in the \nother body.\n  As some may know--I know my colleagues are aware of this--I have been \nin the position of being the acting chairman of the Senate HELP \nCommittee. The committee is chaired by our dear friend and colleague \nSenator Ted Kennedy, who is wrestling with his own health care crisis \nat this very hour and so has been unable to be with us these last \nseveral months as we have begun the process of marking up, that is, \nconsidering the legislation dealing with health care. So as the person \nsitting next to him on that committee, I was asked to assume the \nresponsibility of chairing the committee as we considered the health \ncare legislation.\n  We have finished our work. We finished it a week ago on Wednesday \nafter numerous hours. I point this out to our colleagues--I know many \nof them may be aware of this already--we on the HELP Committee spent \nclose to 60 hours in consideration of our bill. I am told it was the \nlongest time that--at least in memory of all here--the committee has \nspent on the consideration of any single bill.\n  We had some 23 sessions over 13 days. There were around 800 \namendments filed before our committee. We considered just shy of 300 of \nthem. Of that 300, we accepted 161 amendments from our Republican \nfriends on the committee.\n  Many of these amendments were technical amendments. But they were not \nall technical amendments. They were worthwhile and positive amendments, \nand there were a number of very important amendments that were offered \nby our Republican colleagues that I think strengthened and made the \nbill a better bill, substantially a bipartisan bill.\n  At the end of the day, after all of these hours and work, we did not \nhave the votes of our Republican friends on the committee. But their \ncontribution to the product was significant. As I mentioned earlier, \nSenator Gregg and a number of our Republican colleagues on the \ncommittee were concerned about the long-term fiscal impact of the new \nvoluntary insurance program for long-term care. We agreed with that \namendment. It was a tremendous help.\n  Senator Isakson of Georgia raised the issue of end-of-life care, \ndrawing on his own family experiences. We were able to accommodate his \nideas in that area.\n  Senators Enzi, Gregg, and Alexander suggested that we increase \nemployers' flexibility to offer workplace wellness programs with \nincentives for employees. That was a very sound proposal, one that has \nbeen recommended to us by others. It was added to the bill. Senator \nHarkin did a very good job, along with others, in reaching that \naccommodation.\n  Senator Hatch's amendment was dealing with follow-on biologics. The \nfull Hatch proposal was adopted by the committee.\n  Our friend Tom Coburn from Oklahoma proposed an amendment to empower \nindividuals to make healthy decisions by having the CDC establish a\n\n[[Page S8080]]\n\nWeb-based prevention tool that would create personalized prevention \nplans for individuals. That was accepted as well.\n  We accepted Senator Hatch's proposal to establish a coordinated \nenvironmental health tracking network at the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention.\n  Senator Murkowski offered an amendment which allows insurers to rate \nbased on tobacco use. Specifically, Senator Murkowski's amendment \nallows insurers to vary premiums from one to one and a half for the use \nof tobacco.\n  Several amendments were offered by Senator Burr, and accepted by \nunanimous consent, to ensure that the community health insurance option \nis operated on a level playing field with all of the other private \ninsurers, and provided a clarification that Federal and State laws \nrelating to rating preexisting conditions, fraud and abuse, quality \nimprovements, and many other provisions apply to the community health \ninsurance option as well.\n  Senator Hatch and Senator Coburn offered amendments that will now \nensure that independent insurance agents and brokers will be eligible \nto be navigators in the gateway.\n  My point is that in addition to the technical amendments, there were \nsubstantive amendments that were adopted as part of the committee \neffort. I invite our colleagues' attention. We have offered to brief \nany single member or others who are interested. This bill has now been \non the Web site for the public to read there, to add comments and \nideas, or to pose questions regarding provisions of the bill.\n  While we are waiting to see what the outcome in the Finance Committee \nwill be, the second half of the equation, it is worthwhile to note that \nin the Senate, there are two committees with jurisdiction over health \ncare. The HELP Committee has completed its committee work, and we \ninvite our colleagues' attention and ideas and thoughts on how we might \nimprove or add to the provisions dealing with quality and prevention, \ndealing with workforce issues, dealing with the fraud and abuse issues \nthat are critically important, as well as coverage questions which are \nalso essential.\n  Obviously I had hoped that we might stay here in August to deal with \nthis issue or continue the process, but the decision has been made to \ndelay consideration of the health care issues until the fall. I \nunderstood how this works, and things have not moved as quickly as we \nall would have liked.\n  Some say we need to slow down a little bit, we are going too fast on \nthis issue. I remind my colleagues that it has been 70 years, 7 \ndecades, with many administrations serving our country in that time, as \nwell as many Congresses that have convened to grappled with this issue.\n  While we have dealt with various aspects of health care, from \nchildren's health and Medicare and Medicaid in that time, every single \nCongress, every single administration, has failed in reaching the kind \nof consensus necessary to adopt national health care reform measures.\n\n  We have been challenged by the American people now to try and defy \nthose odds, to do what no other Congress and no other administration \nhas ever been able to achieve. I understand we are going at it a little \ntoo fast in the minds of some, but for those out there beyond the halls \nof Congress, that issue of how fast we are going may seem rather \nperplexing.\n  I am stating the obvious here. I know my colleagues know this, and I \npresume many of our fellow citizens do. Every single one of us who is \nserving in this Chamber, every single Congressman who serves down the \nhall, every single employee you see here, has very good, comprehensive \nhealth insurance coverage. We are blessed, as a part of the Federal \nemployees benefit health package. We never have to worry, Lord forbid, \nsomething happens to one of us tonight, or tomorrow, to our children, \nor our spouses. We are well covered with insurance. And so taking a \nbreak in August and sort of rolling along poses no real threat to any \nof us or the Federal employees who have this health care program.\n  But for millions of other Americans who do not have the privilege of \nhaving the kind of coverage we do, this is an unsettling time, a very \nunsettling time. In this country of ours, millions of our fellow \ncitizens do not get to sleep with that same sense of security and \nassurance. If something happens to their family, Lord forbid, they know \nthey are going to wake up with the inability to either take care of the \nhealth care problem or maybe at the same time go through a financial \ncrisis that destroys their economic future.\n  I have said this many times, and it is worth repeating. Of all of the \nbankruptcies that occur in the United States, 62 percent of them occur \nbecause of a health care crisis in that family; 62 percent. Of the 62 \npercent that go into bankruptcy because of a health care crisis, 75 \npercent of those people have a health insurance program. They are not \nuninsured. These are people with health insurance.\n  So if you are out there today and saying: Well, I have got health \ninsurance, I could not possibly end up in financial ruin, the fact is \nthat the overwhelming majority of people who have gone into bankruptcy \nbecause of a health care crisis have been covered with insurance.\n  Fifty percent of all foreclosures are occurring as a result of a \nhealth care crisis in a family. Today, before the sun sets in the \nUnited States of America, 14,000 of our fellow citizens will lose their \nhealth care coverage. Fourteen thousand people today and every single \nday in America, that many people will lose their health care coverage.\n  So while we sit here and say: Look, we are going too fast on this \nsubject. Slow down. Boy, slow down. That is easy for us to say because \nnone of us ever has to worry about what most Americans have to worry \nabout, and that is, God forbid, they end up with a health care crisis \nand end up being destroyed economically or sitting with the anger and \nfrustration of knowing that I cannot provide for my child, I cannot \nprovide for my spouse, and they need the kind of medical care they \ndeserve.\n  This is the United States of America. We rank 37th in the world in \nmedical outcomes, and we spend more money than any other nation, way \nbeyond, way more than any other country in the world on health care. So \nwe pay the most and we rank like a Third World country when it comes to \noutcomes. I do not think most Americans like to think of our country as \nbeing incapable of taking care of our Nation in such a way.\n  It has occurred to me that some people in this town seem to think \nthis process of health care is about them: Did I get appropriately \nconsulted? Did I get invited to enough meetings? Did I get a headline? \nWhat do my consultants think I should say about all of this? What are \nthe right words to use here? Let's hire people to tell us how to \ndescribe all of this.\n  Well, let me ask all of my colleagues: Is anybody here worried that \nthey are going to lose their health care insurance over the August \nbreak? Is anybody here unable to afford the care they think they may \nneed for themselves or their family? Has any Member of this body or the \nother body been staying up late at night recently with a sick child for \nwhom they cannot afford to get treatment?\n  Has anyone I serve with here spent the last 3 hours bouncing from \nvoicemail to voicemail as you try to find out why the insurance company \nyou pay thousands of dollars to every month suddenly refuses to pay for \nyour spouse's cancer treatments?\n  Is any Member of Congress, as they go through the August break back \nin their States and districts or on vacation someplace, stuck at a job \nthat pays too little because they have a preexisting condition and will \nnot be able to get coverage anywhere else they may get hired?\n  Has anybody here been driven into bankruptcy or lost a home, as \n10,000 people will today? Their homes will get a notice of foreclosure \nbecause of medical bills their insurance company would not cover.\n  Has anyone in this Chamber or anyone in the other Chamber, a small \nbusiness owner, had to choose between cutting coverage or laying off \nyour employees whom you care about, who have been loyal to you and \nhelped you build your products every day? Has anyone had to talk about \nlaying them off or not providing the health care coverage that you \nhave? I suspect no.\n\n  Then why are so many in Washington acting as if this were about us, \nabout\n\n[[Page S8081]]\n\nwhether you are a Blue Dog or a Red Dog, a Democrat, a Republican, a \nconservative, a moderate, a liberal, as if that was the most important \nissue, rather than the people who sent us here to grapple with an issue \nthey wrestle with every single hour of every day. We are in danger of \nlosing this once again, of failing, as has every other Congress and \nevery other administration for 70 years, because we are forgetting that \nthis is about the people who sent us here, asking us to try and come up \nwith answers that would relieve them of the fear and frustration that \nconfronts them every day and grows as a result of our inability or \nunwillingness to come up with national health care reform.\n  We in this Chamber have good insurance and we're in no danger of \nlosing it. The same is not true for the American people. That is why it \nisn't about us. It is about the 47 million people who are uninsured, \nthe 87 million who are underinsured, the 14,000 a day who lose their \ninsurance, and the millions who will lose it if we don't act. It is \nabout the people who pay our salaries and our great health insurance as \nwell, the people who sent us here to fight on their behalf. When we \npretend this is about us, when we treat health care reform as if it is \nsome kind of a game, a political contest--who is going to face their \nWaterloo, who is going to lose, who can go in for the kill and defeat \nsomeone, put them into trouble, maybe they will lose an election over \nthis--as it appears in the minds of some, then is it any wonder why the \nAmerican people get so angry and frustrated when they watch us talk \nabout ourselves, as if we were the only people on the face of the \nplanet?\n  If any of us had to go through some of the things I suspect every one \nof us has heard from constituents--and there is nothing unique about \nwhat I am about to say; you can go to almost any State at almost any \nhour and repeat some of the stories I will share this morning, as I \nhave heard in Connecticut--there wouldn't be anybody calling for more \ndelays if they listened carefully. Sometimes we get involved in \nnumbers, as we mention 14,000 and 87 million and 47 million. It sort of \nglazes over the eyes in a way. Is there anybody involved in these \nnumbers? Are any stories involved? This legislation would be done by \nnow if we paid more attention to some of these individual stories.\n  In 2005, a young woman in Connecticut named Maria was diagnosed with \nnon-Hodgkin's lymphoma. When she asked her insurance company to cover \nher treatments, the insurance company found out Maria had once gone to \na doctor for what she thought was a pinched nerve. Even though no tests \nhad been done for cancer, the insurance company decided the doctor \nvisit meant Maria's condition was a preexisting condition and denied \nher claim. Maria died from that illness.\n  A young man in Connecticut named Frank disclosed on his insurance \napplication that he sometimes got headaches. Several months after he \ngot his policy, he went in for a routine eye exam. His eye doctor saw \nsomething he didn't like and sent Frank to a neurologist who told Frank \nhe had multiple sclerosis. Frank's insurance company decided Frank \nshould have known his occasional headaches were a sign of multiple \nsclerosis, and they took away his coverage retroactively. Frank's \ndoctor wrote them a letter saying there was no way anyone could have \npossibly suspected that an ordinary headache was related to multiple \nsclerosis. But the insurance company left Frank out to dry. He was \nstuck with a $30,000 medical bill he simply couldn't afford. His \ncondition got worse. He left his job and went on public assistance.\n  This is Kevin Galvin. I have held a series of townhall meetings in my \nState, four or five of them over the last number of months, to invite \npeople to share their concerns and stories about health care. The first \none I held, to give Members an idea, I held outside Hartford at 8:30 in \nthe morning, on a Friday morning. My first reaction to my staff was: \nWhy are we having a townhall meeting at 8:30 in the morning? No one \ncould possibly be there. Mr. President, 750 people showed up at that \nsmall community college on the banks of the Connecticut River in \nHartford to be heard and to listen and talk about what was going on in \ntheir lives.\n  Kevin has shown up at a lot of my townhall meetings to talk about \nthis issue. I met him at a number of gatherings we have held around the \nState to listen to people's concerns.\n  Kevin owns a small business, a maintenance company. He employs seven \npeople in that little firm--some older, some younger--and can't afford \nto insure them. His younger employees use emergency rooms in their home \ncommunities as their regular doctor. If one of them has a child with an \near infection, they will spend all day, as Kevin has told me, in the ER \nwaiting for them to get basic treatment, costing the employee a day's \npay and Kevin a day's work from that employee.\n  By the way, to remind people who say we can't afford any additional \ncosts, think of this: If you have an insurance policy, on average, your \nfamily is paying $1,100 a year on your insurance policy to cover people \nsuch as Kevin's employees, the uninsured. That is the average cost per \nfamily. That is a tax on every insurance policy to pick up the cost of \nKevin's employee, the one who shows up in that emergency room. You \ndon't get free medical care there. They are charging for it. How do \nthey charge? The premium costs go up for everyone else, on average, \n$1,100 per family.\n  Kevin has three employees in their twenties and thirties who have \nnever had a physical, never had a dental cleaning by a hygienist. One \nof them, age 28 with two children, was out of work for 12 weeks and \nnearly died from a staph infection he got from an untreated cavity. \nKevin stepped in, paid that man's salary during those weeks, and also \nall of his medical bills. That is the kind of person this individual \nis. Even though he doesn't have the kind of business that allows him to \npick up the insurance tab for all his employees, Kevin stepped in to \nmake a difference in that family. I know many do that. He is not alone \nin that regard. But it is awfully difficult to make a business work \nwhen you have to turn around and pick up the wages for someone who is \nnot there at work, not to mention the medical bills and expenses.\n  Another one of Kevin's employees recently left for a job with health \ninsurance, even though the new job gives him far fewer hours and pays \none-third less than he got from Kevin. Another employee has been with \nKevin's company for 24 years, relying on his wife's job for their \nhealth insurance. She got laid off recently. They will be able to get \nCOBRA insurance for a short period, but Kevin's employee has a \npreexisting condition and his wife is a breast cancer survivor. You \ntell me whether you think they will get health care coverage, under the \npresent circumstances, with one of them having a preexisting condition \nand the other being a breast cancer survivor. You don't need to be a \nPh.D. in health care issues to know what is going to happen. Under the \npresent circumstances, if we do nothing around here, that guy and his \nwife get nothing. They will be looking for any kind of help they can \nget.\n  They, similar to millions of our fellow citizens, are looking to us, \nthose of us gathered here. I don't know what Kevin's politics are. I \ndon't know whether he is a Democrat or a Republican, a liberal, \nconservative, moderate, a Blue Dog. I don't think he thinks that way. I \nthink all he thinks about is trying to take care of his employees and \nhis family. I don't think Maria's family--Maria, with non-Hodgkin's \nlymphoma--wondered what politics they were. I don't think any American \ndoes. All they know is, once again, we are sitting around here deciding \nwe will drift off for a few more weeks or months because we can't seem \nto come together, or we are going to sit there and attack each other \npolitically, as this problem grows by the hour. We don't have to worry \nabout that. I say that respectfully, but nonetheless, it does impact \nthe decisionmaking process.\n  When you don't have an ounce of concern about your insurance and your \nability to take care of yourself and your family, you lose some of the \nmotivation, it seems to me, that we ought to have, when it comes to \naddressing these issues.\n  I will be talking about this every day we are in session and every \nday until we get to the point of coming together and addressing this \nissue. It is what I tried to do for nearly 60 hours, replacing my dear \nfriend, Senator Kennedy, on the committee. I thank my 22 other\n\n[[Page S8082]]\n\ncolleagues who stayed there day after day to work on this. I \nparticularly thank Tom Harkin of Iowa, who spent hours working on the \nprevention side of this bill, doing everything he could to come up with \nideas to encourage behaviors that would reduce cost and improve the \nquality of health; Barbara Mikulski, who is going through her own \nmedical issues, having broken her ankle in four different places and \nundergoing treatment, she did a magnificent job working on quality \nissues; Jeff Bingaman from New Mexico, who did the work on coverage \nissues and the important issue of how we pay for this to come up with \nideas that will reduce cost and make health coverage more affordable. \nThen, of course, there was Patty Murray, who did a great job working on \nworkforce issues. I see Jack Reed of Rhode Island, who is a member of \nour committee and did a great job on a number of issues affecting the \nbill. On down the line: Kay Hagan; Jeff Merkley; Sheldon Whitehouse was \ntremendously helpful; Bernie Sanders did a great job; Bob Casey; \nSherrod Brown of Ohio was terrific as well.\n  I thank my Republican colleagues--even though they didn't vote for \nthe bill in the end, I have mentioned the ideas they brought to our \nbill that made it a better bill: Mike Enzi, Judd Gregg, Lamar \nAlexander, John McCain, Lisa Murkowski, Pat Roberts, Orrin Hatch, Tom \nCoburn, Johnny Isakson, Richard Burr. The idea is, we came together and \nit worked. We have a product now. We look forward to working with the \nFinance Committee. But we need to get on to the business of getting \nthis done. We cannot sustain the present situation, and the American \npeople deserve a lot better. They need the same kind of security we \nhave provided for ourselves as Members of Congress. I don't think the \nAmerican people are going to accept the notion that they should have to \nlive with the fear and frustration that is associated with having the \nkind of health care system presently in our Nation, knowing we can do \nbetter.\n  I thank my colleagues for the work we have done already and urge \nthem, over this break, if they are not here working, to listen to their \nconstituents, hear their voices, and then come back to this Chamber in \nearly September with a serious determination to do what no other \nCongress and no other administration has been able to achieve in nearly \na century: to come up with a health care plan for the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 30 \nminutes in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking and commending \nSenator Dodd, who was at the helm of the deliberations on health care \nreform in the HELP Committee. His patience, his understanding, and his \ndetermination were probably the three critical factors that got this \nbill through the committee and to the floor. He has made a singular \ncontribution to the progress of this debate on health care, which he \neloquently described as so central to every family in this country. I \nknow he is performing these duties with the notion that the real \nchampion of health care, Senator Ted Kennedy, is in the wings urging \nhim on and helping him and guiding him. But Senator Kennedy's presence \nwas palpable. I think our efforts today and in the days ahead will \nculminate, I hope, as does Senator Dodd, in legislation that can be \nsigned by the President, with Senator Kennedy there and Senator Dodd. I \ncan't think of two people who would deserve such a place of honor.\n  We hear often from the opponents of health insurance reform that the \nvast majority of Americans have health insurance and are happy with it. \nThat is true. But it is only one side of the coin. Americans are glad \nthey have insurance, but they are worried they might lose it because \nthe cost keeps going up. All Americans worry when they see friends and \nfamily members who don't have insurance or who lose their health \ninsurance. They worry when they are faced with completing piles of \npaperwork having to do with their health insurance policy. And they \nworry when they get the runaround from their insurance carriers about \nwhat is and is not covered. They certainly are not particularly happy \nwhen they are either denied coverage or denied reimbursement of a claim \nbecause of a preexisting condition. It is clear that we must improve \nhealth care for the Nation.\n  The opponents of health care reform are talking about a government \ntakeover and bureaucrats, but those are merely scare tactics. The \nreality today is there are Americans who are uninsured, who show up in \nhospital emergency rooms with out coverage that wind up in higher \npremiums for all of us. There are Americans who are being denied \ninsurance, even though they can pay the premium, because of a \npreexisting condition. All of that has to be addressed.\n  Today we face a choice between a broken status quo or a better and \nless-expensive health care system; between being denied health \ninsurance or a marketplace where competition and choices are \nvibrant; between a health insurance system that will double in cost or \none that will actually control costs; between a health care system that \nleads to thousands of families losing their insurance every day or a \nsystem that covers more of our relatives and neighbors; between a \nhealth insurance system that will keep adding to the deficit or a \nsystem that helps reduce government costs over the long run.\n\n  That is the choice facing the Senate and the American people. The \nstark reality is that our health care system is broken. The status quo \nis untenable. In the face of this, the HELP Committee and the President \nmade the right choice to fix it.\n  In contrast, the Republicans have chosen to simply protect the \nexisting health care system--the one that is denying care to millions \nof Americans, the one that cannot be sustained financially by families \nor by government. They would rather talk about Waterloo and a host of \nother hobgoblins than do the hard work of health reform that we must \ndo. We can succumb to fear or we can roll up our sleeves and pass \nhealth care reform. I believe that we cannot wait any longer.\n  In fact, that is what is ongoing at this moment. Senator Baucus is \nreaching out, as Senator Dodd reached out, to develop a plan that will \nnot only pass this Congress but also benefit the American people in the \nlong run.\n  There are many specific elements in the HELP Committee bill and the \nbill Chairman Baucus will bring from the Finance Committee. But there \nare five key principles by which we are guided.\n  One, we will pay for the cost of reforming the health insurance \nsystem.\n  Two, we will start controlling costs today and in the future.\n  Three, we will preserve and expand insurance choices for the American \npeople.\n  Four, we will cover as many Americans as we can through commonsense \nsteps that increase health security and stability for families.\n  And, five, we will reward efficiency and quality care.\n  Everything we do in health care reform should be guided by these \nprinciples because they are the right principles and they are what the \nAmerican people expect.\n  Now, let me take a moment to talk more about our health care system \nand how we got here. At the turn of the 20th century, significant \ntechnological and medical advances yielded superior treatments, more \neffective training of physicians, and higher quality care.\n  More Americans demanded access to these new and improved services. \nBut for many the cost was too expensive. The problem intensified during \nthe Great Depression and doctors, because of the financial crisis, were \nill-equipped and unprepared to help many who needed help. We have made \nprogress since then.\n  In the 1960s, this Congress--a predecessor Congress--adopted the \nMedicare Program and the Medicaid Program. We have also seen \ninvestments in the construction of hospitals under Federal legislation. \nWe have seen a system grow up somewhat unwittingly through the tax \nsystem to subsidize employer-based health care. All this has led to the \npresent situation.\n  But, even today, the parallels between our current health care system \nand that of the system at the turn of the Century are frighteningly \nsimilar. The cost of care is still too expensive\n\n[[Page S8083]]\n\nand doctors are still ill-equipped to treat every patient that walks \nthrough their door.\n  Throughout those years, Presidents and Congresses have recognized the \nneed for comprehensive reform, to make health care affordable and \naccessible for all Americans and affordable for the Nation as a whole. \nHarry Truman, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton all endeavored to change the \nhealth care system. We are still at that great task, and this is a \ndaunting task, but this time we must succeed.\n  In the face of this task, some have said it is too hard, it cannot be \ndone. Instead, incremental reform would better serve the country. In \n2003, under President Bush's urging, the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit, Medicare Part D was passed. That was done without paying for \nit. It was done with deficit spending. And it was done supposedly with \na $400 billion pricetag over 10 years that later turned into $1.2 \ntrillion over 10 years. That was an initiative supported by President \nBush and the Republicans.\n  So we are in a situation now that is different. We have presented a \nbill that costs half as much, has gone down in price, and that will be \npaid for. We are determined to pay for it. We are determined to make it \ncontain costs over the long run because the current costs are \nskyrocketing out of control.\n  We have also seen the need, because of the current economic crisis, \nto accelerate our reform efforts. In my State of Rhode Island, 12.4 \npercent of the population is unemployed. That is adding to the rolls of \nthose who are uninsured. They are losing their coverage if they are \nbeing dismissed from their work or their employer is scrapping coverage \njust to save the company and keep some people employed.\n  We have seen the premiums for those who still have access to coverage \nincrease dramatically. In Rhode Island, family premiums have increased \n97 percent since 2000. Over 20 percent of middle-income Rhode Island \nfamilies spend more than 10 percent of their income on health care. We \nknow these numbers are going to get worse, not better, if we do \nnothing. They are going to get to the point where families cannot \nafford it, where State governments cannot afford it, where the Federal \nGovernment cannot afford it. We have to recognize that, that sitting \nback, doing nothing, proposing the old remedies will do nothing for the \nAmerican people.\n  My Republican colleagues believe that giving everyone a tax credit, \n$5,000, will get everyone in America covered. But that is less than the \ncost of an insurance policy. Moreover, they are not proposing to reform \nthe insurance system. If we do not do this, we will continue down the \npath toward a social and economic crisis.\n  So we have acted. And we must continue to act. President Obama is \ndetermined to make this effort succeed. I recall the debate in 1993 and \n1994 and we are much further ahead than we were in 1993 and 1994. We \nall talked about health care reform in 1993--a major issue in the \nelection--but by the time we got down to passing legislation, it was \nthe summer of 1994 and we ran out of time. We cannot run out of time \nnow. The President is right to insist we keep moving as fast as we can \nuntil we reach the objective.\n  The President said it very well Wednesday evening:\n\n       If somebody told you that there is a plan out there that is \n     guaranteed to double your health-care costs over the next 10 \n     years, that's guaranteed to result in more Americans losing \n     their health care, and that is by far the biggest contributor \n     to our federal deficit, I think most people would be opposed \n     to that. That's what we have right now. If we don't change, \n     we can't expect a different result.\n\n  ``If we don't change, we can't expect a different result.''\n  So we must move forward with health care reform and we must do it \ndeliberately and we must do it in a timely way. As one who sat on the \nHELP Committee under the leadership of Chairman Kennedy and Acting \nChairman Dodd, we took great effort to work through these issues. We \nspent hours and hours consulting with every single stakeholder: \npatients, providers, doctors, nurses, hospitals, employers, small \nbusiness owners, large business owners, Governors, economists, and our \nRepublican colleagues. We had 13 committee hearings. We had 14 \nbipartisan roundtable discussions. And we spent hours--20 hours--with \nour Republican colleagues in an informal walk-through of the bill, \ngetting their impressions and feedback. We entertained hundreds of \namendments--160 amendments to be exact. Major contributions were made, \nas Senator Dodd indicated, by our Republican colleagues, along with my \nDemocratic colleagues. Then the committee passed this legislation.\n  This work must continue with that same intensity. I know Senator \nBaucus in the Finance Committee is doing that. I hope we return in \nSeptember fully engaged and ready to move on this issue.\n  I wish to make a few points about the legislation that is emerging \nfrom both the HELP Committee and I anticipate from the Finance \nCommittee. First of all, we have included in our bill items--and the \nFinance Committee will do the same--that will ensure that this is fully \npaid for, unlike the Medicare Part D plan enacted by the Bush \nadministration.\n  CBO has informed us, in their hearing before the Budget Committee, \nthat they are not convinced we are going to be able to dramatically \nreduce costs going forward. Now, we are all bound by them. This is the \nyardstick we use. But I wish to make a point about the CBO projections. \nBy their rules, CBO cannot consider some things that we feel will be \ninstrumental in not only improving the health of Americans but bringing \ndown the costs. They cannot and will not predict the effect of a \nhealthier and livelier America.\n\n  The Trust for America's Health, for example, found that investing $10 \nper person per year in proven community-based programs to increase \nphysical activity, improve nutrition, and prevent smoking and other \ntobacco use, would save the Nation at least $16 billion annually within \n5 years. Out of this $16 billion in savings, it is estimated Medicare \ncould save more than $5 billion, Medicaid could save more than $1.9 \nbillion, and private insurance companies could save more than $9 \nbillion.\n  Those savings are not factored into the CBO's projections for several \nreasons: One, they are hard to predict, and they do not want to take \nthat risk; but, second, they will only record savings that accrue \ndirectly back to the Federal Government. The millions that are being \nsaved by private insurance companies through prevention--that is a \nsavings they will enjoy, the country will enjoy, the families will \nenjoy, but it will not be scored by CBO.\n  We have also taken some significant steps to ensure that we crack \ndown on fraud and abuse in the public and the private insurance \nsectors. The National Health Care Anti-Fraud Association estimates that \n3 percent of all health spending each year--more than $70 billion--is \nlost to fraud perpetrated against public and private health plans. \nFederal antifraud efforts in the Medicare Program have been \ndemonstrated to return $17 for every $1 invested in these activities, \nand we have expanded these activities in this legislation.\n  We also expect cost savings through the use of health information \ntechnology. In the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, we provided \n$19.2 billion to hospitals, doctors, and clinics for this purpose. \nAccording to the RAND Corporation, we could save up to $77 billion each \nyear in medical costs through health information technology. Once \nagain, this type of savings is not included in the CBO calculations.\n  But in addition to the savings we anticipate, we are still going to \npay for the cost that the CBO has calculated. The Finance Committee is \ncommitted to do that. And it should be noted, significantly, that \nPresident Obama has already received commitments from health care \nindustries to share in the cost of payment and contribute to this plan. \nThe American Hospital Association has pledged $155 billion in \nanticipated cost reductions. The drug companies have promised $80 \nbillion. These groups, along with insurance companies and doctors, have \nalso pledged to slow the rise in health care costs over the next 10 \nyears by 1.5 percent. This is much different than in 1993 and 1994. \nThese concessions will not cover the whole cost, but that is where the \nFinance Committee will augment with their proposals.\n  The President has engaged not only the Congress but also the major \nstakeholders in the health care system. Indeed, one of the things I \nfind remarkable is that some people are running\n\n[[Page S8084]]\n\naround talking about that this is a nationalization of health care, it \nis a socialization of health care, it is going to be government \nbureaucrats. Well, if that is the case, why is the private insurance \nindustry not only cooperating but pledging to participate in cost \nreductions? They must feel their security and safety financially and \neconomically are not being jeopardized.\n  So we are going to pay for this. We are also going to expand coverage \nin a way where not only you can get it, but you can keep the coverage. \nThe same thing goes with respect to keeping your doctor.\n  One of the guiding principles the President announced initially was: \nIf you like your health care, you can keep it. We have stayed true to \nthat principle in terms of the construct that has emerged from the HELP \nCommittee.\n  We have also tried to provide assistance to those people who need \nhealth insurance that is affordable. They will have the choice of a \nhealth plan that meets their needs and their budget. Again, many of the \nproposals my colleagues on the other side have made throughout the \nyears, including tax credits are not sufficient to pay the premiums, \nand as such are ineffectual. We are going to make sure you not only \nhave insurance but that you can afford that insurance.\n  So we have listened to a whole range of proposals. We have listened \nto those who are proponents of the single-payer system. We have \nlistened to those who stress a strong community option. I think we have \nclearly staked our reform on a more competitive market that will have a \npublic option to spur competition but will not in any way displace the \nprimacy of private health care insurance.\n  We are moving forward with this legislation. We have created a system \nwhere citizens can come and select the choice of private insurance or a \ncommunity option, a publicly-organized option. We have also insisted \nupon insurance reform so that preexisting conditions, limits on policy \npayments--all of those things would be a thing of the past.\n  We believe this legislation will provide greater stability for \nAmericans, not only financially but for peace of mind, the notion that \nwhen I go to the doctor, I won't have to worry, will the insurance \ncompany accept this claim; when I go to the doctor and I make the \nclaim, will I then be told that what happened to me 20 years ago was a \npreexisting condition and my visit will not be covered; the peace of \nmind that if I have employer-based health care and I lose it, then I \nwill be able to access a plan for me and my family. I think these are \nimportant aspects of this legislation, as important as some of the \nfinancial aspects.\n  We also want to make sure we increase the efficiency, the efficacy of \nthe health care system. We have adopted quality measures. We have \nlearned from experience that we can make changes--some of them are very \nsimple--that will increase the efficiency and the effectiveness of \nhealth care. One simple approach is a checklist of safety measures in \nICU that has been adopted in my State of Rhode Island. Studies have \nfound that the checklist cuts infection rates 66 percent within 3 \nmonths and within 18 months of implementation saved about $75 million \nand 1,500 lives. Those types of innovations, those types of reforms are \ndesigned now to be dispersed throughout the system.\n  We also have to prevent readmission to hospitals, and we have adopted \nlegislation in the bill that will help do that by clearly planning for \nthe discharge of a patient. We are building up the workforce which is \nnecessary. We have emphasized significantly the issue of wellness and \nprevention. Our bill will provide coverage for all recommended \npreventive services, remove barriers to access, such as copayment and \ndeductibles for preventive services, and encourage employers to offer \nwellness programs.\n  As has been said before, we want to transform the system not only \norganizationally and financially, but we want to transform it from a \nsystem that treats sickness to one that promotes wellness. This \nlegislation will go a long way to do that. And in doing that, it will \naffect the cost for all of us.\n  I think we also have to recognize that everyone has to be a part of \nthis effort. If we were to require insurers to take everyone but not \nrequire everyone to purchase insurance, we would have the classic \nproblem where the healthy would not buy insurance, the sickest who need \ninsurance would buy it, and the system wouldn't work. It would be too \ncostly for those who need coverage and those who don't have coverage \nwould get sick, and drive the costs up higher and higher. So our \nlegislation requires the responsibility of every American to \nparticipate. We will help those who are of modest income to meet this \nobligation.\n  We also are still working through many significant issues. I think \nthe time we now have will be used wisely. There are many different \naspects of this legislation that we recognize can be improved, and we \nhope they will be by the Finance Committee deliberations and by our \nfloor deliberations.\n  My colleagues are proposing ideas. For example, Senator Rockefeller \nhas suggested that we use the procedure for the Medicare Payment \nAdvisory Commission--these are experts on health care--to provide not \nsimply recommendations but binding policies subject to a vote by \nCongress on the types of treatments that would be offered, the medical \nissues that have to be addressed. I think this would give us an \ninteresting way to deal with the issue of effectiveness of treatment as \nwell as cost of treatment, and I think this is something we must \nconsider as we go forward, again, dealing with this issue of cost which \nis so central.\n  I raised this issue with Chairman Bernanke, the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve. He, in his rather professorial way, certainly \nrecognized the need for reform, but he also stressed that reform from \nan economic standpoint has to have cost containment, cost controls, and \nI think this idea Senator Rockefeller has proposed is something that \nhas to be seriously looked at.\n  We have reached a point now that we need reform. We can't afford to \nwait. This is the second time in my relatively brief career in the \nCongress that we have faced the issue of national health care reform. \nIn 1993 and 1994, we faltered. It has gotten worse since then, not \nbetter, and it will get much worse if we don't succeed this time.\n  So I would encourage all of my colleagues to work together. What I \nsense is that Americans want, need, and deserve access to \ncomprehensive, affordable, quality, efficient health care. That is what \nmy constituents are asking for.\n  We have a plan for overall reform as well as to bring down spending. \nThe current path is unsustainable. Those who advocate a less costly, \nbetter health insurance system have an obligation to offer something \nmore than a tax credit proposal here or there or give all of the \nresponsibility to the private sector. We need a real plan. A plan that \nwill give all Americans the security and stability that they need in \ntheir health insurance plan. We cannot afford another missed \nopportunity. I urge all of my colleagues to come together on this most \nvital of issues and pass health care reform this year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman).

Mr. President, I come to speak today because I have \ntremendous concerns about the potential effects of the Waxman-Markey \nclimate change bill, concerns about the destruction of jobs and \nconcerns about the cost to our economy.\n  The Waxman-Markey bill may create some green jobs. If it does, great. \nWe need green jobs in my State. We need green jobs all across the \ncountry. In\n\n[[Page S8085]]\n\nWyoming, we are developing our wind resources, so we need the green \njobs, and Wyoming has world class winds. But to me, this bill also \ncosts jobs. And Americans want all jobs, not just some jobs. People \ndon't want to lose the jobs they have with a promise that they may get \na green job in exchange someday down the line. Americans want all the \njobs. They want to keep the ones they have, and they want to create \nmore jobs, more opportunities. To me, the Waxman-Markey bill fails to \ndo that.\n  The administration says that the Waxman-Markey bill will create \nmillions--millions--of new jobs. This administration also promised that \nafter Congress passed the so-called ``economic stimulus package'' they \nwould create or save 3\\1/2\\ million jobs. Since the bill's passage and \nbeing signed into law, unemployment has reached 9.5 percent in this \nNation. Last month, almost half a million people lost their jobs.\n  The administration's economic experts said that unemployment would \nnot exceed 8 percent if the stimulus package passed. It passed, and was \nsigned into law, but they were wrong. And not just by a little.\n  In an interview with George Stephanopoulos, Vice President Biden \nacknowledged that administration officials were too optimistic when \nthey predicted that unemployment rates would peak at 8 percent. The \nVice President said that ``the administration and I misread the \neconomy.''\n  Well, is it possible, then, that the administration is misreading the \neconomic predictions of millions of new jobs being created in this \nbill? The administration failed to make the grade on the $787 billion \nstimulus package, and I believe the administration is failing again by \nsupporting this misguided climate change bill.\n  It is a fact that the climate change legislation will cost jobs in \nthe American economy. That is why there is language in the bill to \nretrain workers who lose their jobs. Why will this legislation cost \njobs? The Waxman-Markey climate change bill is designed to make fossil \nfuel more expensive. Advocates say we must make fossil fuel more \nexpensive to change the behavior of businesses and of consumers. That \nmeans making everything that is powered by fossil fuel more expensive. \nFossil fuel powers your car, your home, your office; it powers the \nairplanes we fly in, the trains we ride in, trucks; things that we use \nfor our own transportation but also things where we ship goods from \nfarms and small businesses to the marketplace all across this country \nand even abroad.\n  All these things will be made more expensive because of the climate \nchange bill that passed the House. When you increase the cost of \nbringing goods and services to the marketplace, especially in a \nrecession, it becomes a recipe for economic disaster. It leads to lost \njobs and lost economic opportunities. We can't afford in this country \nto lose more jobs.\n  By deciding to pass Waxman-Markey, the majority will increase the \ncost of doing business. The legislation will increase the cost for \nevery small business. The legislation will force them to pay more for \neverything that uses energy. Those costs will put businesses in debt or \neven out of business. Jobs will be lost and unemployment will continue \nto climb.\n  The administration talks about creating green jobs. Well, we \ncertainly want those jobs, but we also want the red-white-and-blue jobs \nthat have powered America for centuries. There was a Washington Post \narticle on July 21 entitled ``U.S. Green Jobs Seen Taking Years of \nPlanning.'' Let me emphasize the word ``years.'' The article mentions \nupfront that:\n\n       Alternative energy jobs can provide vocations across many \n     sectors of the economy, but policy to spark them can take \n     years to develop.\n\n  Not now, not 6 months from now, not a year from now, but years into \nthe future. Promises of immediate green jobs being created across the \ncountry because of this Waxman-Markey bill are another misreading by \nthis administration. The economic stimulus package was simply the first \nthing the President misread. Those jobs never materialized. The green \njobs promised in Waxman-Markey may also take years to develop. However, \nthe job losses that the bill creates will occur immediately.\n  In an Investors Business Daily editorial on July 17 entitled \n``Following California Off a Green Cliff,'' the editor states that:\n\n       America remains the richest country on Earth, but it might \n     profit from adopting a bit of the attitude displayed by much \n     poorer but up-and-coming economic rivals such as China and \n     India. Those nations don't take prosperity for granted. That \n     is why they aren't such good sports on global warming. They \n     prefer to get rich and then go green.\n\n  The author goes on to say:\n\n       The U.S. isn't so poor that it can't afford strong \n     environmental policies. But it can't afford to take its \n     prosperity for granted either.\n\n  Let me repeat a couple of lines from those quotes: First, that \nAmerica remains the richest country on Earth. And that last line: But \nit can't afford--that is we, the United States--to take our prosperity \nfor granted. We here in Congress--the Members of this Congress--cannot \nafford to take the prosperity of this Nation for granted. If we pass \nWaxman-Markey, or a bill similar to it, that prosperity will erode \nfurther. We should create jobs, and we should create more wealth in \nthis country. We need to keep business costs low so businesses can \nexpand and create wealth for our Nation. We can do that by making \nAmerica's energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising \nenergy prices for the businesses and the families of America.\n  Our end goal must be to do everything we can to keep the jobs we have \nnow and also to find ways to add new green jobs. Americans want all of \nthese jobs and more. We need them all.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/24/senate-section/article/S8085-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8085-S8086]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to make a few comments on the \nDefense bill that passed late last night. Senator Levin and Senator \nMcCain did a very fine job in working through all the difficulties we \nfaced and tried to put together a bill that would support our troops. \nIndeed, I was on a video conference this at noon with a group of \nAlabama National Guardsmen and their families, an MP company from \nPrattville, AL, that is undertaking its third deployment. The company \nwas last deployed to Guantanamo and now they will be going to Iraq. We \nowe a great deal to these people who put their lives on the line for \nus. They leave their families and loved ones and go into harm's way to \nexecute the policies that we have set. As a result, we must never \nforget what we owe them. I hope we never do.\n  I think the bill we passed has some good things in it. Some are \ntroubling to me. I did not speak last night, in the late evening, about \nsection 1031 of the National Defense Authorization Act entitled \n``Military Commissions and al-Qaida.'' It was an important little \namendment and I want to share a few thoughts about it.\n  What we discovered was in the Defense authorization bill, al-Qaida \nwas removed from the unlawful enemy combatant definition. My amendment \nput that back into the bill. If you are a member of al-Qaida, you have \nearned the designation of an unlawful enemy combatant, or belligerent. \nWe are now using the words unlawful enemy belligerent. Those \nindividuals are people who operate outside the rules of warfare. They \ndo not wear uniforms. They deliberately and systematically target women \nand children and innocents. They do not comply with the rule of law, \nthe Geneva Conventions, and they, therefore, are not given the normal \nand full protections of the Geneva Conventions.\n  A person who is at war with the United States, as al-Qaida has \nrepeatedly announced that it is, who does their military activities \nwithout complying with the Geneva Conventions, deserves to be attacked. \nThey deserve to be killed or captured by the U.S. military. If \ncaptured, they deserve either to be prosecuted or held until the \nhostilities are over. That is what the\n\n[[Page S8086]]\n\nhistoric rules of warfare are, it is what we have always done, and we \nneed not be confused in this war and start treating it as if it were \nsome sort of criminal activity. Doing so would compromise our ability \nto be effective and place at greater risk those individuals whom we \nsend in harm's way, such as the 217th Military Police troop from \nPrattville, AL, which is going to Iraq. We don't need to be confused \nabout what this is. It is not a law enforcement operation.\n  We also adopted an amendment last night that prohibited the \nintelligence communities of the United States, our agencies or our \nmilitary, from giving Miranda warnings to people captured on the \nbattlefield. Giving Miranda warnings to unlawful enemy combatants is \nunthinkable. It is a confusing thing. What you are basically telling \nthese people that we capture is: Don't talk, we will give you a lawyer.\n  In fact, some of the NGOs, were telling Americans not to talk to them \nand ask for lawyers, because we were beginning to give Miranda \nwarnings.\n  The premise of this amendment is not an overreach. It is consistent \nwith our law.\n  Make no mistake, al-Qaida has announced it is and continues to be at \nwar with the United States. We are at war with them. We cannot mince \nwords. We cannot lead the world to believe that we have softened our \nresolve to defeat this enemy that threatens us.\n  According to a CNN report from July 15, 2009, al Zawahiri, bin \nLaden's deputy, called on Muslims to join in a jihad against the United \nStates. I wish that were not so but that is what it is. Last week a \nterrorist group affiliated with al-Qaida targeted two American-owned \nhotels in Jakarta, Indonesia. On July 21, just a few days ago, a Wall \nStreet Journal article pointed out last week's hotel bombings were not \nsome isolated event:\n\n       In the 19 months leading up to the Jakarta attacks, Islamic \n     terrorists have brought their holy war to upscale properties \n     in Kabul, Afghanistan; Islamabad, Pakistan; Mumbai, India; \n     and Peshawar, Pakistan. The casualties thus far number 116 \n     people killed and hundreds more injured.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, in the middle of the war against al-Qaida, is it \nwise to remove al-Qaida from the definition of unlawful enemy \ncombatant, or even the new form ``unprivileged enemy belligerent''? \nThat is the new word we are using and perhaps it is all right. I don't \nknow why we changed. But we have to be careful the words we use.\n  Can anyone imagine the Congress removing ``Nazi'' from the wartime \ndefinitions in the middle of the Second World War? What do we hope to \nachieve by taking al-Qaida's name out?\n  Fortunately, last night it was put back in. But what would have been \nachieved by removing their name from that list of organizations against \nwhich we are at war?\n  The original Military Commissions Act passed in 2006 made it clear \nthat the unlawful enemy combatant definition covered hostile groups \n``including a person who is part of . . . al-Qaida, or associated \nforces.''\n  Let's be clear about what removing al-Qaida from the definition would \nhave meant in the legal proceedings related to detainees. It will cloud \nthem under uncertainty and ambiguity. Judges, whether military or \ncivilian, will have to second guess whether al-Qaida members are truly \neligible to be held as enemy combatants.\n  This is not an unjustified concern. Let me tell you about one case \nwhere a Federal judge questioned whether an al-Qaida member who fought \nin the jihad could still be held as an enemy combatant. On April 15 of \nthis year, Judge Huvelle of the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia granted the habeas corpus petition of Yasin Muhammed Basardh, \nover the objections of the Obama administration.\n  Habeas corpus petition is a right of a person in the United States \nwho is held by the Government to ask why they are being held. It is \nreferred to in the Constitution. Many of my colleagues have said you \nare denying these prisoners habeas corpus petitions--denying them, \ntaking away something to which they are entitled.\n  I would point out that is not correct. Nobody ever understood habeas \ncorpus, as referred to at the founding of our Republic, as something \napplied to people captured in war against the United States. That was \nnever what it meant. It is only a most recent incorrect definition of \nhabeas that applied it to people who are trying to kill Americans and \nare at war against Americans. Some of the courts are confused on this, \nin my view. Congress has been a bit confused about it also.\n  But Judge Huvelle, unwisely, I think, concluded that the United \nStates could no longer hold Mr. Basardh because he no longer posed a \nrealistic risk of joining the enemy--in his opinion. Judge Huvelle is \nnot involved in the war. He is sitting safe and comfortable here in the \nDistrict of Columbia. The execution of a war is placed in the hands of \nthe men and women in the military to protect our country, whose lives \nare on the line.\n  So this judge reached this conclusion because Basardh was cooperative \nwhile in custody at Guantanamo Bay. In her decision in 2009, Judge \nHuvelle failed to mention the many salient facts that showed why the \nObama administration and the Bush administration before it opposed this \nman's release. According to unclassified Administrative Review Board \nrecords, Basardh was closely associated with al-Qaida, and directly \nlinked to Osama bin Laden. He admitted to:\n  No. 1, traveling from Yemen to Afghanistan to join the jihad, saying, \n``Yes, I did go to Afghanistan for the Jihad.''\n  No. 2, training at the al-Qaida-run al Farouq camp near Kandahar in \nAfghanistan;\n  No. 3, staying at Osama bin Laden's house in Kabul when the U.S. \nbombing began. ``It was Osama bin Laden's private house,'' he said.\n  No. 4, meeting with bin Laden himself on numerous occasions.\n  No. 5, responding to Osama bin Laden's call for all fighters to \nretreat and assemble at Tora Bora and,\n  No. 6, being in the cave with Osama bin Laden at Tora Bora.\n  If Federal courts are going to second guess the military on cases \nlike Basardh under the current Military Commissions Act, Congress \ncertainly should not weaken this act any more and give them any more \nability to undermine our efforts.\n  To the contrary, Congress should be crystal clear that membership in \nal-Qaida qualifies a detainee for unprivileged enemy belligerent \nstatus. My amendment removed any doubt over the detention of anyone who \nis a member of al-Qaida or served in its aid. My amendment will make \nclear that cases like this should not happen again. Simply put, if you \nare a member of al-Qaida you are going to be detained and held until \nthe war is over, in the same way Nazi army prisoners of war treated \nduring World War II.\n  I urge my colleagues to think about this, to make sure we are fully \ncognizant of the dangers our country faces, and retain this language \nthat was initially omitted, keeping al-Qaida by name as a group which \nwe are at war against. It is important that doesn't get removed by the \nconference committee. I am going to be watching. I think it is a big \ndeal.\n  Oftentimes when the conference committee meets, they make substantive \nchanges in the bill. Following conference, it will come back to the \nfloor, and at that time we will be unable to amend it. I am going to \nwatch. I think the American people need to know we are not confused in \nour thinking. We know against whom we are at war and we are committed \nto this effort and we are supporting our fabulous men and women who \nplace their lives at risk for us. We must not undermine their efforts \nby creating circumstances in which Federal judges can treat military \ncaptives as ordinary criminals with all the rights pertaining thereto.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/24/senate-section/article/S8086-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8086-S8090]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss an amendment I \nsubmitted with 12 cosponsors that the Senate adopted yesterday by voice \nvote. My amendment, No. 1760, as modified by a second-degree amendment \nI offered, No. 1807, sets some important benchmarks for the President \nto meet as his administration negotiates and prepares for Senate \nratification of a follow-on to the 1991 START agreement, which expires \nthis December 5.\n  As my colleagues know, the Constitution entrusts the Senate with the \nresponsibility of advice and consent on treaties.\n\n[[Page S8087]]\n\n  It is entirely within the Senate's prerogative--in fact, it is the \nSenate's responsibility--to consult with the administration at the \nbeginning of a treaty negotiation, during the process, and at the end. \nI have said before, if the administration wants to have the Senate on \nboard at the end of the treaty process--at ratification--it must listen \nto Senators throughout that negotiation. That is why the National \nSecurity Working Group which I co-chair with my friend Senator Byrd is \nso important.\n  It is also why this amendment is so important. The amendment is \nsimple and straightforward so that there should not be any confusion \nabout what the Senate expects in this treaty process.\n  First, the amendment requires the President to submit a report on the \nplan to modernize the U.S. nuclear deterrent, including the nuclear \nweapons stockpile, the infrastructure and the delivery systems. This \nreport must be put together in consultation with the experts: the \ndirectors of the national weapons labs, the Administrator of NNSA, the \nSecretary of Defense and the Commander of the United States Strategic \nCommand. And it must be accompanied by a plan to pay for the \nmodernization of the deterrent over the next decade.\n  This report is due within 30 days of enactment of S. 1390 or at the \nsame time the President sends the START follow-on treaty to the Senate, \nwhichever occurs earlier.\n  And to make sure there is no confusion about what the Senate expects, \nI joined my colleagues Senators Levin, McCain, Kerry, Lugar, and Byrd \nin sending a letter to the President to make clear that this plan must \nbe in place, and funded in fiscal year 2011 and the outyears, at the \nsame time the START follow-on treaty is sent to the Senate. I will ask \nto have this letter printed in the Record at the conclusion of my \nstatement.\n  Let there be no mistake about what we mean: if the administration \ndoes not submit to Congress a plan for the modernization of the U.S. \nnuclear deterrent, with funding to implement that plan, at the same \ntime it submits a START follow on agreement, that treaty will not be \nratified by the Senate until it does.\n  I know modernization is a dirty word to some arms controllers who \nbelieve that our nuclear weapons will simply go away if we neglect them \nenough. It should now be clear that that plan of nuclear disarmament \nthrough neglect and atrophy is dead.\n  Second, the amendment addresses the Russian Federation's demands that \nthe U.S. place limitations upon its missile defenses, space \ncapabilities, or advanced conventional modernization in order to reach \nan agreement on the treaty. Any such treaty would be dead on arrival in \nthe Senate.\n  To strengthen the President's position with the Russian Federation on \nthese matters, the amendment makes clear the Senate expects the \nadministration will not change its position by including any of these \nlimitations in the follow-on treaty, no matter how hard the Russians \nhuff and puff and stomp their feet.\n  And the Senate has now joined the House of Representatives in \nunanimously backing my amendment and the similar House amendment \noffered by Congressman Turner so the Russians and the Obama \nadministration should have no question about what both Houses of the \nCongress expect from this treaty process.\n  I would like to say a few words about why I felt it was necessary to \noffer these measures.\n  In recent months, it has become clear that our nuclear deterrent is \nin need of serious attention. As high an authority as Secretary of \nDefense Robert Gates warned:\n\n       At a certain point, it will become impossible to keep \n     extending the life of our arsenal, especially in light of our \n     testing moratorium. It also makes it harder to reduce \n     existing stockpiles, because eventually we won't have as much \n     confidence in the efficacy of the weapons we do have.\n\n  And:\n\n       To be blunt, there is absolutely no way we can maintain a \n     credible deterrent and reduce the number of weapons in our \n     stockpile without either resorting to testing our stockpile \n     or pursuing a modernization program.\n\n  The Perry-Schlesinger Commission, which recently issued its final \nreport, also warned that:\n\n       For the indefinite future, the United States must maintain \n     a viable nuclear deterrent. The other NPT-recognized nuclear-\n     weapon states have put in place comprehensive programs to \n     modernize their forces to meet new international \n     circumstances.\n\n  Yet, it is clear that the steps necessary to do that are not being \ntaken. The administration's fiscal year 2010 budget for the nuclear \ndeterrent has been described by its own officials as ``treading water'' \nand a ``placeholder.''\n  The physics and chemistry that are causing our nuclear weapons to \ndeteriorate will not wait for the next Nuclear Posture Review--NPR--\nthough.\n  I make that point because I'm sure there are those who will make the \nargument that a comprehensive modernization plan should wait for that \nNPR.\n  To that I have two points: one, modernization is interrelated with \nthe size of our stockpile this is the point made by the Secretary of \nDefense.\n  And, apparently, decisions about the size of our stockpile--which is \na significant element of the NPR Congress ordered--are being made right \nnow; in fact, it appears they were made in early July in Moscow. If the \ncart can be put before the horse, the Senate can and should require the \nhorse be brought along.\n  I say again, my amendment doesn't say that the treaty or agreement \ncan't be signed until there is a modernization plan put forward. It \nmerely says the DOD can't implement the reductions called for in the \ntreaty until the modernization plan, at least the fiscal year 2011 \nelements of it, are submitted by the President and funded by the \nCongress.\n  My personal belief, consistent with the warnings of the Secretary of \nDefense, is that we should not ratify the treaty until the long-term \nmodernization plan is submitted by the President and funded by the \nCongress. But that is not what this amendment would do.\n  Additionally, it is clear from that Joint Understanding that issues \ntotally unrelated to strategic arms reductions, like missile defense \nand conventional modernization programs, are at risk of being sewn into \nthe START agreement anyway.\n  As Dr. Keith Payne, a member of the Perry-Schlesinger Commission, \nrecently noted in testimony before the House Foreign Affairs Committee:\n\n       It would seem self-evidently a mistake to include any \n     limits on U.S. [Ballistic Missile Defense] BMD as a price to \n     be paid for an agreement that requires nothing of the \n     Russians beyond discarding the aged systems they plan to \n     eliminate in any event and will not touch the real problem of \n     Russian tactical nuclear weapons.\n\n  Yet, despite the logic of Dr. Payne's statement, and disregarding the \nphoto ops and positive press statements, President Medvedev made clear \nthat little had changed from the especially pugnacious Russian \nstatements before the July summit when he said at the G-8 summit just a \nfew days later: ``If we don't manage to agree on the issues, you know \nthe consequences,'' referring to the deployment of Russian tactical \nmissiles to Kaliningrad.\n  And his Foreign Minister, Mr. Lavrov, further elaborated that if the \nThird Site goes forward, ``then that will doubtless place a big \nquestion mark over the prospects for further reductions in strategic \noffensive weapons.''\n  Congress has a long history of making its views known on arms control \nnegotiations in this fashion, including on the SALT-I negotiations in \n1972 and the START II negotiations in 1996.\n  Given the issues at stake in the follow-on treaty, it is clear that \nthis amendment is necessary.\n  Mr. President, I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a Dear colleague letter I circulated to Senators concerning my \namendment No. 1760, in addition to the letter to President Obama which \nI referred to earlier.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    July 23, 2009.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Obama: We believe that when the START treaty \n     is submitted, you should also submit a plan, including a \n     funding estimate for FY11 (and out years across the next \n     decade), to enhance the safety, security and reliability of \n     the nuclear weapons stockpile, to modernize the nuclear \n     weapons\n\n[[Page S8088]]\n\n     complex (i.e. improve the safety of facilities, modernize the \n     infrastructure, maintain the key capabilities and \n     competencies of the nuclear weapons workforce--the designers \n     and the technicians), and to maintain the delivery platforms.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jon Kyl,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     John McCain,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Richard Lugar,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Carl Levin,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     John Kerry,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Robert C. Byrd,\n       U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 22, 2009.\n       Dear Colleague, I recommend the attached op-ed, ``Plumage--\n     But at a Price'' by Charles Krauthammer, from the July 9th \n     Washington Post. Mr. Krauthammer makes a number of \n     observations worth understanding and repeating, including, \n     ``the very notion that Kim Jong Il or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \n     will suddenly abjure nukes because of yet another U.S.-\n     Russian treaty is comical.''\n       The column also highlights another concern: the Russian \n     insistence that we compromise our missile defense. As Mr. \n     Krauthammer writes, ``since defensive weaponry will be the \n     decisive strategic factor of the 21st century, Russia has \n     striven mightily for a quarter-century to halt its \n     development.'' The July 6th Joint Understanding signed by \n     President Obama and President Medvedev raises concerns that \n     the Administration may be ceding key ground to the Russians \n     on several significant points, including missile defense.\n       Recently, the House unanimously adopted a provision as a \n     part of its FY10 National Defense Authorization Act that \n     missile defense, space capabilities and advanced conventional \n     modernization (e.g. prompt global strike) should not be a \n     part of the START follow-on, and our nuclear weapons MUST be \n     modernized if further reductions are to be conducted with \n     minimal risk. The operative provisions of the amendment are \n     tied to the implementation of a follow-on treaty or \n     agreement; they DO NOT prevent the Administration from \n     concluding a new treaty or agreement with the Russians.\n       We should adopt the same amendment to strengthen the \n     Administration's hand with the Russians by making clear that \n     Congress simply WILL NOT provide the funding to implement a \n     START follow-on that in any way limits missile defense, space \n     capabilities, or conventional strike modernization, nor will \n     it allow further strategic arms reductions if the President \n     does not provide a comprehensive modernization program for \n     the U.S. nuclear deterrent (including the weapons stockpile, \n     the infrastructure that supports it, and the weapons delivery \n     systems).\n       I will, therefore, be offering such an amendment to S. \n     1390, the FY10 National Defense Authorization Act.\n       I will also offer an amendment that expresses the Sense of \n     the Senate that the asymmetrical advantage Russia has over \n     U.S. and allied forces due to its 10-to-1 edge in tactical \n     nuclear weapons must be rectified. As the bipartisan Perry-\n     Schlesinger Commission stated in its Final Report: ``The \n     United States should not cede to Russia a posture of \n     superiority in the name of deemphasizing nuclear weapons in \n     U.S. military strategy. There seems no near-term prospect of \n     such a result in the balance of operationally deployed \n     strategic nuclear weapons. But that balance does not exist in \n     non-strategic nuclear forces, where Russia enjoys a sizeable \n     numerical advantage. As noted above, it stores thousands of \n     these weapons in apparent support of possible military \n     operations west of the Urals. The United States deploys a \n     small fraction of that number in support of nuclear sharing \n     agreements in NATO. Precise numbers for the U.S. deployments \n     are classified but their total is only about five percent of \n     the total at the height of the Cold War. Strict U.S.-Russian \n     equivalence in NSNF numbers is unnecessary. But the current \n     imbalance is stark and worrisome to some U.S. allies in \n     Central Europe. If and as reductions continue in the number \n     of operationally deployed strategic nuclear weapons, this \n     imbalance will become more apparent and allies less \n     assured.''\n       Congress has a long history of making its views known on \n     arms control negotiations in this fashion, including on the \n     SALT-I negotiations in 1972 and the START II negotiations in \n     1996.\n       I urge you to support my amendments to the NDAA. It is \n     imperative that we ensure the follow-on treaty is negotiated \n     and implemented in a manner most consistent with the national \n     security of the U.S.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                          Jon Kyl,\n     United States Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, July 9, 2009]\n\n                        Plumage--But at a Price\n\n                        (By Charles Krauthammer)\n\n       The signing ceremony in Moscow was a grand affair. For \n     Barack Obama, foreign policy neophyte and ``reset'' man, the \n     arms reduction agreement had a Kissingerian air. A fine \n     feather in his cap. And our president likes his plumage.\n       Unfortunately for the United States, the country Obama \n     represents, the prospective treaty is useless at best, \n     detrimental at worst.\n       Useless because the level of offensive nuclear weaponry, \n     the subject of the U.S.-Russia ``Joint Understanding,'' is an \n     irrelevance. We could today terminate all such negotiations, \n     invite the Russians to build as many warheads as they want \n     and profitably watch them spend themselves into penury, as \n     did their Soviet predecessors, stockpiling weapons that do \n     nothing more than, as Churchill put it, make the rubble \n     bounce.\n       Obama says that his START will be a great boon, setting an \n     example to enable us to better pressure North Korea and Iran \n     to give up their nuclear programs. That a man of Obama's \n     intelligence can believe such nonsense is beyond \n     comprehension. There is not a shred of evidence that cuts by \n     the great powers--the INF treaty, START I, the Treaty of \n     Moscow (2002)--induced the curtailment of anyone's programs. \n     Moammar Gaddafi gave up his nukes the week we pulled Saddam \n     Hussein out of his spider hole. No treaty involved. The very \n     notion that Kim Jong Il or Mahmoud Ahmadinejad will suddenly \n     abjure nukes because of yet another U.S.-Russian treaty is \n     comical.\n       The pursuit of such an offensive weapons treaty could \n     nonetheless be detrimental to us. Why? Because Obama's hunger \n     for a diplomatic success, such as it is, allowed the Russians \n     to exact a price: linkage between offensive and defensive \n     nuclear weapons.\n       This is important for Russia because of the huge American \n     technological advantage in defensive weaponry. We can \n     reliably shoot down an intercontinental ballistic missile. \n     They cannot. And since defensive weaponry will be the \n     decisive strategic factor of the 21st century, Russia has \n     striven mightily for a quarter-century to halt its \n     development. Gorbachev tried to swindle Reagan out of the \n     Strategic Defense Initiative at Reykjavik in 1986. Reagan \n     refused. As did his successors--Bush I, Clinton, Bush II.\n       Obama, who seeks to banish nuclear weapons entirely, has \n     little use for such prosaic contrivances. First, the Obama \n     budget actually cuts spending on missile defense, at a time \n     when federal spending is a riot of extravagance and trillion-\n     dollar deficits. Then comes the ``pause'' (as Russia's \n     president appreciatively noted) in the planned establishment \n     of a missile shield in Eastern Europe. And now the ``Joint \n     Understanding'' commits us to a new treaty that includes ``a \n     provision on the interrelationship of strategic offensive and \n     strategic defensive arms.'' Obama further said that the East \n     European missile shield ``will be the subject of extensive \n     negotiations'' between the United States and Russia.\n       Obama doesn't even seem to understand the ramifications of \n     this concession. Poland and the Czech Republic thought they \n     were regaining their independence when they joined NATO under \n     the protection of the United States. They now see that the \n     shield negotiated with us and subsequently ratified by all of \n     NATO is in limbo. Russia and America will first have to \n     ``come to terms'' on the issue, explained President Dmitry \n     Medvedev. This is precisely the kind of compromised \n     sovereignty that Russia wants to impose on its ex-Soviet \n     colonies--and that U.S. presidents of both parties for the \n     past 20 years have resisted.\n       Resistance, however, is not part of Obama's repertoire. \n     Hence his eagerness for arcane negotiations over MIRV'd \n     missiles, the perfect distraction from the major issue \n     between the two countries: Vladimir Putin's unapologetic and \n     relentless drive to restore Moscow's hegemony over the \n     sovereign states that used to be Soviet satrapies.\n       That--not nukes--is the chief cause of the friction between \n     the United States and Russia. You wouldn't know it to hear \n     Obama in Moscow pledging to halt the ``drift'' in U.S.-\n     Russian relations. Drift? The decline in relations came from \n     Putin's desire to undo what he considers ``the greatest \n     geopolitical catastrophe'' of the 20th century--the collapse \n     of the Soviet empire. Hence his squeezing Ukraine's energy \n     supplies. His overt threats against Poland and the Czech \n     Republic for daring to make sovereign agreements with the \n     United States. And finally, less than a year ago, his \n     invading a small neighbor, detaching and then effectively \n     annexing two of Georgia's provinces to Mother Russia.\n       That's the cause of the collapse of our relations. Not \n     drift, but aggression. Or, as the reset master phrased it \n     with such delicacy in his Kremlin news conference: ``our \n     disagreements on Georgia's borders.''\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I commend the Senate for including \nthe Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act as part of the National \nDefense Authorization Act, and I am optimistic that at long last, our \n12-year effort to enact this legislation into law is finally reaching \nfruition.\n  Hate crimes are acts of domestic terrorism. Like all terrorist acts, \nhate crimes are intended to strike fear into whole communities by \ncrimes against a few. We have committed ourselves to protecting our \ncountry from terrorists who strike from abroad, and now we have \ncommitted ourselves to protecting Americans from hate-motivated crimes \nin our own backyards.\n  That is why 63 Senators from both sides of the aisle voted to include \nthe\n\n[[Page S8089]]\n\nMatthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act as part of the National \nDefense Authorization Act. The House of Representatives already \napproved a very similar measure with strong bipartisan support earlier \nthis year. The Matthew Shepard Act strengthens the ability of the \nFederal Government to investigate and prosecute hate crimes. It removes \nexcessive restrictions in current Federal law that prevent effective \nhate crimes prosecutions. And it offers Federal assistance to State and \nlocal authorities in preventing, investigating, and prosecuting \ndespicable crimes.\n  I am proud that President Obama is a strong supporter of this \nbipartisan legislation along with Attorney General Eric Holder. The \nAttorney General has been with us from the beginning of our efforts to \nget this done, and it is significant that swift enactment of this \nlegislation would ensure that the measure is implemented under his \nimpressive guidance.\n  The Attorney General's leadership at the Justice Department is \nlaunching a new era of civil rights enforcement. In recent months, we \nhave worked with the Justice Department to improve the Senate-approved \nhate crimes bill so that it addresses hate crimes in the most effective \nand meaningful way, and I appreciate the time and expertise of so many \nat the Department on this matter, especially Mark Kappelhoff, Ron \nWeich, and Judy Appelbaum. In addition, I must thank the Justice \nDepartment for diligently working to provide its recent views letter \nwhich concludes that the Matthew Shepard Act would be ``wholly \nconstitutional.''\n  Passage of the amendment would not have been possible without the \nskill and dedication of many in the Senate. I commend Majority Leader \nReid for his leadership and commitment to seeing that the amendment was \npassed before the August recess. In addition, I commend Serena Hoy of \nthe majority leader's staff for her constant attention to the issue.\n  I also especially commend Senator Levin for working so hard with me \non this measure for so many years, and Rick Debobes and Kaye Meier of \nhis staff for their tireless work on the Senate floor. I am also very \ngrateful for the support and leadership of Senator Leahy and his \nexcellent staff, including Ed Pagano, Bruce Cohen, Kristine Lucius, \nNoah Bookbinder, and Roscoe Jones.\n  I appreciate as well the hard work of Senator Durbin and his staffer \nMike Zubrensky, as well as Senator Collins and her staff, including Rob \nEpplin, Amanda Wood, and Nikki McKinney. I also thank Judiciary \nCommittee staffers Lara Flint and Danyelle Solomon, as well as Mike \nJones on the Budget Committee, for their contributions as well. I also \nappreciate the expert and patient assistance of John Henderson and Bill \nJensen in the Office of the Legislative Counsel of the Senate.\n  As is the case with many challenging issues before the Senate, \npassage of the Matthew Shepard Act would have not been possible without \nthe effective support of the Democratic cloakroom, especially Lula \nDavis.\n  Finally, I commend the outstanding work of so many in my own office, \nincluding Carey Parker, Christine Leonard, Ty Cobb, and Sara Kingsley--\nas well as Bethany Bassett, Jorie Feldman, Joe Barresi, Colin Taylor, \nand Jamie Susskind, who helped us get through the final stretch. For \nover a decade, we have been working to see this measure become law, and \nwe certainly wouldn't be where we are today without the contributions \nof so many dedicated and determined staffers along the way.\n  Inclusion of the Matthew Shepard Act as part of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act sends a strong signal that just as our Nation is \nconcerned about terroristic acts abroad, it is also dedicated to \neliminating homegrown terrorism against our Nation's own communities. \nWe will be a stronger and better nation in the years ahead, once our \nlaws recognize that bias-motivated violence has no place in the United \nStates.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, while there are a number of provisions \nin the Fiscal Year 2010 National Defense Authorization Act that I \nsupport, I have some serious concerns about the bill that prevent me \nfrom supporting it. In particular, this bill does not contain a binding \ndeadline to end the war in Iraq. While I am pleased that the President \nhas committed to withdrawing our troops by the end of 2011, this \nredeployment schedule is too long and therefore may undermine our \nability to combat al-Qaida and further strain our Armed Forces \nunnecessarily. In addition, while the President clearly understands \nthat the greatest threat to our Nation resides in Pakistan, I remain \nconcerned that his strategy regarding Afghanistan and Pakistan does not \nadequately address, and may even exacerbate, the problems we face in \nPakistan. This bill authorizes funding that is being used to increase \nour military presence in Afghanistan, without ensuring that this \nstrategy does not end up pushing militants into neighboring Pakistan \nand further destabilizing that nuclear-armed nation.\n  Among the provisions in the bill that I strongly support are a pay \nraise for those serving in uniform, a task force to review care for \nwounded warriors, and $20 million in additional funding for the \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program.\n  In addition, my amendment to ensure that wounded members of the \nReserve component are not discharged until their disabilities have been \nevaluated will help ensure a smooth transition back into civilian life \nfor these service members. I am pleased that this amendment was \naccepted and thank Senator Levin and Senator McCain for their \ncooperation.\n  I am also pleased that the Senate accepted my amendment to require a \nreport on the adequacy of funding for forces needed to respond to the \nconsequences of a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear \nexplosive incident in the United States. Historically, the Defense \nDepartment has delayed efforts to stand up these forces and underfunded \nsimilar capabilities. This amendment will help ensure that these key \ncivil support forces receive necessary funds.\n  Unfortunately, the Senate Armed Services Committee rejected my \namendment to ensure our troops are not exposed to toxic fumes in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. This commonsense amendment would have prohibited the \nburning, in open pits, of waste that produces toxic fumes, including \nthat which produces known carcinogens. I have urged the chairman to \naccede to the language in the House bill, which I helped to draft, that \nwould prohibit this practice.\n  I continue to be concerned that foreign military assistance funds \nauthorized by this bill are being awarded in violation of the Foreign \nAssistance Act. I will continue to work to ensure that the Pentagon \ncomplies with Federal law in its administration of these programs. The \nForeign Assistance Act ensures that our foreign military assistance is \nadministered in a manner that will promote legitimate governments and \nthe rule of law. Failure to comply with these statutory requirements \nruns the risk of provoking instability, militancy and anti-Americanism \nin key regions throughout the world.\n  The bill contains a provision prohibiting the outsourcing of \ninterrogations ``during or in the aftermath of hostilities.'' I have \npreviously cosponsored similar amendments covering the intelligence \ncommunity.\n  I am pleased that the legislation includes changes to the Military \nCommissions Act to improve the procedures that would be used in \nmilitary commission trials. The Military Commissions Act violated the \nbasic principles and values of our constitutional system of government, \nand any improvement to it is welcome. However, I remain concerned that \nthe military commission process is so discredited that it may not be \npossible to fix it. And I have yet to hear a convincing argument that \nother options for bringing detainees to justice--the civilian Federal \ncriminal justice system and the military courts martial system--are \ninsufficient or unworkable.\n  The bill requires a report on the Department's efforts to reduce \nspending on unneeded spare parts. I have long had concerns about \nwasteful spending on unnecessary spare parts. I was pleased that early \nthis year, at my urging, the Air Force committed to reducing its on \norder excess inventory by half, thus saving American taxpayers roughly \n$50 million.\n  This bill largely supports the President's efforts to restore fiscal \nresponsibility to the defense budget. I was\n\n[[Page S8090]]\n\npleased to support Senator Levin and Senator McCain's amendment \nstripping funds for the F-22 from the bill. The Defense Department has \nstated that it does not need any more of these aircraft, and that these \nfunds are urgently needed to meet the real-world threats that we face \ntoday. I am also pleased that the President has reduced spending on \nredundant and unproven missile defense technologies. I am disappointed, \nhowever, that this bill contains billions of dollars of earmarks not \nrequested by the Pentagon. This wasteful spending takes money away from \nour troops and endangers our national security.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, today, I wish to speak on the Victims of \nIranian Censorship, or VOICE, Act which passed last night as an \namendment to the Defense authorization bill.\n  I was pleased to introduce this bill with Senators McCain, Lieberman, \nCasey, and Graham, and I thank the cosponsors for their shared \ncommitment to this issue. I also thank Chairman Levin and Ranking \nMember McCain for helping to secure its passage.\n  The VOICE Act supports freedom of the press, freedom of speech, and \nfreedom of expression in Iran, and authorizes funding for the \nBroadcasting Board of Governors to expand transmission capability and \nprogramming on Radio Farda and the Persian News Network.\n  It supports the development of technology to counter ongoing Internet \ncensorship, and promotes online U.S.-Iranian educational and cultural \nexchanges.\n  Passage of the VOICE Act is especially timely given the suppression \nof free flowing information in and out of Iran since the June 12 \npresidential election.\n  While the people of Iran enthusiastically participated in these \nelections, it is painfully clear that the long road to democracy does \nnot end there. A true democracy values fundamental freedoms, such as \nfreedom of expression, which is protected under the International \nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n  In fact, in 1976, Iran was one of the first countries to ratify--and \nit is still a party to--this U.N. treaty, which also protects the right \nto hold opinions without interference, and affirms the right to receive \nand impart information in writing, print, or through any other media.\n  Unfortunately, these international obligations have not been upheld \nin Iran, where the Internet and text-messaging services are monitored \nand blocked, and U.S.-funded television and radio broadcasting is \nincreasingly jammed. News reporting has been censored, access for \njournalists has been restricted, and specific media outlets have been \ntargeted and shutdown. Foreign journalists have had their press \ncredentials cancelled and equipment confiscated.\n  They have been confined to their hotels and told their visas would \nnot be renewed. Foreign press bureaus in Tehran have been closed, and \nothers have been instructed to suspend all their Farsi-language news.\n  For Iranian journalists, the stakes have been even higher. Numerous \nIranian journalists have been detained, imprisoned, assaulted, and \nintimidated since the elections. And journalists have been instructed \nto file stories solely from their offices, which has limited their \nability to provide timely and accurate news.\n  Regarding interference of international broadcasting, shortwave and \nmedium wave transmissions of the Farsi-language Radio Free Europe/Radio \nLiberty's Radio Farda have been partially blocked. And satellite \nbroadcasts, including those of the Voice of America's Persian News \nNetwork and the British Broadcasting Corporation, have been \nintermittently jammed.\n  These are popular services in Iran, which serve as a vital source of \nnews and entertainment for the Iranian people, especially for those \nseeking access to credible information and news.\n  Since the election, efforts to suppress the free flow of information \nhave not focused on the media alone. Blogs and social networking sites \nhave been targeted as well, including popular websites such Facebook \nand Twitter. Short message service in Iran has been blocked--preventing \ntext messaging and jamming internet sites that utilize such services--\nand cell phone service has been partially shut-down. These restrictions \nhave prevented the free flow of information, and precluded Iranian \ncitizens from accessing unimpeded means of communication.\n  Iran did not develop this sophisticated Internet-censorship \ntechnology on its own. In fact, reports indicate that numerous \ncompanies including some with U.S. subsidiaries--have provided Iran \nwith the software and technological expertise to block the Internet, \nand monitor online use to gather information about individuals.\n  Unfortunately, little is known about the specifics surrounding these \nsales, which likely including ``deep packet inspection'' technology, \nwhich, among other things, allows the government to read, block, and \ncensor the Internet. In addition to giving it the capability to spread \ndisinformation by modifying, tampering with, and diverting emails.\n  This behavior is unconscionable, and unfortunately not enough is \nknown about the sale of Internet-restricting technology to countries \nincluding, but not limited to, Iran. That is why the VOICE Act requires \na report to Congress examining the sale of technology that has \nfurthered Iran's ability to filter and monitor the Internet, as well as \ndisrupt cell phone and Internet use.\n  Our bill supports the Iranian people as they take steps to peacefully \nexpress their opinions and aspirations, and seek access to means of \ncommunication and news. It expresses respect for the sovereignty, proud \nhistory, and rich culture of the Iranian people, and recognizes the \nuniversal values of freedom of speech and freedom of the press.\n  Most importantly, it supports the Iranian people as they seek access \nto unimpeded Internet access, cellular phone communications, and \ncredible news.\n  I am pleased the Senate has adopted a bipartisan bill that supports \nthe Iranian people as they seek unfettered access to news and other \ninformation.\n  It is critical that we continue to support for free speech, free \npress, and free expression in Iran and in every country throughout the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/24/senate-section/article/S8090-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8090-S8091]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN AFGHANISTAN\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I wish to speak about women in Afghanistan. \nAfter months of collaborative discussions between women's advocacy \ngroups and the Government of Afghanistan, the Elimination of Violence \nAgainst Women Act was just signed by Executive decree. I applaud the \nwomen who pushed for this bill, and those in the government who jointly \nprepared it. It represents transparency and collaboration between civil \nsociety and the government, something we should all congratulate. The \nbill will head to Parliament for final review when it reconvenes next \nweek. It is my strong hope that Parliament review the law and pass it \nwithout delay, ensuring all protections remain intact. This bill \nprovides real criminal sanctions for violence against women, and puts \nspecific responsibilities onto the shoulders of government ministries. \nWhen we think of the abuse and repression exercised against women \nduring the Taliban regime, it is hard not to feel encouraged by the \nvery existence of this act, let alone its prospect for enactment.\n  Many, quite plausibly, will say that this law cannot be fully \nimplemented anywhere in Afghanistan, as access to justice for women in \nthe courts and in traditional councils is all too often out of reach, \nand because of the societal discrimination that women still suffer. \nJustice must be accessible to women in Afghanistan on an equal basis to \nmen, or Afghanistan will never tap into the true, vast potential of the \nwomen of that country. This law is a giant step for the entire country \nin rejecting violence against women, but now the Parliament must take \nthe final step to pass the law as it is, with all protections intact.\n  I must also mention the controversial Shia Personal Status Law that \nwas also signed by Executive decree. It was drafted without \ntransparency, and aimed to codify degrading practices that exist in \nsome households and communities. Unlike the Elimination of Violence \nAgainst Women Act, civil society was not included during the drafting \nand debate of the law in Parliament. While women's civil organizations \nwere able to force some amendments to the bill just before the \npresident's signature, they were not able to\n\n[[Page S8091]]\n\nfully cleanse the bill of some harmful provisions. Now that the bill \nhas been signed, I call on the Government of Afghanistan to communicate \nwidely and openly about the final substance of the law.\n  The timing of this is vital. Afghanistan is about to go to the polls \nfor presidential and provincial elections, and all eyes will be \nwatching how and to what extent women participate. Women's access to \nthe polls is imperative, and the value of their vote must be considered \nby the candidates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/24/senate-section/article/S8091-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8091-S8092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JOHN PODESTA'S CULINARY SKILLS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, our friend, Marion Burros, a superb writer \non all matters culinary and otherwise, has written a most entertaining \nprofile of John Podesta for Politico.\n  John Podesta is a friend of decades and someone Marcelle and I admire \ngreatly. It is not only his and his wife Mary's talent in everything \nfrom the law to politics, but it is also the Podestas a privileged few \nsee when they are preparing feasts in their District of Columbia home. \nWatching them is like watching a symphony where the enjoyment continues \nthroughout the evening.\n  I can think of a number of times we settled all the problems of the \nworld through laughter, food, discussions of our families, and on, in \ntheir kitchen. Anyone who doesn't relish such a feast for weeks after \nhas no sense of culinary excellence--and I have never known anyone to \nleave disappointed.\n  Mr. President, so others might enjoy the Politico article, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From Politico, July 10, 2009]\n\n                     John Podesta, a Seasoned Hand\n\n                           (By Marian Burros)\n\n       John Podesta may be best known as one of Washington's \n     consummate inside players. But he is also his family's chief \n     cook, grocery shopper and, apparently, bottle washer--and can \n     put on a five-course meal for six in the space of three hours \n     without assistance, and with a bare minimum of advance \n     preparation.\n       The adjectives used to describe Podesta's political \n     skills--methodical and disciplined--apply equally to his \n     well-honed cooking techniques, learned from his mother long \n     before he became one of the capital's most influential \n     Democratic power brokers.\n       No recipes, no timing notes. ``I consult cookbooks for \n     ideas,'' he said. ``I don't use recipes. I don't tend to cook \n     like a chemist.''\n       What he does do is cook and talk at the same time, a skill \n     generally found only among professionals. And he talks the \n     game of a seasoned cook while he chops, using the proper \n     knife technique. Interspersed are funny, self-deprecating \n     stories, including tales of his tour of duty as a guide \n     wearing an 18th-century costume that involved slaughtering \n     and roasting pigs.\n       But more on that later.\n       Hard-driving is the adjective often applied to Podesta's \n     style in all of the various incarnations of his Washington \n     career--as a lobbyist with his brother Tony, as a staffer for \n     Sen. Pat Leahy (D-Vt.), as chief of staff in the Clinton \n     White House, as co-chairman of the Obama transition team and \n     as chief executive of the Center for American Progress, a \n     liberal think tank he helped found. When he relaxes, if that \n     is a word that can be applied to the tightly wound Podesta, \n     it's through two favorite pursuits: jogging and cooking.\n       He also collects contemporary art, is a UFO aficionado and \n     loves nothing more than to sit in the front car of a roller \n     coaster with his wife, Mary, as they hurtle along, holding \n     hands above their heads. A feat, he notes proudly, achieved \n     with the purchase of senior citizen tickets. He runs \n     marathons, completing his latest in Rome in 4:06. In fact, he \n     plans his menus while he runs. ``I kept going back and forth \n     between pork and fish,'' he said about dinner on a recent \n     evening.\n       ``Cooking is what I do to relax,'' he said. ``It's much \n     easier to see the fruits of your labor. It's fun.''\n       Even better is cooking for crowds. ``Cooking for 50 needs \n     organization, preparation and thought,'' Podesta said. ``One \n     part is creative; one part you have to get your mind focused. \n     That's challenging.''\n       As a young boy, he was expected to finish the dinners his \n     mother, who worked at night, left on the stove. Mary Podesta \n     was Greek-American, his father Italian-American, so he \n     learned to cook dishes from both cultures. ``I make a pretty \n     mean moussaka, pastitsio, baklava and spanakopita,'' he said, \n     reeling off Greek dishes that are complicated, the latter two \n     made with the paper-thin phyllo dough, requiring great manual \n     dexterity.\n       ``My mother had an intuitive sense of cooking and \n     chemistry,'' he said. ``She was a fixture in Washington. When \n     my brother was hosting a fundraiser, she would cook and sit \n     in the kitchen. She was very liberal and very opinionated, \n     and this was the age of Republican control of Congress.\n       ``A reporter was talking to her, and she was going off on \n     Trent Lott, [Newt] Gingrich and [Tom] DeLay. It was the most \n     embarrassing moment for us, but the reporter took pity on her \n     and didn't write about it.''\n       As Podesta explains it, with a Greek mother and Italian \n     father, speaking your mind was a core value of his childhood. \n     ``We were a blue-collar Chicago family,'' he said. ``The \n     kitchen table was not a model of decorum. It was all right to \n     yell.''\n       His heritage, he once told an interviewer, also explains \n     his hot temper and accounts for the occasional appearance of \n     Skippy, his sarcastic and ill-humored alter ego.\n       Flashing a touch of his well-known wit, he said it also \n     explains ``why I can't understand why Obama doesn't hold \n     grudges.''\n       The meal began with the risotto, topped with chopped fresh \n     radicchio and basil and served with a 2004 Fonterutoli \n     Chianti Classico. Podesta put the tilapia on to cook while \n     the guests finished the risotto. It was served with all of \n     the vegetable dishes and a 2006 Kistler Carneros chardonnay.\n       He wondered aloud if he should serve the salad and then \n     disappeared into the basement for the mandoline to slice the \n     fennel and red peppers, which he dressed with olive oil and \n     lemon juice.\n       His wife, Mary, arrived home from her book club just in \n     time for the dessert of berries in prosecco, which was served \n     with Perrier Jouet rose. She confirmed that he did most of \n     the cooking and the dishes.\n       ``Having a husband who does all the cooking is pretty \n     great,'' said Mary Podesta, who is also a lawyer. Asked if \n     she had a say in what is served, there was a pause: ``We \n     negotiate.''\n       Podesta cooks dinner every night he is in town, as he did \n     when his three children lived at home, and thought nothing of \n     introducing them to exotic foods like frogs' legs, \n     sweetbreads and squid. He and his wife seldom eat out and \n     entertain about once a week.\n       It's no different from his remarkable ability to impose \n     discipline on a bunch of unruly Democrats--or the fractious \n     factions of the Clinton West Wing.\n       For this informal Sunday dinner for six, the 60-year-old \n     Podesta was dressed in a polo shirt, shorts, sports socks and \n     sneakers. He led his guests directly to the modest kitchen in \n     his Northwest D.C. home, where most surfaces were covered \n     with what was soon to be dinner. There were tomato halves \n     soon to be topped with pesto (the one recipe he had made in \n     advance); arborio rice simmering on the stove, on its way to \n     being risotto; a pan of sauteed leeks and radicchio to be \n     added to the risotto; Brussels sprouts to be roasted with \n     thyme; bok choy and a baking dish, which would soon hold \n     tilapia sprinkled with olives and capers and cooked in \n     parchment.\n       Cocktails, or the kibitzing hour, took place in the \n     kitchen, where simple snacks to go with the Jacob's Creek \n     sparkling wine included dried apricots stuffed with goat \n     cheese.\n       Podesta likened dinner preparations to training for ``Iron \n     Chef,'' though there was no secret ingredient and his only \n     competition was with himself, to pull off the dinner without \n     a hitch.\n       He has been, however, prevailed upon to participate in \n     celebrity cook-offs that Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) holds to \n     raise campaign cash. He had only this to say about the \n     results: ``When the lobbyists judge, usually a member of \n     Congress wins. When Nora Pouillon (the chef and owner of \n     Restaurant Nora) judged it, I won.'' His winning dish was \n     grilled tuna in the style of vitello tonnato.\n       Running 30 miles a week explains, in part, why he is reed-\n     thin, despite his love of food. But then, he has never liked \n     breakfast and hardly ever goes out to business lunches, \n     considering them ``an occupational hazard.''\n       As Podesta talked, he went back and forth between the \n     dishes, his timing impeccable. He doesn't rattle easily.\n       A few things were bought the day before, the rest that \n     morning. His choice of grocery stores reflects his frugal \n     nature as much as his cooking skills. Before Balducci's bit \n     the dust, he avoided it. ``Too expensive,'' he said. While he \n     goes to Magruder's and Whole Foods, he also goes to Costco \n     and Rodman's, a drugstore better known for its discounted \n     gourmet products than for filling prescriptions.\n       His stove also makes a statement about his frugality. ``I'm \n     not into the whole Vulcan thing and all that,'' he said. ``I \n     do very well with a Sears stove. I'm always bargain hunting; \n     I could totally live on Social Security.'' Not counting his \n     fine wine collection or his contemporary art, perhaps--though \n     continuing the frugal theme, he insists the art is ``mostly \n     picked up at bargain-basement prices.''\n       The hunt for bargains is a testament to his mother's \n     influence. ``My parents were completely Depression people, \n     but we always ate well, even during the war,'' he said. ``My \n     mother scrounged around for bargains till the day she died.''\n       They even cooked their own wedding supper for 80--with the \n     help of a few relatives.\n       Talk of pig roasting and slaughter kept popping up during \n     dinner and was the last tale Podesta told before the guests \n     left. To earn money while attending law school at Georgetown, \n     he spent two years working at Turkey Run Farm in McLean, now \n     called the Claude Moore Colonial Farm, an 18th-century re-\n     creation.\n       He dressed in britches, a blousy linen shirt, floppy hat \n     and homemade shoes and learned how to butcher and roast a \n     pig.\n\n[[Page S8092]]\n\n       Standing in the kitchen and acting out his role, Podesta \n     explained: ``It's best to do the butchering at 4 a.m., \n     ``because pigs should be slaughtered when it is cool, and it \n     takes a long time to roast them. The pig is hauled on a \n     front-end loader in order to split and gut it. It's most \n     important to slow the pig down by shooting it between the \n     eyes so you can cut its throat. It makes the pig less ornery \n     and a whole lot more cooperative than if you just stick a \n     knife in its throat.''\n       In homage to these skills, Podesta used to have a picture \n     of a pig on a spit as his screen saver, but his staffers made \n     him get rid of it, because he said: ``They couldn't stand \n     looking into the pig's eyes during meetings.''\n       The powerful John Podesta does not always get his way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/24/senate-section/article/S8092-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     COMMENDING ROBERT DALLAS PRICE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, an American's success can be measured in \nlarge part on how he or she helps others. This year, the Boys and Girls \nClubs of Central Wyoming have selected as their Man of the Year someone \nwho has made his life's mission serving others. There is a very special \nperson who has given voice to so many important causes in our State, \nand today I am proud to note this recognition of one of Wyoming's great \ncitizens--Bob Price.\n  The Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming plays a vitally important \nrole in our State. They serve all youth regardless of economic \ncircumstances. They continue to expand thanks to the generous support \nof the Tate Foundation, the McMurry Foundation, and the city of Casper. \nTheir inspiration and work has spread to adjacent counties. What is \nexceptional about the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming is their \ndedicated and loyal volunteer base. Their Person of the Year, Robert \nDallas Price, takes service to his community to a new level.\n  Bob Price grew up in Chicago and graduated from the College of Great \nFalls, MT. He started his successful business career in Casper, WY, \nclimbing through the ranks at KTWO Radio and Television to become \ngeneral manager. He chose to forgo television in favor of focusing on \nhis radio ventures and soon became vice president of GapWest \nBroadcasting--growing his family of radio stations to include six \nothers. It is hard to imagine that anyone in Wyoming does not recognize \nthe radio voice of Bob Price.\n  While Mr. Price has shown his exceptional achievement as a \nbusinessman in the operation and management of radio stations across \nWyoming, he has truly gained success through his hands-on involvement \nwith local civic groups that work to make a difference in our great \nState.\n  When Bob saw a community need, he worked to see that it was \naddressed. From Bob's vision over 25 years ago, the Wyoming Health \nFairs were created. Now, the Health Fairs serve over 51,000 people \nyearly in nearly every Wyoming community. By keeping costs low, the \nHealth Fairs facilitate participants' active involvement in prevention \nand early detection. Their motto, ``helping you help yourself . . . be \nwell'' is a model our entire Nation would be wise to follow.\n  Another important tradition in our lives also traces its roots back \nto Bob Price. The Jerry Lewis Muscular Dystrophy Telethon is a Labor \nDay tradition for families all across America. Bob knew that Wyoming \nfamilies would want to help too. He started Wyoming's MDA Telethon in \n1977 and to this day we all look forward to sharing our Labor Day \nweekend in support of this worthwhile organization.\n  Hardly a week goes by without Bob doing something to help others. He \nhas worked on behalf of the Youth Baseball League and Stage III \nCommunity Theater productions. He has dedicated years of service on the \nboards of successful organizations like the Wyoming Symphony Orchestra, \nCentral Wyoming Counseling Center, and Natrona County United Way, just \nto name a few. He launched the Beartrap Music Festival on Casper \nMountain 15 years ago, and his behind-the-scenes work ensures the event \nkeeps growing. He has lent his presence and voice to serve as emcee for \ncountless special events like the Wyoming Sports Hall of Fame Induction \nCeremony and Make-a-Wish campaigns.\n  Bob's willingness to reach out to so many different groups is a \nconstant reminder of his personal dedication to the value of community \ninvolvement. Through his engagement, Bob Price has driven our community \ntoward success and drawn our people together. His is a voice that we \nfrom Wyoming know and trust, and he has a spirit of service that \ninspires. The people of Wyoming today, as well as generations to come, \nwill feel the impact of his generous and selfless contributions to his \ncommunity and our world.\n  Mr. President, I am so proud to call Bob Price my friend. My life has \nbeen enriched because of our friendship. It is fitting and terrific \nthat the Boys and Girls Clubs of Central Wyoming have named him Man of \nthe Year, and I ask that my colleagues join me in sending our \ncongratulations to Bob for this well-deserved honor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/24/senate-section/article/S8092-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8092]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      COMMENDING ROBERT D. STEELE\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, today I honor the service of Robert \nD. Steele, dean of the College of Agricultural Sciences at the \nPennsylvania State University. After 12 years of serving the students, \nthe college and the university, Dr. Steele is stepping down as dean and \nrejoining the faculty in the Department of Food Science at Penn State.\n  As dean of the College of Agricultural Sciences, Dr. Steele was \nresponsible for the day-to-day operation of a college that is renowned \nfor its top-notch agricultural research. Dr. Steele administered an \nannual budget of over $175 million, managed a staff of over 2,000 \nemployees, and was a leader for approximately 2,500 students.\n  Bob Steele is dedicated to the students and the growth of the College \nof Agricultural Sciences. During his tenure he oversaw the \ntransformation and planned growth of the college. Dr. Steele has to his \ncredit many accomplishments as the college's dean, including major new \nadditions including the new Food Science and Forest Resources \nbuildings; implementation of new marketing and recruitment programs \nthat have led to increased undergraduate enrollment, reversing a trend \nof declining enrollments experienced by colleges of agriculture \nnationwide; steady growth in the research funds for the college; \naddition of key new research initiatives in chemical ecology, \nreproductive biology, and infectious disease and immunology, which have \nresulted in the addition of internationally renowned scientists to the \ncollege and enhanced graduate education; a renewed focus on \nenvironmental and energy issues, including the establishment of the \nEnvironment and Natural Resources Institute, the Biomass Energy Center, \nand the Agriculture and Environmental Science Policy Center; and \nsignificant progress in the planning, development, and fund-raising for \nThe Arboretum at Penn State.\n  Dr. Steele has taken his academic expertise outside the campus of \nPenn State serving on many committees that moved agriculture forward on \nthe national level. His passionate interest in the success of Penn \nState and other land grant universities is evident with his service on \nthe Special Think Tank Committee on the future of land grant colleges \nof agriculture partnership with the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Dr. \nSteele was also instrumental in providing valuable ideas and leadership \nfor the 2008 farm bill through his service on various national \ncommittees, such as the National Association of State Universities and \nLand-Grant Colleges Agriculture Deans.\n  Although Dr. Steele's dedication and talents will be missed in the \nadministration of the College of Agricultural Sciences at Penn State, \nthe students enrolled in that program will benefit from his return to \nthe classroom. I am certain that his expertise, knowledge, and \nexperiences will serve them well.\n  I congratulate Bob Steele on his outstanding achievements as dean and \nhis distinguished service to Penn State and the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania and his continued commitment to Pennsylvania's farm \nfamilies. I also personally thank him for his friendship and his \ninvaluable advice to me and my staff. I wish him all the best as he \nreturns to the classroom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/24/senate-section/article/S8092-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8092-S8093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to\n\n[[Page S8093]]\n\nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/24/senate-section/article/S8093-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting a \nnomination which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/24/senate-section/article/S8093-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8093]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:45 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that pursuant to \nsection 5 of the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act of 2009 (Public Law \n111-21), and the order of the House of January 6, 2009, the Speaker and \nthe Majority Leader of the Senate jointly appoint the following \nindividual to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission: Mr. Phil \nAngelides of Sacramento, California, Chairman.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 1516. A bill to secure the Federal voting rights of persons who \nhave been released from incarceration; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in a democracy, no right is more \nimportant than the right to vote; in our democracy, no right has been \nso dearly won. This country was founded on the idea that a just \ngovernment derives its power from the consent of the governed, a \nprinciple codified in the very first words of our Constitution: ``We \nthe People of the United States.'' From the Civil War through the \nwomen's suffrage movement through the Voting Rights Act of 1965 through \nthe 26th Amendment, the continuing expansion of the franchise, a \nbroadening of who ``we the people'' are, is one of our great American \nnarratives.\n  Today I introduce the Democracy Restoration Act of 2009. This bill \nwill guarantee that citizens who are not incarcerated have the right to \nvote in Federal elections. I am proud that the junior Senator from \nRhode Island, Sen. Whitehouse, and the junior Senator from Maryland, \nSen. Cardin, have agreed to cosponsor this legislation.\n  Once, only wealthy white men could vote. Once, African Americans, \nethnic minorities, women, young people, the poor, and the uneducated \nwere all excluded. Today, we look back at those times and wonder how \nour country could have denied its citizens such a fundamental right for \nso long. Yet today, we continue to disenfranchise an estimated four \nmillion of our fellow citizens who were convicted of felonies but are \nno longer in prison. Two million of these people have fully served \ntheir sentences, and the other two million are on probation, parole, or \nsupervised release. These people are living and working in the \ncommunity, paying taxes, and contributing to society. But they cannot \nvote.\n  At this time, 10 States still strip some people who have entirely \ncompleted their sentences--who have paid their debt to society--of \ntheir right to vote. Some 35 States deny the vote to people on parole, \nand 30 of those states also deny the vote to people on probation. I \nbelieve that the practice of stripping our fellow citizens of their \nvoting rights is un-American. It weakens our democracy. It is an \nanachronism, one of the last vestiges of a medieval jurisprudence that \ndeclared convicted criminals to be outlaws, irrevocably expelled from \nsociety. This principle was called ``civil death.''\n  Back then, in the despotisms of medieval Europe, it was reserved for \nthe worst crimes. Yet today, here, in the greatest democracy in the \nworld, we continue to sentence 4 million people--people who have served \ntheir time, people who are contributing members of society--to civil \ndeath.\n  One might ask how something as undemocratic as civil death could have \nsurvived to the present day. Unfortunately the practice of \ndisenfranchising people with felony convictions has an explicitly \nracist history. Like the grandfather clause, the literacy test, and the \npoll tax, civil death became a tool of Jim Crow.\n  Across the country, thirteen percent of African-American men are \ndisenfranchised because of a felony conviction. In 14 States, civil \ndeath provisions have stripped more than ten percent of the entire \nAfrican-American voting-age population of the right to vote. In 4 \nStates, civil death provisions disenfranchise more than 20 percent of \neligible African-American voters.\n  The architects of Jim Crow would be proud of their handiwork, and how \nit has lasted long after the rest of their evil system was dismantled. \nThe rest of us should be ashamed, and yes, outraged. If we believe in \nredemption, we should be outraged. Because civil death has denied 4 \nmillion Americans a chance at redemption. If we believe in progress, we \nshould be outraged. Because civil death keeps this country chained to \nthe worst moments of our past. If we believe in democracy, we should be \noutraged. Because civil death strikes at the heart of our democracy.\n  There is a growing movement across the country to expand the \nfranchise and restore voting rights to people coming out of prison and \nreentering the community. In the last decade, 16 states have reformed \ntheir laws to expand the franchise or ease voting rights restoration \nprocedures. This bill continues that movement. It provides\n\n[[Page S8096]]\n\nthat the right to vote for candidates for Federal office shall not be \ndenied or abridged because a person has been convicted of a crime \nunless that person is actually in prison serving a felony sentence. It \ngives the Attorney General of the U.S. the power to obtain declaratory \nor injunctive relief to enforce that right. It gives a person whose \nrights are being violated a right to go to court to get relief.\n  The bill also requires federal and state officials to notify \nindividuals of their right to vote once their sentences have been \nserved. This is an important part of the bill, given the long history \nof these civil death provisions. Even after this bill passes, many ex-\noffenders may not know their rights, and we should take affirmative \nsteps to make sure that they do.\n  Upon signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, President Johnson said:\n\n       The vote is the most powerful instrument ever devised by \n     man for breaking down injustice and destroying the terrible \n     walls which imprison men because they are different from \n     other men.\n\n  When prisoners return to their communities after serving their \nsentences, we expect and hope that they will reintegrate themselves \ninto society as productive citizens. Yet, without the right to vote, \nrehabilitated felons are already a step behind in regaining a sense of \ncivic responsibility and commitment to their communities. If our \ncountry wants ex-offenders to succeed at becoming better citizens, who \nboth abide by the law and act as responsible individuals, then we need \nto restore this most fundamental right. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nincluded in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1516\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Democracy Restoration Act of \n     2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right to vote is the most basic constitutive act of \n     citizenship. Regaining the right to vote reintegrates \n     offenders into free society, helping to enhance public \n     safety.\n       (2) Article I, section 4 of the Constitution of the United \n     States grants Congress ultimate supervisory power over \n     Federal elections, an authority which has repeatedly been \n     upheld by the Supreme Court.\n       (3) Basic constitutional principles of fairness and equal \n     protection require an equal opportunity for Americans to vote \n     in Federal elections. The right to vote may not be abridged \n     or denied by the United States or by any State on account of \n     race, color, gender or previous condition of servitude. The \n     14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th Amendments to the \n     Constitution empower Congress to enact measures to protect \n     the right to vote in Federal elections.\n       (4) There are three areas where discrepancies in State laws \n     regarding felony convictions lead to unfairness in Federal \n     elections--\n       (A) there is no uniform standard for voting in Federal \n     elections which leads to an unfair disparity and unequal \n     participation in Federal elections based solely on where a \n     person lives;\n       (B) laws governing the restoration of voting rights after a \n     felony conviction vary throughout the country and persons in \n     some States can easily regain their voting rights while in \n     other States persons effectively lose their right to vote \n     permanently; and\n       (C) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact \n     racial and ethnic minorities.\n       (5) Disenfranchisement results from varying State laws that \n     restrict voting while under some form of criminal justice \n     supervision or after the completion of a felony sentence in \n     some States. Two States do not disenfranchise felons at all \n     (Maine and Vermont). Forty-eight States and the District of \n     Columbia have disenfranchisement laws that deprive convicted \n     offenders of the right to vote while they are in prison. In \n     thirty-five States, convicted offenders may not vote while \n     they are on parole and thirty of these States disenfranchise \n     felony probationers as well. In ten States, a conviction can \n     result in lifetime disenfranchisement.\n       (6) An estimated 5,300,000 Americans, or about one in \n     forty-one adults, currently cannot vote as a result of a \n     felony conviction. Nearly 4,000,000 (74 percent) of the \n     5,300,000 disqualified voters are not in prison, but are on \n     probation or parole, or are ex-offenders. Approximately \n     2,000,000 of those individuals are individuals who have \n     completed their entire sentence, including probation and \n     parole, yet remain disenfranchised.\n       (7) In those States that disenfranchise ex-offenders, the \n     right to vote can be regained in theory, but in practice this \n     possibility is often granted in a nonuniform and potentially \n     discriminatory manner. Offenders must either obtain a pardon \n     or order from the Governor or action by the parole or pardon \n     board, depending on the offense and State. Offenders \n     convicted of a Federal offense often have additional barriers \n     to regaining voting rights.\n       (8) State disenfranchisement laws disproportionately impact \n     racial and ethnic minorities. Eight percent of the African \n     American population, or 2,000,000 African Americans, are \n     disenfranchised. Given current rates of incarceration, \n     approximately one in three of the next generation of African \n     American men will be disenfranchised at some point during \n     their lifetime. Hispanic citizens are also disproportionately \n     disenfranchised based upon their disproportionate \n     representation in the criminal justice system.\n       (9) Disenfranchising citizens who have been convicted of a \n     felony offense and who are living and working in the \n     community serves no compelling State interest and hinders \n     their rehabilitation and reintegration into society.\n       (10) State disenfranchisement laws can suppress electoral \n     participation among eligible voters by discouraging voting \n     among family and community members of disenfranchised \n     persons. Future electoral participation by the children of \n     disenfranchised parents may be impacted as well.\n       (11) The United States is the only Western democracy that \n     permits the permanent denial of voting rights to individuals \n     with felony convictions.\n\n     SEC. 3. RIGHTS OF CITIZENS.\n\n       The right of an individual who is a citizen of the United \n     States to vote in any election for Federal office shall not \n     be denied or abridged because that individual has been \n     convicted of a criminal offense unless such individual is \n     serving a felony sentence in a correctional institution or \n     facility at the time of the election.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 224\n\n       Whereas the historical ties between the United States and \n     the Republic of Indonesia began during the struggle of the \n     people of Indonesia to become independent and the early years \n     of independence beginning in 1945;\n       Whereas the constitutionally required ``free and active'' \n     foreign policy of Indonesia resulted in a close relationship \n     with the United States, and this relationship reflects \n     growing connections between the developed and the developing \n     world;\n       Whereas, following the 1998 financial crisis of Asia, \n     Indonesia instituted numerous democratic reforms, including \n     amending the constitution of Indonesia in order to become \n     more democratic and transparent, holding the first direct \n     presidential election in 2004, and direct, nationwide local \n     elections beginning in 2006, and giving the judicial branch \n     independent administrative and financial responsibility for \n     all courts in 2004;\n       Whereas the administration of President Susilo Bambang \n     Yudhoyono, the first President of Indonesia elected directly \n     by the people, is strongly committed to strengthening \n     democracy and remains focused on developing good governance \n     and promoting and protecting human rights, civil liberties, a \n     free press, and a vibrant civil society;\n       Whereas the Government of Indonesia continues to reform the \n     military in accordance with internationally accepted \n     democratic principles;\n       Whereas Indonesia signed a peace agreement in August 2005 \n     that ended the conflict in Aceh, met its obligations under \n     the agreement, oversaw the return of normalcy to Aceh, and \n     held free, transparent, and peaceful elections for local \n     government leaders in December 2006;\n       Whereas the Government of Indonesia continues to work to \n     peacefully resolve other internal conflicts, including Papua, \n     with concern for the welfare and security of the entire \n     population;\n       Whereas, following the recovery of economic and political \n     stability in Indonesia after the 1998 Asian financial crisis, \n     the country regained a pivotal role in the Association of \n     Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and continues to work toward \n     a secure, peaceful, and vibrant Southeast Asia, particularly \n     by successfully proposing to establish the ASEAN Security \n     Community, the ASEAN Economic Community, and the ASEAN Socio-\n     cultural Community;\n       Whereas the Government and the people of Indonesia endured \n     several terrorist bombings, have shown resilience in the \n     fight against international terrorism by apprehending and \n     bringing to justice numerous perpetrators, and remain open to \n     international cooperation in this area;\n       Whereas the Government of Indonesia, together with the \n     Governments of Malaysia and Singapore as fellow littoral \n     states and user-countries, maintains and is further \n     strengthening efforts to secure the important international \n     shipping lane in the Malacca Strait;\n       Whereas, as shown in international fora, the Government of \n     Indonesia remains committed to addressing the problems \n     related to the control of the spread of weapons of mass \n     destruction;\n       Whereas the Government of Indonesia deployed a military \n     battalion to support the peacekeeping operations of the \n     United Nations Interim Force In Lebanon, and as the largest \n     Muslim democracy in the world, has helped facilitate dialogue \n     among many Islamic factions in the Middle East; and\n       Whereas, though the Government of Indonesia has shown \n     significant progress in the areas of democracy, good \n     governance, human rights, and counterterrorism, there remains\n\n[[Page S8098]]\n\n     much to be done and many reforms yet to be implemented: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the progress made by the Government of \n     Indonesia in promoting democracy;\n       (2) expresses ongoing support for further democratic reform \n     in Indonesia and the efforts of the Government and the people \n     of Indonesia toward developing good governance;\n       (3) encourages the Government and the people of Indonesia \n     to continue working to promote and protect human rights, \n     civil liberties, a free press, and a strong civil society in \n     Indonesia; and\n       (4) encourages the President, the Secretary of State, and \n     other officials of the United States Government to continue \n     assisting the Government of Indonesia in promoting democracy \n     and ensuring the liberty and welfare of the people of \n     Indonesia.\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to submit a \nresolution with Senator Inouye recognizing one of the most important, \nbut often overlooked, nations in the world: Indonesia.\n  Just this past week, Secretary of State Clinton, our former \ncolleague, journeyed to a meeting of the Southeast Asia nations in \nThailand and pledged greater and increased American involvement in \nsupport of the region. I applaud her. She is definitely on the right \ntrack.\n  Many Americans are not aware of the fact, but Indonesia is the third \nlargest democracy in the world after India and the United States.\n  Early this month, I came to the Senate floor to recognize and \ncelebrate yet another democratic milestone in Indonesia: the reelection \nof President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, known for obvious reasons as \nSBY. His victory will quicken the pace of democratic reform that has \nbeen keeping Indonesia moving in the right direction.\n  SBY's first tenure as President was a success. His choice to select \nBoediono as his running mate has raised expectations of accelerated \nreform for a second term in office. The duo has campaigned on a ticket \nof clean governance and reforms to promote broad-based economic growth.\n  In addition to the democratic politics, Indonesia's religious \nleanings also trend very positive. By and large, Indonesians reject \nviolent brands of Islam. The Nation was founded on the principles of \nwhat is known as Pancasilla, or respect for religious and cultural \ndiversity and the desire to create a pluralistic society, and as a \ncountry with the largest Muslim population in the world, Indonesians \nare also proud to showcase that Islam and democracy are compatible and \ncan work together.\n  But despite the moderate, peaceful-loving population of Indonesia, \ngroups such as Jemaah Islamiyah and Abu Sayyaf are still seeking to \nspread Islamist terror and their extremist ideologies across Indonesia \nand Southeast Asia, often resulting in violence and death. The world \nwas shocked and saddened over the most recent terrorist violence just \nthis past week. Early on the morning of July 17, suicide bombers \nattacked two hotels in Jakarta, Indonesia, killing innocent people and \ninjuring scores more.\n  The latest terrorist attack should be a wake-up call. The twin \nsuicide attacks in Jakarta last Friday underscore the perils of our \nNation continuing to ignore this nation and this region. The dangers of \ncontinuing down our current path are very real. By overlooking this \nregion, Southeast Asia could become a breeding ground of terrorist \nactivity for generations and for future Americans to deal with. If left \nignored, Southeast Asia and Indonesia will be the next front in the war \non terror.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. It is critical that the United States \nact now, before violent extremists gain traction in their quest to \nspread their fundamentalist ideologies enforced by violent terrorist \nacts across Indonesia and other countries in Southeast Asia.\n  This effort requires first that the United States do more than give \nlipservice to Southeast Asian countries about our strong partnership. \nYes, counterterrorism cooperation is very important, but for many \nnations in Southeast Asia, they see this partnership as, once again, \nthe United States only asking for self-serving help, coming when we see \na danger to our country but not coming to find out what their needs and \nwhat their desires are. If we want nations in Southeast Asia to be \nstrong partners in the war on terror, we must also be willing to extend \na hand of friendship in other ways, assuring that they are strong, \nstable democracies with economic strength and good jobs and progress \nfor their people.\n  The first thing we must do is increase trade among our nations. \nSoutheast Asia, including nations such as Indonesia, Thailand, \nSingapore, Malaysia, the Philippines, and many smaller countries, \nrepresents our fifth largest trading partner. While this will help \ncreate economic opportunities in our own Nation to export to them, it \nwill also help many poverty-stricken people in Southeast Asia as we buy \nfrom them, as we invest there, as we create businesses that will \ngenerate small and medium enterprises to fill the needs of those \nbusinesses and create locally owned and controlled entrepreneurships \nthat can benefit their country in many ways.\n  People who are hungry, without a job, or maybe even a roof over their \nhead, are particularly vulnerable to ideologies that promise a better \nway of life, whether or not those ideologies deliver. The United States \nmust realize that before a person can choose his politics, he has to \nhave enough to eat and a stable, secure community in which to live.\n  That is the simple truth behind Smart Power--a term I use to describe \nthe combination of military might where necessary with diplomatic \nefforts, educational exchanges, economic development, and more personal \ninteraction. We need this in Southeast Asia. I believe Smart Power is \nan effective way to fight radical ideologies that use terrorist attacks \nagainst their own government and freedom-loving people elsewhere.\n  This was recognized by General Petraeus and by President Bush when \nthe President authorized him to institute the counterinsurgency \nstrategy in Iraq, which means not only do we go in and clear an area of \nal-Qaida, but we stay there to make sure al-Qaida doesn't come back, \nand we then work with those provinces, with those areas, with the local \ngovernments and the local leaders, to build the infrastructure they \nneed to help them get the health care to do things that are important \nto build a strong community.\n  In Al-Anbar, for example, a Sunni region that had been a major \nconcern for the United States, one of the first things the Marines did \nin 2007 was rebuild the Sunnis' Blue Mosque, one of the most important \nmosques in the region.\n  This is the kind of effort we need to make in those areas where we \nare not actively fighting. We have the military might to support those \ncountries in their battle against terrorist activities when they pick \nup, to fight against piracy that might occur off their shores.\n  As vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, a member of \nthe Defense and State Foreign Operations Committee, I am working with \nmy colleagues to ensure that Congress provides the resources and policy \ninitiatives needed to expand the use of Smart Power.\n  For instance, we must increase the number of Peace Corps volunteers \nand Foreign Service officers. We must encourage more young Americans to \nvolunteer to serve in that region, more businesspeople to visit there \nand seek opportunities where they can help those countries and help us \nat the same time. It sounds simple, but I believe by putting more \nAmerican sandals and sneakers on the ground, we can avoid sending in \nAmerican combat troops later.\n  I saw firsthand the payoff of Smart Power when several Southeast \nAsian nations--particularly Indonesia--were devastated by the tsunami \nin December of 2004. The month after that disaster, I traveled to \nSoutheast Asia with representatives of the U.S. Government, Deputy \nSecretary of Defense, our Ambassador. We visited the tsunami-ravaged \nareas and met with representatives from the relief organizations. We \nsaw the tremendous benefits that the volunteer NGOs--nongovernment \norganizations--and the American military brought by bringing fresh \nwater, bringing medical supplies, bringing food to the region, and \nhelping to clear areas. Our military and volunteers from our embassy \nand elsewhere in the region helped avert what I think would have been \ntens of thousands more deaths.\n  We met with the Indonesian Government officials, and they were \nabsolutely deeply grateful for our help in providing clean drinking \nwater and\n\n[[Page S8099]]\n\nfood, emergency evacuations, medical help, and rebuilding. This kind of \nassistance the United States provided in that short time created an \nunmatched outpouring of goodwill for America and an appreciation from \nother countries who helped, such as Singapore and Australia.\n  Unfortunately, after the flood waters receded, so, too, did America's \nSmart Power engagement in the region. The recent attacks of terrorist \norganizations--probably Jemaah Islamiyah in Jakarta--should be a wake-\nup call that it is past time to reinvest in the region and quit \nignoring the dangers of failing to do so.\n  President Obama, in condemning the terrorists' actions, highlighted \nthis danger when he said:\n\n       These attacks make it clear that extremists remain \n     committed to murdering innocent men, women and children of \n     any faith in all countries.\n\n  The President got it absolutely right. The war against terror is far \nfrom over, and the battles are not confined to the Middle East. \nFreedom-loving nations must continue to fight terrorists not just in \nthe border regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan, but also in the jungles \nand countless islands of Southeast Asia.\n  More than just a call to arms, however, these attacks should serve as \na deadly reminder that the war against extremism and insurgency cannot \nbe won by military might alone. Many top military and intelligence \nleaders say military action is no more than 20 percent--or maybe even \n10 percent--of the effort we should expand to ensure stability in \ngovernments that are friendly.\n  In order to be truly successful, the United States must focus the \nweight of the effort on the ideological front, reaching would-be \nterrorists before they turn violent. Today I have a resolution that \nrecognizes the importance of Indonesia, but it is just a small and \nsymbolic step. We must do more.\n  I hope my colleagues will think about this region and about the \npoints I have made. America must wise up and make Smart Power \ninitiatives a cornerstone of our foreign policy and our efforts to \ncombat terrorism, extremism, deadly murder, and attacks around the \nworld, in our country, and elsewhere.
