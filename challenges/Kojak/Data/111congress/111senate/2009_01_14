Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, at 10:30, I believe, this morning, we are \ngoing to vote on cloture on this lands package. I wish to take a few \nminutes--and my colleague has been more than gracious to me in terms of \nallowing time--to discuss this.\n  Our country is at a very difficult time in terms of our economic \ngrowth but, more importantly, in terms of the number of people who are \nsuffering. We have before us a 1,300-page bill that we will hear has \nbeen looked at for a year and a half--the proponents of which, I am \nsure, have--that is nonamendable and that we will spend somewhere \nbetween $10 billion and $12 billion, when we think about the long-term \nconsequences of the bill.\n  The questions I have before the body on this bill are, No. 1, is this \ntruly a priority for us at the times we are in, considering the nature \nof the great difficulties that face this country; and No. 2, is it a \npriority for us in terms of the things that are out there that we can \nreally be making a difference on today that we refuse to make a \ndifference on.\n  Mr. President, let me highlight that for you for a minute.\n  This last year we put out a report on the Justice Department that \nshowed very clearly $10 billion a year in waste. I gave a speech on the \nfloor this last summer outlining $380 billion in waste. We know we have \nat least $50 billion a year in waste at the Pentagon. We know we have \nat least $80 billion worth of fraud a year in Medicare. The first thing \nwe do in this Congress is create $10 billion more of spending. So we \nare not attacking the structural problems that actually face our \nGovernment, but, more importantly, we are not attacking the biggest \nproblem. The biggest problem is the American people do not have \nconfidence in us as an institution to do what they do every day, and \nthat is to set priorities.\n  Every family out there today is going through a process, much like I \ndid at the end of the year, seeing how much is going to come in, what \nthey are absolutely obligated to spend, and if there is any left over, \nwhere is the priority at which they do that. We are in reverse of that \nprocess. We are saying we are not even going to look at that process, \nwe are not going to look at the $380 billion worth of waste, we are not \ngoing to look at the programs.\n  I had a visit with Mr. Duncan, who is the new nominee for the \nEducation Department. To his surprise, he was blown over by the fact \nthat there are more educational programs outside the Department of \nEducation than there are inside. Yet we refuse to work on those very \nhard things that will actually make a large difference in the outcome.\n  We are going to be voting yet this week on putting another $350 \nbillion in the hands of the Treasury Department to enhance liquidity. \nBut with that, we hear from Larry Summers that we are going to direct \nthe money to whoever needs to borrow rather than whoever needs to try \nto be liquid in terms of loaning money. We have it exactly backwards.\n  Before us is a bill that will markedly undermine attempts at energy \nindependence, will add to the 107 million acres of land that presently \nare wilderness areas which will make them truly, in all respects, \nsignificantly difficult to ever tap any natural resources, regardless \nof whether we can do that without any impact on the environment.\n  It is interesting to note that the actual number of acres of land \nthat are in wilderness areas is greater than the total developed land \nin this country, which is 106 million acres.\n  We are going to take another 2.2 million acres and move them away \nfrom any possibility. Yet nowhere in our thought was--whether we were \nmanipulated by supply-demand constraints or we were manipulated by \nfutures markets--the fact that oil reached an all-time high and we were \npaying $4 for a gallon of gasoline. Completely outside the scope of \nthis bill was any consideration that we might want to preserve our \nability to have access to future oil reserves--even the disputed debate \non the Wyoming Range on whether we are going to have access to, the \nlowest estimate, 5 million barrels of oil and maybe 3 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas, all the way up to 300 million barrels of oil and \n15 trillion cubic feet of natural gas.\n  My complaint and my reason for voting no on cloture is really \nfourfold. No. 1 is it is not a priority what we are doing. No. 2 is our \nproblems with demand that we would be doing something different than \nwhat we do in this bill. No. 3 is the process which has not allowed for \nsignificant amendments of our choice on this bill is flawed. And, \nfinally, No. 4, it does not go towards building back the trust in the \nCongress to actually do things in order of priority that are going to \nmake a difference for this country.\n  I recognize that I am in the minority opinion of that view in this \nbody. What I don't recognize and what I know is true is that I am not \nin the minority opinion of the people in this country.\n  We are about to vote on a 1,300-page bill that will not be amended, \nthat very few have read, that very few have studied hard as to the \nconsequences it will have on our energy dependency, and we are going to \npass it. It is probably going to be sent to the new President, and he \nis probably going to sign it, which gives me great cause for worry \nbecause my friend, the President-elect, ran on hope and a promise of \nchange. I don't see any change in the Senate.\n  My hope is somewhat diminished because I don't see us as a body \ncollectively addressing the big problems that face us as a nation. \nThere is no question that many of the States that have programs in this \nbill have wanted them for a long time, and they are going to be happy \nwith them, the fact that we do all these things for these various \norganizations to create four new extensions to national parks at a time \nwhen there is a $9 billion backlog on the national parks we have today.\n  But I wonder if getting something parochially is worth putting the \ncountry at risk, and not just at risk with this bill but the risk of \nprocess, the risk that we will continue to plow ahead on that which \nwill not make an ultimate difference in the security, the long-term \nfinancial outlook of this country.\n  Anybody who reads this bill will say: Why are you doing certain \nthings now? Why would you authorize the spending of $3.5 million for a \nbirthday party in Florida? Why would you enhance botanical gardens now \nwhen we are going to run a $1.8 trillion deficit this year? Why would \nyou build a new orchid garden for the Smithsonian now when we have so \nmany other issues that are so far more important that we should be \ndoing? Why in light of the greatest drought California has ever seen \nwould we disrupt the water supply to 10,000 farmers, creating more than \n$2 billion worth of GDP? Why would we do that? Why would we do that \nnow? I don't understand why we are doing it now.\n  I understand the politics of it. I understand the way the Senate \nworks. I understand the reason Members want to get things done for \ntheir States. But right now in our Nation, we ought to be thinking \nabout the good of the Nation as a whole, the long-term good of the \nNation as a whole.\n  Confidence--confidence--is what Americans don't have today. They are \nnot confident in their future. They are\n\n[[Page S355]]\n\nnot confident in the economics of maintaining their family, their \nlifestyle. As a matter of fact, the confidence is so low that we are \ngoing to have a savings rate that we have not seen in 40 years in this \ncountry because people are saving for a rainy day, and they think the \nrainy day is here. What we are doing is destroying what confidence is \nleft.\n  Our President-elect's job over the next year, more than anything, is \nto restore hope and confidence in the future of this country. I believe \nwe fall far short by bringing this bill to the Senate at this time in \nthis way without an ability to amend it in significant ways that \npreserve chances for energy exploration, that take the silliness out of \nit--as I mentioned earlier, the 45 earmarks that are in this bill--and \ndo not address the priorities of which we should be authorizing the \nspending of money in this bill. It is wasteful. It does not meet common \nsense. It destroys what little credibility we have left, and in the \nlong run it diminishes the promise of change and hope for which our new \nPresident-elect stands.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 18\\1/2\\ minutes remaining: \n15 minutes on the Democratic side, 3\\1/2\\ minutes on the Republican \nside.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, shortly, the Senate will vote on cloture \non S. 22, the Omnibus Public Lands Act. I obviously support going ahead \nwith cloture on that legislation. Let me explain briefly why and then \nrespond to a few of the points that my colleague from Oklahoma made.\n  Yesterday, we did spend several hours trying to determine if it was \npossible to develop a unanimous consent agreement so that we could have \na couple of votes today on amendments that the Senator from Oklahoma \nhas proposed. Despite good-faith efforts on both sides, we were unable \nto reach that agreement. I appreciate Senator Coburn's willingness to \nwork with us. Also, I appreciate Senator Murkowski's involvement in \nthose discussions.\n  I have spoken at some length earlier this week about this package of \nbills, so I will not repeat the details that I talked about before, but \nI would like to briefly summarize the bill.\n  This legislation contains over 160 separate public land and related \nbills, with roughly an equal number of provisions sponsored by \nDemocratic and Republican Senators. Apart from the bipartisan makeup of \nthe package, almost all of these bills were considered in the Energy \nCommittee and were reported in our committee after amendment. I should \nemphasize that there was an extensive process of amending these bills \nin our committee. They were reported after amendments by unanimous \nvote. We have made some further modifications to some of these bills in \nan effort to address any remaining concerns.\n  S. 22 incorporates 15 new wilderness bills, which combined will \nresult in over 2 million acres of new additions to the National \nWilderness Preservation System in nine different States. It will add \nover 1,000 miles of new rivers to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers \nSystem. It will add over 2,800 miles to the National Trails System. It \nwill add three new units to the National Park System and enlarge the \nboundary of over a dozen existing parks. It will designate a new \nnational monument, three new national conservation areas, and \nlegislatively establish the Bureau of Land Management's National \nLandscape Conservation System.\n  The bill will protect over 1 million acres of the Wyoming Range for \nhunting, fishing, and other recreational uses. And to help reduce the \ncatastrophic fire problems of recent years, it authorizes a new forest \nlandscape restoration program.\n  In addition to the public land components of the package, the bill \nwill ratify three extremely important water rights settlements. Those \nare located in California, in Nevada, and in my home State of New \nMexico. The legislation related to those settlements will end literally \ndecades of litigation. And it includes many other land and water \nauthorizations to help local communities throughout the country but \nespecially in Western States.\n\n  Despite the scope of the conservation measures included in the \npackage, it is not, as some have suggested, inconsistent with our \nnational energy policy. I heard my colleague indicate that in his view \nthis legislation in total would--I believe the phrase he used was--\nmarkedly undermine energy independence in our country. I strongly \ndisagree with that characterization of what we are doing. Almost none \nof the wilderness areas designated by the bill are in areas with \nsignificant energy development potential.\n  As to the one area which does contain energy potential--that is the \nWyoming Range Legacy Act legislation--let me give some details as to \nthat legislation. The legislation seeks to protect from future oil and \ngas activity lands in the Wyoming Range not currently under lease. As \nof November 6, 2007, there were 18 oil and gas leases within the \nproposed withdrawal area. Those leases cover a total of 70,600 acres. \nThese leases represent valid existing rights and will not in any way be \ncanceled by this legislation. The leases are primarily located in the \narea that has some of the most significant mineral development \npotential.\n  In addition to those oil and gas leases, there are 35 oil and gas \nleases covering 44,977 acres that have either been issued and are under \nprotest or have been sold but not yet issued. This bill, again, does \nnot in any way cancel or impede development of those leases.\n  Under the estimated U.S. Geological Survey's estimates, they believe \nthe natural gas potential for the area is 1.5 trillion cubic feet, and \nthe mean oil potential is 5 million barrels. Relative to other known \ngas reserves in the area, the numbers are smaller in both size and \nscope.\n  There are approximately 4,300 producing oil and gas wells in the \nthree counties that are touched by this legislation. There is a \nproposal being considered for up to 4,339 additional wells that would \nnot be affected by the legislation. There is production currently \ntaking place nearby that will not be stopped by the provisions here.\n  We had the Congressional Budget Office look at this, and they have \nissued a statement which I will quote for information of Senators. When \nthey refer to S. 2229, that is the legislation that is incorporated in \nthis bill. They say:\n\n       Based on information from the U.S. Forest Service and the \n     Bureau of Land Management, CBO estimates that enacting S. \n     2229 would have no significant effect on the Federal budget. \n     Under the current law, CBO anticipates that neither agency \n     will offer to sell mineral leases or other interests in land \n     that would be withdrawn by the bill within the next 10 years; \n     hence, we anticipate no foregone receipts from sales of such \n     interests over the period of 2009 through 2018.\n\n  So as I was saying, the legislation, in my view, does not markedly \nundermine energy independence, it does very little to impede our \nability to develop oil and gas resources, and this is a piece of \nlegislation that is strongly supported by the Senators from Wyoming, it \nis strongly supported by the Governor of Wyoming, and it is legislation \nthat I myself support as well.\n  Several Senators have previously spoken about the many years they \nhave spent working on some of the provisions in this package. \nEspecially in the West, there are few issues as complex and difficult \nto resolve as land and water use issues. Given the years of work \ninvested by interested citizens and communities, by State and local \ngovernments and by individual Senate delegations to address and resolve \nthe many competing issues, it is time to bring these issues to closure. \nThere has been an extensive public process for the individual bills \ncontained in this package, both locally and in the Congress, with \nalmost all receiving the unanimous approval of our committee, the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, which has jurisdiction over \nthese matters.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote to invoke cloture \nthis morning on S. 22, the Omnibus Public Lands Act, so we can advance \nthis long overdo legislation forward for Senate approval.\n  Mr. President, how much time remains for the majority?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority has a little over 4 \nminutes and the minority has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, at this time, I yield the remainder of \nmy\n\n[[Page S356]]\n\ntime to my colleague, the Senator from Alaska, Ms. Murkowski.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise this morning to support the \nstatement of my colleague, the chairman of the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources, as it relates to this legislation, the Omnibus \nPublic Lands Act of 2009.\n  There has been a great deal of discussion in these past several days \nabout priorities and whether the bills in this package actually reflect \nmy particular priorities. Well, in fact, there are some priorities I do \nhave. But are all these bills, all 160 of them, my priorities? No.\n  There has been a great deal of discussion about process. The fact \nthat we have 160 bills packaged into an omnibus bill is cumbersome. Is \nthis a process I would have chosen? Probably not.\n  Am I concerned about the ability of the minority to offer amendments? \nAbsolutely. Absolutely. My colleague from Oklahoma has made a very \nstrong case for why, in this deliberative process, in this deliberative \nbody we should not be allowed to move forward and advance amendments. \nAs I understand it, there were discussions yesterday that, hopefully, \nwould have allowed a time agreement for consideration of amendments, \nbut that didn't work out and that is unfortunate. But I do not believe \nthe bills we see in this package result from an absence of careful \nconsideration and process.\n  As the chairman has noted, the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources has had almost 2 years' worth of hearings, negotiations, and \nbusiness meetings on these very bills we have in front of us. There has \nbeen that thoughtful committee process, there has been that review, \nthere has been the input from the local level all the way to the top. \nThe public lands bills in this package were considered and they were \namended with the very concerns in mind that my fellow Senators are \nexpressing today.\n  The concerns are most appropriate: How do we get a fair deal for the \nAmerican taxpayer? How do we ensure we are not locking up land that \ncould help improve our Nation's energy security? Are the lands we are \nprotecting deserving of this? We can find that balance and we can \nmaximize the development of our domestic energy resources while \nprotecting our Nation's other natural resources.\n  So why so many bills in here? Well, for those of us in the West, so \nmuch of our land is federally owned that simple transactions often take \nliterally an act of Congress. This bill transfers 23,226 acres of \nFederal lands to private and State sectors through conveyance, exchange \nor sale, and does so in a way that provides full value for the American \ntaxpayer. The bill does authorize the expenditure of funds, but each of \nthose is dependent on future appropriations that depend on the \noversight of the Appropriations Committee and the Presidential budget \nrequest.\n  This process is not my preferred method for passing legislation. I \nwish to work with my colleague from Oklahoma and with others who have \nexpressed their concerns about how we move public lands bills. I think \nworking with the chairman we can improve this process, and we should. \nBut I believe that overall what we have before us today is a package \nthat will improve our Nation's management of its public lands and parks \nand will be a long-term benefit to our Nation. Therefore, I \nrespectfully request my fellow Members' support for passage of this \nlegislation and on this cloture motion we have before us this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me clear up the data on the Wyoming Range. It is said \nthere is only 1.5 trillion cubic feet, according to the U.S. Geologic \nSurvey. But you have not read the complete report. The letter is new. \nThe data used by them is older than the data used by the Bureau of Land \nManagement. It wasn't based on the latest topographic and geological \nstudies. That is the first problem.\n  The second thing they say in their report is they lacked an official \nmap. So it is their best guess, not based on science, not based on \nknown data.\n  Finally, they only approximated for the following reasons: They only \nhad a general outline of the area and they assumed a homogenous \ndistribution of oil and gas resources across the entire area.\n  Well, that is a no report. The latest report to come from the \nNational Petroleum Council, which is subcontracted to BLM, estimates, \nat a minimum, 12 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. So where you get \nyour information and what it says and what it is based on is very \nimportant.\n  So we have had all this defense that this is not going to impact \nenergy based on an erroneous report based on erroneous assumptions by \nthe National Geologic Survey, when all you have to do is read their own \nsurvey and that is the footnote to it, which says we didn't have the \ninformation, we didn't have the map, so we used an average, not what \nwas there. Having known that the first three gas wells drilled there \nhad to be capped because we didn't have the technology to take the \nflow, it was so great, the estimates by the USGS are so far out of \nrange it is laughable. As far as 10 years counting whether it is going \nto have any impact on our energy, I hope we are thinking longer than 10 \nyears. But that is what the CBO says they are going to use--10 years.\n  Don't forget there is another big issue with this bill in that we \nstep all over property rights in this country. Even though several of \nthe bills in here say they would not use eminent domain, every one of \nthem still has the right to use eminent domain outside the areas we \nhave created in this bill. So we have taken one of the basic rights of \nAmericans in this country, and the Senate, in passing this bill, by \nsaying: Sorry, our parochial interests for what we want to do for the \nState trumps your property rights.\n  If you believe in property rights, if you believe people who own land \nought to have the right to develop that land, if you don't think the \nFederal Government ought to be funding those people who will take away \nyour rights--which is what they will do with the heritage areas; they \nactually change the zoning laws as funded by the U.S. Park Service--I \nhave a bridge I want to sell you.\n  We ought to be about doing what is in the best interest of the \ncountry, not what is in the best interest of our States right now. Our \nproblems are severe. We ought to be doing things that develop \nconfidence in this body, not undermining the confidence in this body. \nAs far as the land exchanges, almost none of those was objected to. \nThey could have come through here on unanimous consent, and everybody \nknows that. To use that as a reason for why we are at this point is not \nonly insincere, it is inaccurate.\n  So it is time for us to start behaving and acting in ways that \nrestore confidence in this body and setting priorities that are very \nsimilar to the priorities every family has to set. I will say, again, \nwe should have spent the last 2 weeks working on waste and fraud and \nduplication in the Federal Government because we are getting ready to \napprove a bill that will spend $800 billion at the same time we know we \nare going to waste $300 billion in this Government. For us to spend \ntime on this bill rather than the important things that are going to \nmake a difference in the lives of families in this country in the long \nrun, I believe it undermines the best values of the Senate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico has \nhalf a minute remaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the time of 10:30 is about to arrive. I \nyield my time.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                            Lilly Ledbetter\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am the leadoff speaker today in what \nwill be a substantial conversation on the Fair Pay Restoration Act. It \nhas been otherwise known in the community and in the media as the Lilly \nLedbetter bill, which we hope to bring up for a vote tomorrow to \nadvance this bill. What this legislation will do is to overturn the \nSupreme Court decision that essentially mitigated the ability to file \nlawsuits for equal pay for equal work.\n  Mr. President, I am not new to this bill, and neither are you. We \ncounted you as one of our strong advocates when we had our vote last \nyear on April 23.\n  The person who has been one of the leads in the Senate has been our \nvery good colleague, Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. As we know, \nSenator Clinton is about to assume other responsibilities. I have taken \nup this bill as the lead sponsor, along with many of the women in the \nSenate and the very good men. I thank Senator Clinton for her \nleadership and her advocacy on behalf of women and on behalf of civil \nrights and on behalf of fairness and justice. She has been a great \nadvocate, and we are going to miss her.\n  I also thank Senator Kennedy and his staff, Senator Kennedy for his \nleadership in trying to right the wrong the Supreme Court decision \ncreated. Senator Kennedy has been a stalwart on this bill and is also \none of the original sponsors of the remedy we are bringing before our \ncolleagues today.\n  You might recall that in April we had our vote on the Lilly Ledbetter \nbill. You might recall it was a very intense and emotional debate. Most \nof the women of the Senate came on the floor. We were dressed in red \nbecause that was the color of the women's movement and Mrs. Ledbetter \nherself wore red. We lost that vote by essentially two votes. As \neverybody left the floor, they thought it was over. But I knew it was \nnot over because we were not going to let it be over. We were going to \ncontinue the fight. I said to my colleagues then, when we lost the \nvote, we would come back and fight another day, and that day is here. \nWe said very loudly, clearly, firmly, and resolutely that we wanted to \nbe sure women receive equal pay for equal work, equal or comparable \nwork. We wanted to change the law books so women would feel it in their \ncheckbooks.\n  I reminded our colleagues, because there had been a fantastic \nminiseries about John Adams, that Abigail, one of our heroes, had \nwritten John when he was busy writing the Constitution--she was busy \nrunning the farm and keeping life going--and she said: John Adams, when \nyou write that Constitution, remember the ladies because if you forget \nus, we will foment another rebellion.\n  I said on the floor on April 23 that we, in the spirit of Abigail \nAdams, were ready to foment another revolution if we were going to be \ndenied the opportunity to pursue equal pay. I then said we were going \nto fight, and I asked the women of the Senate--I asked the women of the \nSenate and women all over the country--to suit up, get ready to fight. \nPut your lipstick on, and let's foment another revolution.\n  Wow, the revolution came, and it is more than I anticipated. The \nrevolution came in one of the most dynamic primaries our country has \never seen. The revolution came when people said loudly and clearly, at \nevery primary and every caucus across this country, that they wanted \nchange. They chose a new standard-bearer in President-elect Barack \nObama. In that, with Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden, we have the leadership \nthe American people want. In their leadership, working on a bipartisan \nbasis in the Congress, we want to bring about change, and therefore one \nof the first bills we bring to the floor of the Senate is one that \nmakes sure women have equal pay for equal or comparable work and they \nhave access to the courts and appropriate legal process to be able to \npursue their concerns and their complaints.\n  The revolution is here, and the votes are coming. We are going to \nvote tomorrow on cloture on the motion to proceed. Later on, we are \ngoing to have complete debate on the bill itself. We know there are \ncolleagues who offer alternatives, but that is part of the revolution--\nto have great ideas, engage where there are differences of opinion, and \nthen, at the end of the day, have the votes. We are looking forward to \nthis. It is a day long in coming.\n  This year, this new Congress and this new President bring us not only \na new year, but it also has created a new economic reality. The economy \nis tanking, with no end in sight, retirement accounts are plummeting, \nhome values are sinking, and unemployment is surging.\n  This is not news to women. Women who are in the workplace today know \nhow hard it is to get and keep a job. What we also know is that in good \ntimes or bad times, women are discriminated against in terms of the pay \nthey receive. Right now, today, in the 21st century America, women \nstill earn only 76 cents an hour when men receive a dollar an hour. \nThere are women who pursued remedies.\n  In May 2007, the Supreme Court made an outrageous decision. They said \nwomen cannot get equal pay for equal work unless they file a complaint \n180 days from when the discrimination\n\n[[Page S358]]\n\nbegan. Women do not always know when discrimination began. They meant \nfrom the very first day that you get a paycheck that discriminates \nagainst you, within 180 days, within 6 months, you are supposed to know \nthat and file a complaint. We would love to be able to do that. But \nthis decision does not reflect the reality of the workplace.\n  What is it that we know about the workplace? You can talk about \nanything in the workplace. Often, politics are discussed in the \nlunchroom; religion is talked about at the computer; sex is often \ndiscussed at the water cooler; but salary is never discussed. How many \npeople really know the salary of their coworkers? Women do not go \naround asking men: How much are you paid, and pull out a little pad. \nThey presume that if they are doing the job side by side with male \ncoworkers, they are getting equal pay. They don't know that. Then what \nhappens if the male counterpart gets a raise? The guys have been out at \na ball game. They say: Don't worry, we will take care of you. But the \nwomen don't know that. You have to know it the day you get the paycheck \nand he gets the bigger one. How are you going to know that? Snooping? \nMen get raises and promotions, but women are often overlooked and \nundervalued.\n  What we saw in the Supreme Court decision was that it was a backward \nstep for women and it violates the very concept of fairness and \njustice. The Supreme Court decision was so outrageous that our beloved \nand esteemed Justice Ginsburg took the unusual position of reading her \ndissent from the bench. Usually, Justices do not do that. She said in \nher dissenting opinion that the Court did not get it, that they do not \nunderstand the realities of the workplace that would prohibit women \nfrom knowing exactly when the discrimination started. She called upon \nCongress to fix it, and that is what this bill does. Our bill restores \nthe original language that existed before Ledbetter.\n  Along the way, President Bush heard about our legislation. He \nthreatened to veto it. On January 20, we will have a new President, and \nhe will not only sign it, he campaigned with Lilly Ledbetter and made a \npromise to the American people. When President-elect Obama, who by then \nwill have taken his oath of office and will be President Obama--this \nwill probably be the very first piece of legislation he will sign. What \na sweet day for women all over America. But we have a legislative road \nto go on.\n  A lot has been said about Lilly Ledbetter, but people are busy and \nthey might not remember her whole story. What a gallant and courageous \nwoman. She fought the system, and on her own time and with great risk, \nshe took on the challenges of the workplace. She turned to the courts \nand began her fight. She fought two different times, once against \nsexual harassment and the other time against unequal pay. What you need \nto understand is when she began her fight to get equal pay, she was \nthen sexually harassed because she followed her legal opportunities and \nrights. So she was doubly punished. She was punished in the workplace \nin her paycheck and she was punished in the workplace because she dared \nspeak out.\n  Lilly Ledbetter did not work at some microbusiness. Lilly Ledbetter \nworked at Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company. She worked there for 19 years \nand by all accounts was an outstanding employee. She did not know when \nthe disparity developed, whether it was on the first day she was hired \nor over the many years she was there. But she found out and took it to \ncourt. A jury found that Goodyear had discriminated against her and \nawarded her $400,000 in backpay. When they did, Goodyear then took this \nall the way up to the appellate court. Each time, this woman pursued \nher remedies, often at great risk and great financial and personal \nhardship. Finally, because Goodyear, every time she won, took it to a \nhigher court--that is their prerogative. But you had little Lilly \nLedbetter against this giant corporation, with tons of lawyers and tons \nof legal resources. Finally, they had the Supreme Court on their side, \nand the Supreme Court said someone cannot sue their employer over \nunequal pay if that person doesn't file the suit 180 days from the day \nthe discrimination began.\n  As we said earlier, the Supreme Court just didn't get it. How many \npeople know the salary of their coworkers, especially in the first 6 \nmonths on the job? What if you are hired at an equal rate with your \nmale counterpart but he gets a raise every few months and you don't? \nThe decision was terrible. As I said, Justice Ginsburg said, ``In our \nview, the Court does not comprehend or is indifferent to the insidious \nway in which women can become victims of pay discrimination.'' She \nencouraged us to fix it.\n  As I said, women continue to earn 77 cents for every dollar. Women of \ncolor get paid even less. So Lilly Ledbetter is not an isolated \nincident.\n  Now, there is opposition to this bill because people make profits off \nof discrimination; if you pay women less, you make more. I mean, we are \nproviding a subsidy to these businesses that discriminate.\n  Over a lifetime, it not only affects your current paycheck, but it \naffects your Social Security and your retirement in terms of lower \nlifetime earnings. The Supreme Court now even makes it harder for women \nworkers to close this work gap.\n  I am going to have more to say about this, but I want to say that we \nnow know the situation in the workplace, women are paid less generally. \nWe want to be sure that if you are paid less specifically, you have an \nopen courthouse door that will have an open mind to the fact that \ndiscrimination might exist. We want to have a fair playing field for \nyou to file this complaint.\n  This bill will amend title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, so \nthat the time for an employee to file a wage discrimination suit runs \nfrom the date of the actual payment of a discriminatory wage, not from \nthe time of hiring. That means that employees can sue employers based \non discriminating paychecks. It does not limit the time a worker can \nseek the remedy.\n  I want to be clear, though, it does not change the statute of \nlimitations. What it does is, under the Supreme Court decision you \nwould have to file your complaint within 180 days of when you were \nhired. Here, you can file it within 180 days of your last paycheck when \nyou found that discrimination, you believed discrimination existed. We \nare going to be debating this bill. I have many colleagues who want to \nspeak on it. There are many in this Congress who have been very strong \nadvocates, but our leading advocates are the two wonderful women from \nthe State of Washington who I know are eager to speak. Both are on the \nfloor, and the lead on this working with us in the Health and Education \nCommittee is, of course, the senior Senator from the State of \nWashington, a part of our leadership team, the dynamic and intrepid \nPatty Murray. I yield the floor for her.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I first thank Senator Enzi for his \naccommodation to allow me to follow Senator Mikulski.\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland. She has been tireless on this \nissue and a champion for women and their families for many years. I am \nvery proud to be with her today as she leads the Senate and the country \nin restoring the credibility and confidence of women across this \ncountry to be able to get what they should be getting when they go to \nwork every day. So I thank her for that.\n  This Senate has a very proud history of working across the aisle to \npass civil rights laws. Those historic laws ensure that all people in \nour Nation have equal rights regardless of their race, their religion, \ngender, or national origin. I am very proud that because of those laws, \nmy daughter now has the right to work in the same job and achieve the \nsame success as my son.\n  But despite all of the years of progress, we have not eliminated \nunfairness in the workplace. I believe we should all fight long and \nhard whenever Americans are denied the ability to fight for their \nrights, and that is why I have come to the floor today to speak.\n  With its May 2007 decision, Ledbetter v. Goodyear, the Supreme Court \nreversed years of progress in the fight for fairness in the workplace. \nTheir decision made it almost impossible for workers who suffer \ndiscrimination to seek justice. It went against congressional intent, \nand it set us back 40 years in the fight for equal opportunity\n\n[[Page S359]]\n\nin the workplace. The decision was wrong, and we here in this body need \nto take action before it weakens our civil rights even further.\n  So today as we begin this new Congress and a new administration, I am \nurging all of our colleagues to support the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct to reverse Ledbetter v. Goodyear and ensure that our workers again \nhave a fair shot at fighting discrimination.\n  Before I describe the bill that is before us today, I want to say a \nfew words about Lilly Ledbetter and her Supreme Court case. As the \nSenator from Maryland talked about, Lilly Ledbetter worked for Goodyear \nTire for 19 years before she found out that her male counterparts were \nbeing paid more for doing the exact same work. So she sued, charging \nher employers with pay discrimination.\n  But, as you know now, the Court sided with Goodyear. It was not \nbecause the Court thought she was wrong. They, in fact, agreed she had \nbeen discriminated against. But the Court said she did not have the \nright to sue. That is right, that is what the Court said. They said she \nshould have sued within 180 days of her very first unfair paycheck, \neven though she did not know about it until many years later.\n  It made that ruling despite the fact that courts around this country \nhad for years assumed the opposite, that the clock starts ticking after \nany discriminatory act, including every time a worker is paid unfairly. \nNow, I think that sounds an awful lot like our Supreme Court is asking \nworkers everywhere to be mind readers. It is unfair and it is not what \nCongress intended when we created that law in the first place.\n  Lilly Ledbetter has, to her credit, not let that decision go without \na fight. She has been a tireless champion for her rights, and I truly \nwant to thank her for everything she has done to raise awareness about \nher case.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act before us today would reverse the \nCourt's unfair decision. It will allow workers to file a claim within \n180 days of any discriminatory paycheck, and it would again allow \nworkers to discover the facts and to challenge ongoing discrimination \nas Congress always intended. Purely and simply, it restores a worker's \nright to fight for her rights.\n  I also want to take a little bit of time to talk about why it is so \nimportant that we ensure our workers have all of the tools necessary to \nfight for their rights. As I said earlier, what we are talking about \ntoday is not just a philosophical issue of rights and discrimination. \nThe truth is that although we have made tremendous progress in civil \nrights, there is a lot of work to be done yet. The pay gap is only one \nexample. Women still make less than men even though they are doing the \nexact same work. On average today, women earn only 77 cents for every \ndollar that is paid to their male coworkers. That pay gap, by the way, \nis even wider for African-American and Latino women. African-American \nwomen earn 67 cents on a dollar, and Latino women earn only 56 cents \nfor every dollar a white man makes.\n  Pay discrimination like that has real and harmful impacts on our \nfamilies and for our Nation as a whole. It hurts an individual's \nability to earn a living or to care for their children or to contribute \nfully to society. Yet it is so deeply ingrained in our society today \nthat many jobs dominated by women pay less than jobs dominated by men \neven when the work they do is almost the same. That disparity hurts \nmillions of families. In almost 10 million households today, mothers \nare the breadwinners. In many of those cases, those women are also \nsupporting their parents and other extended family members and, in far \ntoo many of those households, women have to struggle to pay for rent or \nheat or food or gas, much less send those kids to college.\n  Think of how much better off our families and our country would be if \nwomen were paid a wage equal to men, especially, of course, as we face \nthis deepening economic crisis and all of our expenses are rising every \nday. If women and men made an equal wage, single working women would \nhave 17 percent more income every year. Ensuring that they have a fair \npaycheck would cut their poverty rate in half. That is to the benefit \nof this entire country.\n  There is one other issue I want to raise. Although the Ledbetter case \ninvolves gender discrimination, the decision applies to all \ndiscrimination: religion, race, age, disability, national origin. I \nthink it is only fitting that in the days before we honor the life and \nthe legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. we are considering this issue \ntoday. The truth is, all the laws we pass guaranteeing rights have \nlittle meaning if Americans do not have the ability to challenge the \ndiscrimination in court.\n  This case could set a terrible precedent. We run the risk that \nantidiscrimination laws will grow weaker, not stronger, if we do not \nact here in the Senate. So I urge our colleagues to support this bill \nto reverse this unfair decision and restore congressional intent and to \nensure the Senate's history of protecting civil rights will not be \neroded.\n  I again thank my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, for her \ntremendous fight over so many years to make sure that women have equal \naccess in the workplace.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I congratulate Senator Mikulski and Senator \nMurray, and all of the people who have worked on the bill for their \ndedication to women's rights and their dedication to civil rights.\n  I have been referred to several times as a reasonable voice on this \nfloor and in committee. I work across the aisle. And I have got to say, \nI went through an election where that was the toughest issue against \nme, the fact that I had worked across the aisle. People particularly \nwanted to know how I could work with Senator Kennedy to get stuff done. \nI always concentrated on the last part of that: ``getting stuff done.'' \nAmerica expects us to get stuff done.\n  The way that really works is, we work across the aisle and we listen \nto everybody, and we work across the building, and we listen to 435 \npeople down there as well, providing a process where people can have \ntheir views heard.\n  One of the reasons we go through a process--and we are talking about \nan appropriate legal process that people who are discriminated against \nneed--is to make sure the voice of the people of the United States is \nheard.\n  The Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee was once the most \ncontentious committee in this body. It is now the most productive \ncommittee in this body. We pass a lot of legislation. You do not hear \nmuch debate on the floor on it because it goes through the committee \nprocess.\n  How does that committee process work? Well, when a bill goes to \ncommittee, you usually have hearings. We have not had a hearing on \nthis. You get a markup. That is when everybody can turn in every \nimaginable amendment they can think of for that bill, which is where \nyou bring into account the perspectives of all of those people on the \ncommittee, 20, 22, 23 people, who concentrate on a subject, who know \nthat subject.\n  From there, the chairman and the ranking member kind of divide things \nup and see what the relative amendments are trying to do, and the \nramifications of those amendments. If you have 25 amendments, but all \ndeal with one subject, you know that is a hot-button issue. But if you \nlook through them, you usually find out there is kind of a common \ntheme; not a common solution but a common theme. And because of the way \na committee works, you have a chance to sit down with those people who \nhave those opinions and see if there is a solution that fits in the \nbill. Usually there is.\n  That is why we have done some very difficult issues through \ncommittee. We passed the first change in mine safety law in 28 years, \nand we did it in 6 weeks, not 6 weeks of floor time. The floor time was \nabout an hour. We did a pensions bill. That has always been a difficult \nprocess. We wanted to make sure people received the pensions they were \npromised and that companies were not put out of business so they could \nnot pay those pensions. That was a 1,000-page bill. We had an agreement \nbefore it came to the floor, because of committee work, that we would \nhave 1 hour of debate, two amendments that we could not agree on, and \nthen a final vote. In less than an hour and a half,\n\n[[Page S360]]\n\nwe passed one of the most critical bills for this Nation, and it was \nbecause of committee work. It is because of the knowledge the committee \nhas and shares in committee and the negotiation that goes on.\n  When we are presented a bill on the floor that has not been to \ncommittee, we have no voice, and it is take-it-or-leave-it. If we look \nat the history of the Senate, it is usually leave it. Why? Because \nthere isn't that flexibility of amendments when it comes directly to \nthe floor. There isn't that ability to see what the intensity of the \namendments is, let alone the direction of the amendments, let alone the \nopportunity to find an alternate solution, one on which both sides \nagree. When you don't follow committee process it takes a lot more \ntime. How much time does it take? I guess we will be talking about this \ntoday and tomorrow we will have a cloture vote on it. If that cloture \nvote succeeds, then there is 30 more hours of debate before we get to \namendments.\n  One of the concerns on this side is whether the process will break \ndown at that point as well so that if there is the approval to proceed, \nthen there would not be any amendments allowed. That was a concern on \nthe public lands bill, no opportunity for anybody to offer any \namendments. That was a $3.5 billion bill. But that doesn't mean much \nwhen one is talking about $700 billion stimulus bill and when we \nhaven't even done the appropriations process for last year. Where are \nthe appropriations? Should that not be a part of the solution to the \ncrisis we are in? Yet we are jumping right to this bill that has not \nbeen to committee.\n  I express my strong opposition to the process or, more accurately, \nthe total lack of process which brings us to the consideration of S. \n181. The manner in which this bill is being handled by the majority \nsets a disappointing tone for the new Congress and lays the groundwork \nfor a legislative term that will surely be more partisan than \nproductive. The majority has brought this legislation directly to the \nfloor of the Senate and, in doing so, has completely circumvented the \nregular order of the Senate and its committee process.\n  This legislation has not been brought before the committee of \njurisdiction and, as a consequence, has not been subject to scrutiny, \nopen debate, and amendment which is an integral part of the Senate's \ndeliberative process. This is not the legislative process our Founding \nFathers created. It is an affront to Members and a disservice to the \nAmerican people. We cannot have good legislation with a bad process. \nPeople may have wanted change when they voted last November, but the \nchange they wanted was not the imposition of one party rule or 30 hours \nof debate followed by a vote, followed by 30 more hours of debate, \nfollowed by no amendment process, followed by a final vote. I don't \nthink anybody thought that was the solution to what we were doing.\n  In the committee process, things can be done in a much more prudent \nand sometimes rapid manner, with less floor debate, and this is where \nthe 80-percent rule can be applied. I have found that we can agree with \n80 percent of the issues. Pick an issue that is in that agreement \ncategory, and we can agree on 80 percent of that issue. What we get to \nsee on the floor of the Senate is the 20 percent debate on what we \ndon't agree on, not the 80 percent that we could get done quickly.\n  In addition to slick procedural maneuvering and empty platitudes, \nthere are other ploys in the political playbook at work. First and \nforemost, and guaranteed to be used to distract the public's attention, \nis to demagogue the issue and attempt to demonize anybody who dares to \nsuggest there may be another way to achieve a particular goal. The \nLedbetter bill is the perfect example of this divisive tactic. Anyone \nwho suggests the bill is an overreach or the problem it seeks to \naddress can be addressed in a better way is immediately painted as \nopposed to equal pay for women or is some kind of a sexist Neanderthal. \nWhat a nonsensical claim.\n  Let's not forget that the alternative to this bill, which has been \nintroduced in this Congress and which the majority leadership will not \nlet us consider, was authored by Senator Hutchison. I do not believe \nthere is a single Member of the Senate who can credibly claim to be \nmore sensitive to women's legitimate concerns over pay equity or more \ninstrumental in assuring equal rights for women in the workplace than \nSenator Hutchison. Is there so little respect for the intelligence of \nthe American public that despite this fact the proponents of the \nlegislation will nonetheless foster this myth?\n  People may have wanted change when they voted last November, but the \nchange they wanted was not a further coarsening of public discourse and \nthe substitution of name calling for meaningful debate or the avoidance \nof following the process in a prudent and rapid way.\n  I intend to speak further with respect to the substance of the \nlegislation, but I do not wish to dilute my concerns about the way this \nlegislation is being handled with my concerns about the bill.\n  Accordingly, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we will be turning to the Senator from \nWashington in a moment. I can't let the remarks that have been said not \nbe clarified in terms of facts.\n  First, when this bill moves forward, there is an agreement between \nboth leaders, the majority and the minority, that there will be \namendments. In fact, one of the premier amendments will be offered by \nthe Senator from Texas, who has an alternative view. She will have the \nopportunity to offer her amendment. As I understand, there is no \nrestriction on amendments. Speaking for the Democratic leader, there is \nno intent on our side to fill the tree.\n  The debate is being led by the women in the Senate. Among ourselves, \nwe have dinner once a month. We get together on a bipartisan basis. We \nhave pledged among ourselves--and it is unofficial, not an oath--that \nwe are going to be a zone of civility in this institution. The way we \nwill debate will, first of all, always try to allow amendments. We will \nproceed with intellectual rigor, have our discussions based on fact. \nYes, philosophy will enter in, but it will not be ideological. Nor do \nwe intend in any way to be tart or demonize.\n  We have listened to two speakers on this issue, myself and Senator \nMurray. There has been no demagoguing. We spoke with passion because we \nknow Lilly Ledbetter. We mourned for her when her husband passed away. \nWe listened to stories of sexual harassment because she stood up for \nherself. But we are not in the demonizing business. I can assure my \ncolleagues, this discussion will be debated by men as well as women. \nBut the women of the Senate intend to have this be a model of civility. \nThat is one thing.\n  The second thing is hearings. This is January 14. There have been no \nhearings on this bill in this session. But it is exactly the same bill \nvoted on in the last Congress on which there were two hearings held: \none in the HELP Committee on January 24, 2008, and the Judiciary \nCommittee on September 23, 2008. It is the same hearings. We would have \nthe same witnesses. We would bring in Lilly, et cetera. The differences \nof opinion on how to achieve the goal of ending discrimination, for \nexample, between the Hutchison approach and the approach here will \nafford her ample time. We know our colleague, Senator Specter, has some \nflashing yellow lights about the bill. He, too, will offer his \namendment. We know the lawyerly way in which he proceeds, and so on.\n  We are ready for debate and discussion. I don't think we have been \ninappropriate in the process. We held our hearings last year. We are \ngoing to offer wide latitude in the offering of amendments here. The \nwhole mood is one that is upbeat and looking forward to spirited \ndebate.\n  Having said that, I didn't know if my very civil colleague from \nWyoming wanted to comment. I just wanted to have those particular facts \non the record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I still suggest on bills that we are going \nto do, if they go through the committee process, the committee markup \nprocess, we have a better idea of the intensity from each of the \nmembers on the committee. We have a better idea of alternate solutions \nor sometimes just alternate wording: a comma, a word here or there. \nChange sometimes makes a tremendous difference. That is not possible to \ndo from the floor of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S361]]\n\nThe publicity isn't very good from the committee. Those issues that we \npassed nearly unanimously every time have not risen to much of a level \nof publicity, but they have gotten the job done. That is what I am \nsuggesting we ought to do on bills this year. I am worried about the \nway this came up so early and, without that process, what we are facing \nfor the rest of the year.\n  Will we just short-circuit committees? I also believe committees were \nvery important, and I have enjoyed working on this committee. It used \nto be the most contentious, and now it is the most productive. I want \nto keep it that way. The way to keep it that way is to make sure things \ngo through committee so committee members are not left out.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to join in the discussion about \nthis important legislation and to thank the dean of our women Senate \ndelegation, the Senator from Maryland, for her steadfast support of \nthis legislation and continuing to make sure that people are aware of \nthe urgency of passing this legislation. I also thank my colleague, \nSenator Murray, also on the HELP Committee, who has been working on \nthis legislation, along with Senator Clinton who was an original \nsponsor.\n  Last year I had the opportunity to attend a rally where I met these \nthree young Americans: Gussie, Sofia, and Leo. I thought their story \nwas compelling because they made their own signs and talked about how \nthey will work for justice. Their plan to talk about discrimination and \nthe difference in pay equity on this particular day was to walk around \nthe street corners begging for 23 cents. They were doing that to show \nthat this was the difference between what women get paid and what men \nget paid for doing the exact same job. This young generation of \nAmericans wants to grow up in a world where they know there is going to \nbe equal pay for equal work.\n  I would like to tell them that the Senate has acted on this \nlegislation and moved forward. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court didn't \nshare that view. I took delight in our hometown newspaper actually \nsaying the Supreme Court kicked female workers in the teeth with their \n2007 ruling and that what was important was restoring average \nAmericans' right to justice as a good place to start undoing the damage \nthat has already been done.\n  This issue is so important to women because the legacy of this \ninjustice means not just on average we make 77 cents for every dollar \nour male counterpart can make in a job, but we stand to lose up to \n$250,000 in income over our lifetime because of this injustice. Those \nare real dollars.\n  At a time of great economic uncertainty, when every penny counts, it \nis more important that we close the gap between what women and men earn \nin the workplace.\n  Last year we saw more jobs lost than in any other year since World \nWar II, and the unemployment rate has climbed to 7.2 percent. In \ncontrast to previous recessions, we are seeing early signs that women \nare being especially hard hit because of the economic downturn. So we \nwant to make sure, that as unemployment numbers rapidly rise, those \nwomen who are still in the workforce are going to get the same pay as \ntheir male counterparts.\n\n  In 2007, women's median wage fell by 3 percent. But during that same \ntime period, the average decline for men was only about .5 percent. So \nwe can see that our economy and how women are being impacted is \nimpacting individual families. So I am here to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act--a piece of legislation that \nwill help us close this gap of injustice and help these young people \nunderstand they are going to grow up in a society where there is faith \nand justice and fairness.\n  As my colleague from Washington said, this bill is about gender \ndiscrimination, but it also extends to claims of pay discrimination \nbased on race, national origin, religion, disability, and age. That is \nwhy I think it should be a top priority for us, and I am sure it is a \ntop priority for many civil rights groups across our country.\n  But this bill, as my colleagues have already discussed, will allow \nworkers to file pay discrimination claims as long as the discrimination \ncontinues. A worker's ability to challenge unequal pay should continue \nas long as the discrimination is there. So it is their most recent \ndiscriminatory paycheck that will be the trigger for allowing them to \nfile a case.\n  Now, I ask my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who have not \nsupported this legislation in the past to now come to the aid of \nhelping this legislation get to the President's desk.\n  A few years ago, we had a similar case with the Supreme Court dealing \nwith identity theft. The Supreme Court had interpreted a case to say \nthat the statute of limitation for a consumer harmed by identity theft \nto file a lawsuit to recover from financial harm is 24 months from when \nit first occurred rather than when the consumer discovered it. Many of \nus came and made the case, through the legislative process, that \nsometimes you do not know when your identity has been stolen, and the \nconsequence of that is sometimes by the time the statute of limitations \nhad run out, you did not have a chance to bring your case.\n  Well, we did something about that. We passed the Fair and Accurate \nCredit Transactions Act that helped create a framework that said that \nat the time of discovery of the act of your identity being stolen was \nthe time the statute of limitations started to run--very similar to \nwhat we are trying to do here. In fact, it was in response to a Supreme \nCourt case in which the U.S. Congress said: We do not like the Supreme \nCourt's decision. It might be based on the law, but let's change the \nlaw and make sure there is justice for those who have had their \nidentity stolen. That legislation passed 95 to 2.\n  It is a similar principle here. We are saying some individuals do not \nknow that discrimination has happened. We want to change the law to say \nthat the most recent paycheck that established discrimination gives you \nthe ability to bring up the case.\n  So I would ask my colleagues, if you were willing to support the \nprevious legislation, the same kind of scenario dealing with identity \ntheft, why are you not willing to give the same kind of justice to \nwomen who are trying to get equal pay for the equal work that they are \ndoing?\n  I hope my colleagues will take the opportunity, now that the Supreme \nCourt has put this ball in our court, to create a fair and equitable \nprocess and pass this legislation as soon as possible.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we would now like to turn to another \nstrong advocate for ending discrimination, someone who has completed \nher first 2 years in the Senate and is part of that zone of civility to \nget the job done. We would like to hear from Senator Klobuchar.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Maryland for her great leadership and her \ntenacity with this bill from the very beginning. She is wearing red for \na reason: That is the color to get this done. I will always remember \nthis bill by Senator Mikulski taking to the floor the last time we came \nso close to passing it, when she said to the women of America: Suit up, \nsquare your shoulders, put your lipstick on. We are ready for a \nrevolution.\n  I also enjoyed hearing the comments from my colleague from \nWashington. I thought the analogy to the identity theft case was on \npoint, where sometimes people have a wrong done to them--whether it is \ndiscrimination or whether it is identity theft--and it is literally \nimpossible for them to know what happened until sometimes years later. \nThat is what happened to Lilly Ledbetter.\n  I am proud to join Senator Mikulski and my fellow women Senators and \nfellow Democrats and others who are here today to call for the Senate \nto take up and pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Restoration Act.\n  The timing of the vote on this legislation, which is tomorrow, could \nnot be more appropriate. We all know our Nation is in the midst of a \nfinancial and economic crisis of historic proportions, with Americans \nfacing record job losses and the largest loss of wealth since the Great \nDepression.\n\n[[Page S362]]\n\n  We know working families and women are bearing the brunt of this \ncrisis. Since 2000--these figures are actually before we had, \nliterally, this meltdown in the last few months--but since 2000--even \nwithout those figures--the average family income in America has gone \ndown $1,175 per year when adjusted for inflation. At the same time, the \naverage family's expenses have gone up $4,500 per year.\n  This includes higher mortgage payments, higher phone costs, higher \ngas prices, higher heating costs, and higher health insurance costs. So \nthe bottom line is the average middle-class family has suffered a net \nannual income loss of something like $5,500 a year, and that is not \neven including all the losses to the 401(k) funds and the pension \nfunds, all the losses because of the expenses of childcare, and \neverything that has been going on in the last few months.\n  These are not just statistics. I saw this when I was home over \nDecember. I saw it in the eyes of a woman at a cafe near Litchfield, \nMN, who called me over to her table and said she was taking a break at \nher job being a waitress and she was now doing three jobs. She had just \nhad her hours cut back at the third job, and that was the extra money \nshe was going to use to buy her grandkids Christmas presents.\n  We have received letters in our office, such as the one we received \nfrom parents who said they would put their three daughters to bed and \nthen just go sit at the kitchen table and put their heads in their \nhands and think: How are we going to make it? There is the woman who \nwrote to us and said she had received a small amount of inheritance \nfrom her father, and she planned to use it for her daughter's wedding, \nbut she was now using it to pay for her own retirement because her \n401(k) and her retirement funds had decreased so dramatically.\n  These are stories of women, real women, in Minnesota. No one has felt \nthe impact of this economic downturn--the loss in income and the rising \ncosts--more than the working women in America. It is often said that \nthings have changed a lot for women in this country, and they have. It \nwas not too long ago that we did not have the right to vote. It was not \ntoo long ago that my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, was the \nonly woman in this Chamber. Now we have 17 of us. And it was not too \nlong ago that I was kicked out of public fourth grade for wearing \nbellbottom pants to school by Mrs. Quady. I went home and changed and \nreturned without missing much of my classes--a true story.\n  It is a sad reality that--88 years after the 19th amendment gave \nwomen equal voting power, and 45 years after the passage of the Equal \nPay Act--it still takes women 16 months to earn what men can earn in 12 \nmonths.\n  When I travel around my State and talk to the women in my State, I \nfind these women are not simply looking for a handout or preferential \ntreatment. All they are asking for is a fair and equal chance to make a \nfair and decent living. That is why it is so important the Senate take \nup the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act on the Senate floor this week.\n  This important legislation will reverse a 2007 Supreme Court ruling--\nLedbetter v. Goodyear--that significantly limited the rights of \nindividuals to sue for gender-based discrimination. The facts that gave \nrise to Lilly Ledbetter's case have been told, but I think they should \nbe told again. She was a hard worker. People can picture her right now. \nI have met her many times. She is a delightful person. She worked at \nGoodyear Tire as a manager for 20 years.\n\n  When she started, all the employees at the manager level started at \nthe same pay. She knew she was getting the same pay as the men doing \nthe same job. But early in her tenure as manager, the company went to a \n``merit-based'' pay system.\n  Payment records were kept confidential, as they are in many \ncompanies, and Lilly did not think to ask what her male colleagues were \nmaking. She was happy to be a manager. She did not think to look at her \npay raise and to ask if the men in the department were getting the same \npay the day the paychecks came out. I do not think many people think \nabout running around and asking their colleagues if they are getting \nthe same amount of money for the same work.\n  As the years passed by, the pay differential between what she made \nand what the male managers were making just kept getting bigger. It was \nonly after getting an anonymous note from a coworker telling her she \nwas not paid as much as the male managers that she finally realized \nwhat was happening. Soon after getting that note, she filed a legal \ncomplaint. But that was many years after the discrimination began.\n  At trial, Lilly Ledbetter was easily able to prove discrimination. \nShe could show what she did, she could show what the men did, and she \ncould show the difference in pay. In fact, the jury found that sex \ndiscrimination accounted for a pay differential of as great as 25 \npercent between Lilly and her male counterparts. You can think about \nhow that adds up over 20 years of working.\n  However, Goodyear appealed the jury's ruling, and the Supreme Court, \nin a 5-to-4 decision, decided that Lilly filed her case too late. \nEssentially, they ruled she would have had to have filed within 180 \ndays of Goodyear making its first discriminatory act.\n  Now, you ask, how would she have known this unless she was nosey and \ngoing around trying to look at people's paychecks? But this, as absurd \nas it sounds, is what the Court said.\n  Although the Court's decision completely ignores the realities of the \nworkplace--that employee records are confidential and there is no \nreasonable way to know when discrimination starts--we now have an \nopportunity to bring the realities to light.\n  We should pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and allow a claim to \nbe filed as long as the paychecks reflecting discrimination continue to \nbe issued. In doing so, we will restore the original intent of the \nCivil Rights Act and the Equal Pay Act.\n  Women cannot be expected to challenge practices they do not know are \nhappening. By passing this law, women will be able to take those 4 \nmonths back, those extra months it takes them to catch up with their \nmale counterparts.\n  This legislation is critical in the fight for equality for women in \nthe workplace, but there is still a long way to go.\n  I am honored to be the first woman elected to the Senate from the \nState of Minnesota. Today, I am humbled to work with my women \ncolleagues in the Senate in this effort to advance equality for women \nacross the country.\n  Last week, we welcomed two new women to the Senate, and I see one of \nthem in the Chamber--my colleague from New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen--\nbringing our current total to 17, although our dear friend and champion \non these issues, Senator Clinton, will soon be leaving us.\n  Passing the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act would be a fitting sendoff \nto Senator Clinton who has dedicated her life to working toward \nequality for women. It would also be a fitting tribute to Senator \nMikulski in her cry to square up your shoulders, suit up, put your \nlipstick on, and get this bill passed. And it would be a great tribute \nto Senator Kennedy. If he were on the Senate floor with us at this \nmoment, I know he, too, would be saying: Get this done, pass this \nlegislation--in his booming voice.\n  So I implore my colleagues--for Senator Clinton, for Senator Kennedy, \nfor Senator Mikulski, but, most importantly, for the working women of \nAmerica--that we pass the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, we also want to be able to call upon one \nof our newest colleagues, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, from the State of New \nHampshire. Though new to the Senate, she is certainly not new to the \nissue. She has been a strong advocate for fairness and justice and an \nadvocate for ending discrimination her whole life and her whole career. \nShe recently, of course, was Governor of New Hampshire, and now brings \nall that wealth of experience, know-how, and commitment to the Senate. \nThis is not her first speech. It is her second speech. We are eagerly \nawaiting her words on this issue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to thank Senator Mikulski for \nthose very nice words.\n\n[[Page S363]]\n\n  I am proud to join Senator Mikulski and so many of the women in this \nbody in support of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. Early in \nthe 1980s, I served on New Hampshire's Commission on the Status of \nWomen. At that time, I chaired a committee that investigated and then \nreported on the status of women's employment in New Hampshire. At that \ntime, women made 59 cents for every dollar a man earned. That report, \nwhich I was proud to coauthor, pointed out that, ultimately, pay \ndisparity affects not just women, it affects their families and it \naffects the entire ability of working families to earn a good living. \nOver the course of a woman's lifetime, that pay discrimination is \nestimated to cost women between $700,000 and $1 million.\n  As has been pointed out by the women who have spoken on this bill \ntoday, we have made some progress. Today, women make 77 cents for every \ndollar a man earns, but the conclusions our report made about the \nimpact of this pay disparity for women are even truer today than they \nwere in 1981, at the time of the report.\n  As Senator Klobuchar and Senator Mikulski have so eloquently pointed \nout, the inability of women to be treated with pay equity in the \nworkplace has a huge impact today, as families are facing this \nrecession and are looking at how to be able to make ends meet. I think \nthe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act is a very important step toward \naddressing the inequality that not just women but working families face \nin our country.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator Mikulski. As has been pointed out, she \nwas the first woman elected to this body in her own right. We have made \nsignificant progress, much of it as a result of her leadership. I am \ndelighted to be able to join as a cosponsor of this bill and look \nforward to voting with the majority of the Senate for final passage of \nthis act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator very much. We look forward to her \nhard work and advocacy for people who have been left out, pushed out, \nredlined and sidelined.\n  This concludes for today the number of women who wished to speak on \nthis legislation. Senator Boxer is chairing a hearing, and I could go \nthrough others. I believe Senator Clinton just finished her \nconfirmation. No, just kidding, but it seems like that. So we are going \nto conclude this part of it. We will be on the floor tomorrow, when we \nhave a vote on cloture on the motion to proceed, at which time we hope \nto be able to do that, so we can actually get down to the business next \nweek of debating the amendments, as has been promised, and moving to \nfinal passage next week. We will be doing that after the inauguration \nof Barack Obama. I look forward to further discussion on this bill.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Navy Record of Decision\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, the U.S. Navy just released \ntoday, at 1:30 p.m., a record of decision which follows a 2\\1/2\\ year \nanalysis and final environmental impact statement of 13 alternatives \nfor homeporting additional ships at the naval station in Mayport, FL, \nwhich is at the mouth of the St. Johns River near Jacksonville. The \nNavy's decision will establish a homeport for a nuclear-powered \naircraft carrier which disperses the fleet instead of it all being in \none place in Norfolk, VA, a fleet of five nuclear aircraft carriers, \nthe most recent of which was just commissioned last weekend--the one \nthat was named after the 41st President of the United States--and those \nfive assigned to the Atlantic fleet. It will disperse that fleet by \nhaving a homeport for a nuclear aircraft carrier, which will reduce the \nrisk to the Atlantic fleet of carriers from a natural or a manmade \ndisaster.\n  I wish to give a direct quote from the Assistant Secretary of the \nNavy for Installations from his press release today:\n\n       Neither the [Navy], nor the nation, nor its citizens can \n     wait for a catastrophic event to occur before recognizing . . \n     . its responsibility to develop a hedge against such an \n     event.\n\n  A catastrophic event.\n  The decision is a continuation of what the Secretary of the Navy has \nsaid is the principle of strategic dispersal. According to the \nSecretary of the Navy, ``Strategic dispersal of our fleet is both a \nprotective measure and a passive deterrence measure, and it is one \nimportant factor in [the Navy's] homeporting decisions and [its] \nmaintenance of transient piers.''\n  Going back to 2005, the Chief of Naval Operations, ADM Vernon Clark, \nasserted that ``over-centralization of the [carrier] port structure is \nnot a good strategic move . . . the Navy should have two carrier-\ncapable homeports on each coast.\n  The fact is, there is only one carrier-capable port on the east \ncoast. There are three nuclear carrier-capable ports on the west coast. \nThis wasn't the case before. Before, when we had nuclear carriers and \nconventional carriers in the Atlantic fleet back in the mid-eighties, \nthere were four carriers in Norfolk, in this photograph from 1985, and \nthere were two aircraft carriers stationed in Florida at Mayport Naval \nStation. That was the case all the way up to 1987. There were still \ntwo-carrier ports all the way up to last year when the John F. Kennedy, \na conventionally powered aircraft carrier, was decommissioned and \nmothballed. And now with five carriers, there is only one port.\n  The Navy has been wrestling with this problem, and they have come to \nthe conclusion in the final administrative process of the record of \ndecision announced this afternoon that in the interest of national \nsecurity, they need these two-carrier ports, which we have always had \nup until last year.\n  If the naval station in Norfolk were to become disabled, the Atlantic \nfleet carriers would be either stuck in port and prevented from getting \nto their area of operations or they would be prevented from reaching a \nport of maintenance. And mind you, the naval station in Norfolk, VA, is \n8 miles up the river in a single-land channel that could easily be \nstopped up.\n  Back in 2007, in our Defense authorization bill, we reaffirmed \nAdmiral Clark's judgment that he had made 2 years previously in 2005. \nWe reaffirmed that judgment that the Navy's fleet should disperse its \nAtlantic coast carriers in two homeports, just as it has always been.\n  The considered judgment and decisions of our military leaders make \nsense because there are numerous risks that face our Nation's capital \nships. Those risks are compounded when you put all your eggs in one \nbasket, on one place on the east coast. Remember, on the west coast, \nthe Pacific coast, we have not two but three nuclear homeports and, \nindeed, you can put in an additional two ports in the Pacific Theater.\n  We simply must not delay in implementing this decision. The Secretary \nof Defense, Robert Gates, has come to the same strategic conclusion \nwhen he reminds us--and this is from his letter of a few weeks ago:\n\n       Having a single [nuclear carrier] homeport has not been \n     considered acceptable on the west coast and should not be \n     considered acceptable on the east coast.\n\n  It is clear that the strategic necessity is to have two homeports for \nour five capital ships, our five nuclear aircraft carriers.\n  The lessons of December 7, 1941, are a reminder of the danger to our \nnational security if we do not disperse our capital ships. Remember \nwhat happened on that day: eight battleships were in port in the \nsurprise attack on Pearl Harbor. It was just lucky that the three \naircraft carriers were out. Two of them were sailing out to the west to \nislands, such as Wake, to deliver marine aircraft, and the third one \nwas 5 hours out of Honolulu doing training exercises. Because there \nwere eight battleships all bunched together, the four-star Navy admiral \nwas fired. He was stripped of two of his four stars, and he\n\n[[Page S364]]\n\nwas forced to retire. That is a lesson in Navy history that still \nstands. Clearly, that has been part of the lesson that has led the CNO, \nthe Secretary of the Navy, and the Secretary of Defense to come to this \ndecision which they announced several weeks ago and which has been \nofficially reiterated today in the record of decision by the U.S. Navy.\n  Some people are going to say: They won't bunch up the ships. Why did \nthey bunch up five aircraft carriers in Norfolk in 1997? Count them--\none, two, three, four, five in 1997. The U.S. Navy did not learn the \nlesson of Pearl Harbor then.\n  And you say: That was 11 years ago. What about 2001? One, two, three, \nfour, five. Oh, by the way, you see this is the main bridge, this is \nthe special channel, and the commercial channel comes right by all \nthese ships: one, two, three, four, five, all docked together.\n  That was 2001. You say that was 7 years ago. We have information that \nin 2003 the same thing happened again. I just don't have a photograph \nof it, but I will.\n  Where are the lessons of Pearl Harbor and the firing and stripping of \ntwo stars of four-star Admiral Kimmel because of the attack on Pearl \nHarbor? Where are those lessons being learned by the U.S. Navy?\n  I submit to the Senate that is a main part of the reason the U.S. \nNavy has today announced the official record of decision that it will \ndisperse the Atlantic fleet of nuclear carriers by having one of those \nin the port of Mayport, which was the second port until last year.\n  This was studied for 2\\1/2\\ years. There were 13 alternatives to the \nrisk that exists. The Secretary of the Navy made the decision, with the \nadvice of the Chief of Naval Operations, and accepted by the Secretary \nof Defense.\n  It is my hope that parochial politics does not get in the way. There \nis going to have to be an appropriation of some $500 million in \nmilitary construction that will make Mayport station nuclear capable. \nOf course, that is a lot of money, but for the national security of \nprotecting the fleet of our main ships, that is a cost we are going to \nhave to bear. It is this Senator's hope that we will get the Senate and \nthe House of Representatives to understand the good common sense of \nthis strategic defense policy when it comes around to the Defense \nauthorization bill and the Defense appropriations bill.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I am pleased to know the Navy has \nfinalized its decision to make Naval Station Mayport a homeport for a \nnuclear carrier a key element in furthering the Navy's longstanding \nstrategy of strategic dispersal.\n  Strategic dispersal has guided our Navy in protecting our fleet for \nmore than 150 years. Creating greater flexibility and additional \nsafeguards for these capital ships is necessary in ensuring continuity \nin our Navy's efforts to tactically position our naval assets.\n  Currently, the Pacific fleet has three nuclear carrier homeports and \nmaintenance facilities at San Diego, Pearl Harbor, and Bremerton; while \nthe Atlantic Fleet has only one at Norfolk. As you might imagine, this \nnot only places a tremendous burden on Norfolk, but it also creates a \ntremendous liability.\n  Last year, all five of the East Coast's nuclear aircraft carriers \nwere in port simultaneously for 35 days. Two or more carriers were in \nport or undergoing routine maintenance in the sole east coast facility \n81 percent of the time.\n  If, Heaven forbid, tragedy should strike or Norfolk were to become \ninoperative, the impact on the Atlantic fleet's ability to meet our \nnational security needs would decrease immensely.\n  Sixty-seven years ago, more than 2,400 brave men and women in uniform \nwere tragically killed while another 1,200 were wounded in the Japanese \nattack at Pearl Harbor. The attack taught our Nation an important \nlesson: assets and resources should not be concentrated in one place.\n  Mayport has been the home to conventional aircraft carriers for more \nthan 50 years and is proud to be playing a role as the Navy continues \ntransitioning to an all-nuclear powered fleet.\n  The Navy's decision to make Mayport nuclear-ready has been given \ncareful consideration. The former Chief of Naval Operations, ADM Vernon \nClark, told the Armed Services Committee in February 2005 that in his \nview, ``over-centralization of the [carrier] port structure is not a \ngood strategic move . . . the Navy should have two carrier-capable \nhomeports on each coast.'' Admiral Clark went on to say, ``. . . it is \nmy belief that it would be a serious strategic mistake to have all of \nthose key assets of our Navy tied up in one port.''\n  In another Armed Services Committee hearing, I had the opportunity to \nask the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staffs ADM Mike Mullen his \nthoughts on the viability of Mayport as a nuclear-ready port. In \nresponse, Admiral Mullen said, ``I also consider the King's Bay, \nMayport, Jacksonville hub a vital part of our both strategic \ninterests--strategic interests and key for not just capability but for \nour people for the future. . . .''\n  In addition to the Navy, the decision is preferred by the Department \nof Defense, Department of Commerce, the National Marine Fisheries \nService, and the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  In November, the Navy released an Environmental Impact Study \nidentifying why expanding Mayport is critical to our Navy's future. In \nthe report, the Navy expressed concern over Norfolk's current physical \ncapacity, which is at its peak. In order to ensure capacity for future \nships, the report recommended utilizing the space available at Mayport.\n  Another concern is the risk posed by hurricanes. In the Navy's \nreport, it was determined that, historically, the hurricane risk at \nNorfolk is statistically identical to Jacksonville. Given the \nstatistical similarities between these two ports and reality of \nhurricanes to any city on the east coast, having the flexibility of a \nsecond nuclear-ready homeport on the Eastern Seaboard is essential in \nmitigating the risk these storms pose to our naval assets.\n  The report also addressed the impact an expansion at Mayport would \nhave on the local habitat. The report found that an expansion at \nMayport would not pose a risk to the marine mammals or the local \nessential fish habitat.\n  Perhaps most importantly, the report determined that expanding \nMayport serves our national security interests. The report's findings \nindicated, ``the most compelling strategic rationale to homeport a \nnuclear carrier in Mayport is as a hedge against a catastrophic event \nat Norfolk.''\n  So I want to commend the Navy's leadership for making this important \ndecision--a decision they admit is long overdue. I also want to \nrecognize Navy Secretary Donald Winter and Chief of Naval Operations, \nADM Gary Roughead for working tirelessly toward making a nuclear-ready \nMayport a reality. The decision is a tremendous step forward for our \nNavy and a critical component to our future national security efforts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, are we on the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \nor is this morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. We are postcloture on S. 22, the lands bill.\n\n\n                              Fair Pay Act\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, tomorrow, it is my understanding we \nwill be--or sometime in the next period of a day or so, I think--we \nwill be on the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. A number of my colleagues have \nspoken on the floor today about it, and I wish to talk about that bill \nbecause I want there to be a full record before we go forward to vote \non a cloture motion on that act.\n  I am a woman who has experienced gender discrimination. I have \nexperienced it firsthand. I know how hard it can be to deal with for a \nwoman, or any person who has been discriminated against for any reason \nin the workplace. I am pleased we are going to address this issue. I \nthink it is very important that we have all of the considerations \naround this bill as we go forward so that we do not have unintended \nconsequences.\n  I have been a small business owner. I know the importance of clarity, \nof knowing if you have made a mistake or a potential mistake, or if you \nare accused of making a mistake and the liability that might go along \nwith that. I think it is important that we recognize this is not just a \nwoman's issue, it is an issue for every person, whether it is age \ndiscrimination or some other kind of discrimination that might be used \nagainst a person in the workplace.\n\n[[Page S365]]\n\n  We want to have fair pay in our country. That is something I think \nall of us can agree is very important for America, but this bill should \nbe fully vetted. One of the problems I have with it is the process. We \nhave not ever gone to committee with this bill. In our committees, as \nthey have functioned in the past, we have been able to have numerous \namendments, we have been able to hear from all sides of an issue, and \ngenerally, in committees, when a bill is coming out, there has been \nmuch work done on it and it is a much better bill before it hits the \nfloor. I think everyone with any experience in this body can see the \ndifference between a bill that has not gone through committee, not had \nthe proper input, not had the hearings, not had the debate in the \nmarkup, versus a bill we try to write on the floor with 100 people who \nmay or may not know all of the businesses or women or ethnic groups \nthat might have a say that is important to hear on an issue such as \nthis.\n  We had a cloture vote on this bill last Congress, and in the \nintervening months we could have had a committee hearing, we could have \nhad witnesses come forward on both sides, but we didn't. Senator Enzi \nhas made a very strong point--because he is the ranking member on the \nrelevant committee--that their committee has acted in a very bipartisan \nway, when he was chairman or when he has been ranking member. There has \nbeen cooperation. This could be a bill that would get 100 votes in this \nbody. But that is not the bill that is going to come before us.\n  I have introduced a substitute--I introduced it last year and I have \nintroduced it again this year--with cosponsors Enzi, Voinovich, \nAlexander, Cornyn, Burr, and Murkowski, because we want a responsible \napproach to address employment discrimination. I hope we will be able \nto have amendments on this bill. I am told the majority leader has \nagreed that we will, and our Republican leader has said he wants to \nwork with the majority leader to assure that we do have some reasonable \nnumber of amendments that might make this a better bill that we could \nall support and know that it will make fairness in the workplace \nbetter.\n  The bill that will be before us is a bill that I think has not been \nfully explained. The supporters say the legislation will restore the \nstate of employment discrimination law to the place where it rested \nbefore the Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter. In fact, it was said \non the floor here earlier that we should overturn the Supreme Court \nruling. This statement has largely gone unchallenged, but in truth this \nbill does more than what the supporters are suggesting. The practical \neffect is to eliminate any meaningful statute of limitations on the \nvalidity of claims, meaning that employees could sue on alleged \ndiscrimination that occurred years ago, even decades ago.\n  The bill accomplishes this by treating every paycheck as a new \ntrigger to start a new filing period. The result of this would \nbasically do two things: One is if a discriminatory act occurs, the \nemployer would be liable for that action indefinitely. They could be \nsued for it any time as long as the employee continues to receive the \npaychecks. It wouldn't matter that the passage of a significant amount \nof time, perhaps decades, could make it virtually impossible for the \nbusiness to expect this legal expense and prepare for it and impossible \nto offer a defense or to learn what happened. In Lilly Ledbetter's own \ncase so much time had passed between the actual act of discrimination \nthat was alleged and the filing of the claim that the supervisor who \nwas accused of the past discrimination was deceased. There was no one \nthere who could have testified that there had been some motivation or \nno motivation. There was no ability because the person had long since \nleft the company and was deceased.\n  In addition, I think for fairness to all sides, there has to be a \ntime in which a claim is brought or lapses. In almost every area of the \nlaw--I cannot remember that there is any other area--claims become \ninvalid after a period of time. That provides certainty. That is \nessential to our justice system. Witnesses have to be available with a \nreasonable amount of recordkeeping or records or some way to ask \nquestions of a person who is accused of some wrongdoing. I think it is \nso important that in our justice system we have the ability for a fair \ntrial--for the person who is claiming a discrimination and the person \nwho is defending against that discrimination to have the right to make \na case. That is what our justice system has protected through statutes \nof limitations or having a time period in which you must make a claim \nor that right lapses.\n  Another problem with the bill is the addition of three words, which \nsound kind of innocuous, I guess. According to the bill, it is not only \nthe person who is discriminated against who has the right for a claim, \nbut a third party who claims to be affected by that discrimination. \nWith such broad language, you are opening the field to innumerable \nlawsuits. Wouldn't it be irrational to have a law in which an heir of a \ndeceased person could potentially have the ability to file a suit, \nsaying that, as a third party, they are affected by a discrimination?\n  I think we are going down a very treacherous road here. I think if we \nhad a committee hearing and the ability to go to markup, this could be \na good bill, because I definitely want to make sure that we have fair \npay for all of the people in our country. I have heard from many small \nand mid-sized businesses around the country, saying they are not \nopposed to giving workers a fair shake, but they oppose this bill \nbecause they are concerned about the catastrophic increase in legal \ncosts resulting from an undisciplined system that allows liability to \ncontinue indefinitely.\n  The explosion of litigation from allegations possibly many years old \ncould be an enormous strain on a small or mid-sized business, and could \nactually result in reduced employment. Certainly at this particular \ntime, when we know we should be creating jobs in America, we should not \nbe creating more burdens on the businesses that are providing jobs.\n  The bill I have introduced goes beyond simply providing additional \ntime for workers to file claims. It would have the consequence of \nallowing a person to file if they knew or should have known of the act \nof discrimination, and they would have the 180 days to do that. It \nwould make it a uniform codified law that everyone in America would be \ntreated the same. Some districts in America do say that you have a \nburden to show you didn't know if there was a discrimination and that \nis why you are bringing the case beyond the 180 days. But if you knew \nor should have known, then you can say, I couldn't possibly have known, \nand the judge can make the determination if your claim is reasonable. \nThat is what we would codify, that an employee would have the \nopportunity to say they were not aware, nor could they have been aware, \nthat there was a discrimination.\n  Now, if you are fired or demoted, that is clearly a triggering action \nin which you should know that there might be discrimination. If you \nbelieve you have been unjustly demoted or fired, as an employee, you \nare then on notice that a discriminatory act has been taken against \nyou. Then it is a harder case for the employee to say they needed more \nthan 180 days. But the area where we want them to conserve the \nemployee's ability to file a lawsuit is in pay discrimination, because \noften it is difficult for the employee to know that maybe they were not \ngetting what their coworker was getting. So I think my bill, which I \nhope to be able to offer as a substitute amendment, would be a fair way \nto say to the employee, if they feel they have been discriminated \nagainst because of their gender or their age, they will have the \nability to come forward and say, it is within the 6 months that I have \nlearned of my discrimination. Or here is why I couldn't know of that \ndiscrimination, and either way, they would have the ability to have \nthat decided by the judge or the EEOC.\n  I think that is a reasonable approach so that the business will know \nwhat their range of liability potentially is, which every small or mid-\nsized business needs to know. We want to make sure there is a fairness \nfor the defense and fairness for the plaintiff in these cases. We want \nto make sure we have a reasonable standard, and I think my bill \nprovides that. It provides more leeway and a standard which everyone \nwould know is the same across our country.\n  I think the underlying bill is flawed in that it gives third parties \nwho are\n\n[[Page S366]]\n\nnot the person who is discriminated against a right of action. I think \nthat opens the door much too wide and offers the potential for abuse if \nthe person who actually had the discrimination might not have wanted to \nbring a case or felt discriminated against--but to give a third party \nthe right to sue and claim they are affected I think is going way \nbeyond our concept of discrimination. Second, I do think it is very \nimportant that we have a standard here that is the standard throughout \nour justice system and that is you need to bring a case in a timely \nway, for the rights of everyone--for defendants as well as the memories \nof people who would want to be making the case that there is a \ndiscriminatory act.\n\n  I want fair pay. I want to eliminate discrimination in our workplace. \nI want people to have the right to sue. I want there to be a reasonable \ntime in which they can do this, and I think that is what the bill that \nI hope to be able to offer as a substitute will do. Mine is the Title \nVII Fairness Act, which has been introduced with cosponsors. I think if \nwe can write this bill in a way that can bring fairness to all sides. \nIt would not overburden businesses with undefendable lawsuits and would \ngive more leeway to the people who have discovered that they were \ndiscriminated against and need more time to bring a case, that, in \nfact, would be the best result for our country.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to speak. I certainly will have the \nopportunity to speak, I hope, again when I am able to offer my \namendment. I hope the Senate will function going into the future, where \nwe have committee hearings, committee markups on bills so we can have \nthe maximum input to go forward and have good legislation and not \nlegislation that has unintended consequences that would hurt the \nworkplace and the rights of people in our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Shaheen pertaining to the introduction of S. 239 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. McCaskill). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for such time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Economic Bailout\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, I have been pretty outspoken in the last \nseveral weeks on the $700 billion bailout. I still believe historians \nwill look back someday and say it was the most outrageous vote ever \ntaken. It is the largest single expenditure in the history of the \ncountry.\n  To make matters worse, it was giving an unelected bureaucrat total \npower, usurping our powers, to make all decisions over the $700 billion \nwith no oversight whatsoever. It had never been done before. It was \nunprecedented in American history. Nobody seems to care. It is mind-\nboggling to me to know that it happened, and now it looks as though we \nwill be voting in the other body as well as here on a motion that would \nbe hostile to the whole idea, but it will not pass. The money is going \nto be there anyway. The reason is, if the legislation that will be \ncoming before the House and the Senate is passed, it still can be \nvetoed by the President, and it would be vetoed by the President. So \nall of a sudden he is going to have the second half of the $700 \nbillion, the $350 billion laid at his doorstep to do with as he wishes.\n  I wouldn't want that for a Republican President or a Democratic \nPresident, for any President. It is not the way we are supposed to \nfunction. I believe it is a fait accompli. I don't see any way a \nresolution of disapproval is going to be effective, because I think it \nis going to pass the House and very likely could pass here. I am \ninclined to think it will not. Whatever the case is, it will become a \nreality.\n  That is bad for many reasons. It establishes a precedent. People look \nat large numbers, and it is difficult for the American people and for \nme to appreciate how much money is $700 billion. What I normally do \nwhen we deal with large numbers is, I take the total number of families \nin America who file tax returns and do the math. This turns out to be \n$5,000 a family. When I say it in those terms, which I have done quite \na bit on talk radio as a wake-up call to the American people, then \npeople do understand.\n  I have been a little critical of my own President, President Bush, \nbecause he has let this happen. This wasn't a Democratic idea or a \nRepublican idea. It was the President's idea, in concert with the \nDemocrats, making this happen. This vote took place on October 10. Ever \nsince October 10, I have had legislation I have tried to get through \nsaying that it is not going to be automatic. Accessing the second $350 \nbillion should not be automatic, and we had legislation to keep it from \nbeing so until 2 nights ago when President Bush agreed to a wish list \nby our new President when he comes into power. It is going to happen. \nAgain, this is unprecedented in American history. It has never happened \nbefore.\n  I have been critical of the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Paulson, \nfor telling us what he was going to do with the money and then turning \naround and not doing it. He did not tell us the truth. It is \ndisingenuous. Nonetheless, it is something that looks as though it will \nbe happening and it looks as though it will happen this week.\n  In defense of President Bush, if we take the total amount of deficits \nof the 8 years of his presidency from his own budget, add them up and \ndivide by 8, it averages $247 billion a year. Compare that with what we \nare faced with right now with the new administration which has said it \nis going to be somewhere between $1.2 and $1.8 trillion. I think people \nwill look at this and say that the Bush legacy is not going to be one \nof deficits, because it is nothing compared to the deficits we are \nprojecting for the coming year, as proposed by the incoming President.\n  The reason I mention that is because I have somewhat accused \nPresident Bush of looking for a legacy. It occurs to me that George W. \nBush has a legacy that may be unlike any other President in history. I \ncall this the invisible legacy of President George W. Bush. I will \nexplain in detail how I have come to this conclusion.\n  President Bush inherited a weaker America militarily. All of a \nsudden, after he came in, 9/11 occurred. So let's go back in history. \nWhen George W. Bush was inaugurated in 2001, he was already behind the \npower curve when it came to the war on terror. As the 9/11 Commission \nconfirmed, the United States was not on a wartime footing with al-\nQaida, even though they were at war with us. While our country took its \npeace dividend, our enemies continued to train, plot, and test. It was \na peace dividend, a euphoric attitude that the Cold War is over, and we \ndon't need a military anymore. That is what we were living with at the \ntime.\n  International terrorism took the forefront as bin Laden began his war \nagainst freedom and specifically against the United States. Afghanistan \nwas used as a training ground for terrorists, and the Taliban regime \nallowed al-Qaida unfettered mobility. They took advantage of this in \nmajor attacks.\n  Look at what happened back in the 1990s. This was a predicate leading \nto 9/11, the worst tragedy in the history of America. On February 26, \n1993, a car bomb was planted in an underground parking garage below the \nWorld Trade Center. This was the first World Trade Center attack. On \nJune 25, 1996, the Khobar Towers were bombed by Hezbollah, with \nintelligence pointing to support by al-Qaida. That was 1996. We knew \nal-Qaida was on the run at that time. We knew of their abilities, the \nincreasing sophistication in their terrorist attacks. On August 7, \n1998, we recall what happened in Tanzania and Kenya and Nairobi and Dar \nes Salaam. Our embassies were bombed. Links were at that time \nestablished with al-Qaida. In October 2000, suicide bombers used a boat \nto attack the USS Cole while it was moored in Yemen. It was\n\n[[Page S367]]\n\none we all remember well, and we remember how it happened. We know the \nterrorist links that took place at that time. The response of the \nUnited States was at best inconsistent.\n\n  Operation Infinite Reach included cruise missile strikes against \nAfghanistan and Sudan, but there was no real change. This inadequate \nresponse has been cited as a factor in emboldening al-Qaida's will to \nundertake more ambitious plans. That was simply kind of small. They had \nbigger plans. We know that now.\n  In Operation Restore Hope, we became entangled in Somalia. We \nremember that very well, with the naked bodies being dragged through \nthe streets of Mogadishu, and America finally woke up, but we did not \ndo anything. We kind of let it happen. We directed our forces to stop \nall actions against Adid except for those required for self-defense. \nWell, that is not a very good message, not a consistent message with \nour behavior in the past. So we withdrew from the country shortly \nthereafter.\n  We also failed to remain vigilant of the Chinese.\n  Security at our national labs was deliberately destroyed. We did away \nwith--and this happened actually in the first few weeks of the Clinton-\nGore administration. They went through the energy labs and they stopped \nthe wiretapping, they stopped the background checks they were \nconducting at the time. They stopped color-coded badges saying it was \ndemeaning to have a color of a badge that was on a lower scale than \nsomebody else's. So that is what happened. Of course, we know the \nresults of that.\n  In 1995, we discovered that China had stolen our W-88 warhead plans. \nThat was the crown jewel of our nuclear program, capable of attaching \n10 nuclear missiles to a single warhead. But they had it. They got it. \nThey got it because of a lack of security that was the policy of that \nadministration at the time, and I was critical at that time.\n  I remember Bernard Schwartz of Loral Space and Communications. They \nwere given a green light to improve the precision and reliability of \nChina's satellites and nuclear missiles. To refresh our memories--I \nremember it very well--it required the President to sign a waiver, a \nspecial waiver, so the Chinese missile program would have greater \naccuracy. That happened during the 1990s.\n  China also gained the capability of accurately reaching the \ncontinental United States with missiles and targeted between 13 and 18 \nUnited States cities. I was critical of President Clinton for claiming, \nat that time--he said: Not one missile is pointed at American children, \nwhen in fact missiles were pointed at American children. That was \nhappening during the 1990s.\n  Simultaneously, weapons of mass destruction proliferation throughout \nthe world reached an unprecedented level. The Chinese Government \nlearned that it could rely on our acquiescence. They transferred \nprohibited weapons technology to North Korea, Pakistan, Iran, Iraq, \nSyria, and other countries, threatened to absorb Taiwan, and \nintimidated our regional treaty allies, South Korea and Japan.\n  The vast Soviet Union nuclear stockpile became fair game for \nentrepreneurs, with over 40 kilograms of Russian-origin uranium and \nplutonium being seized since 1991.\n  Then remember Abdul Qadeer Khan, the father of Pakistan's nuclear \nprogram, who began an international network of clandestine nuclear \nproliferation to Libya, Iran, and North Korea. North Korea withdrew \nfrom the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty on March 12, 1993, and \nrefused to allow inspectors access to its nuclear sites. And Libya \nfurther continued weapons of mass destruction research as a priority.\n  Now, despite the increase in terrorist activities around the world \nand the growing signs of a direct threat to this country, we \nessentially broke our intelligence community through the lack of \nfunding, an inadequate number of linguists, and no interagency \ncooperation.\n  I have to say this. My predecessor to this job was former Senator \nDavid Boren. David Boren's young son Dan is a very talented young man \nnow serving in the House of Representatives. I was in the House and \ncame to the Senate in 1994. I took his seat.\n  He at that time was chairman of the Intelligence Committee of the \nSenate, and he made the statement to me--he called me up, and he said: \nInhofe, I want you to try to do something I failed to do during the \ntime I was chairman of the Intelligence Committee in the Senate. He \nsaid: We have all these agencies--the FBI, the NSA, all the defense \nintelligence agencies--and none of them talks to each other. Then I \nfound out later on that was so true. He said: You have to get this \ndone. That has to be a high priority. I told him it would be. We were \nnot able to do anything until George W. Bush came in.\n  If this was not enough, with the demise of the Soviet Union, our \nmilitary was essentially neutered to counter a ``perceived'' diminished \nworld threat. I remember so well this euphoric attitude that everybody \nhad: The Cold War is over. We don't need a military anymore.\n  The Clinton-Gore administration cut the defense budget by 40 percent, \nreducing it to its lowest percentage of the GNP since prior to World \nWar II. As a result, President Bush inherited a force half the size of \nthe military in 1990.\n  Now, as our forces decreased in size and capability, deployments and \ndeployment times increased. We have all seen the results. We now have \n15-month deployments. They used to be 9-month deployments. We have \nthese because he inherited this military that was undersized for the \nthreat we are facing.\n  I have a chart in the Chamber I will show as documentation of this \nfact. During the Clinton years--and I do not say this to denigrate the \nadministration; I am saying we have to understand how we got in the \nposition we are in today and that we have been in since 9/11. If you \ntake the black line on the chart--this is during the Clinton \nadministration--if he had taken the military budget as it was at that \ntime and had the increase for inflation, it would have been this black \nline going up, shown on the chart. Instead, the red line shows what his \nbudget request was. If you take the difference between the red line and \nthe black line, that is $412 billion reduced from when he took office.\n  That is how we got into this position. We downgraded our military, \nand a lot of people believed the threat was not there anymore because \nthe Cold War was over, not looking at the new asymmetric threats, which \nare much greater.\n  I sometimes look back wistfully at the Cold War. Things were \npredictable back then. We knew what the Soviets were going to do--the \nSoviets, not the Russians--and we knew what their capabilities were. \nThese were known things, known behavioral patterns. It was totally \ndifferent than what we have today.\n  So the programs, the modernization efforts, and the equipment \nreplacement costs were literally kicked down the road and left waiting \nin the wings. This happened to our modernization program. It happened \nin many areas. This has been very demoralizing to most of us who \nbelieve we have to keep America's national defense strong.\n  We saw countries coming up with better systems than we have. We have, \nfor example, the artillery piece, the best one we have today now that \nwe are modernizing. But we did not have that at that time. We had one \ncalled the Paladin. That was World War II technology. You have to get \nout and swab the breach after every shot.\n  There were five countries at that time, including South Africa, that \nmade a better piece than we had, and we are still using this today. It \nwas not until a very courageous general, GEN John Jumper, came up and \nadmitted, in 1998, that the best strike vehicles we had--the F-15 and \nthe F-16--were not as good as some of the SU series being developed in \nRussia and actually were being sold to the Chinese--we know of one sale \nwhere they bought 240 SU-30 type of vehicles--again, better than \nanything we had.\n  So, again, that is where we were before George W. Bush was elected.\n  Now enter President George W. Bush.\n  Starting with his first budget submission after inauguration, he \nproposed increases in defense spending and focused his Pentagon team on \nreform. He started with recognizing and revitalizing the military for \nthe post-Cold War world it now faced. He provided the military with the \nfunding required\n\n[[Page S368]]\n\nto develop force structure and modernize its aging force. So he was \ngetting in there and starting to do something about the modernization \nprogram.\n\n  Then, of course, 9/11 happened. Well, 9/11, we all know about that. \nWe know what a tragedy it was, with the most significant attack in \nAmerica in our history. It came at a time when we had a downsized \nmilitary, downsized by about 40 percent. So he was saddled with trying \nto respond to this situation, and he did.\n  He asked Congress for new authorities and began to implement sweeping \nchanges in our national security policy. In this new policy he declared \na war on terror. This is what he said--I want to read the quote from \nback at that time:\n\n       We will direct every resource at our command--every means \n     of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of \n     law enforcement, every financial influence, and every \n     necessary weapon of war--to the disruption and to the defeat \n     of the global terror network.\n\n  That is what he said at that time. Then he outlined the country's \nstrategy. He said:\n\n       First, we're determined to prevent the attacks of terrorist \n     networks before they occur. . . .\n\n  Unlike it was on 9/11.\n\n       Second, we're determined to deny weapons of mass \n     destruction to outlaw regimes and\n     to their terrorist allies who would use \n     them. . . .\n       Third, we're determined to deny radical groups the support \n     and sanctuary of outlaw regimes. . . .\n       Fourth, we're determined to deny militants control of any \n     nation.\n\n  And he did. He asked Congress for the PATRIOT Act--listen to the \nthings he did--the PATRIOT Act to break down walls between Government \nagencies. That is getting back to what David Boren observed many years \nago back in 1994 that had to be done.\n  In October of 2001, he initiated Operation Enduring Freedom to \ndismantle the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, which is harboring al-\nQaida. Bombing runs and Tomahawk missile strikes were launched.\n  In October of 2001, President Bush established the Office of Homeland \nSecurity. This was a coordinating effort that corrects the problem that \nwas called to my attention in 1994, so everything would be coordinated \nand everyone would know what everyone is supposed to be doing.\n  The 9/11 Commission was formed and he began implementing its \nrecommendations, including intelligence reform, which included \nestablishing the Director of National Intelligence. There you have it. \nThat is the key. One Director over all intelligence: military \nintelligence, domestic intelligence--and it worked.\n  On March of 2003, President Bush launched Operation Iraqi Freedom, \npreemptive attacks against Saddam Hussein, a gathering threat to the \nUnited States, who was reportedly developing ties with our enemies and \nwho openly praised the 9/11 attacks.\n  I remember that very well because in the first gulf war--which we \nshould have gone ahead and taken care of Saddam Hussein at that time; \nwe did not do it, and there are some reasons it could not be done--I \nhappened to be privileged to be with nine other people on the first \nfreedom flight that went into Kuwait after the war was over. Now, it \nwas so close to the time the first Persian Gulf war was over that there \nwas still burning off the fields, and there were a lot of them. The \nIraqis did not know the war was over, the ones who were in there.\n  I remember so well one of the parties who was going over was the \nAmbassador from Kuwait to the United States and his daughter. I think \nshe was around 7 years old. What they wanted to do was go back and see \nwhat was left in Kuwait of their mansion on the Persian Gulf. We got \nback there, and I remember going back to see their mansion, only to \nfind out Saddam Hussein had used this for one of his headquarters. They \ntook the little girl up to her bedroom--she wanted to see her little \nanimals and all that--to find out it had been used as a torture \nchamber, with body parts stuck to the walls around there. This is what \nwe were looking at at that time.\n  Well, President Bush established the National Counterterrorism Center \nto assist in analyzing and integrating foreign and domestic \nintelligence acquired from all U.S. Government Departments and \nagencies--so, again, putting this all together.\n  He established the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office, in the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, to provide a single Federal \norganization to develop and deploy a nuclear detection system to thwart \nthe importation of illegal nuclear or radiological materials.\n  In order to consolidate terrorist watch lists and provide around-the-\nclock operational support for Federal and other governmental law \nenforcement personnel across the country and around the world, \nPresident Bush created the Terrorist Screening Center to ensure that \nGovernment investigators, screeners, and agents are working with the \nsame unified, comprehensive set of information about terrorists.\n  He transformed the FBI to focus on preventing terrorism.\n  He strengthened the Transportation Security Administration through \nscreening and prevention. He improved border screening.\n\n  All of these things he did in a very short period of time that had to \nbe done and had never been done before.\n  He expanded shipping security through container security initiatives. \nHe developed Project Bioshield to increase preparedness against \nchemical, biological, and radiological, or nuclear attack, potential \nattack against this country. Finally, he aggressively cracked down on \nterrorist financing with many international partners. Over 400 \nindividuals and entities have been designated pursuant to Executive \norder, resulting in nearly $150 million in frozen assets and millions \nmore blocked in transit or seized at the borders.\n  President Bush also rallied international support to fight terrorism \nwith a coalition of more than 90 countries. We didn't do this alone. He \nbrought in neighboring countries, other countries with the same \nproblems that we had, and the same exposure. This coalition of nations \nhas actively worked to synchronize diplomatic intelligence, law \nenforcement, economic and financial and military power to attack \nterrorism globally. One man did this. This is George W. Bush.\n  The result of all of these efforts is what I refer to as the Bush \ninvisible legacy. Now, why is this an invisible legacy? I am going to \nshow my colleagues things that were out there that could very well have \nhappened to the United States of America--and some would have \nhappened--but since they didn't happen, that legacy is invisible \nbecause they never happened. That, to me, is going to go down as one of \nthe great legacies of any President in the history of the United \nStates.\n  There has not been another attack on this country since 9/11, and do \nnot think this was due to a lack of effort on the part of terrorists. \nIn fact, there have been many attempts. I am going to give my \ncolleagues a partial list of the attacks that were stopped as a result \nof all of these policies and programs I just outlined that our \nPresident--current President George W. Bush--was responsible for.\n  First, December of 2001: This is the first post-9/11 plot that was \nthwarted. It was the capture of an al-Qaida operative named Ali Salih \nMari in the United States who was targeting water reservoirs and the \nNew York Stock Exchange at that time. Also, he was targeting--he had \nhis programs outlined in documents that we found through all of these \nefforts to attack our various military academies. He offered himself as \na martyr to Khalid Sheikh Mohammad. Of course, we know he was the \nmastermind of 9/11. Anyway, all of this was planned, but I believe Bush \npolicies stopped the attacks.\n  I have to say at this point that I have served on the Intelligence \nCommittee. I served for a number of years--ever since 1994--on the \nSenate Armed Services Committee. So I have been involved in these \nissues. We know this had a lot to do with stopping some of these \npotential attacks.\n  Remember Jose Padilla. He is the guy who had the dirty bomb plot, an \nAmerican citizen accused of seeking radioactive-laced dirty bombs to \nuse in attacks against America. Again, this was a Bush program that \nbrought him down.\n  The 2002 aviation plots: An al-Qaida leader in Southeast Asia known \nas Humbali recruited several other\n\n[[Page S369]]\n\noperatives of Asian origin. The plot was derailed in early 2002 with \ninternational cooperation. The Library Tower is the tallest building \nwest of the Mississippi. It was among the 25 tallest buildings in the \nworld. There was a written program about how to bring this building \ndown, and our policies--the Bush policies, primarily--stopped that from \ntaking place.\n  In September of 2002, Lackawanna Six: We all remember that. The FBI \nthwarted the locally recruited terrorist cell, the Lackawanna Six, by \nthe capturing of Juma all-Dosari in Afghanistan and a subsequent \ninterrogation while in prison in Guantanamo Bay. By the way, I disagree \nwith the current attitude toward what is going to happen at Guantanamo \nBay. I have had occasion to be there, probably more than any other \nMember. I can remember so well early on, those who were in prison, \nincarcerated in Guantanamo Bay actually had better treatment, better \nliving quarters, and better health attention than our own troops did at \nthat time. I think it is going to be imperative that whoever wants to \nclose that down ask: Where are all of these people going to go?\n  Six American citizens of Yemeni origin were convicted of supporting \nal-Qaida after attending a Jihadist camp in Pakistan. Five of the six \nwere from Lackawanna, NY. The six were arrested and convicted. They are \nout now. They performed terrorist attacks. They were very specific. \nThey are gone. I think the new Bush programs at that time were \nprimarily responsible for that.\n  In May of 2003, we had the Brooklyn Bridge plot: An American citizen \nwas charged with plotting to use blow torches to collapse the Brooklyn \nBridge. After being introduced to al-Qaida operatives, New York and \nFederal authorities intercepted a plan to collapse the Brooklyn Bridge \nby cutting suspension cables, as well as potentially derailing a train \nen route to Washington, DC. Iyman Faris was arrested, brought to \njustice, and was successfully stopped.\n  In June of 2003 in Virginia, a Jihad network that was taking place, \n11 men from Alexandria, VA--just south of here--trained for Jihad \nagainst American soldiers and were convicted of violating the \nNeutrality Act, a conspiracy. Eleven Muslim men were charged in the \nU.S. district court in Alexandria with training with and fighting with \na group that was associated with al-Qaida. Several members of the group \nwere found to have trained for future attacks by using paint ball \nfacilities in the Northern Virginia area. It was stopped. The Bush \npolicies were primarily responsible for giving us the resources to stop \nattacks such as those I am outlining.\n  In 2004, August of 2004, the financial centers plot: This was the \nIndian-born leader of a terror cell who plotted the bombing on the \nfinancial centers. His name was Barot. He plotted a ``memorable black \nday of terror'' via a dirty bomb that targeted financial institutions \nin New York, Washington, DC, and in Newark. Barot was arrested at his \nhome in Pakistan with the cooperation of others, but again, these were \nthe Bush policies and resources that we used to make this happen.\n  In August of 2004--the same month--a Penn Station plot: This was \nJames Elshafay and two accomplices who sought to plant a bomb at New \nYork's Penn Station near Madison Square Garden during the Republican \nNational Convention. The New York City Police Department's intelligence \ndivision helped to conduct an investigation leading to their arrest, \nagain, using the policies that President Bush had put in place.\n  The same month, the Pakistani diplomat assassination plot: We all \nremember that. Two leaders of an Albany, NY, mosque, Yassin and \nMohammed Hossain, were charged with plotting to purchase a shoulder-\nfired grenade launcher to assassinate a Pakistani diplomat. An \ninvestigation took place by the FBI, and all of these other agencies \ncoordinating under the single leadership of the new system put in \nplace, they stopped it. With the help of an informant, the perpetrators \nof that plot have been brought to justice. Again, that was stopped.\n  August of 2005, Orange County, CA, a terror plot: Seven people were \ninvolved and were arrested in Los Angeles and charged with conspiracy \nto attack Los Angeles National Guard facilities and synagogues, several \nsynagogues. The plan was there; it is in writing. We know it was going \nto happen. Kevin James allegedly founded a radical Islamic prison group \nand converted Levar Washington and others to the group which was known \nas the JIS. After Washington and Patterson were arrested for robberies, \npolice and Federal agents began a terrorist investigation where the \nsearch of Washington's apartment revealed a suspicious target list.\n  We had a list of targets in Orange County that were going to be \nbrought down. Again, these policies weren't available to us before the \nBush administration, and we were able to stop that.\n  December of 2005, the gas lines plot: Michael Reynolds was arrested \nby the FBI in December of 2005 and charged with being involved in a \nplot to blow up a Wyoming natural gas refinery, the Transcontinental \nPipeline. That is a national gas pipeline that goes from the gulf coast \nto the east coast and into New Jersey. I believe it is owned by the New \nJersey Standard Oil refinery. Reynolds was convicted for providing \nmaterials for supporting terrorists and soliciting a crime of violence. \nAgain, we used the new resources that were available because of our \nPresident, George W. Bush.\n\n  In April of 2006, the U.S. Capitol and World Bank plot: Syed Haris \nAhmed and another one whose name is Ehsanul Islam Sadequee from \nAtlanta, GA, were accused of conspiracy, having discussed terrorist \ntargets with alleged terrorist organizations. They met with Islam \nextremists and received training and instruction on how to gather \nvideotape surveillance of potential targets in the Washington area. \nTheir targets happened to be the U.S. Capitol--right here where we are \nstanding today--and the World Bank headquarters. They were the targets \nand, again, we were able to intercept this and to bring them to justice \nunder these new policies that were put in place by our current \nPresident.\n  We had Narseal Batiste, and he had six others who were involved in a \nSears Tower plot. They were arrested in Miami and in Atlanta in June of \n2006 for being in the early stages of a plot to blow up the Sears Tower \nin Chicago as well as FBI offices and several other buildings. Arrests \nresulted from an investigation involving an FBI informant and all of \nthe rest of them working together with the new resources they had, and \nthey were brought to justice. Again, this was the new system we had in \nplace.\n  July of 2006, New York City, the train tunnel plot: It is frightening \nto think this could have happened. There were eight suspects, including \nAssem Hammoud, an al-Qaida loyalist living in Lebanon. They were \narrested for plotting to bomb the New York City train tunnels. He was a \nself-proclaimed operative for al-Qaida. He admitted that he was with \nal-Qaida when we brought him to justice, and he admitted to the plot. \nHe is currently in custody in Lebanon and his case is pending. Two \nother suspects are in custody in other locations. The bottom line is it \ndidn't happen. It was precluded from happening as a result of the new \nresources that were put in place and the coordination of all of our \nintelligence committees.\n  In March of 2007, a skyscraper plot: This was Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. \nHe was the mastermind of 9/11 and the author of numerous other plots \nconfessed in court. People think of him as only 9/11. He also had plans \nin writing to destroy skyscrapers in New York, Los Angeles, and \nChicago, as well as a plot of an assassination of Bill Clinton and Pope \nJohn Paul II. Again, that was stopped.\n  In May of 2007, the Fort Dix plot: This was another one. I will not \ngo into detail, but this was one where the Fort Dix six were thought to \nbe leaderless. We found that they were a homegrown cell of immigrants \nfrom Jordan, Turkey, and Yugoslavia and they had ties to al-Qaida. They \nwere stopped, the plot was stopped, and they were brought to justice. I \nbelieve this was due to the new programs that were put together by the \nBush administration.\n  June of 2007, the JFK plot: Suspects planned to hit fuel farms and a \n40-mile aviation field supply pipeline. Specifically, they targeted the \nsymbolism of JFK, seeking to invoke an emotional\n\n[[Page S370]]\n\nreaction, saying it is like killing the man twice. We all know and \nremember that, and we were able to stop it.\n  I think the bottom line has been that there hasn't been another \nsuccessful attack on this country since 9/11. It didn't just happen. \nWhat this administration has accomplished in the last 5 years is \nphenomenal. In the aftermath of 9/11, he brought us together as a \nnation, prevented our enemies from striking again, and captured many \nwho would have tried. President Bush woke the Nation so we could begin \nto deal aggressively with the threats that were facing us.\n  Because of President Bush, we no longer treat terrorists like common \ncriminals but as enemy combatants. We no longer turn a blind eye to \nnuclear proliferation by negotiating without the real threat of \nmilitary action. We fully funded a readiness-challenged, cold-war-\nequipped, and organized military that had suffered from a decade of no \nmodernization. We have removed threatening regimes in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, freeing 50 million people. We have weakened the al-Qaida \nnetwork and its affiliates. We have disrupted terrorist plots and built \na coalition of more than 90 nations to fight terrorism. We have \ntransformed our approach to combating terrorism after the 9/11 attacks.\n  So we ask the question: Would all of these terrorist attacks have \nbeen successful? Obviously, no, but I honestly believe--it is my \njudgment from having the background of years of serving on the Armed \nServices Committee and the Intelligence Committee, that some of these--\nto me, it is not conceivable that none of these would have occurred. I \nbelieve this invisible legacy--keep in mind, it is an invisible legacy \nof George W. Bush because they didn't happen. If they didn't happen, \nthey are invisible, but nonetheless they were stopped.\n  The bottom line is this: The New York Stock Exchange was not bombed, \nthe military academies were not bombed, the Brooklyn Bridge was not \nbombed, New York and DC financial centers were not bombed, Penn Station \nwas not bombed, Los Angeles synagogues were not bombed, and New Jersey \nStandard Oil refineries were not bombed.\n  The transcontinental pipeline was not bombed. The World Bank was not \nbombed. The Chicago Sears Tower was not bombed. New York City train \ntunnels were not bombed. JFK Airport was not bombed. And our Nation's \nCapitol Building was not bombed. Clearly, the Bush invisible legacy may \ngo down in history as perhaps the greatest legacy in history. I know \npeople don't want to give credit where credit is due. This is something \nthat took almost all of his energies at a time when otherwise something \ncould very well have happened. It is my honest judgment that had it not \nbeen for his changes in our intelligence process, that one or more of \nthese terrorist attacks would have been successful. I believe that in \nmy heart. I think history will treat that as the case. Clearly, the \nBush invisible legacy may go down as the greatest legacy in history.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record an Oklahoman \neditorial dated January 13, 2009, and a Heritage Foundation \nBackgrounder No. 2085.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows;\n\n                  [From the Oklahoman, Jan. 13, 2009]\n\n           History Will Credit Bush With Keeping Country Safe\n\n       George W. Bush surely is right when he insists the fairest \n     histories of his presidency will be written years from now--\n     contrasting with the quick assessments and snapshot rankings \n     that are being done even before he hands the Oval Office keys \n     to Barack Obama.\n       The president asserted that and more in his last official \n     news conference Monday, parrying with reporters over the \n     accomplishments, mistakes and disappointments of eight years \n     in the White House.\n       The Bush years have been difficult, which he acknowledged. \n     Bush is a war president, and thus has been challenged to make \n     momentous decisions that involve sacrifice, trial and loss.\n       In Bush's case, a war against the forces of terror that \n     lacked the usual metrics--territory to be gained, discernible \n     armies to be defeated--made it difficult for Americans to see \n     progress, much less victory. This very much tints \n     contemporary views of the 43rd president.\n       It will take years to create perspective and permit \n     credible historic assessment of Bush's response to 9/11 and \n     his forward-leaning strategy against terrorists and their \n     allies, exemplified in the decision to topple Saddam \n     Hussein's regime in Iraq.\n       If democracy or something like it thrives in Iraq, creating \n     a democratic bulwark in the Middle East, Bush ultimately will \n     be awarded praise. If free government fails and Iraq descends \n     into ethnic chaos--or worse, becomes a new base for \n     terrorists--then the expenditures in blood and treasure under \n     Bush no doubt will be seen as a waste, to his historic \n     detriment. Same for Afghanistan.\n       Economically, the Bush years were mixed. His stewardship is \n     marked by the recession he inherited and the one he bequeaths \n     to Obama. While there were 52 months of uninterrupted job \n     growth in between, Bush likely is to be remembered for \n     failing to control government spending and not more \n     forcefully monitoring various institutions and certain \n     sectors of the economy that collapsed last year, triggering \n     the current downturn.\n       Even so, our early assessment of President Bush invariably \n     returns to his performance as commander in chief. Bottom \n     line: Since \n     9/11, the United States hasn't suffered another terrorist \n     attack.\n       That alone is remarkable. While critics would attribute \n     that to blind luck, we think history will credit bush for \n     strengthening U.S. intelligence-gathering capabilities and \n     for refusing to run away from Iraq when conditions there were \n     most grave.\n       Instead of delegating American security to allies or \n     international organizations, he accepted the obligation \n     knowing it probably would consume his presidency.\n       Certainly, President Bush made mistakes, and he conceded a \n     few Monday. But in the supreme test of his watch he was \n     steadfast, and the country is safe for it--which most likely \n     will be history's focus.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  [From the Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 2085, Nov. 13, 2007]\n\n    Thwarted Terror Plots Against the U.S. Since September 11, 2001\n\n       Sept. 11, 2001.

I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                          The Bush Presidency\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise to offer some thoughts and \nobservations about the Presidency of George W. Bush as his time in \noffice comes to a close. This is truly a time to thank God for our \ncountry, for our system of government, and for our liberty--\nunparalleled in the history of the world.\n  President Bush served at a time of great challenge and even crisis \nfor our country and I wish to focus on him both as a President and a \nperson.\n  When America's Founders gathered in Philadelphia in 1787, it is said \nsomeone asked Benjamin Franklin, the Constitutional Convention's oldest \ndelegate, what form of government was under construction. He famously \nanswered: A republic, if you can keep it. James Madison defined a \nrepublic as a government which derives its powers from the people, a \nprinciple enshrined in the Declaration of Independence.\n  One way we work to keep our Republic is by the people choosing those \nwho will govern them. In his farewell address in 1837, President Andrew \nJackson said:\n\n       But you must remember, my fellow citizens, that eternal \n     vigilance by the people is the price of liberty, and that you \n     must pay the price if you wish to secure the blessing.\n\n  Elections and transitions of power are part of that vigilance; part \nof keeping our Republic in order that we might, in the words of the \nConstitution's preamble, secure the blessings of liberty to ourselves \nand our posterity. Every transition goes from something to something \nand is an occasion to look at what is concluded as well as what is \nbeginning. With the inauguration of President-elect Obama around the \ncorner and the flurry of confirmation activity in the Senate regarding \nhis nominees and the intense focus on economic and other challenges, \nmuch of our attention is rightfully focused on the future. But we look \nto the future from a present shaped by the past. Only by understanding \nwhere we have been can we have the ability, perspective, and confidence \nto act today and plan for tomorrow.\n  Although a Presidency has a beginning and an end, it is simply part \nof the flow of events. Presidents inherit situations they did not \ncreate and create situations that they then leave to their successors. \nThey may get credit for successes they did not produce and escape blame \nfor failures that do not materialize until after they leave office. \nThat is the nature of political life in America. While we focus on the \nindividual--the President--I think it is more appropriate to speak of \nan administration--the Presidency.\n  There are hundreds and hundreds of people who serve at the pleasure \nof the President to develop and implement his agenda. All this makes \nvery difficult even describing, let alone evaluating, something as \nmultifaceted as the Bush Presidency. Some of President Bush's critics \nalmost reflexively look at opinion polls, noting his approval rating \nhas sunk. I do not have to tell anyone serving in public office about \nthe allure as well as the danger of this particular reflex. Polls are \nsnapshots, they are not motion pictures. The pollster is the \nphotographer. He chooses the subject, the lighting, and the angle. He \nframes the shot and determines how the final picture turns out.\n  The Bush Presidency was book-ended by national crises--the terrorist \nattacks of September 11, 2001, and the financial crisis before us \ntoday. Not surprisingly, as the Washington Post pointed out a few days \nago, President Bush enjoyed the highest approval rating in late 2001 \nand nearly the lowest in late 2008 in the history of the Post's \nreporting. Once again, that is the nature of political life in America \nand comes with the Presidential territory.\n  While President Bush's approval rating has many ups and downs, one \nthing has remained absolutely constant: His approval rating has been \nconsistently higher than ours in the Congress. The Web site \npollingreport.com shows that dozens of national polls in the last \ncouple years have given Congress an approval rating in the tens, down \nto a measly 12 percent, while President Bush has never had one that \nlow. We in the Congress have the advantage of getting lost in the crowd \nwhen we want to, blaming such dismal public sentiment on the \ninstitution, while insisting that as individual Members we are \ncertainly much more popular. The President never has that luxury.\n  The polls do not ask whether Americans approve of his administration \nbut whether they approve of him. President Bush knows it is tough to \nlead if you follow the polls. As he said in an interview last month, he \ndid not compromise his soul to be a popular guy. George W. Bush is not \nleaving the Presidency with chapped fingers from holding them up to the \npolitical wind. His critics spin that as stubbornness, saying he wants \nto go it alone. I fully expect many of those same Bush critics will \npraise the next President for the very same thing.\n  One man's principle, I suppose, is another man's inflexibility.\n  But as President Bush said at Texas A University, popularity is \nfleeting but character and conscience are sturdy.\n  The only test that matters, he said, is going home at night, looking \nin the mirror and being satisfied that you have done what is right.\n  Politics, of course, is about disagreement and competing ideas, \npriorities, and policies. Conservative leader and thinker Paul Weyrich, \nwho passed away last month, has written about what he called \nconstructive polarization.\n  That is the idea that clearly defined, and clearly different, choices \nand alternatives can be constructive for the electoral and political \nprocess.\n  Disagreement and competition help us to focus and refine ideas, to \nwork harder at finding the best solution.\n  But I regret to say that there is often today more effort at enraging \nthan engaging, and that along with disagreement has come disrespect.\n  Too often an opponent is treated not simply as wrong but as rotten, \nand that is when the distinction between an office and the individual \nwho holds it breaks down and political objectives take precedence over \ninstitutional principles.\n  I have seen that destructive trend over the last 8 years and I hope, \nfor the sake of the next president and for our country, it does not \ncontinue.\n  I join President Bush who has said that the tone in Washington got \nworse rather than better during his presidency and I urge my \ncolleagues, and all others who participate in so many ways in our \npolitical process, to do some real soul-searching about this.\n  In addition to looking at the polls, it is easy when looking back at \na presidency to look no further than the most recent events.\n  The financial and economic situation has deteriorated so fast in the \nlast several months, and the difficulties have spread so quickly and \nloom so large, that it is difficult to see anything that came before.\n  The truth is, however, that we experienced a record economic \nexpansion before that downturn occurred, 52 months of uninterrupted job \ncreation.\n  Another mistake in evaluating a Presidency is a simple one.\n  We act as if we know everything that can be known, that the jury \ncould possibly have already come back with the verdict.\n  The jury is still out, and will remain there for a long time, which \nis why we more properly talk about history judging a President.\n  As President Bush put it in one interview, folks are still writing \nbooks analyzing President George Washington.\n  President George Bush is not going to worry about it.\n  President Harry Truman's own party discouraged him from running for \nre-\n\n[[Page S372]]\n\nelection and he left office with an approval rating even lower than \nPresident Bush will, yet today is mentioned among the twentieth \ncentury's best presidents, and one of my personal favorite Presidents \nof all time.\n  The facts of what President Bush has done, not to mention their \neffects, will not be fully understood or even known by most Americans \nfor many years to come.\n  In evaluating a Presidency, we should also look not only at \nindividual programs or neatly numerical accomplishments but also at the \nchallenges than cannot be reduced to charts, graphs, or bullet points.\n  President Bush certainly came into office with goals to achieve, \nproblems to solve, and situations to handle.\n  He had offered concrete proposals and made campaign promises.\n  There is a long list of bills he signed, programs he initiated, \nappointments he made, and other concrete achievements that can be \nmeasured and listed.\n  I will mention some of those in a minute.\n  But the President-elect has already shown us how quickly those \npromises get tossed on the cutting-room floor.\n  The Washington Post just reported that, before Mr. Obama has even \ntaken the oath of office, his proposal for a tax credit for job \ncreation, which he had touted on the campaign trail, has been dumped \nfrom the economic stimulus package now under construction.\n  But in addition to specific programs or proposals, President Bush has \nworked hard to get us to think differently, to shift paradigms, to re-\norder our understanding of America, the world, and our relationship to \nit.\n  That is more qualitative than quantitative, and perhaps it is harder \nto measure with numbers or notches on a board somewhere, but it is as \nmuch a part of leadership and vigilance that is necessary to keep this \nRepublic as anything else.\n  We are in the eighth year since the terrorist attacks of September \n11, 2001.\n  What a way for a President to begin his first term.\n  The world changed, and American changed with it.\n  Previous generations saw the struggle against global communism define \nmuch of what America did and how we did it.\n  Today, it is the struggle against global terrorism.\n  It may have begun in earnest with President Bush in office, but it \nwill continue long afterward.\n  And so national security has defined the Bush Presidency.\n  Not simply the subject of national security, but the reality of \nnational security. From retooling the Department of Justice and FBI, \ncreating the Department of Homeland Security, revamping the \nintelligence community, to engaging dozens of other nations, and \nliberating millions in the Middle East, President Bush took bold steps \nto confront this new international menace.\n  In short, he led.\n  President Bush has sought to lead us to think differently about war \nand terrorism, and to understand both that terrorism is a global threat \nand that freedom is terrorism's worst enemy.\n  He has said throughout his Presidency that freedom comes from God and \nis a universal human right.\n  Freedom is better than tyranny, liberty is better than oppression.\n  I am so grateful that President Bush refused to accept this moral-\nequivalency nonsense that one way of life is just as good or bad as the \nnext.\n  Not only does that view make no sense on its face, but with it no one \nwould ever see liberation from disease, hunger, slavery, or \ndeprivation.\n  That is a philosophical perspective, to be sure, and perhaps it is \ndifficult to communicate in the 21st century, perhaps it does not lend \nitself to a text message or a posting on Facebook.\n  But where you start determines the road on which you travel and where \nyou eventually arrive, both for individuals and nations.\n  President Bush told the American Enterprise Institute last month that \na President's job is not only to tackle problems but to look over the \nhorizon.\n  That is real leadership.\n  Let me move to some of those concrete accomplishments.\n  Though some may wish to forget it, I remember when so many dismissed \nPresident Bush's strategy in Iraq that we have come to call ``the \nsurge.''\n  Once again, he was thinking outside the box, changing the way we \nthink about dealing with challenges and problems.\n  The surge was more than simply sending more troops to Iraq, but \nimplemented a comprehensive counterinsurgency strategy.\n  It provided for one of the most dramatic comebacks in the history of \nmodern warfare.\n  In less than 2 years, what some had said was a hopeless situation saw \nan 80 percent reduction in violence.\n  Cities and provinces whose names were literal synonyms for violence--\nRamadi, Fallujah, Baghdad, and others--are now largely free of al-\nQaida's operatives.\n  And let me say at this point that President Bush has reaffirmed our \nsacred commitment to our veterans.\n  His administration has more than doubled funding for veterans' \nmedical care, cutting the time to process disability claims almost in \nhalf and reducing homelessness among veterans by 40 percent.\n  It is, of course, much easier, much more natural, to think about what \nhas happened rather than what has not happened.\n  This is true for many reasons, not the least of which is that we \noften simply do not know what has not happened. But think about this. \nWe do know that America has not been attacked since September 11, 2001. \nThat is 88 months.\n  I know that no one listening to me speak is foolish enough to think \nthis is because the terrorists, the terrorist networks, the terrorist \nmovement at work today have simply lost interest.\n  No one is foolish enough to think the terrorists have just moved on \nto other things.\n  No, they want more than ever to attack and destroy this country, if \nonly because their first attack failed to bring us down.\n  It has not happened in more than 7 years.\n  President Bush's leadership has helped prevent another attack.\n  His leadership in creating an international coalition, in working \nwith other individual nations, in transforming and redirecting \nintelligence and law enforcement agencies, has helped prevent another \nattack.\n  We have fought over these issues here in Congress, and I for one \nagree with President Bush that we must, for example, monitor \ninternational communication involving suspected terrorists if we are to \nprotect ourselves.\n  Doing so is both necessary and constitutional, and I am glad \nPresident Bush stood firm on those principles.\n  President Bush has also helped protect us here at home by reducing \nthe threat of rogue nations or groups launching a missile attack \nagainst the United States.\n  President Bush fielded an operational missile defense system, which \nwill require additional investment and development.\n  But because of his leadership, we have already developed significant \nanti-ballistic missile capability both on the ground and at sea.\n  Also looking abroad, President Bush has led us to rethink how we \napproach foreign aid with a new model of assistance to other countries.\n  He signed millennium challenge account agreements with nearly a dozen \nAfrican nations and put more emphasis on holding governments that \nreceive our aid accountable for how they treat their people and whether \nthey promote economic growth.\n  This approach actually invites competition, utilizes criteria, and \nrequires progress, and it requires a strong link between our security \nobjectives, accountability, and foreign-assistance funding.\n  Linking these together serves both American and foreign interests \nbetter and it took bold leadership to shift into this new way of \napproaching foreign assistance.\n  In his 2003 State of the Union Address, President Bush introduced the \nPresident's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. I happened to \nhave been very interested in that and worked hard to get that done, \ntoo, because--along with Senator Kennedy--we are the authors of these \nthree anti-AIDS bills, so I take a great interest in what he has done \nand he is the first to have really done it.\n  This program focuses on both prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS and \ncare.\n\n[[Page S373]]\n\n  Billions of dollars have already gone to prevent the spread of HIV/\nAIDS and opportunistic diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis that \noften kill people with AIDS.\n  This program has prevented HIV transmission from mother to child \nduring more than 12 million pregnancies and provided antiretroviral \ndrugs for nearly 2 million people, up from only 50,000 receiving such \ndrugs when the program began.\n  PEPFAR has helped support care for nearly 7 million children and more \nthan 33 million counseling and testing sessions for men, women, and \nchildren.\n  This program launched by President Bush, which was reauthorized last \nyear with increased funding, is the largest international health \ninitiative in history dedicated to a single disease.\n  Shifting the focus to right here at home, even though the downturn of \nthe last year has been severe, it was preceded by a record 52 months of \njob creation.\n  Productivity in his first term grew at the fastest rate in more than \nhalf a century.\n  Before the recent spike, the average seasonally adjusted unemployment \nrate during President Bush's tenure was the lowest in 60 years.\n  President Bush cut taxes for every American who pays taxes, doubled \nthe child tax credit to help American families, provided marriage \npenalty relief, and began phasing out the estate tax.\n  The roots of the current financial crisis extend before President \nBush took office and his warnings went unheeded.\n  In April 2001, just 3 months in office, he warned that financial \ntrouble at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac could have strong repercussions \nin financial markets.\n  In May 2002, he called for disclosure and corporate governance \nprinciples to be applied to those agencies.\n  In February 2003, the Bush administration warned that unexpected \nproblems at Fannie and Freddie could immediately spread beyond the \nhousing market.\n  Seven months later, the Treasury Secretary called for prudent minimum \ncapital adequacy requirements for Fannie and Freddie.\n  In February 2004, President Bush called for stronger regulation of \nFannie and Freddie because of their low levels of required capital, \nthat is, subprime mortgages.\n  Warnings continued month after month, year after year.\n  The notion that the Bush administration sat by while the problem \ndeveloped or, worse yet, fought increased regulation is simply a lie.\n  President Bush campaigned on education reform, having the courage to \nspeak of what he called the bigotry of low expectations.\n  He delivered education reform with the No Child Left Behind Act, and \nI can tell you what a difference it has made.\n  One example is Dee Elementary School in Ogden, UT.\n  Nearly every student in that school is economically disadvantaged, \nmore than 80 percent are minorities, more than 44 percent are learning \nthe English language, and 10 percent are homeless.\n  Those are challenging demographics no matter where they are found.\n  At the beginning of the 2003-04 school year, only 13 percent of Dee \nElementary third-graders were reading at grade level.\n  In just 5 years, after Dee Elementary was chosen to participate in \nthe Reading First program, that figure quadrupled to 52 percent.\n  The school jumped from only the 9th percentile in fifth grade reading \nto the 43rd percentile.\n  And I am so proud to say that Dee Elementary has now met Adequate \nYearly Progress standards for 3 consecutive years.\n  Lives are changed, hopes are kindled, and futures are brighter as a \nresult.\n  Empowering teachers to help students meet higher expectations works, \nand that has become Federal educational policy under President Bush.\n  The educational achievement gap between White and minority students \nnarrowed and both fourth and eighth graders achieved their highest \nreading and math scores on record.\n  I am hopeful that the new President's Secretary of Education will \nrecognize and build on the reform-oriented approach of the Bush \nadministration through supporting policies such as charter schools and \nschool choice.\n  President Bush campaigned on Medicare reform, and he delivered with \nthe Medicare Modernization Act, the most significant reform of the \nMedicare Program since it was created in 1965.\n  As a result of this law, 40 million Americans have better access to \nprescriptions and have choices in their health coverage.\n  It also provided for health savings accounts, which President Bush \ninsisted not be limited solely to Medicare beneficiaries.\n  These accounts are portable and give people more choices and more \nways to improve their lives.\n  I served on the House-Senate conference committee on this legislation \nand attribute its success to President Bush's leadership.\n  President Bush has challenged all Americans, and his own party, to \nchange the way we address real human needs in this country.\n  This includes increasing the impact of nonprofit organizations, \nending discrimination against faith-based groups that can provide \nservices, and promoting volunteerism.\n  As a result, chronic homelessness has dropped by nearly 30 percent in \njust the last few years.\n  President Bush also advanced a culture of life.\n  Our Declaration of Independence recognizes that we are endowed by our \nCreator with an inalienable right to life.\n  That is a foundational principle.\n  In an interview a year ago, President Bush said that his belief that \nevery human life has dignity has informed his policies and programs.\n  I do not understand where the compassion and commitment comes from \nfor hundreds of programs and billions of dollars to help millions of \npeople without believing that those people's very lives are worth \nprotecting.\n  The conviction that life itself is sacred is the best foundation for \nliberty and prosperity, for human and civil rights.\n  President Bush shares that conviction and signed into law the ban on \nthe horrific practice of partial birth abortion, which the Supreme \nCourt has upheld.\n  He also signed the Born Alive Infant Protection Act and the Unborn \nVictims of Violence Act.\n  President Bush also appointed judges who know their proper place in \nour system of government.\n  Our liberty depends on limited government, and that means government \nlimited by a written Constitution that actually means something.\n  The Constitution cannot limit government if government defines the \nConstitution. President Bush appointed judges who know that this \nprinciple applies to them. This is one of the most important, and most \nlong-lasting, results of President Bush's leadership.\n  Others believe that judges not only apply the law, but make the law \nthey apply.\n  Others believe that judges should decide cases based on where their \npersonal empathy lies, based on the political interests that can be \nserved.\n  Others believe that judges should take sides in a case before those \nsides even appear in court.\n  That activist, politicized view of judging will destroy our liberty \nand I am glad that President Bush sided with America's Founders and \nappointed judges who will interpret and apply the law and leave \npolitics to the people.\n  President Bush charted a new course for energy security.\n  This is another area which the recent financial crisis can easily \nobscure, but President Bush's first order of business was producing a \nmajor energy plan and task force.\n  That plan became the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n  It included a proposal I authored called the CLEAR Act, which \nprovided incentives for hybrid and alternative fuel vehicles.\n  President Bush's advocacy of plug-in hybrid vehicle technology \nresulted in passage of the FREEDOM Act, which I drafted along with \nSenators Barack Obama and Maria Cantwell.\n  And President Bush called for developing our Nation's unconventional \nfuel resources, including oil shale and tar sand.\n  Only the most willful denial or ideological distortion will buy the \nspin from environmental extremists that\n\n[[Page S374]]\n\nPresident Bush has done nothing to protect the environment or to move \nus away from our dependence on oil.\n  At the same time, knowing that our current transportation needs \ndepend on oil, President Bush has led the way to doubling domestic oil \nand gas production on public lands.\n  I could go on about issue after issue, listing one accomplishment \nafter another, but my remarks today are intended to be more than just a \nfactual recitation.\n  Many others are writing and analyzing the Bush presidency and record \nfrom many different perspectives.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have an editorial titled \n``Bush's Achievements'' from the January 19 issue of the Weekly \nStandard printed in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Before I close, I have to say a word about our wonderful \nand gracious First Lady, Laura Bush.\n  Her strength, dignity, and grace will leave a lasting mark on the \nrole of First Lady.\n  She was a kind, steady presence, advocating for causes in her own \nright as the President led the Nation in his.\n  And in times of great tragedy, she was the voice and personification \nof comfort and kindness.\n  She confidently balanced the public and private aspects of life and \nfamily. Like her husband, Laura Bush was just what our country needed.\n  President Bush has been our leader, our chosen leader, for the past 8 \nyears.\n  He has been a man of principle, conviction, and action.\n  He has had to tackle challenges, both here and abroad, that are \ndifficult even to describe, let alone comprehend.\n  There have been many successes, and this has been a time of \ntransition, adjustment, and change.\n  President Bush, as is his way, takes a very practical view of his \ncontribution to America.\n  He says he will be remembered as someone who dealt with tough issues \nhead on, helping our country protect itself, and who was unashamed \nabout spreading certain fundamental values such as liberty.\n  At home, he says, he trusts individual Americans to make the best \ndecisions for themselves and their families.\n  In his last State of the Union Address, President Bush said that our \nNation will prosper, our liberty will be secure, and our union will \nremain strong if we trust in the ability of free people to make \ndecisions.\n  Protecting America from outside enemies and strengthening America \nfrom within.\n  That is a legacy to be proud of, and I am so thankful for President \nBush's leadership and courage and I pray for God's richest blessings \nfor him, for First Lady Laura Bush, and their family in whatever lies \nahead for them.\n  Let me close with a quote from President Theodore Roosevelt, whom I \nknow President Bush admires.\n  President Roosevelt said this in Paris in 1910 and it expresses my \nsentiments about President Bush as his time in office ends.\n\n       It is not the critic who counts: not the man who points out \n     how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could \n     have done better. The credit belongs to the man who is \n     actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat \n     and blood, who strives valiantly, who errs and comes up short \n     again and again, because there is no effort without error or \n     shortcoming, but who knows the great enthusiasms, the great \n     devotions, who spends himself for a worthy cause; who, at the \n     best, knows, in the end, the triumph of high achievement, and \n     who, at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while \n     daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those \n     cold and timid souls who knew neither victory nor defeat.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n               [From the weekly Standard, Jan. 19, 2009]\n\n        Bush's Achievements--Ten Things the President Got Right.\n\n                            (By Fred Barnes)\n\n       The postmortems on the presidency of George W. Bush are all \n     wrong. The liberal line is that Bush dangerously weakened \n     America's position in the world and rushed to the aid of the \n     rich and powerful as income inequality worsened. That is \n     twaddle. Conservatives--okay, not all of them--have only been \n     a little bit kinder. They give Bush credit for the surge that \n     saved Iraq, but not for much else.\n       He deserves better. His presidency was far more successful \n     than not. And there's an aspect of his decision-making that \n     merits special recognition: his courage. Time and time again, \n     Bush did what other presidents, even Ronald Reagan, would not \n     have done and for which he was vilified and abused. That--\n     defiantly doing the right thing--is what distinguished his \n     presidency.\n       Bush had ten great achievements (and maybe more) in his \n     eight years in the White House, starting with his decision in \n     2001 to jettison the Kyoto global warming treaty so loved by \n     Al Gore, the environmental lobby, elite opinion, and \n     Europeans. The treaty was a disaster, with India and China \n     exempted and economic decline the certain result. Everyone \n     knew it. But only Bush said so and acted accordingly.\n       He stood athwart mounting global warming hysteria and \n     yelled, ``Stop!'' He slowed the movement toward a policy \n     blunder of worldwide impact, providing time for facts to \n     catch up with the dubious claims of alarmists. Thanks in part \n     to Bush, the supposed consensus of scientists on global \n     warming has now collapsed. The skeptics, who point to global \n     cooling over the past decade, are now heard loud and clear. \n     And a rational approach to the theory of manmade global \n     warming is possible.\n       Second, enhanced interrogation of terrorists. Along with \n     use of secret prisons and wireless eavesdropping, this saved \n     American lives. How many thousands of lives? We'll never \n     know. But, as Charles Krauthammer said recently, ``Those are \n     precisely the elements which kept us safe and which have \n     prevented a second attack.''\n       Crucial intelligence was obtained from captured al Qaeda \n     leaders, including 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, \n     with the help of waterboarding. Whether this tactic--it \n     creates a drowning sensation--is torture is a matter of \n     debate. John McCain and many Democrats say it is. Bush and \n     Vice President Cheney insist it isn't. In any case, it was \n     necessary. Lincoln once made a similar point in defending his \n     suspension of habeas corpus in direct defiance of Chief \n     Justice Roger Taney. ``Are all the laws but one to go \n     unexecuted, and the government itself go to pieces, lest that \n     one be violated?'' Lincoln asked. Bush understood the answer \n     in wartime had to be no.\n       Bush's third achievement was the rebuilding of presidential \n     authority, badly degraded in the era of Vietnam, Watergate, \n     and Bill Clinton. He didn't hesitate to conduct wireless \n     surveillance of terrorists without getting a federal judge's \n     okay. He decided on his own how to treat terrorists and where \n     they should be imprisoned. Those were legitimate decisions \n     for which the president, as commander in chief, should feel \n     no need to apologize.\n       Defending, all the way to the Supreme Court, Cheney's \n     refusal to disclose to Congress the names of people he'd \n     consulted on energy policy was also enormously important. \n     Democratic congressman Henry Waxman demanded the names, but \n     the Court upheld Cheney, 7-2. Last week, Cheney defended his \n     refusal, waspishly noting that Waxman ``doesn't call me up \n     and tell me who he's meeting with.''\n       Achievement number four was Bush's unswerving support for \n     Israel. Reagan was once deemed Israel's best friend in the \n     White House. Now Bush can claim the title. He ostracized \n     Yasser Arafat as an impediment to peace in the Middle East. \n     This infuriated the anti-Israel forces in Europe, the Third \n     World, and the United Nations, and was criticized by \n     champions of the ``peace process'' here at home. Bush was \n     right.\n       He was clever in his support. Bush announced that Ariel \n     Sharon should withdraw the tanks he'd sent into the West Bank \n     in 2002, then exerted zero pressure on Sharon to do so. And \n     he backed the wall along Israel's eastern border without \n     endorsing it as an official boundary, while knowing full well \n     that it might eventually become exactly that. He was a loyal \n     friend.\n       His fifth success was No Child Left Behind (NCLB), the \n     education reform bill cosponsored by America's most prominent \n     liberal Democratic senator Edward Kennedy. The teachers' \n     unions, school boards, the education establishment, \n     conservatives adamant about local control of schools--they \n     all loathed the measure and still do. It requires two things \n     they ardently oppose, mandatory testing and accountability.\n       Kennedy later turned against NCLB, saying Bush is \n     shortchanging the program. In truth, federal education \n     spending is at record levels. Another complaint is that it \n     forces teachers to ``teach to the test.'' The tests are on \n     math and reading. They are tests worth teaching to.\n       Sixth, Bush declared in his second inaugural address in \n     2005 that American foreign policy (at least his) would \n     henceforth focus on promoting democracy around the world. \n     This put him squarely in the Reagan camp, but he was \n     lambasted as unrealistic, impractical, and a tool of wily \n     neoconservatives. The new policy gave Bush credibility in \n     pressing for democracy in the former Soviet republics and \n     Middle East and in zinging various dictators and kleptocrats. \n     It will do the same for President Obama, if he's wise enough \n     to hang onto it.\n       The seventh achievement is the Medicare prescription drug \n     benefit, enacted in 2003. It's not only wildly popular; it \n     has cost less than expected by triggering competition among \n     drug companies. Conservatives have deep reservations about \n     the program. But they shouldn't have been surprised. Bush \n     advocated the drug benefit in the 2000 campaign. And if he \n     hadn't acted, Democrats\n\n[[Page S375]]\n\n     would have, with a much less attractive result.\n       Then there were John Roberts and Sam Alito. In putting them \n     on the Supreme Court and naming Roberts chief justice, Bush \n     achieved what had eluded Richard Nixon, Reagan, and his own \n     father. Roberts and Alito made the Court indisputably more \n     conservative. And the good news is Roberts, 53, and Alito, \n     58, should be justices for decades to come.\n       Bush's ninth achievement has been widely ignored. He \n     strengthened relations with east Asian democracies (Japan, \n     South Korea, Australia) without causing a rift with China. On \n     top of that, he forged strong ties with India. An important \n     factor was their common enemy, Islamic jihadists. After 9/11, \n     Bush made the most of this, and Indian leaders were \n     receptive. His state dinner for Indian prime minister \n     Manmohan Singh in 2006 was a lovefest.\n       Finally, a no-brainer: the surge. Bush prompted nearly \n     unanimous disapproval in January 2007 when he announced he \n     was sending more troops to Iraq and adopting a new \n     counterinsurgency strategy. His opponents initially included \n     the State Department, the Pentagon, most of Congress, the \n     media, the foreign policy establishment, indeed the whole \n     world. This makes his decision a profile in courage. Best of \n     all, the surge worked. Iraq is now a fragile but functioning \n     democracy.\n       How does Bush rank as a president? We won't know until he's \n     judged from the perspective of two or three decades. \n     Hindsight forced a sharp upgrading of the presidencies of \n     Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower. Given his achievements, \n     it may have the same effect for Bush.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                          TRIBUTE TO DON MEYER\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Don Meyer, men's \nbasketball coach at Northern State University, in Aberdeen, SD, for his \n903rd career coaching victory. The historic win occurred January 10, \n2009, as his NSU Wolves defeated the University of Mary by a score of \n82-62. That victory placed Coach Meyer atop the NCAA men's all-time \nwins list, one victory ahead of legendary coach Bob Knight.\n  Since their arrival in 1999, Coach Meyer and his wife Carmen have \nbeen incredible assets to the Aberdeen community and Northern State \nUniversity. The Meyers participate in countless civic events, \ndisplaying great community pride. As his players, assistants, coaching \ncolleagues, participants, and fans can attest, Coach Meyer is a world-\nclass basketball instructor. More importantly, however, he is a world-\nclass teacher and mentor on the fundamentals of everyday life. He is \nable to not only mold his athletes into great basketball players, but \nalso into outstanding young adults equipped to have positive impacts on \nthe world around them.\n  Coach Meyer's courageous journey is made even more remarkable due to \nthe fact he was involved in a near fatal automobile accident in \nSeptember of 2008 on the way to an annual team retreat. Coach Meyer \ncredits his team with saving his life, as players and assistant coaches \nrushed to his aid while waiting for help to arrive. Throughout his \nhospitalization, Coach Meyer maintained his selfless nature and \nadmirable character by always looking for the positive and keeping his \nfaith steadily intact. His strong spirit, optimistic attitude, and \nunprecedented determination remained constant even amidst the \namputation of his lower left leg and the pronouncement of an unexpected \ncancer diagnosis. This amazing man was at his team's 5 a.m. practice \nimmediately following his hospital dismissal, ready to use his life \nexperiences as a tool to enrich the lives of others. Those who know him \nappreciate his wealth of knowledge, distinctive outlook on life and his \nunique sense of humor.\n  Coach Meyer began his college basketball career as a standout player \nat the University of Northern Colorado, earning NCAA All-American \nstatus. Upon graduation, he served as an assistant coach at Western \nState College of Colorado and the University of Utah. He landed his \nfirst head coaching position at Hamline University in St. Paul, MN, in \n1972. After 3 years with Hamline, which included a 1975 trip to the \nNCAA Division III Elite Eight, Coach Meyer traveled to Nashville, TN, \nto become the head coach for Lipscomb University.\n  During his tenure at Lipscomb, Coach Meyer amassed 665 wins. His \nteams qualified for 13 national tournaments and won the 1986 NAIA \nNational Championship. He was named NAIA Coach of Year in both 1989 and \n1990. He coached 22 All-Americans and 3 National Players of the Year \nwhile in Nashville. In 1993, Coach Meyer was elected to the NAIA Hall \nof Fame. After 24 successful seasons, he left Lipscomb to become head \ncoach for Northern State University in Aberdeen, SD.\n  Under Coach Meyer's tutelage, Northern State has reached the NCAA \npostseason-play four of the past five seasons. Included in this \npostseason run are two appearances in the North Central Region \nChampionship game in 2006 and 2008. His NSU teams have surpassed the \n20-win mark in seven consecutive seasons and captured four Northern Sun \nIntercollegiate Conference regular season and conference tournament \nchampionships. Currently, his Wolves squad holds a 12-2 record and is \nranked 11th in the Nation in NCAA Division II.\n  It is my great privilege to congratulate one of the most amazing, \nadmirable, well-respected coaches of all time, Coach Don Meyer. He is a \nhumble man of great integrity--a true inspiration and moral icon. It \nhas been a true pleasure to have the opportunity to know him personally \nand an honor to call him my friend. On behalf of the city of Aberdeen, \nthe State of South Dakota, and our great Nation, I am pleased to say \ncongratulations, Coach Meyer. You have made us all incredibly proud. \nYour legacy will flourish throughout the lives that you have so \nprofoundly touched. Congratulations and best wishes, Coach, and may God \nbless you.\n\n\n                      lilly ledbetter fair pay act\n\n  Mrs. CLINTON. Mr. President, I am so pleased to join my fellow \nSenators to press for passage of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act. In \nparticular, I would like to salute Chairman Kennedy, a champion of \nequality for decades in this body, and Senator Mikulski, who has been a \ntireless leader in the effort to achieve equal pay for equal work and \nwho is heading the effort to pass this legislation on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  This legislation would help us deliver on the promise of equality and \nfairness in the workplace--not just for women but for all workers, men \nand women, subject to discrimination on the basis of gender, race, \nethnic background, age, and disability. That is why I have supported \nthe Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act so strongly--and will continue to \nsupport it until the Senate passes it and our new President can sign it \ninto law.\n  In America today, women earn only 78 cents on the dollar for doing \nthe same jobs as men--far less if they are women of color. And we still \ndon't value or recognize some of the hardest and most productive work \ndone in our society: caring for children, elderly parents, and the \nseriously ill--work that is largely done by women.\n  The disparities in income, just one important example, are not only \nharmful to women. It is not just a mother who suffers when she is \ndenied equal pay for equal work; her children and family suffer too. \nFamilies earn an average of $4,000 less each year because of pay \ndisparities. It is not just a wife who loses out when she is not valued \nfor the hours she spends caring for a sick relative or a child in need; \nher husband and family lose out too.\n  The failure to defend the civil rights of women and men facing \ndiscrimination affects real lives. That is why this act is named for \none such person--someone who didn't have a lot of money or a lot of \noptions but believed, and still believes, that we all deserve a fair \nchance to defend our civil rights in the courts.\n  Lily Ledbetter was one of only a few female supervisors at a Goodyear \nTire plant. She endured insults from her male bosses and shifts that \nran to 18 hours. She kept her head down, worked hard in a traditionally \nmale job.\n  Near the end of her 20 years at the factory, she discovered she was \nbeing paid less than all of her 15 male counterparts--a lot less. The \nmale supervisors earned 25 to 40 percent more\n\n[[Page S376]]\n\nthan she did. And so she took her case to court, and a jury of her \npeers concluded that she had been paid less because of her gender in \nviolation of the law, awarding full damages. But in a 5-to-4 decision, \nthe Supreme Court reversed the jury, overturned decades of bipartisan \nrules and judicial precedent, and told Lilly that she was entitled to \nnothing. The Court ruled that if you are discriminated in your salary, \nyou only have 180 days to seek action even if that discrimination is \nongoing--and even if you didn't know about it.\n  The legislation we will vote on tomorrow morning is simple: it will \nreverse the Supreme Court's decision in Ledbetter and take us back to \nthe rule that prevailed for years, when women had a reasonable \nopportunity to sue if they were being denied equal pay. That is all \nthis legislation does--restore us to the rule before 2007.\n  In fact, this legislation should just be a down payment on much-\nneeded reform to close the wage gap. The House earlier this year passed \nthe Paycheck Fairness Act, legislation that I introduced in the Senate \nto close the pay gap. The bill takes critical steps to empower women to \nnegotiate for equal pay, to close loopholes that courts have created in \nthe law, to create strong incentives for employers to obey the laws \nthat are in place, and to strengthen Federal outreach and enforcement \nefforts.\n  Our pay equity laws are replete with holes and lax enforcement that \nhas prevented them from serving as a real check on pay discrimination. \nAs a result, there has not been enough meaningful progress to close the \nwage gap. We need not only the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act but also \nthe Paycheck Fairness Act, and I urge my colleagues to take up the \nPaycheck Fairness Act as soon as possible.\n  Throughout my lifetime of public service, I have been proud to join \nmany in the fight to change laws to ensure fairness and equality for \nall of our citizens. We have achieved great progress, but great \nprogress, especially for women, remains to be made.\n  This is part of the unfinished business of America, unfinished \nbusiness that holds back all people, weakens our prosperity, and \njeopardizes our progress as a nation. Now is the time to help end pay \ndisparity and ensure that women earn equal pay for equal work.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the Omnibus \nPublic Land Management Act of 2009.\n  I commend my colleagues who support this comprehensive public lands \nbill, and I thank Chairman Bingaman for his leadership. He and his \nstaff should be congratulated for their perseverance and patience in \nshepherding this important bill through the legislative process.\n  I would like to speak first about one of the bill's provisions, which \nhas major implications for California; and that is, the legislation to \nimplement the historic San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement, which \nI have sponsored with my colleague from California, Senator Boxer.\n  This measure would restore California's second longest river, while \nmaintaining a stable water supply for the farmers who have made the San \nJoaquin Valley the richest agricultural area in the world.\n  Once enacted, this bill would bring to a close 19 years of litigation \nbetween the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Friant Water Users \nAuthority, and the U.S. Department of the Interior. And it does so \nwithin a framework that the affected interests can accept--and have all \nagreed to.\n  The Settlement has two goals: to restore and maintain fish \npopulations in the San Joaquin River in good condition, including a \nself-sustaining salmon fishery; and to avoid or reduce adverse water \nsupply impacts to long-term Friant water contractors.\n  Consistent with the terms of the settlement, I expect that both of \nthese goals will be pursued with equal diligence by the Federal \nagencies.\n  This historic agreement would not have been possible without the \nparticipation of a remarkably broad group of agencies, stakeholders, \nand legislators, including: the Department of the Interior; the State \nof California; the Friant Water Users Authority; the Natural Resources \nDefense Council on behalf of 13 other environmental organizations; and \ncountless other stakeholders who came together and spent countless \nhours with legislators in Washington to ensure that we found a solution \nthat the large majority of those affected could support. Without this \nconsensus, the parties would no doubt continue the fight, resulting in \na court-imposed judgment--one which would likely be worse for all \nparties.\n  I spoke at greater length about the purposes and benefits of this \nlegislation during my statements upon introduction of the omnibus lands \nbill and when introducing the San Joaquin River Settlement legislation \nin December 2006 and January 2007 in previous Congresses.\n  I would like to take a moment to highlight several important changes \nthat were made to this version of the legislation--which improved upon \nthe initial bill, first introduced in December 2006.\n  First, the legislation reflects an agreement reached in November 2008 \nto ensure that the implementing legislation is pay-go neutral, which \nmeans that the restoration program allocates no more in direct spending \nthan it brings in.\n  The agreement also protects the rights of third parties. These \nprotections are accomplished while ensuring a timely and robust \nrestoration of the river and without creating any new precedents for \nimplementing the Endangered Species Act.\n  Similarly, there is no preemption of State law and nothing in the \nbill changes any existing obligations of the United States to operate \nthe Central Valley Project in conformity with State law.\n  Second, the bill incorporates amendments made by the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee in May 2008 to enhance implementation of \nthe settlement's ``Water Management Goal'' to reduce or avoid adverse \nwater supply impacts to Friant Division long-term water contractors.\n  It also includes provisions approved by the committee that will \nincrease the amount of upfront funding available for the settlement by \nallowing most Friant Division contractors to accelerate repayment of \ntheir construction cost obligation to the Treasury. In exchange for \nearly repayment, Friant water agencies will be able to convert their \n25-year water service contracts to permanent repayment contracts.\n  Now, I would like to speak at greater length about the legislation's \nsubstantial protections for other water districts and private \nlandowners in California that were not party to the original settlement \nnegotiations.\n  I think it is important to note that these protections have been \nagreed to by all of the settling parties as well as the third-party \nwater agencies in the San Joaquin Valley who requested them, and that \nthey will be accomplished while ensuring a timely and robust \nrestoration of the river.\n  Section 10004(d) requires that the Secretary of the Interior \nidentify; first, the impacts associated with the proposed action or \nactions; and sSecond, the measures that will be implemented to mitigate \nthose impacts.\n  Sections 10004(f), 10004(g) and 10004(j) protect third party water \nusers by clarifying that implementation of the settlement will cause no \ninvoluntary reductions in contract water allocations to long-term CVP \ncontractors--other than Friant contractors--by making it clear that the \nbill does not, except as actually provided in the settlement and this \nbill, modify the rights and obligations of parties to existing water \nservice, repayment, purchase, or exchange contracts, and by specifying \nthat the rights and obligations under what is known as the Exchange \nContract--with downstream districts--are not modified.\n  Further, section 10006(b) makes it clear that the bill does not \npreempt State law or modify any existing obligation of the United \nStates under Federal reclamation law to operate the Central Valley \nProject in conformity with State law.\n  Some third parties had expressed concerns about potential conflicts \nbetween the provision of flows under the restoration program, and the \nrights of the exchange contractors to water from the San Joaquin River.\n  The Bureau of Reclamation has provided a letter that complements the \nlanguage in the legislation and explains that such a conflict is \nextremely unlikely, but should such a conflict\n\n[[Page S377]]\n\narise the Bureau will continue to make water available to the San \nJoaquin River exchange contractors consistent with its contractual \nrequirements.\n  I will ask to have the letter, dated November 6, 2008, from Mr. \nDonald Glaser, regional Director of the Bureau of Reclamation for the \nMid-Pacific Region of California, to Mr. Steve Chedester, executive \ndirector of the San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors Water Authority, \nbe printed in the Record.\n  Concerns about potential damage to downstream farmers and landowners \nfrom water seepage resulting from interim restoration flows under the \nsettlement are addressed by section 10004(h).\n  That section directs the Secretary, before releasing interim flows, \nto prepare an analysis of channel conveyance capacities and the \npotential for seepage, describe an associated seepage monitoring \nprogram, and evaluate possible seepage impacts and mitigation measures \nfor impacts that are significant.\n  The section also directs that interim flows may only be released to \nthe extent they will not impede completion of the channel restoration \nwork or exceed downstream channel capacities.\n  And finally the section directs the Secretary to reduce interim flows \nif necessary to address material adverse impacts from groundwater \nseepage that the Secretary identifies through the Secretary's \nmonitoring program.\n  Some of the third-party agencies have expressed concerns about the \neffectiveness of a fish barrier in the San Joaquin River near the \nconfluence of the Merced River in preventing the upstream migration of \nanadromous fish prior to reintroduction of salmon and implementation of \nthe restoration flow program.\n  This concern has been addressed in part with the addition of section \n10004(i)(4), which calls for an evaluation of the temporary fish \nbarrier, and the funding of fish screens and facilities under certain \ncircumstances.\n  To further address the concerns regarding the effectiveness of the \nfish barrier, the Bureau of Reclamation and the California Department \nof Fish and Game have exchanged letters confirming their willingness to \ncooperate in the operation and evaluation of the Hills Ferry Fish \nBarrier during the interim flows period.\n  More specifically, these letters discuss future efforts by these \nagencies to achieve a barrier program that effectively prevents \nunintended upstream passage of salmonids during the interim flow \nperiod.\n  I applaud these efforts and look forward to their successful \nimplementation.\n  I will ask to have the agencies' letters, dated December 22, 2008, \nfrom Mr. Jason Phillips, Program Manager, Bureau of Reclamation; and \nJanuary 5, 2009, from Jeffery Single, Ph.D., Regional Manager, \nCalifornia Department of Fish and Game, printed in the Record.\n  Third parties had also requested that actions to increase the channel \ncapacity in Reach 2B of the river be prioritized. The legislation \ndirects the Secretary to implement the channel improvements that are \nlisted in paragraph 11 of the settlement necessary to achieve the \nrestoration goal.\n  Among the highest priority restoration improvements identified in the \nsettlement are modifications to increase the channel capacity of Reach \n2B of the river. I am pleased that work in that reach will be a \npriority for the restoration program and as a result will also address \nthe third party concerns.\n  Finally, Section 10011 of the bill provides that the Central Valley \nSpring Run Chinook Salmon reintroduced into the San Joaquin River will \nbe classified as an ``experimental population'' under the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  This section also makes clear that it establishes no precedent with \nrespect to any other application of the Endangered Species Act, ESA.\n  It also provides that the Secretary of Commerce shall issue a rule \nunder section 4(d) of the ESA which shall provide that the \nreintroduction of the spring run salmon under this section shall not \nimpose more than de minimis water supply reductions, additional storage \nreleases or bypass flows on unwilling third parties.\n  In closing, in addition to the protections listed above, I wish to \nhighlight one further provision of the settlement that reflects some of \nthe significant themes of this historic agreement.\n  In paragraph 13(h) of the settlement agreement, the settling parties \nagreed that the Secretary of the Interior should apply to the State of \nCalifornia to protect the restoration flows from Friant Dam to the \nDelta, subject to existing downstream diversion rights.\n  In my view, this underscores that this settlement is intended to \nconform to State law and that the Interior Department will seek \nappropriate actions by the State Water Resources Control Board to \nensure that the water released for the settlement is controlled and \nmanaged from Friant Dam to the Delta to accomplish the restoration goal \nand water management goal purposes.\n  The Bureau of Reclamation has made significant progress on \nenvironmental and engineering studies necessary to implement the \nsettlement.\n  Passage of the legislation will allow the agency to undertake \nspecific programs and projects to implement the settlement's \nrestoration and water management goals.\n  For example, with approval of the legislation, interim flows can \nbegin this fall as scheduled, once a required environmental study is \ncompleted.\n  These limited water releases will provide essential information on \nchannel capacity, fishery needs and water recovery opportunities as \nwell as potential third-party impacts, such as seepage, and measures \nthat may be needed to mitigate them.\n  The information will be used to shape other important aspects of the \nrestoration goal program, such as the release of full restoration \nflows, scheduled to begin in 2014.\n  Passage of the legislation also will allow the Bureau to take \nimmediate steps toward achieving the water management goal, including \nundertaking a project to restore the water-carry capacity of the \nFriant-Kern and Madera Canals and the installation of pump-back systems \non the canals to help recapture water losses resulting from the \nsettlement.\n  In addition, the agency is charged with implementing a cost-sharing \nprogram for local groundwater recharge and recovery projects that will \nhelp mitigate water losses.\n  Before I conclude, I would like to also briefly discuss the other 19 \nCalifornia bills in the omnibus legislation approved today.\n  First, wilderness provisions: The three wilderness bills in this \npackage would together protect a wilderness about 735,000 acres of land \nin Mono, Riverside, Inyo, and Los Angeles Counties, and within Sequoia-\nKings Canyon National Park.\n  The bills include three additions to National Wilderness Preservation \nSystem: Eastern Sierra and Northern San Gabriel Wilderness, Riverside \nCounty Wilderness, and Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks \nWilderness.\n  This package of wilderness bills would help expand lasting Federal \nprotection for some of California's important natural resources.\n  Second: water project authorizations.\n  In the West, drought, population growth, increasing climate \nvariability, and ecosystem needs make managing water supplies \nespecially challenging.\n  The nine California water recycling projects included in the omnibus \nbill offer a proven means to develop cost effective alternative water \nsupply projects.\n  The water projects in the bill would fall under the auspices of the \nBureau of Reclamation, and include San Diego Intertie feasibility \nstudy, Madera Water Supply Enhancement Project authorization, Rancho \nCalifornia Water District project authorization Santa Margarita River \nproject authorization, Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District project \nauthorization, North Bay Water Reuse Authority project authorization, \nPrado Basin Natural Treatment System Project authorization, Bunker Hill \nGroundwater Basin project authorization GREAT Project authorization, \nYucaipa Valley Water District project authorization, Goleta Water \nDistrict Water Distribution System title transfer, San Gabriel Basin \nRestoration Fund, and Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation \nProgram.\n  Together they will help our State reduce its dependence on imported \nwater from both the Lower Colorado River and Sacramento/San Joaquin \nDelta.\n  Third: other public lands bills to help preserve California's \nhistoric legacy.\n\n[[Page S378]]\n\nThese include: Bureau of Land Management: Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk \nIndians of the Tuolumne Rancheria land exchange; Forest Service: \nMammoth Community Water District land conveyance; National Park \nService: Tule Lake Segregation Center Resource Study\n  There is an old saying when it comes to water: Whiskey's for \ndrinking, water's for fighting over.'' There is no area where this has \nbeen more the case than the future of the San Joaquin River.\n  The passage of this omnibus legislation means we are one step closer \ntoward resolving the longstanding conflict over the future of the San \nJoaquin River.\n  This is a bill whose time is long overdue, and I strongly urge my \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives to promptly join us in \napproving this critical piece of legislation.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letters to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                        Bureau of Reclamation,\n\n                                 Sacramento, CA, November 6, 2008.\n     Subject: San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement \n         Legislation--Exchange Contractors Water Deliveries.\n\n     Mr. Steve Chedester,\n     Executive Director. San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors \n         Water Authority, Los Banos, CA\n       Dear Mr. Chedester: This is in response to concerns that \n     you raised during our meeting in Los Banos on October 21, \n     2008. At that meeting, you expressed concern that the \n     Settlement in NRDC v. Rodgers. which was approved by the \n     Court on October 23, 2006, and the San Joaquin River \n     Restoration Act that is currently pending in Congress could \n     be interpreted as modifying the contract between the Exchange \n     Contractors and the United States (Contract # Ilr-1144. as \n     amended February 14, 1968).\n       As I said at the meeting in Los Banos, and I reiterate \n     again. Reclamation does not interpret the Settlement or the \n     proposed legislation as modifying the obligations of the \n     United States under the Exchange Contract. Instead, \n     Reclamation's obligations under the Contract remain \n     unchanged. As a result, if a situation were to occur where \n     Settlement flows conflicted with Reclamation making necessary \n     deliveries under the Contract with the Exchange Contractors, \n     which as we discuss below is highly unlikely, Reclamation \n     would make water available to meet the contractual \n     requirements, consistent with the Contract.\n       My understanding is that the reason you are elevating this \n     issue now is because of a recent Federal District Court \n     decision affecting the operations of the Central Valley \n     Project (CVP) operations in the Delta. At the meeting in Los \n     Banos, a chart was handed out that was said to represent the \n     likely future CVP water supply south of the Delta given \n     pumping restrictions that result from the Federal District \n     Court's decision. The Exchange Contractors interpreted this \n     chart to show that in two out of every ten years. Reclamation \n     would not be able to fully meet the Exchange Contractor \n     demands from the Delta, thus requiring Reclamation to make \n     deliveries to Mendota Pool via the San Joaquin River from \n     Friant Dam. You expressed a specific concern that the flows \n     required by the Settlement for restoration could cause \n     interference with your water deliveries, in that available \n     channel capacity will be used to deliver the flows required \n     by the Settlement at times when the Exchange Contractors need \n     to receive water from Friant Dam.\n       After further review of the chart that was distributed in \n     Los Banos, Reclamation does not concur with the findings \n     presented on the chart. Since receiving your chart. \n     Reclamation completed some preliminary analysis based on \n     information developed for our on-going consultation on the \n     continued long-term operations of the CVP and State Water \n     Project. Our assessment is that, even with the current \n     Interim Federal District Court order in place, we are able to \n     fully meet the Exchange Contractor demands from the Delta in \n     all years. I would also point out that you provided no credit \n     at the meeting as to who completed the analysis, nor could \n     anyone describe the assumptions that were used to generate \n     the chart.\n       As a way to move forward with addressing your concerns. I \n     suggest representatives of the Exchange Contractors meet with \n     Reclamation to discuss the long-term CVP delivery \n     projections, as well as various operational scenarios for the \n     Settlement flows. Such discussions should alleviate your \n     concerns with regard to the risk to your water deliveries.\n       I look forward to working with you as we implement the \n     restoration program. Please contact Jason Phillips if you \n     have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Donald R. Glaser,\n     Regional Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                       Department of the Interior,\n\n\n                                        Bureau of Reclamation,\n\n                                Sacramento, CA, December 22, 2008.\n     Subject: San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act (S 27/\n         H.R. 4074; H.R. 151)--Hills Ferry Barrier Effectiveness \n         Evaluation.\n\n     Mr. Jeffrey R. Single,\n     Regional Manager, California Department of Fish and Game, \n         Fresno, CA.\n       Dear Mr. Single: Third Parties have expressed new concerns \n     related to the operation of the Hills Ferry Barrier (Barrier) \n     in response to recent amendments to the proposed San Joaquin \n     River Restoration Settlement Act. In addition, during \n     discussions among the Settling Parties and Third Parties, \n     Reclamation agreed to exchange letters with the California \n     Department of Fish and Game (DFG) regarding the evaluation of \n     the effectiveness of thc Barrier in preventing the upstream \n     migration of anadromous fish, such as adult Chinook salmon, \n     steelhead, and sturgeon. This letter explains Reclamation's \n     commitment to assist DFG in its operation of the Barrier \n     program as needed during the Interim Flows program.\n       As you are aware, the relationship of the Barrier operation \n     and the San Joaquin River Restoration Program (Program) have \n     already been discussed by the Program's Fisheries Management \n     Work Group (FMWG). I propose that the issue regarding \n     evaluation of the effectiveness of the Barrier, as well as \n     all other actions associated with the relationship of the \n     Barrier operations to the Program, continue to be addressed \n     by the FMWG. The FMWG, in cooperation with DFG, will assess \n     whether alternative designs to maximize the Barrier \n     effectiveness are needed in an effort to reduce unintended \n     anadromous fish migrations upstream of the Barrier on the San \n     Joaquin River. If it is determined that any such migration \n     past the Barrier is caused by the introduction of Interim \n     Flows, and that the presence of such fish will result in the \n     imposition of additional regulatory actions against Third \n     Parties, the Secretary would be authorized under the proposed \n     legislation to assist DFG in making improvements to the \n     Barrier as necessary, or to take other equivalent actions, \n     such as assisting with the salvage of fish that get past the \n     Barrier, if DFG requests such assistance.\n       I look forward to working with you as we implement the \n     restoration program. Please contact me if you have any \n     questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jason Phillips,\n     Program Manager.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  Department of Fish and Game,\n\n                                      Fresno, CA, January 5, 2009.\n     Subject: San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act (S 27/\n         H.R. 4074; H.R. 151)--Hills Ferry Barrier Effectiveness \n         Evaluation.\n\n     Mr. Jason Phillips,\n     Program Manager, San Joaquin River Restoration Program, U.S. \n         Bureau of Reclamation, Sacramento, CA.\n       Dear Mr. Phillips: Per your recent letter dated December \n     22, 2008, the California Department of Fish and Game \n     (Department) thanks you for communicating the U.S. Bureau of \n     Reclamation's (Reclamation) commitment to assist the \n     Department with the operation of the Hills Ferry Barrier \n     (Barrier) during implementation of the San Joaquin River \n     Restoration Program's (SJRRP) Interim Flows.\n       We concur with your proposal that issue regarding \n     evaluation of the effectiveness of the Barrier, as well as \n     all other actions associated with the relationship of the \n     Barrier operations to the Program, continue to be addressed \n     by the Fisheries Management Working Group (FMWG). Such \n     actions could include assessing more effective designs for \n     the barrier, assisting the Department in making improvements \n     to the Barrier as necessary, or taking other equivalent \n     actions, such as assisting with the salvage of fish that get \n     past the Barrier, if the Department requests such assistance.\n       The Department looks forward to the continued cooperation \n     and assistance provided by Reclamation and the SJRRP's \n     Program Fisheries Management Work Group to preclude and/or \n     resolve issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Jeffrey R. Single, Ph.D.,\n                                                 Regional Manager.\n\n  Mr. SALAZAR. Mr. President, I rise today to briefly discuss the \nDominguez-Escalante National Conservation Area and Dominguez Canyon \nWilderness Area Act, which is included in the omnibus public lands \npackage, S. 22, that we are currently considering on the floor.\n  The Dominguez-Escalante National Conservation Area and Dominguez \nCanyon Wilderness Area Act would designate approximately 210,000 acres \nof federally-owned land on the Uncompahgre plateau as the Dominguez-\nEscalante National Conservation Area, NCA, of which approximately \n65,000 acres would be designated as the Dominguez Canyon Wilderness \nArea.\n  The legislation is the product of several years of work in local \ncommunities to find a way of better protecting these Federal lands in \nMontrose, Delta, and Mesa Counties in\n\n[[Page S379]]\n\nColorado. I was proud to introduce this legislation and to work with \nSenator Wayne Allard on it in the 110th Congress. Senator Udall has \nbeen a great champion as well, and he is the cosponsor of the Senate \nlegislation this year. Congressman John Salazar has been the leader of \nthis effort in the House and again this year introduced a companion \nbill in the House of Representatives. The legislation has broad support \nin local communities and I am hopeful we will pass it in the coming \ndays.\n  I briefly want to make a few points about the bill.\n  First, the water rights language of the bill was carefully crafted to \nstrike a balance between Federal interests and State law. The area \nboundaries in the bill are crafted to specifically exclude the Gunnison \nRiver from the wilderness area. The bill disclaims any new Federal \nreserved water rights, instead relying principally on the State of \nColorado's instream flow program to provide and protect the stream \nflows necessary to maintain the purposes of the wilderness within the \nconservation area in perpetuity. However, the Secretary of the \nDepartment of the Interior is directed to appropriate and file for a \nnon-reserved Federal instream water right to ensure protection of such \nstream flows in the circumstance that the State's program proves \nunsuccessful or insufficient. Such filing must be made in Colorado's \nwater court and will follow the procedural requirements of Colorado \nlaw. Additionally, water users' water quality concerns were addressed \nby clarifying that no higher water quality standard than would \notherwise be appropriate is attached to the designating of the National \nConservation Area.\n  The water language in the bill will help ensure that we are able to \nprotect the water resources of area streams, based on seasonally \navailable flows, that are necessary to support aquatic, riparian, and \nterrestrial species and communities in the conservation area and in the \nwilderness area.\n  Second, I am pleased that this bill protects the life estate of Mr. \nBillyie Rambo. Mr. Rambo lives within the boundaries of the proposed \nnational conservation area so we worked to make sure that the \nlegislation would have no effect on valid existing rights.\n  Third, I want to enter into the record a narrative description of the \nboundary of the wilderness area that this legislation would create. \nThis description is consistent with the map referred to in the \nlegislation.\n  Beginning at the northernmost point of the wilderness where the \nwilderness boundary adjoins private property, at Dad's Flat, and \nreading counterclockwise around the wilderness, the wilderness \nboundary:\n  Follows the private property line westward to a point 30 feet off the \ncenterline of the road leading to the private property from the \nsouthwest; follows the road, at a set-back 30 feet from the centerline \nof the road or 30 feet from select existing stockponds along that road, \nto the point at which the road and the original wilderness study area--\nWSA--boundary diverge; from that point, the boundary follows the WSA \nboundary--with select set-backs for existing stockponds and roads, and \nfollowing select drainages, rims, elevation contours, and national \nforest boundaries around Wagon Park--to the point at which the WSA \nboundary reaches Delta county road; follows the WSA boundary, \nimmediately adjacent to Division of Wildlife land--no set-back--and at \na set-back 100 feet from the centerline of the county road, to the \npoint at which the WSA boundary reaches private land; generally follows \nWSA boundary, at a set-back of 100 feet from private land, adjacent to \nDivision of Wildlife Land--no set-back, and 100 feet from the \ncenterline of the county road, as applicable, but with three variations \non the reference noted immediately above: from the point approximately \n38 degrees 41'35.05\" N 108 degrees 18'28.91\" W to the point \napproximately 38 degrees 41'38.87\" N 108 degrees 18'28.98\" W, the \nboundary follows the base of the first visible rim; near an existing \nstructure, the boundary is moved to a point 50 feet set back from \nexisting water development; near the ``stack yard'' north of the county \nroad, from the point approximately 38 degrees 42'04.32\" N 108 degrees \n18'01.71\" W to the point approximately 38 degrees 42'04.29N 108 degrees \n17'55.26\" W, the boundary follows an arc with apex 200 feet north of \nthe county road; beginning at the northeast corner of the wilderness--\nsouthwest of Escalante townsite, and continuing to the point at which \nprivate and Federal land adjoin at the edge of the Gunnison River south \nof Bridgeport townsite, the boundary follows a line variously 100 feet \nset-back from private land or 100 feet set-back from the centerline of \naccess road, except: beginning at a point approximately 38 degrees \n45'40.11\" N 108 degrees 17'00.95\" W and continuing approximately 1,500 \nfeet northwest, follows the road at a set-back 200 feet from the \ncenterline of the road; beginning at a point approximately 38 degrees \n45'48.58\" N 108 degrees 17'20.32\" W and continuing approximately 2,000 \nfeet northwest, follows the road at a set-back 200 feet from the \ncenterline of the road; beginning at a point near existing cultivated \nland south of the Gunnison River--southeast of Dominguez townsite and \ncontinuing approximately 2,000 feet northwest, follows the trail at the \nbase of the rise, beginning at approximately 38 degrees 47'07.75\" N; \n108 degress, 18'50.25\" W with a southern apex at approximately 38 \ndegress, 47'38.09\" N; 108 degrees 19'21.49\" W and meeting the 100 foot \nsetback of the road at approximately 38 degrees 47'38.9\" N; 108 degrees \n19'39.23\" W beginning at a point near large side canyon that drains \nfrom the southwest) (southwest of Peeples townsite), and continuing \napproximately 5,000 feet northwest, the boundary follows the road at a \nset-back of 100 feet south from private land; beginning at the western \nend of the east-west private land line, where that line touches the \nGunnison River south of Bridgeport townsite, and following the southern \nedge of the river to the mouth of Dominguez Canyon, the boundary \nfollows the edge of the Gunnison River--the boundary changes with the \nriver level--the river is out of wilderness, land immediately adjacent \nis in wilderness; at the mouth of Dominguez Canyon, the boundary \ncircles around an existing water diversion at a set-back 100 feet; \nfollows the ditch at a set-back 100 feet from the ditch to private \nland, then 100 feet set-back from private land; beginning at the \nwestern end of the east-west private land line, where that line touches \nthe Gunnison River, and following the southern edge of the river to the \nnext private land line--beginning point for full boundary description, \nthe boundary follows the edge of the Gunnison River--changes with river \nlevel--river is out of wilderness, adjacent land is in wilderness; thus \nreturning to the beginning point.\n  I want to thank all the stakeholders in Colorado who worked so hard \non this legislation. I want to thank Chairman Bingaman and his staff, \nalong with Ranking Member Domenici, Ranking Member Murkowski, Senator \nAllard, Senator Udall, Congressman Salazar and their staffs, for \nhelping move this bill through the legislative process. This is a \nstrong, sensible bill that has broad support. I am proud of all the \nprogress we have made and hope that it will pass both houses of \nCongress in the coming weeks.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to give you the \nreasons why I voted against the motion to invoke cloture on S. 22, the \nOmnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009.\n  I support this legislation on its merit. The bill is a collection of \npriorities for many of my Senate colleagues, most of which concern \npublic land matters specific to their home States. Indeed, I have \nactively supported two provisions in S. 22 that concern my home State \nof Pennsylvania: reauthorization of the Delaware and Lehigh National \nHeritage Corridor and the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route \nNational Historic Trail Designation Act. Moreover, I believe this \nlegislation will go a long way to help preserve and protect some of our \ncountry's most pristine land for future generations without seriously \ncompromising our national capacity to develop domestic energy.\n  It is for these reasons and others that it is particularly \nunfortunate that the majority leader has decided to fill the amendment \ntree and thus demonstrate his intention to utilize in this Congress, \nprocedural roadblocks to deny the rights of the minority to offer \namendments. For more than 200 years this body has prided itself on \ncareful deliberation of legislation. Free and fair debate is the \nhallmark of the U.S.\n\n[[Page S380]]\n\nSenate, and I am not prepared to accept the abdication of these \ntraditions for the purpose of political expediency for the majority \nparty.\n  In the 110th Congress, the majority leader used this tactic to block \nRepublican amendments on 16 different occasions. Important legislation \nsuch as FAA reauthorization, climate change legislation, an energy \nspeculation legislation and energy speculation legislation were all \nderailed because the majority leader's decision to deviate from regular \norder and deny minority participation in the debate.\n  Mr. President, as my colleagues have mentioned, it has been over 120 \ndays since a Republican amendment has received consideration on the \nfloor. It is my hope that the Senate will return to fair procedures for \ndebate, which have well served this proud institution since its \ninception.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Throughout his career as \na public servant, Tom has worked hard to give back to the community \nthat he loves so dearly. I have worked closely with Tom over my career \nand have seen firsthand his dedication to the people of Owensboro.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mayor Watson and wish him \nthe very best as he embarks on new challenges. I further ask unanimous \nconsent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         [From the Owensboro Messenger-Inquirer, Dec. 19, 2008]\n\n                          Watson Bids Farewell\n\n                          (By Owen Covington)\n\n       Owensboro Mayor Tom Watson closed out his term Thursday \n     night in the lobby of the RiverPark Center, just yards away \n     from where work has begun on a $37 million river wall for \n     which he helped secure funding.\n       The farewell reception attended by dozens of friends, \n     families and colleagues was just two blocks away from The \n     Commerce Center, a ``one-stop-shop'' for business and \n     economic development that became a reality at Watson's \n     urging.\n       ``I, for one, look forward to what he'll do next,'' City \n     Commissioner David Johnson told the crowd. ``Everything he \n     does is special, and he does it well and he does it with a \n     passion.''\n       This week, Watson talked with the Messenger-Inquirer about \n     his four years in office and said he had no regrets about his \n     decision to leave city government.\n       ``I'm just happy I had a chance to serve, and I'm humbled \n     that I made it through four years,'' Watson said.\n\n\n                           Unified Government\n\n       Watson jumped in the mayoral race in 2004 as a former \n     chairman of the Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce who had \n     built a successful prosthetics and orthotics business with \n     offices in Owensboro and Evansville.\n       Central to Watson's campaign was a drive for unified \n     government, a push to bring city and county government under \n     one entity to ``speak with one voice.''\n       That push took Watson to Frankfort in 2006 when he helped \n     lobby support for a bill that would put cities and county on \n     a more even footing as they looked at unified government.\n       That bill became law, and Watson and the commission adopted \n     an ordinance in early 2007 to create a commission to study \n     merger, but inaction by Daviess Fiscal Court meant Watson's \n     merger push went no further.\n       ``I feel good we tried, but it didn't work out,'' Watson \n     said. ``It was something you've got to try to do.''\n       Greater Owensboro Chamber of Commerce President Jody \n     Wassmer said Watson's election in 2004 is evidence that the \n     issue is one that will not go away.\n       ``I think we've been able to move some things to the \n     forefront that will pay off in future administrations,'' \n     Wassmer said. ``I think Tom will probably be known as the man \n     that brought government merger back to the forefront.''\n       At Thursday night's reception, Watson was made an honorary \n     judge-executive by Daviess County Judge-Executive Reid Haire, \n     with Haire noting with a smile that the title was probably \n     something the mayor had ``lusted for'' in the past.\n       ``We have worked well together,'' Haire told Watson.\n\n\n                        State, federal attention\n\n       As mayor, Watson was able to use his connections with state \n     and federal elected officials to help bring the community \n     notice when in the past it had been overlooked.\n       ``I think one of his greatest strengths was the \n     relationships that he developed with state and federal \n     officials, and those efforts brought Owensboro an \n     unprecedented amount of state and federal funding,'' said \n     former City Manager Bob Whitmer, who served for three of \n     Watson's four years.\n       U.S. Sen. Mitch McConnell said during a phone interview \n     Thursday that Watson is responsible for making him realize \n     how important riverfront development was to the community.\n       ``He had a lot to do in getting me even more interested and \n     enthusiastic about the future of the Owensboro riverfront,'' \n     McConnell said. ``Tom deserves a lot of credit for pushing \n     that project, believing it was important and believing it \n     would transform the city.''\n\n\n                          Economic development\n\n       Just months after taking office, Watson along with Haire \n     unveiled a ``white paper'' that presented a plan with a \n     broader look at economic development efforts and resulted in \n     a more coordinated effort by the community.\n       The paper also led to the creation of the separate Greater \n     Owensboro Economic Development Corp. and The Commerce Center, \n     which is now home to EDC, the chamber, the office of Downtown \n     Development Director Fred Reeves and the Owensboro \n     Metropolitan Planning Commission.\n       ``I certainly think he and the judge presented and \n     articulated a vision about how they wanted economic \n     development to be a little more streamlined,'' said Nick \n     Brake, EDC president and CEO. ``He had some real strong ideas \n     about doing some things much differently than what we've done \n     in the past.''\n       Thursday night, EDC board chairman Darrell Higginbotham \n     presented Watson with a framed copy of the cover of the \n     ``white paper'' and said a duplicate will be hung in the \n     EDC's offices.\n       ``Your vision for The Commerce Center is a reality today,'' \n     Higginbotham told the mayor.\n\n\n                        ``Man of great energy''\n\n       Commissioner Al Mattingly Jr. noted Thursday night that he \n     got to know Watson as the two squared off in the mayoral \n     election in 2004 and has seen the sacrifices that Watson has \n     made as mayor.\n       ``I know of no other man in the city of Owensboro that is \n     as compassionate, is as\n\n[[Page S381]]\n\n     caring or has as much empathy for others as Tom Watson,'' \n     Mattingly said. ``I think those are real traits in a \n     leader.''\n       Watson's term wasn't without its controversies, and his \n     effort to seek state approval and funding for a joint \n     partnership between the city and development firm Gulfstream \n     Enterprises Inc. opened up a rift in the community.\n       The city was hoping its partnership with Gulfstream for the \n     proposed Gateway Commons development on Kentucky 54 would \n     allow it to receive millions of dollars in tax increment \n     financing.\n       Some viewed the push as an abandonment of efforts to \n     develop downtown, while others saw the project as the only \n     way to get state funding for a new mixed-use events center.\n       The proposal prompted a lawsuit against the city and failed \n     to pass muster with the state, but it was followed by the \n     community backing the creation of a downtown master plan.\n       ``You always knew where he stood,'' said City Manager Bill \n     Parrish. ``I've seen him as a man of great energy where you \n     know where he comes from and he wants to get things moving. \n     He is a man of unbounded enthusiasm.''\n       Though not able to attend Thursday night, Commissioner \n     Cathy Armour sent her thoughts about the mayor in a letter \n     read by Mattingly, and wished him luck and now more time to \n     enjoy his grandchildren.\n       Commissioner Candance Castlen Brake announced Thursday \n     night that the city staff and the commission would be making \n     a donation in Watson's name to the Daniel Pitino Shelter, an \n     organization that he has personally supported in the past and \n     urged the city to commit money to.\n       Watson counts the proclamations he has announced and the \n     recognitions he has handed out as some of his fondest \n     moments, which also include visits to classrooms to talk \n     about city government and work to help open the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs clinic in the city.\n       ``Really it hasn't been a job,'' Watson said Thursday \n     night. ``It's been another opportunity in my life to \n     participate in my community.''\n       When asked if he had any second thoughts about not seeking \n     a second term, Watson explained that he is a ``front \n     windshield'' kind of man.\n       ``I don't like to look out the rearview mirror too much,'' \n     Watson said. ``But you still have that piece of you that \n     wants to see things completed that you started. . . . It's \n     almost like a blur, really, it went by so fast.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/14/senate-section/article/S381-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S381]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO DAVID STEVENS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a well-respected \nKentuckian, Mr. David Stevens. Mr. Stevens's outstanding dedication to \npublic service is truly immeasurable, as is his devotion to our \nCommonwealth.\n  Recently the Lexington Herald-Leader in Lexington, KY, published a \nstory about Mr. Stevens. The story highlights not only the major \ninitiatives he took as a Lexington-Fayette urban county councilman, but \nthe keen sense of humor that contributed to his significant presence in \nKentucky. Mr. Stevens's noteworthy pursuit as a public servant is a \ntrue testament of his devotion to not only Kentucky, but his loyalty to \nour great Nation.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Mr. David \nStevens as a true patriot and Kentuckian whose dedication to his city \nwill be long remembered. I further ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Lexington Herald-Leader, Dec. 15, 2008]\n\n      Modest Stevens' Impact Seen In Smoking Ban, Sunday Drinking\n\n                            (By Michelle Ku)\n\n       David Stevens isn't exactly a household name in Lexington, \n     but the modest man's work has had a huge impact on the city.\n       Thanks largely to Stevens, Lexingtonians can drink a little \n     longer on Sundays but can't light up a cigarette inside a \n     workplace.\n       Stevens, 79, leaves the Urban County Council this month \n     after 15 years.\n       He has served three terms as an at-large councilman and one \n     term as the District 5 representative. He chose not to seek \n     re-election for his district seat.\n       He has been involved in many of the major initiatives in \n     Lexington over the last 15 years.\n       Stevens pushed to extend the hours of Sunday alcohol sales \n     and expanded who was eligible to sell. He helped develop the \n     city's farmland preservation program, the Town & Gown \n     Commission and ethics code.\n       But what he will be most remembered for is the passage and \n     implementation of Kentucky's first smoke-free law. Since \n     Lexington's was passed in 2003, 20 other Kentucky communities \n     have enacted some type of a smoke-free law or regulation.\n       Stevens is probably the most significant Lexington figure, \n     said former Vice Mayor Mike Scanlon.\n       ``If you look at any councilman who has ever served, or any \n     mayor who's ever served, I don't think that there's anybody \n     who's going to leave a bigger footprint on Lexington than \n     David Stevens.''\n       Stevens' departure will leave very large shoes to fill \n     because of his institutional knowledge of Lexington dating \n     back to the writing of the city-county charter, Scanlon said. \n     ``The council changes all the damn time, but the government \n     is going to be changing because David's leaving.''\n       Last month, the council approved the first revision to \n     Lexington's smoking ban.\n       Stevens engineered the revision, which extended the ban to \n     all workplaces, not just those open to the public, and closed \n     a loophole that had allowed smoking in bingo halls.\n       ``Americans for Nonsmokers' Rights calls Lexington's law \n     the shot heard round the world,'' said Ellen Hahn, director \n     of the Kentucky Center for Smoke-Free Policy. ``It was so \n     landmark because this region, including the other tobacco \n     states, really lagged behind the rest of the country.''\n       Many people think the smoking ban was his biggest \n     accomplishment while on council, Stevens said. While it \n     certainly got the most attention, ``the other things are of \n     equal importance.''\n       The parks master plan he worked on with former Councilwoman \n     Sandy Shafer was important even though the city has never \n     been able give parks enough funding, Stevens said.\n       Much of his work on council was done with a vision for \n     Lexington that's 50 years out, said Councilwoman Linda \n     Gorton. ``That was obvious when he helped write the charter \n     and helped with merger. It will take that long for much of \n     his beautification efforts on the city's corridors to grow.''\n       In addition to the legislation he sponsored, Stevens will \n     be remembered for his dry wit. He has a penchant for \n     delivering a well-timed one-liner.\n       For example, during Stevens' final budget and finance \n     committee meeting last Tuesday, the council discussed the \n     city's projected budget shortfall in the next fiscal year.\n       ``I will be happy to forgo any salary for next year,'' \n     Stevens said to a round of chuckles.\n       Stevens plans to remain active in the community and city \n     government despite his retirement from the council.\n       He wants to continue his work on the corridors committee, \n     including a project to add sidewalks to Tates Creek Road from \n     Lakewood Drive to New Circle Road. Neighbors are opposed to \n     the idea.\n       ``I'm determined to get those sidewalks down Tates Creek,'' \n     he said.\n       Also, he wants to complete a project he began several years \n     ago to document discussions that took place on the commission \n     that drafted the city's charter. He had the audio tapes from \n     those meetings transcribed, but still has to review the tapes \n     to identify the speakers, he said.\n       Outside of city government, Stevens will continue on as the \n     president of the Blue Grass Council of the Boy Scouts of \n     America and board chairman of the Kentucky Blood Center. He \n     also wants to finish fund-raising for a children's garden at \n     the Arboretum on Alumni Drive.\n       His one regret while on the council was not pushing as hard \n     as he could have for a dedicated tax for the parks \n     department. When parks explored the idea six years ago, \n     Stevens was running for his third term as an at-large \n     councilman.\n       ``I thought if I spent all my time working on the parks \n     referendum, I might not get re-elected,'' Stevens said. ``I \n     feel kind of bad about that. I let the people in the parks \n     down.''\n       Being on the council is a lot like playing a game of golf, \n     Stevens said.\n       ``When you play a game of golf, you're only going to hit \n     three or four perfect shots out of the 70 in every round,'' \n     he said. ``It's the same on the council, you know, you're not \n     going to hit every one just right.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/14/senate-section/article/S381-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S381-S382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                      REMEMBERING DR. SHUKRI KHURI\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I welcome this opportunity to pay \ntribute to the life of Dr. Shukri F. Khuri who, until he passed away \nlast September 26 from a brain tumor, was one of Massachusetts' \nforemost physicians and a true public servant, contributing especially \nto the health care of our veterans.\n  Dr. Khuri was born in Jerusalem in 1943, and fled with his parents in \n1948 to Syria, later settling in Lebanon. He graduated from American \nUniversity of Beirut, where he met his wife Randa, and also completed \nmedical school at the university. He then completed his surgical \ntraining at Johns Hopkins in Baltimore and the Mayo Clinic in \nRochester, MN.\n  Dr. Khuri was remembered for the extraordinary way he answered the \ncall to public service. He refused lucrative offers to join private \nsurgical practices, and chose instead to combine his\n\n[[Page S382]]\n\npassion for research with his commitment to patient care. He joined the \nSurgical Service of the Veteran's Affairs Boston Healthcare System in \n1976, where he spent the rest of his career. He rose to become Chief of \nSurgery at the West Roxbury VA Medical Center in 1984, Vice Chairman of \nthe Department of Surgery at Brigham and Women's Hospital in 1992, and \nProfessor of Surgery at Harvard Medical School in 1987.\n  Early in his tenure at the VA, Dr. Khuri realized the need for a \nmethodology to assist surgeons in managing the health of the heart \nduring cardiothoracic surgery. In his quest to identify a metabolic \nindicator of intra-operative myocardial ischemia, Dr. Khuri invented \nand patented a probe that would measure the pH of the heart muscle, a \ndevice currently in the final stages of research and development.\n  In addition to his work in surgical heart protection, Dr. Khuri was \ndeeply interested in improving the quality of care for all surgical \npatients. In 1978, at West Roxbury VA Medical Center, he established \nthe first automated data management system in a surgical intensive care \nunit in the Northeast. Today, the electronic patient record in the VA \nis by far the most advanced and comprehensive electronic medical \nrecords system in the world.\n  Dr. Khuri also led a unique national effort within the VA which \nestablished the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program in 1994. \nThe program is now recognized by the surgical community as the standard \nfor the comparative assessment of quality of surgical care and for \ncontinuous improvement in surgery. This program has now become the \nmodel for a joint effort between the VA and the American College of \nSurgeons to incorporate data in the private sector to see that all \npatients receive the best care possible.\n  In the course of his outstanding career, Dr. Khuri achieved national \nand international prominence. His research laboratory at West Roxbury \nhas been continuously funded for 24 years and has trained more than 60 \nresidents and postgraduate students in applied research. He was a \nmember of numerous professional organizations, including the \nprestigious American Surgical Association, and he served on and chaired \nmany regional and national committees, including a 3-year term as \npresident of the Massachusetts Affiliate of the American Heart \nAssociation.\n  Dr. Khuri was the author of more than 200 peer-reviewed publications. \nHe was also a regular reviewer for more than ten scientific journals, \nand served on the editorial board of the Journal of Thoracic and \nCardiovascular Surgery. He was the recipient of many prestigious \nawards, including the 1998 Frank Brown Berry Prize, which honors an \noutstanding physician in the federal health care system each year. Just \ndays after his death, Dr. Khuri was named the recipient of the 2008 \nErnest Amory Codman Award for improvements in the safety of care to the \npublic.\n  As a Palestinian American, he felt the pain of the conflict in the \nMiddle East firsthand, and he devoted much of his life to seeking peace \nin the region. He worked with groups in the Boston area to create and \nsustain dialogue between Israelis, Palestinians, and Jewish and Arab \nAmericans.\n  Dr. Khuri embodied the American story of hope, opportunity and \nservice. He built a remarkably successful professional life as a public \nservant, and he also built a beautiful and loving home. His hobbies \nranged from carpentry to photography to actively serving in his church. \nHis love of life, his profound humility, his steadfast faith, and his \neternally optimistic outlook will continue to inspire all those whose \nlives he touched. He is deeply missed by his wife and three children, \nhis four grandchildren, his mother and brother, his many loving family \nmembers, his friends and patients, and the community he loved to serve \nand served so well. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/14/senate-section/article/S382-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S382-S383]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO RICH ARENBERG\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, as the Nation celebrates a new beginning by \nwelcoming a new administration to town next week, my office will be \nsaying goodbye to a longtime trusted adviser and friend. Today, I pay \ntribute to my legislative director, Rich Arenberg, who will retire from \nCongress after 34 years to take a teaching position at Brown \nUniversity.\n  In the nearly 15 years that Rich has led the legislative team in my \noffice, he has provided invaluable guidance on innumerable issues that \nhave arisen. No doubt, he has a detailed record--likely in chart form--\nof the legislative back-and-forth behind each bill, if not each vote, \nwe have confronted together. And when Rich announced his retirement to \nthe legislative staff last month, the number of long faces around the \ntable spoke volumes about his skills.\n  Rich has an encyclopedic knowledge of Senate history, procedure, and \nprotocol. He has been a mentor to countless Hill staffers, as well as a \nthoughtful, reasonable, skilled adviser to the Members he has served. \nHe is a gifted storyteller who enlightens and entertains my office with \nanecdotes of his decades on the Hill. And above all, he is an \nincredibly decent human being, devoted to his work, loyal to the people \naround him, with a passion for life.\n  Rich takes a distinct interest not only in understanding the policy \nimplications of the bills that came before the Senate but also in \nappreciating the subtleties of each vote the significance of procedural \nvotes and the connotations of each Senator's stance. Rich revels in the \nobscure though sometimes critical anomaly: for example, he often \ntracked which Senators reversed their positions between or during \nvotes.\n  With his competence, focus, and passion, Rich has endeared himself to \nthose who had the pleasure of working with or near him. Beyond his \npersonal qualities, he has distinguished himself with a remarkable \nrecord of legislative contributions. Rich and I arrived in the Senate \nat the same time following the election of 1978. As a staffer for \nSenator Paul Tsongas, whom he had previously worked for in the House of \nRepresentatives, Rich was initiated in the Senate in a pursuit that \nalso dominated my first year: securing loan guarantees for Chrysler \nthat helped save the company and had an enormous positive impact on the \nvibrancy of our domestic auto industry. He contributed significantly to \nthe Alaska Lands Act, enacted in 1980, which remains of the most \nsignificant pieces of environmental legislation of the last several \ndecades.\n  Beginning in 1984, he served as chief of staff to Senator George \nMitchell. His work to investigate the Iran-Contra affair could fill a \nbook--and, in fact, Rich helped Senator William Cohen and then-Majority \nLeader Mitchell write ``Men of Zeal,'' a book detailing the 1987 Iran-\nContra hearings in which Rich played a critical role. As a special \nassistant for national security affairs for Senator Mitchell in the \nearly 1990s, Rich handled a variety of intelligence matters, and his \nwork required extensive travel around the world.\n  Since joining my staff in 1994, Rich has contributed to legislation \nprotecting the Great Lakes, improving treatment for drug abuse, and \npreserving American jobs. Rich has been on the front lines of \nlegislative efforts that have sometimes spanned years. He has been at \nmy side at the crack of dawn each Wednesday morning for weekly radio \ninterviews, at the ready to answer questions. His performance reflects \na deep respect for the Senate and an understanding that the root of \nsenatorial accomplishment is cooperation and collaboration.\n  He has worked long hours with a zeal for legislative maneuvering \nmatched only by his passion for the Red Sox and exceeded only by his \nlove for his family. I was honored that he and his wonderful wife Linda \nchose my Capitol hideaway as the site to celebrate their wedding, a \njoyful day that included a spirited procession through the Senate \nbuilding and Capitol subway. And when his Red Sox won the World Series \nor when his beloved cocker spaniel had a new litter of puppies or when \nhis sons or daughter were in the midst of an adventure, there was a \nglint in his eye and a smile would break across his face.\n  But there is no doubt that Rich's engaging stories, insightful \nobservations, and flair for humor will be a treasure trove for the \nstudents who are fortunate enough to be in his classroom. They will \nlearn the ins and outs of the Senate from the best. They'll learn about \nRich's ``tilted deck'' theory, which predicts that the Senate will take \nuntil the eve of adjournment or weekend recess to act, and then, if it\n\n[[Page S383]]\n\nfails to do so, will inevitably take until the eve of the next deadline \nto try again. And I am willing to predict that after a semester with \nRich, his students will know well that a gorilla in an idiom should \nalways weigh 800 pounds and that they will pay close attention to the \nPresident's appraisal of the State of our Union.\n  For one more glimpse of Rich's great accrued wisdom, look at his \noffice. Inside Rich's office, he has posted a quote from Confucious. It \nreads: ``When you know a thing, to hold that you know it; and when you \ndo not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it--this is \nknowledge.''\n  That is the brand of excellence that Rich brought to all his work in \nthe Senate, and that approach is why he has been such a trusted and \nimportant adviser to me, as well as to other Senators. And when he does \nnot know a thing, he figures it out. Rich, thank you for your work on \nbehalf of the people of the State of Michigan, mastering their issues, \napplying your legislative skills to their benefit. Thank you for your \nservice to the Nation in the Senate, advancing the spirit of thoughtful \nbipartisanship that makes this body work. Thank you helping me navigate \nthe murky waters of Senate procedure and precedent for all these years. \nAnd thank you for your friendship and for being--day-in and day-out--\nthe kind of staff member that a Senator can be proud of.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/14/senate-section/article/S383-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S383-S385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday expenses \nbut also have suggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can \ndo now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond \ntoday. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am a college student in Pocatello at ISU in the Physician \n     Assistant Program. My husband is a real estate agent and we \n     own a few rentals in town. I wanted to comment on the effect \n     that rising energy prices have had on the real estate market. \n     Generally spring and summer are boom time in Idaho's real \n     estate market. But we have noticed a sharp down-turn in the \n     market in Pocatello this spring. There are a glut of homes on \n     the market and nothing is moving. It is as if everyone is \n     holding their breath, glad to have a home, and not ready to \n     move. I am sure things will move, but prices have dropped \n     significantly.\n       I am glad to hear you are concerned about this. Both my \n     husband and I agree. Drill here, drill now. If we have \n     untapped energy reserves in the United States . . . we are \n     fools! We need to be accessing our own resources, creating \n     jobs, growing our economy, and saving ourselves money. I am \n     sure we can do it in a responsible way with minimal effect on \n     the environment. I do not want to damage our environment, but \n     if it costs us our economic liberty to do it . . . I say \n     drill.\n     Annie and Jason Dixon.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for your email. Most citizens do not feel that \n     Washington is aware of our concerns or listening . . . and \n     here you are asking . . . thank you.\n       To Whom It May Concern:\n       Our family is a 5th generation Idaho family. We have worked \n     hard for 40 years to teach our family to accept \n     responsibility for themselves and their success. There are no \n     free-loaders in our family. Now, because of the current \n     economic trend, we are all very concerned about our future in \n     spite of our hard work and sacrifices. Higher energy prices \n     have caused concern in every corner of our lives and every \n     time we go to the pump or pay our utility bills our concerns \n     are heightened and reaffirmed. Fear is a great motivator . . \n     . unfortunately it is a negative motivator and we are seeing \n     the results dramatically.\n       We have seen the negative impact in every household in our \n     family. Our son-in-law is a very successful Realtor and his \n     business is off 50% from last year. Another son-in-law has \n     his own construction company. His business is off 40% from \n     last year. My son and I have a very successful commercial \n     real estate business and typically earn over $400,000 a year. \n     We have only had one closing this year. Buyers are hesitant \n     to move forward because of the current economic concerns. Our \n     youngest son was planning on starting his own business using \n     the degree he obtained from college but now he feels he must \n     find employment elsewhere. Another son began building his \n     own home this winter and is now questioning whether he \n     should move into his dream home or sell it and find \n     something much smaller.\n       These are not minor inconveniences. These are life changing \n     concerns and we can do nothing to change or control them.\n       The economic status of our country is critically out of \n     control because of poor judgment and planning on the part of \n     the policy makers in Washington. Because of years of doing \n     nothing to plan and prepare for the future the security and \n     success of our entire family is now being threatened. We are \n     fearful, we are disappointed and we are angry.\n       It is alarming to think that the policies of our government \n     leaders have caused such a life altering situation. Wouldn't \n     you think that the country who championed capitalism would \n     understand the law of supply and demand? Wouldn't you think \n     that the brightest and best that have been sent to Washington \n     would have seen this crisis coming?\n       We do not blame the oil companies. The government has kept \n     their hands tied for years. We blame you . . . the policy \n     makers and leaders of this nation. Now the light of truth is \n     shining brightly and we can all see the results of listening \n     to the special interest groups who only care about their own \n     selfish interests. Washington has put this country and its \n     citizens in a perilous and fearful situation. Fear leads to \n     anger. Anger leads to anarchy.\n       It is time for Washington to stop ``looking'' at the \n     situation like spectators and start ``fixing'' the problems \n     with real solutions that work. It is time for Washington to \n     wake up to the reality of where we are at and the impact of \n     their neglect. Washington has neglected reason and ignored \n     the writing on the wall. At what price?\n       Americans can make this country strong and independent \n     again if the bureaucrats and the special interest groups will \n     just get out of our way.\n       We are very grateful that we have our faith and our family. \n     We will weather this unnecessary storm but what about the \n     rest of the people who call this nation home? I guess if \n     Washington fails to stop the insanity we can always feed our \n     children spotted owls and polar bears.\n       Please Senator Crapo. Do not let us down. This is just the \n     tip of the iceberg. If we do not do something now who knows \n     what the next crisis will be and how far this country will \n     fall into chaos.\n     Dennis and Janette Stevens, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am 22 years old and when I first started driving only a \n     short 7 years ago, at that time it cost me 35-40 dollars to \n     fill my truck, today it cost just over 100 dollars. Do the \n     math that is a huge increase and most of which has been in \n     the past few years. I am currently spending 400+ dollars a \n     month on gas. This new cost is taking a big hit on me and my \n     savings account which I am relying on since I will never see \n     all that money I pay into social security. You guys in \n     Congress just don't seem to get how angry the American people \n     are at your lack of caring on how we feel. Remember we are \n     the ones who elected you to represent us not your own \n     interests or lobbyists. Please start doing your jobs and look \n     out for the interests of the greatest country in the world. \n     Drill for our own oil now. I know it will not be an immediate \n     help but imagine if we do nothing, we apparently never \n     learned from the 70s. Thanks for at least asking our opinion \n     and please relay the messages to the rest of Congress.\n     Andrew.\n                                  ____\n\n       I'm a bit disappointed in the way you have phrased your \n     plea. You are only asking for horror stories and looking for \n     support to find ways to decrease fuel costs and increase fuel \n     supplies. I am affected by fuel costs as much as the next \n     person, but I try to look at the larger picture and I wish \n     you would to. Easily available and cheap fossil fuels has \n     been a major problem for our country and for humanity in \n     general. It got us through the industrial revolution and \n     was responsible, in no small way, for much that is good in \n     our society. Unfortunately, it also causes much harm. Some \n     examples:\n       (1) Global warming\n       (2) International policy driven by a need to ensure a \n     continuing oil supply\n       (3) The loss of great public transportation systems, such \n     as the light rail system that served the treasure valley for \n     decades\n       (4) The loss of our freight rail system in favor of an \n     enormously powerful trucking industry that is much more \n     costly to the environment and dangerous to the public.\n       I am sure the list could go on.\n       So, I propose that we look at the opportunities created by \n     high oil prices--the opportunity to develop alternative \n     energy sources, the opportunity to emphasize public \n     transportation, the opportunity to begin weaning ourselves \n     from dependence on foreign sources of fuel. I know that my \n     opinion is not popular, but I believe we have not yet got to \n     the point where fuel costs are painful\n\n[[Page S384]]\n\n     enough to effect the changes we need. I would be happier if \n     you put your considerable weight behind legislation for real \n     change rather than patching a bad system.\n       Thank you for your concern, Senator. I just wish you shared \n     mine.\n     Dave.\n                                  ____\n\n       As a full time student working two jobs, paying outrageous \n     prices that continue to rise makes it difficult to manage. \n     College education is extremely important to my future and my \n     success in life, yet with the increases of gas prices and \n     school tuition work is a priority over education. Many, \n     including myself, are feeling the pressures of paying bills, \n     working, and going to school forces us to choose work over \n     our education. Some ideas to decrease the prices of gas (oil) \n     would be to drill off the coast line, provide better public \n     transportation in and around Boise (trains, metros, etc), \n     better access to roads for bicycles, or use some of our oil \n     reserve. I also think that we need to hold oil/gas industry \n     accountable. I also think that banning plastic bags would \n     help with energy and the environment. Promoting closer \n     vacations or trips within Idaho would be a good idea. Through \n     a mass transit system (trains, etc) that would link our \n     cities together would help increase tourism and would help \n     encourage our own to venture out without the worry of high \n     costs.\n     Rebekah West.\n                                  ____\n\n       Sometimes it appears that the United States Congress, \n     charged with taking care of the needs of the People of the \n     country, is instead preoccupied with representing the few and \n     the extreme--the special interests and the so-called \n     environmentalists. I cannot believe that we would prohibit \n     our own country from drilling for oil off of our own shores, \n     but other countries are doing so. Where is the logic behind \n     barring oil exploration in Alaska while our nation is \n     bleeding economically due to buying oil from our avowed \n     social and political foes abroad? Other, equally destructive \n     policies arise from the hoax of global warming and the \n     thought that, even if it is real, that we can combat it \n     unilaterally. Considering that China, for instance, is \n     ramping up its energy demands with no concern for it \n     unbridled pollution. We are frittering away our competitive \n     edge on the economic and political theaters. Our irrational \n     fear of nuclear power and the thought that hydrogen powered \n     cars will cure our need for fossil fuels (where do we believe \n     the electrical power to accomplish this inefficient process \n     comes from?) will continue to bankrupt us.\n       Now, for the direct, personal impact of our irresponsible \n     energy policies: We are a middle class family with six \n     children. Our standard of living is being constantly driven \n     downward by the rising costs that energy imposes on food, \n     heating, travel, and just the cost of doing business. While \n     the buying power of my dollar continues to fall, and many \n     necessities have recently risen in cost by double digit \n     percentage points, my salary has remained stagnant. Even such \n     an important event as visiting my elderly parents in an \n     adjacent state has been curtailed due to outrageous gas \n     prices. We live in Idaho and my parents moved from California \n     to northern Utah to be closer to us. While in the past, our \n     visits to look in on and help them were typically monthly, \n     now we visit them only a couple of times a year. We feel that \n     we are not meeting our obligations and this situation is \n     prone only to further deterioration. We are struggling with \n     keeping our oldest son in college and the prospects for \n     higher education for his siblings are dwindling, although \n     this is a priority for our family.\n       Everywhere we look, we observe negative trends. Where can \n     we look to for help aside from our government, which appears \n     not to hear our pleas? In fact, our understanding of the \n     energy and trade intentions of Congress convinces us that \n     things will get far worse. We are striving to live \n     responsibly and within our means. We do not note the same \n     disciplined approach from our national and local governments.\n     Eric and Melanie Kuns.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am contacting you with a story I thought would be of \n     significant value to the people of the Treasure Valley.

If we \n     had a government concerned about us, we wouldn't need to send \n     emails to tell you how much poor people are suffering.\n       And another thing--My house and barber shop were \n     reappraised this year, so my taxes could be increased.\n       Don't you think it is about time the government cut some \n     jobs and programs like the rest of us are having to?\n       Thanks for listening.\n     Tom Smith, Parma.\n                                  ____\n\n       The Country's present economic condition mandates immediate \n     action. The oil companies have had consecutive years of \n     record breaking earnings. It is time for the industry to \n     reinvest some of those earnings in the country and the people \n     that have ``Demanded the Supply''. The United States needs to \n     show that we are capable not only of producing but producing \n     a quality product that will aid the environment and provide \n     jobs for the population at the same time. I grew up in the \n     Southern California area where the undulating pumps helped to \n     produce the oil that was refined into the end product. Again \n     we are hearing we must maintain a global economy. It is very \n     hard to think global when local (friends, family, and \n     neighbors) are working twice as heard and ending up with half \n     as much.\n     Pat, Middleton.\n                                  ____\n\n       As an Idaho public educator, the increases in energy and \n     food costs have made life increasingly difficult. I may have \n     to give up my career in public education and seek employment \n     in the private sector to be able to meet my financial \n     obligations (such as student loan payments).\n       I have not seen any benefit from the government's \n     expenditures on alternative fuel sources (such as bio-\n     diesel). I believe that we should work to end our dependence \n     on foreign oil by taking advantage of our domestic resources. \n     I believe we should increase domestic drilling (using \n     environmentally responsible practices). I appreciate you \n     seeking the opinion of your constituents. I hope that our \n     opinions will be taken into account on a national level and \n     that action will be taken soon.\n     Erica Hardy.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would love for you to have Congress and those who are \n     opposing drilling for our own resources what a low income \n     family faces. My family has struggled to make ends meet and \n     when we finally figure it out gas prices go up, or someone \n     needs to go to the doctor. My husband drives 150 miles a week \n     for work, we are now looking at $200 plus, a month on gas \n     just for work forget running to the store to get things we \n     need. We have received help from our church but they can only \n     help so far. We just barely make too much to get food stamps \n     or health care help. Our level pay on our power and gas keep \n     going up whenever we get behind and finally get it caught up \n     again. I do not understand why Obama and other Democrats will \n     not drill for oil because ``it takes too long'' as I have \n     been told they were saying the same thing about ten years ago \n     and if they didn't have their heads up a certain body part \n     then we probably wouldn't be in this position. Senator you \n     have asked us for our opinion please don't let those who have \n     voted for you and have taken some faith in your interest \n     down. My family lives in the South Eastern part of the state \n     and when we traveled down the first of March we were paying \n     $2.97 in gas and now that we are looking at another trip down \n     we are looking at paying over $4.00 a gallon for gas. My mom \n     is paying our way. Not to mention that where she lives gas is \n     the first to go up and the last to go down because the \n     closest town for gas is 30 miles away. You asked us now \n     please try to make a difference I want someone in Congress to \n     please show me how I am supposed to make ends meet with DAILY \n     rising fuel prices. If they refuse to do what is needed to \n     help because it will take too long then by all means please \n     come to my house and live on my income for a few months and \n     show me how I am supposed to make ends meet.\n     Kim, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       This was an email sent to me by my father, a former Idaho \n     resident who now lives in Nebraska. You may even be familiar \n     with his name. He was quite an advocate for you. I have an \n     Expedition that we purchased only this past December. It cost \n     us $60 to fill it then, now it costs me over $100. I know \n     that the answer to high fuel costs will not come immediately, \n     but we must act now. Or we will not have a future. We must \n     start drilling. The ANWR in Alaska must be opened to us. This \n     country is filled with oil rich deposits. We must increase \n     our refining capacity, we must create new oil fields. The \n     level of environmental awareness is so far beyond that of 30 \n     years ago that the concerns of big business doesn't exist the \n     way it did then. The oil spills of the 70's aren't our \n     future. Times have changed and the environmentalists have to \n     be made to see that and that they are destroying our freedom \n     and way of life. I have five grown sons and I fear for their \n     future. I am grateful that I am not raising children in this \n     day and age, but I am sorry for my children that they have to \n     face such a future. The liberals and environmentalists of \n     Washington D.C. are destroying our future, you must be \n     counted and stand up and fight for us. I no longer vote for \n     the lesser of the evils, I now vote for the person who I \n     believe is the best leader for our\n\n[[Page S385]]\n\n     future. That means I'm voting for Ron Paul. Will he win? Not \n     a chance, but will I vote for someone that will continue the \n     selling of this country down the river? Not a chance!

Its educational events will be held at area galleries, \nlibraries, museums, theaters, and universities, bringing positive \nattention to many northeast Ohio locations.\n  This year, Fashion Week Cleveland will highlight ``green-\nsustainability'' in a special show that coincides with the United \nNations' Year of the Natural Fibre. This event will feature garments \nmade of natural fibers produced in Ohio.\n  The Cleveland Fashion Show, the central event of Fashion Week \nCleveland, is recognized across the country as a distinctive showcase \nfor American designers. Fashion Week Cleveland is also nationally \nrecognized as the third largest fashion industry event in the United \nStates, after events held in New York and Los Angeles.\n  I am proud that Fashion Week Cleveland will contribute significantly \nto the economic growth of Ohio. Restaurants, hotels, stores, and other \nretail establishments will benefit tremendously from the patronage of \nFashion Week Cleveland attendees.

SQUELLATI\n\n Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I would like to recognize a great \nAmerican and a dedicated Air Force officer who has diligently served in \nmy office for the past year.\n  Colonel Squellati was born in San Rafael, CA, and entered the Air \nForce in 1986 after earning her bachelor of science in nursing from New \nYork State University. She earned her master of science in nursing from \nCalifornia State University, Dominguez Hills. Her assignments include \ncommander, 47th Medical Operations Squadron, 47th Medical Group, \nLaughlin Air Force Base, Texas; commander, 321st Expeditionary Medical \nGroup, Masirah, Oman; commander, 72nd Medical Operations Squadron, 72nd \nMedical Group, Tinker AFB, Oklahoma; and deputy group commander, 72nd \nMedical Group, Tinker AFB, Oklahoma.\n  Colonel Squellati served as a principal legislative adviser to myself \nand the congressional committee staff on health, nursing and defense \nhealth. She drafted health related authorization and appropriations \nlanguage for introduction to the Senate. She collaborated with \ncommittee staffers, constituents, and Tri-Service military personnel, \nattended committee hearings, prepared background information and \nquestions for witnesses, and coordinated the development of Senate \nbills and amendments through Senate committees and conference \ncommittees.

From \ncompanies whose employees volunteer at food pantries to firms that \nsponsor teams in their town's Little League program, America's small \nenterprises are magnanimous forces in the cities and towns where they \noperate. I rise today to highlight the tremendous gift of one business, \nCaldwell Auto Parts & Towing, to the town of Limestone, a small town of \nroughly 2,400 in far northern Maine.\n  Caldwell Auto Parts & Towing has been in Limestone for the last 10 \nyears, under the ownership of brothers Scott and Robbie Caldwell. Prior \nto that, the company was located in Caswell, one town north of \nLimestone, on the U.S. border with New Brunswick, Canada. A family-\nowned small business, the company is dedicated to providing quality \nauto parts to its clientele, as well as responsive and safe towing.\n  Caldwell's has long been known for its generosity within town, but \nits latest act of kindness was a true surprise. Robbie and Scott \nCaldwell, wanting to celebrate the tenth year of their business' \noperation in town, decided to give back to the community in a unique \nand lasting manner. They determined that donating one of their \nvehicles--a 2006 Ford Explorer--to the Limestone Police Department \nwould represent an unparalleled gift. After contacting the town manager \nand police chief to make the gift a reality, the Caldwells fitted the \nvehicle with a full police package, making it ready to use without any \ninvestments by the town.\n  What makes the vehicle even more special is that it is replacing one \nof Limestone's police cruisers that suffered significant damage during \nwhiteout conditions last winter. The new vehicle has four wheel drive \nand studded tires, making it more effective to drive during the long \nand snowy winter months in Aroostook County.\n  People in Limestone have long known the Caldwells for their kindness \nand charity. Active members of their community and the local chamber of \ncommerce, Caldwell's has been critical in assisting the town's \nrecreation department, including sponsoring T-shirts for youth \nbasketball teams. Additionally, Caldwell's has made significant \ndonations to Project Graduation, a Maine-wide program that promotes \nsafe, drug-free graduation parties, including contributing one of their \nvehicles for the group's use in the Limestone Fourth of July parade.\n  Caldwell Auto Parts & Towing understands the meaning of being a good \nneighbor. Over the years, they have sought new and distinctive ways to \nmake a difference in their community, and have garnered much good will. \nAs Donna Bernier, Limestone's town manager, noted, ``The Caldwells have \nmade significant impacts on the community and they continue to do so.'' \nI wish Scott and Robbie Caldwell and everyone at Caldwell Auto Parts & \nTowing the very best, and thank them for their contributions to a safer \nand stronger Limestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/14/senate-section/article/S385-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                TRIBUTE TO CALDWELL AUTO PARTS & TOWING\n\n Ms. SNOWE.

A bill to designate a portion of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge as wilderness; to the Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, this morning we introduced legislation \nto protect the coastal plains region of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge from the threat of oil and gas exploration. S. 231 designates \n1.5 million acres of the Refuge as Wilderness to be included in the \nNational Wilderness Preservation System. Bestowing Wilderness \ndesignation on this precious piece of national heritage will reaffirm \nthe original intent of the Refuge: to provide habitat for Alaska's \nwildlife.\n  As designated Wilderness, that land will become subject to specific \nmanagement restrictions. Human activities will be restricted to non-\nmotorized recreation, scientific research, and other non-invasive \nactivities. Logging, mining, road building, mechanized vehicles, and \nother forms of development are generally prohibited in designated \nWilderness areas. However, since these particular lands are in Alaska, \nsome public motorized uses will be permitted for subsistence and \ntraditional use. For example, subsistence hunting as well as limited \nbackpacking and hiking will be allowed.\n  The Arctic Refuge is home to 250 species of wildlife. Drilling there \nwould severely harm its abundant populations of polar bears, caribou, \nmusk oxen, and snow geese, and the amount of commercially recoverable \noil in the Refuge would satisfy only a very small percentage of our \nnation's need at any given time.\n  The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge is a pristine natural treasure \nthat must be preserved for future generations. We do not have to choose \nbetween conservation and exploration when it comes to our energy \nfuture; we can do both simultaneously while moving toward a sustainable \nand diverse national energy policy.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 234. A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 2105 East Cook Street in Springfield, Illinois, as \nthe ``Colonel John H. Wilson, Jr. Post Office Building''; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce \nlegislation to designate the United States Post Office at 2105 East \nCook Street in Springfield, IL, as the ``Colonel John H. Wilson, Jr. \nPost Office Building,'' honoring the first African-American to achieve \nthe rank of Colonel in the Illinois Reserves.\n  Colonel John H. Wilson, Jr., was born on December 28, 1918, in \nSpringfield, IL. In 1942, he enlisted in World War II and served in \nfive battle campaigns in Europe, including in General Patton's advance \nin France, for which he was awarded the Silver Star Medal.\n  In addition to his 14 years of active duty service, he served for 17 \nyears in the Illinois Reserves. He served as group commander in \nSpringfield from 1967-1973 and was promoted to Colonel in 1965, making \nhim the first African-American to achieve that rank in the Illinois \nReserves at that time. Upon his retirement in 1973, he was awarded the \nLegion of Merit from the Army.\n  In his civilian life, Col. Wilson worked for the United States Postal \nService for 57 years. From time to time, he would stop by my office in \nSpringfield to share news about our local post office and make sure our \nmail was being delivered on time. Whenever he could, he would stop by \nto see me in Washington.\n  Anyone who knew Col. Wilson also knew of his love for the Reserves. \nHe was a life member of the U.S. Reserve Officers Association, \nPresident of the ROA Springfield Chapter from 1960-61 and President of \nthe ROA Illinois Department from 1971-72.\n  He was also a commercial photographer, member of the Military \nOfficers of America, and lifelong member of Holy Trinity Lutheran \nChurch.\n  He died on August 30, 2008, in the same home of his birth. He is \nsurvived by his wife of 62 years, Lydie, and their two daughters, \nShirley Wilson and Chantal Sneed.\n  Col. Wilson was a distinguished man of service. My hometown of \nSpringfield, IL and our Nation is a better place because of his \nlifelong commitment to his country.\n  I am grateful to Springfield Mayor Timothy Davlin, former Illinois \nNational Guard Adjutant General Lou Myers, and the local branch of the \nAmerican Postal Workers Union for their support of this legislation. I \nhope my colleagues will join me in enacting this tribute to Col. \nWilson.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 234\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. COLONEL JOHN H. WILSON, JR. POST OFFICE BUILDING.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The facility of the United States Postal \n     Service located at 2105 East Cook Street in Springfield, \n     Illinois, shall be known and designated as the ``Colonel John \n     H. Wilson, Jr. Post Office Building''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in a law, map, regulation, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     facility referred to in subsection (a) shall be deemed to be \n     a reference to the ``Colonel John H. Wilson, Jr. Post Office \n     Building''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mr. Udall of Colorado):\n  S. 235. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to establish fair \nand transparent practices relating to the extension of credit under an \nopen end consumer credit plan, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the \nCredit Cardholders' Bill of Rights today with my friend and colleague, \nSenator Charles Schumer. We are introducing this bill today as a way to \nadd some commonsense rules to the laws governing the issuance of credit \ncards.\n  Commonsense rules are important at a time when many Americans are \nhurting and taking on more debt, even as credit card companies are \nmaking record profits. I hear often from hard-working, honest \nColoradans who are asking only to be treated fairly by the credit card \nindustry, whose deceptive practices have plagued consumers for years.\n  We need to act to bring greater fairness to the millions of Americans \nwho need and use credit cards every day. I have heard from constituents \nacross Colorado, asking me to help even the playing field on this \nissue.\n\n[[Page S390]]\n\n  They benefit from the widespread availability of consumer credit, and \ntheir use of that credit has been important to our economy. In fact, \nfor many Americans, consumer credit is more than a convenience. It is \nsomething that many people need to use to pay for their everyday needs. \nFor them, it is a necessity.\n  Of course, another word for credit is debt, and credit card debt has \nincreased considerably in recent years. Overall, during the last \ndecade, total credit card debt rose by about 70 percent, and this \nclearly has an effect on consumers.\n  Some polls have reported that about 70 percent of surveyed families \nsaid the quality of their lives is adversely affected by the extent of \ntheir debts, and young people are more worried about going deeply into \ndebt than about a terrorist attack.\n  Some have argued that much of this debt was caused by recklessness \nand an erosion of financial responsibility. That was one of the main \narguments advanced in support of the recent changes in the bankruptcy \nlaws.\n  But while there was something to that argument, it was not the whole \nstory and it put too much emphasis on borrowers alone. Instead of just \nfocusing on borrowers, Congress should also do more to promote \nresponsibility by those who provide the credit, and one place to start \nis with credit card companies.\n  That is the reason I have been working to make some commonsense \nchanges in the rules for credit card companies.\n  I first introduced a bill to do that back in 2006, and reintroduced \nit again the following year. I am proud it won the support of an array \nof consumer groups as well as cosponsors from congressional districts \nacross the country.\n  Last year, the House passed H.R. 5244, the Credit Cardholders' Bill \nof Rights, a bill I introduced with Representative Carolyn Maloney, \nthat includes many provisions based on my legislation.\n  The bill I am introducing today with Senator Schumer is almost \nidentical to the House-passed bill. It includes protection against \narbitrary interest rate increases. It will prevent cardholders who pay \non time from being unfairly penalized. It will bar excessive fees and \nwill require more fairness in the way payments are handled. And it will \nprohibit the use of ``universal default'' clauses--provisions that \nallow card issuers to impose a new, higher interest rate on a credit \ncard account if there has been any change for the worse in the \ncardholder's credit score--even if the change is unrelated to the \ncredit card account.\n  The passage of this legislation is made more urgent by our Nation's \nworsening financial crisis. I will work with Members of both parties to \nmake these commonsense reforms and even the playing field for credit \ncard consumers in Colorado and throughout the country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Thune, Ms. Klobuchar, and Ms. \n        Collins):\n  S. 238. A bill to provide $50 billion in new transportation \ninfrastructure funding through bonding to empower States and local \ngovernments to complete significant infrastructure projects across all \nmodes of transportation, including roads, bridges, rail and transit \nsystems, ports, and inland waterways, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, despite the record transportation funding \nthat Congress provided in the 2005 Transportation Reauthorization \nbill--SAFETEA-LU--our Nation's infrastructure is being stressed to the \nbreaking point. Our ports and rail lines are at or near capacity. Our \nhighways are clogged.\n  Congress is working with President-Elect Obama on an economic \nstimulus package that will probably include funding for ``shovel-\nready'' transportation projects. But even that won't come close to \nrehabilitating our Nation's transportation infrastructure.\n  The American Society of Civil Engineers has noted that over the next \n5 years $1.6 trillion in investment is needed from all levels of \ngovernment to keep our Nation's current transportation system up to \ndate. To put that into perspective, our Nation's infrastructure needs \nroughly i times as much funding as was included in SAFETEA-LU.\n  The question is ``Where do we find the transportation funding that \nour country needs to meet our transportation and our economic needs?''\n  Senator Thune's and my answer is to invest in America.\n  Everyone agrees that our country's infrastructure needs are \ntremendous. Everyone agrees that our country needs to invest more in \ntransportation. What Congress hasn't been able to agree on is where to \nfind the money. Gas taxes just don't generate enough revenues to even \nbegin to satisfy highway and transit needs.\n  In this budget climate, pots of extra Federal money are not just \nsitting around waiting to be used, and States surely don't have any \nextra money either. Most have budget deficits. All the conventional \nfunding sources are coming up short, so Senator Thune and I think it's \ntime to think outside the box--and outside the trust funds. The Federal \nGovernment is about the only entity in the country that does not borrow \nmoney for capital projects, but in this climate it should and it must.\n\n  Senator Thune and I have come up with a creative approach to provide \n$50 billion of additional new funding for transportation projects our \ncountry desperately needs by issuing Build America Bonds. Our country's \nneeds are so great that we think funding should be made available that \nis in addition to SAFETEA-LU.\n  Our legislation is not a substitute for fixing the transportation \ntrust fund. We still must address that problem, and later this year we \nmust start on a new Transportation bill. Our legislation is meant to \nprovide extra money on top of regular transportation funding.\n  This money could not be earmarked by Congress. This will not fund any \nSenator's pet project. This money will be controlled by the States, and \nused for the projects they think are most critical.\n  An annual amount of approximately $500 million from trade fees will \nbe placed in an Infrastructure Finance Account and invested for the \nlife of the bonds, which will generate more than enough to repay the \nentire $50 billion principal amount.\n  That means the only cost to the Government is the ``interest \nportion'' on the bonds, which is in the form of tax credits. With this \nfunding mechanism, as little as $2 billion a year could generate the \n$50 billion in funding for transportation infrastructure. I call that a \nvery smart investment in our country's infrastructure.\n  This investment is badly needed.\n  Citizens stuck in traffic choking on exhaust need relief. Truckers \nwho need to detour miles out of their way to avoid weight-limited \nbridges need relief. As our economy struggles with millions of workers \nlosing their jobs, stagnating wages, the loss of even basic health \nbenefits for many, and a mortgage market that is spiraling downward, \nthe American economy desperately needs a shot in the arm.\n  The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that each $1 billion \nof funding for transportation directly produces nearly 50,000 jobs. So \nunder the Wyden/Thune proposal the $50 billion of new transportation \nfunding will provide critical economic stimulus that will create up to \n2.5 million family wage jobs.\n  This is an economic stimulus idea that will generate more funding for \nthe economy now. It will create jobs. It's a chance for the Federal \nGovernment to hold up its end of the bargain with our States.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself and Mr. Gregg):\n  S. 239. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to ensure that \nveterans in each of the 48 contiguous States are able to receive \nservices in at least one full-service hospital of the Veterans Health \nAdministration in the State or receive comparable services provided by \ncontract in the State; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I rise to announce that I am introducing \nthe Veterans Health Equity Act of 2009. This legislation requires the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs to ensure that every State has either a \nfull-service veterans hospital or, in the alternative, that veterans in \nevery State have access to instate hospital care and medical services \ncomparable to the services provided in full-service hospitals.\n\n[[Page S391]]\n\n  New Hampshire is currently the only State that does not have a full-\nservice veterans hospital or a military hospital that provides \ncomparable care to veterans. This imposes a great burden on too many \nNew Hampshire veterans who are forced to travel out of State for \nroutine medical services. New Hampshire has over 130,000 veterans and \nthis number is projected to grow over the next 10 years. It is \nunconscionable that New Hampshire veterans must board buses in order to \nbe transported to Massachusetts to get necessary medical care. New \nHampshire's entire congressional delegation, Senate and House, \nRepublican and Democratic, is united in our commitment to end this \nunfair treatment of veterans. I am pleased the senior Senator from New \nHampshire, Judd Gregg, has agreed to cosponsor this legislation with \nme.\n  Our bill is companion legislation to that introduced last week in the \nHouse by Representative Carol Shea-Porter and cosponsored by \nRepresentative Paul Hodes. I wish to take this opportunity to salute \nRepresentative Shea-Porter for the leadership she has shown on this \nissue.\n  Our goal is to ensure that New Hampshire veterans can get the care \nthey need and deserve instate. Our legislation provides the Veterans' \nAdministration with flexibility to achieve this end. If it is not \nfeasible for the VA to construct a new full-service hospital in New \nHampshire or to restore full services at the VA hospital in Manchester, \nthis legislation simply requires the Veterans' Administration to \ncontract for comparable instate care.\n  My father served in Europe during World War II, my husband is a \nVietnam era vet from the Army, and my son-in-law Ryan recently served \nin the Air Force. I am proud of my family's service and the service of \nall the veterans of New Hampshire and across this country. Every \nfreedom and right we enjoy today was paid for with the sacrifices of \nthe men and women who have served in our Nation's Armed Forces.\n  Our veterans deserve first-rate medical care, regardless of where \nthey live. There are full-service veterans hospitals in 47 States and \nveterans in Alaska and Hawaii are able to receive care at military \nhospitals. New Hampshire alone has neither. I am hopeful our colleagues \nwill recognize this inequity and support our efforts to provide New \nHampshire veterans with the same access to health care that veterans in \nevery other State receive.\n  I look forward to working with New Hampshire's congressional \ndelegation, with my Senate colleagues and with the new Obama \nadministration to end this injustice.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 239\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Health Equity Act \n     of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AVAILABILITY OF FULL-SERVICE HOSPITAL OF THE VETERANS \n                   HEALTH ADMINISTRATION IN CERTAIN STATES OR \n                   PROVISION OF COMPARABLE SERVICES THROUGH \n                   CONTRACT WITH OTHER HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN \n                   THE STATE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 17 of title 38, United States \n     Code, is amended by inserting after section 1716 the \n     following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 1716A. Access to full-service hospitals in certain \n       States or comparable services through contract\n\n       ``(a) Requirement.--With respect to each of the 48 \n     contiguous States, the Secretary shall ensure that veterans \n     in the State eligible for hospital care and medical services \n     under section 1710 of this title have access--\n       ``(1) to at least one full-service hospital of the Veterans \n     Health Administration in the State; or\n       ``(2) to hospital care and medical services comparable to \n     the services provided in full-service hospitals through \n     contract with other health care providers in the State.\n       ``(b) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in subsection (a) \n     shall be construed to restrict the ability of the Secretary \n     to provide enhanced care to an eligible veteran who resides \n     in one State in a hospital of the Veterans Health \n     Administration in another State.''.\n       (b) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the \n     item relating to section 1716 the following new item:\n\n``1716A.

Mr. President, I wish to discuss the Veteran's Health \nEquity Act, a bill that has been introduced by my friend from the other \nside of the aisle, Senator Jeanne Shaheen. I am pleased to start the \n111th Congress in a bipartisan fashion and to support legislation that \naddresses an issue that is extremely important to our Nation's heroic \nmilitary veterans, especially in my home State of New Hampshire.\n  This important piece of legislation, which I hope will have the \nSenate's full support, would require the Department of Veterans Affairs \nto guarantee that veterans in every State have access to instate \nhospital care. More specifically, the Veteran's Health Equity Act would \nrequire the VA to either provide a full-service VA hospital in every \nState or contract with one or a number of full-service hospitals to \nprovide veterans with a comparable level of care.\n  At this time, New Hampshire, like Alaska and Hawaii, is without a \nfull-service VA hospital and veterans are being forced to travel to \nMaine, Massachusetts, and Vermont in order to receive necessary medical \ntreatment. Oftentimes, especially during the winter months, interstate \ntravel can be extremely dangerous in New England, and our veterans \nshould not be forced to travel long distances in order to receive the \nmedical care they have earned and deserve.\n  I will continue to press the VA until veterans have access to local, \nfull-service medical care. Our Nation's veterans, who have selflessly \nserved our country, are owed high-quality medical care in exchange for \ntheir courageous service. The Veteran's Health Equity Act will \nguarantee that they receive that care in a local health care facility.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Ensign):\n  S. 242. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n1965 to specify the purposes for which funds provided under part A of \ntitle I of that Act may be used; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President. I rise today with Senator Ensign to \nintroduce legislation to ensure that Federal Title I education funds \nare targeted to help our Nation's neediest students learn.\n  Title I provides assistance to virtually every school district in the \ncountry, serving over 12.5 million children in low-income schools, \nincluding about 3 million California school children.\n  Although it has always been the intent of Congress for Title I funds \nto be used for academic instruction and instructional services, the \nFederal Government has never provided clear guidelines for how these \nimportant dollars should be used.\n  This lack of Federal guidance has become especially clear now, as \nStates are struggling to comply with the Title I accountability \nstandards established under ``No Child Left Behind''.\n  While State administrators of Title I are directed by law to meet \nthese specific requirements, they have been given little guidance as to \nhow to ensure that they are in compliance with the law.\n  I believe that the Federal Government is responsible for making this \nprocess as clear as possible to States and school districts.\n  This legislation would define Title I direct and indirect \ninstructional services.\n  It would set a standard for the amount of Title I funds that can be \nused to achieve the academic and administrative objectives of this \nprogram.\n  It would ensure that the majority, 90 percent, of Title I funds are \nused to improve academic achievement by stipulating that a school \ndistrict may not use more than 10 percent of these funds for \nadministrative or indirect instructional services.\n  By setting a standard for the amount of funds that school districts \ncan spend on administrative or indirect services, we ensure that the \nmajority of Title I dollars are used by districts to help improve \nstudent academic achievement.\n  Furthermore, by defining direct and indirect services, all States can \napply\n\n[[Page S392]]\n\nthe same standards for how Title I funds are used nationwide.\n  Examples of permissible Direct Services are: employing teachers and \nother instructional personnel, including employee benefits; intervening \nand taking corrective actions to improve student achievement; \npurchasing instructional resources such as books, materials, computers, \nand other instructional equipment; developing and administering \ncurriculum, educational materials and assessments.\n  Examples of Indirect Services limited to no more than 10 percent of \nTitle I expenditures are: business services relating to administering \nthe program; purchasing or providing facilities maintenance or \njanitorial, gardening, or landscaping services or the payment of \nutility costs; buying food and paying for travel to and attendance at \nconferences or meetings, except if necessary for professional \ndevelopment.\n  Current law on Title I is much too vague.\n  It says, ``a State or local educational agency shall use funds \nreceived under this part only to supplement the amount of funds that \nwould, in the absence of such Federal funds, be made available from \nnon-Federal sources for the education of pupils participating in \nprograms assisted under this part, and not to supplant such funds.''\n  Basically, it says that Title I funds are to be used for the \n``education of pupils.'' This is too ambiguous.\n  The U.S. Department of Education has given States a guidance document \nthat explains how Title I funds can be used.\n  Under this guidance document, only two uses are specifically \nprohibited: construction or acquisition of real property; and payment \nto parents to attend a meeting or training session or to reimburse a \nparent for a salary lost due to attendance at a ``parental \ninvolvement'' meeting.\n  We should give the Department, States, and school districts clearer \nguidance in law.\n  During consideration of ``No Child Left Behind,'' I worked hard to \nget my bill defining appropriate Title I uses included in the Senate \nversion of the bill.\n  Unfortunately, during conference consideration, that language was \nstripped out and in its place language was inserted directing the \nGeneral Accounting Office to report on how States use their Title I \nfunds.\n  In April 2003, GAO released the report that Congress directed them to \nsubmit on Title I Administrative Expenditures.\n  What GAO found is that while districts spent no more than 13 percent \nof Title I funds on administrative services, these findings were based \non their own definition ``because there is no common definition on what \nconstitutes administrative expenditures.''\n  Therefore, the accounting office could not precisely measure how much \nof schools' Title I funds were used for administration.\n  Because uses of Title I funds are not defined consistently throughout \nthe States, the accounting office created its own definition by \ncompiling aspects of State priorities to complete the report.\n  The very reason I worked to define how Title I funds should be used--\nto create consistency and distribution priority nationwide--became the \ndefinitive aspect preventing GAO from effectively drawing conclusions \nto their report.\n  The report highlights two concerns that I have with the lack of \nuniversal definitions in the Title I program: the lack of Federal \nguidance on effective uses of Title I funds; and the government's \ninability to accurately measure whether the academic needs of low-\nincome students are being met.\n  This bill takes some strong steps by balancing the needs for States \nto retain Title I flexibility and providing them with the guidance \nneeded to administer the program uniformly throughout the country.\n  My reasons for introducing this bill are two-fold: First, I believe \nthat States must use their limited Federal Title I dollars for the \nfundamental purpose of providing academic instruction to help students \nlearn.\n  Second, I believe that it is nearly impossible to achieve this \nfundamental purpose without providing a clear definition of what is \nconsidered an instructional service.\n  Federal funding is only about 8 percent of the total funding for \nelementary and secondary education and Title I is even a smaller \npercentage of total support for public schools.\n  That is why it is imperative to better focus Title I funds on \nacademic instruction, teaching the fundamentals and helping \ndisadvantaged children achieve.\n  It is critical that Federal guidance be provided to ensure that Title \nI funds go where they are needed most--improving the academic \nperformance of low-income children.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Recod.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 242\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Title I Education Funding \n     Integrity Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DIRECT AND INDIRECT INSTRUCTIONAL SERVICES.\n\n       Subpart 1 of part A of title I of the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 6311 et seq.) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 1120C.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to establish the standard mileage rate \nfor use of a passenger automobile for purposes of the charitable \ncontributions deduction and to exclude charitable mileage \nreimbursements for gross income; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce a bill, the \nGiving Incentives to Volunteers Everywhere Act. In today's economic \nclimate, Americans need relief--especially people who volunteer to help \nthe less fortunate in their communities. We can't let an out-of-date \nmileage rate for volunteers who use their vehicles for charitable \npurposes exacerbate the pinch at the pump they are experiencing. Now,\n\n[[Page S393]]\n\nwhile it is true that gas prices have retreated from their historic \nhighs since last summer, the principle still stands: the Internal \nRevenue Service, IRS, should have discretion in setting the mileage \nrate for charitable organizations. This legislation will provide \nimmediate relief for volunteers serving our elderly, poor, frail, and \nat-risk Americans. I'm pleased that the senior Senator from Maine, \nSenator Snowe, and my other colleagues, the senior Senator from New \nYork, Senator Schumer, and the junior Senator from Nevada, Senator \nEnsign, have joined me in introducing this legislation. They have \nworked extremely hard on this issue. I would also like to thank \nSenators Grassley, Feingold, Leahy, Alexander, Sanders, Burr, Dodd, and \nCantwell for being original co-sponsors of this bill.\n  The Internal Revenue Code does not fix a rate for individuals who are \nrequired to use their own vehicle for work, or for individuals taking a \nmileage deduction for moving purposes. The IRS is able to increase the \ndeduction amount for these purposes to reflect the current economic \nclimate and dramatically higher fuel prices. This is exactly what the \nIRS recently did.\n  Last July, the IRS modified the standard mileage rates for computing \nthe deductible costs of operating an automobile for business, medical, \nor moving expenses. The revised standard mileage rate for business \npurposes increased from 50.5 cents per mile to 58.5 cents. For medical \nand moving expenses, the IRS increased the rate from 19 cents per mile \nto 27 cents per mile. I think the Nation's volunteers who travel on \nbehalf of charitable organizations deserve an increase in their mileage \nrate, too.\n  Just recently, the IRS again modified the standard mileage rates for \ncomputing the deductible costs of operating an automobile for business, \nmedical, or moving expenses. As of January 1, the revised standard \nmileage rate for business purposes was decreased from 58.5 cents to 55 \ncents. For medical and moving expenses, the IRS decreased the rate from \n27 cents per mile to 24 cents per mile. This ability to change the rate \ndue to the cost of gasoline or the economic climate is crucial and \nshould be permitted for the Nation's charitable organizations.\n  My bill gives the IRS flexibility in setting the rate so that \nvolunteers for charitable organizations could be given the same tax \nbenefit accruing for moving, medical, and business expenses. It also \nprovides a floor for volunteers, not allowing their rate to be set \nlower than moving and medical rate. In today's climate of increasing \nfood and fuel prices, this bill will help relieve some of the pressure \non charitable organizations and their volunteers. Additionally, this \nbill will allow the organization to reimburse the volunteer up to the \nbusiness rate without any tax impact to volunteers.\n  Take Meals on Wheels, for example. This organization delivers \nnutritious meals and other nutrition services to men and women who are \nelderly, homebound, disabled, frail, or otherwise at-risk. The services \nMeals on Wheels provides significantly improve the recipients' quality \nof life and health, and often help to postpone institutionalization.\n  Over the past year, there has been nearly a 20 percent increase in \nfuel and food prices, coupled with reduced government funding and fewer \ndonations across the country. Nearly 60 percent of the estimated 5,000 \nprograms that operate under the auspices of the Meals on Wheels \nAssociation of America have lost volunteers, in large part because it \nbecame too expensive for the volunteers to drive back and forth. Nearly \nhalf the programs have eliminated routes or consolidated meal services. \nAbout 38 percent of the programs have switched to delivering frozen \nmeals, and about 30 percent are cutting personal visits from 5 days a \nweek to one.\n  In Maryland, the Central Maryland Meals on Wheels has experienced an \nincrease of 7 percent in food costs and suppliers are charging higher \ndelivery fees. The cost to fill up the vans with gas has increased. \nFuel costs averaged $72,538.70 in fiscal year 2007; this year, the \ncosts have jumped to $86,790.63. This is an organization with \nvolunteers serving over 3,100 elderly, disabled, frail, and at-risk \nMarylanders. Its volunteers deserve relief from high gas prices just as \nmuch as people who use their car for work or for medical purposes or \nfor moving.\n  Throughout the United States, Meals on Wheels served over 3 million \npeople and more than 250 million meals in fiscal year 2006. This is \njust one of thousands of charitable organizations. We need to encourage \nand support the Meals on Wheels volunteers and all other volunteers who \nneed their cars to help their neighbors and communities. The Giving \nIncentives to Volunteers Everywhere bill will do just that, and I hope \nmy colleagues will support it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 243\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to expand, train, and support all sectors of the \nhealth care workforce to care for the growing population of older \nindividuals in the United States; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Retooling the \nHealth Care Workforce for an aging America Act, a bill that will \naddress the impending and severe shortage of health care workers who \nare adequately trained and prepared to care for older Americans. The \nunfortunate fact of the matter is that while our country is aging \nrapidly, the number of health care workers devoted to caring for older \nAmericans is experiencing a shortage--one that will only grow more \ndesperate as the need for these caregivers skyrockets.\n\n[[Page S394]]\n\n  We face many challenges. We know that few nursing programs require \ncoursework in geriatrics and that in medical schools, comprehensive \ngeriatric training is a rarity. Currently, only one percent of all \nphysicians are certified geriatricians, even as the population of older \npeople is on track to double by 2030, and less than one percent of all \nnurses are certified gerontological nurses. Absent any change, by 2020, \nthe supply of nurses in the United States will fall 29 percent below \nprojected requirements, resulting in a severe shortage of nursing \nexpertise relative to the demand for care of frail older adults.\n  Ensuring that health care workers are properly trained in the \nprovision of care to our seniors is vital. For the direct care \nworkforce, which includes home care aides and personal care attendants, \nwe know that state training requirements vary enormously, despite the \nfact that studies show that more training is correlated with better \nstaff recruitment and retention. We also know that family caregivers \nwant enhanced education and training to develop the necessary skills to \nprovide the best possible care for an ailing family member. There are \nmore than 44 million people providing care for a family member or \nfriend nationwide. These caregivers frequently do the same work as a \nprofessional caregiver, but they do so voluntarily and with little or \nno training. To their loved one, they are the doctor, the nurse, the \nassistant, the therapist, and oftentimes the sole source of emotional \nand financial support.\n  Fortunately, knowing what we need to change is half the battle. The \nbill I introduce today will expand, train, and support the workforce \nthat is dedicated to providing care for the older members of our \npopulation, incorporating the major recommendations for improving the \nskills and preparedness of the health care workforce put forth in the \nInstitute of Medicine report, ``Retooling for an Aging America: \nBuilding the Healthcare Workforce.'' It has the support of many \nnational organizations, such as AARP, the American Health Care \nAssociation, the American Association of Homes and Services for the \nAging, Consumers Union, Family Caregiver Alliance, the National \nAlliance for Caregiving, the National Association of Area Agencies on \nAging, Alzheimer's Association, the American Geriatrics Society, the \nNational Association for Home Care and Hospice, Paraprofessional \nHealthCare Institute, the American Association of Geriatric Psychiatry, \nAlliance for Aging Research, and The Catholic Health Association.\n  By the year 2020, it is estimated that the number of older adults in \nneed of care will increase by one-third. The United States will not be \nable to meet the approaching demand for health care and long-term care \nwithout a workforce that is prepared for the job. Bolstering the health \ncare workforce will be an integral part of national health care reform, \nand I look forward to working with Finance and HELP Committee leaders \non incorporating this legislation into their policy proposals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 246. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \nquality of care provided to veterans in Department of Veterans Affairs \nmedical facilities, to encourage highly qualified doctors to serve in \nhard-to-fill positions in such medical facilities, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, in the fall of 2007, at least nine \nveterans died at the Marion VA Medical Center as a result of the poor \nmedical care they received. We immediately learned that a VA surgeon, \nwho had operated on some of these veterans, was not qualified to work \nat the VA but slipped through the hiring process. Later, VA \ninvestigations revealed much larger problems in the management of the \nfacility--problems that employees kept secret out of fear for losing \ntheir jobs. Today, I am reintroducing legislation to help ensure that \nincidents like these never take place again at Marion or another VA \nmedical center.\n  I asked the VA to investigate the circumstances surrounding these \nunfortunate deaths as soon as they came to light. The VA investigation \nrevealed that Marion hospital management knew that doctors, including \nthe surgeon at issue, were not properly credentialed but failed to act. \nThe surgeon remained employed at the Marion hospital and practiced \nthere for more than a year. Had he not been hired to work at Marion, \nmany of his patients may have survived their surgeries.\n  The VA investigation revealed additional quality of care issues at \nthe Marion hospital. Management disregarded VA quality care directives \nin the face of serious patient incident reports and surgical data \ncollected to ensure quality of care. They ignored or failed to \nrecognize warning signs that there were problems in the surgical \nprogram.\n  The investigation also showed many Marion Medical Center employees \nfeared reporting quality of care issues. They worried that quality of \ncare might be suffering at the facility but hesitated to report those \nconcerns for fear of losing their jobs. A primary reason is that such \nreports were funneled through management at the facility, rather than \nbeing handled by an independent and confidential outlet focused solely \non quality of care.\n  The legislation I am introducing would improve quality of care across \nthe VA medical care system.\n  First, it would improve the process of vetting doctors who apply to \nor work for the VA and restore accountability to physician hiring and \nretention practices.\n  Second, the legislation would expand the quality control programs in \nthe VA health care system. The bill creates new quality assurance \nofficer positions, gives VA employees new forums to raise concerns \nabout the quality of care at a VA facility, without fear of \nretribution, and establishes strong peer review mechanisms for \nphysicians.\n  Third, the legislation would create incentives to encourage high-\nquality doctors to practice at VA hospitals. In return for agreeing to \npractice in hard-to-serve areas, doctors and medical students could \nparticipate in student loan forgiveness and tuition reimbursement \nprograms. Doctors would also be eligible to participate in the federal \nemployee health insurance program.\n  Fourth, where practical, VA medical facilities would be required to \nestablish affiliations with nearby medical schools. These partnerships \nwould expose medical students to careers with the VA. In return, the VA \nwould benefit from the energy and innovative ideas brought by students \nworking in their facilities. In addition, VA hospitals would benefit \nfrom access to experienced medical school faculty members.\n  Finally, the bill would encourage the VA to increase its recruitment \nof experienced doctors who are willing to practice for our veterans. \nThe VA must hire and retain only highly qualified doctors as it takes \non these tremendous responsibilities.\n  Every one of the tragic deaths at the Marion VA hospital violated the \nobligation our Nation owes to its veterans. Each of their lives can \nnever be replaced. The Veterans Health Care Quality Improvement Act is \na strong step toward avoiding such tragedies in the future and \nreestablishing trust in the veterans health care system.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 247. A bill to accelerate motor fuel savins nationwide and provide \nincentives to registered owners of high fuel consumption automobiles to \nreplace such automobiles with fuel efficient automobiles or public \ntransportation; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \n``Accelerated Retirement of Inefficient Vehicles Act.'' This \nlegislation is cosponsored by Senators Susan Collins and Charles \nSchumer. A companion bill is also being introduced today in the House \nof Representatives by Mr. Israel and Mr. Inslee.\n  Let me first acknowledge the important role of one of my colleagues, \nSenator Salazar, who initiated much of the thought and drafting for \nthis legislation at the end of the last Congress. I thank him for his \nleadership, and I thank him for letting us take up the work needed to \nmove this bill forward as he begins to transition into his new role \nwith the incoming Obama administration.\n  Last Congress, we successfully enacted legislation--which I authored\n\n[[Page S395]]\n\nwith Senator Snowe and others--to improve the fuel efficiency of \nAmerica's fleet of new cars, trucks and SUVs by 10 miles per gallon \nover 10 years, or from 25 miles per gallon to at least 35 miles per \ngallon by 2020.\n  But the fact is that we face real challenges with trying to encourage \ndrivers to trade in their older, less fuel efficient vehicles for a \ncleaner and more fuel efficient vehicle--particularly in this tough \neconomic climate.\n  This bill is designed to address that problem.\n  First, let me explain this legislation.\n  This bill would establish an incentive program at the Department of \nEnergy to provide a voucher, or coupon, of between $2,500 to $4,500 to \na consumer who trades in an inefficient, used vehicle for a much more \nefficient car, truck, or SUV.\n  The traded-in vehicles--which must be then dismantled or scrapped--\nmust meet the following requirements; have a fuel economy of no more \nthan 18 miles per gallons, be in drivable condition, and have been \nregistered for at least the past 120 days.\n  To receive the benefit of the coupon, purchased vehicles must exceed \nCorporate Average Fuel Economy, CAFE, Standards for that class of \nvehicle by at least 25 percent and have a suggested retail price below \n$45,000.\n\n  The size of the coupon varies based upon the expected oil savings \ncreated by trading in the vehicle.\n  The voucher program will be set up to provide larger credits to new, \nmore recent vehicles that would otherwise be on the road for many more \nyears, while older ``clunker'' models would be eligible for smaller \ncredits.\n  The bill specifies that during the first year of the program, \nvouchers will be issued for the following amounts: For model year 2002 \nand later: new vehicle: $4,500, used vehicle: $3,000, transit fare \ncredit: $3,000. For model year 1999-2001: new vehicle: $3,000, used \nvehicle: $2,000, transit fare credit: $2,000. For model year 1998 and \nearlier: new vehicle: $2,500, used vehicle: $1,500, transit fare \ncredit: $1,500. In each subsequent year, 2010, 2011, and 2012, the \nmodel years would be advanced by 1 year.\n  Vouchers would be eligible for redemption for up to 2 years after the \ndate of issuance, and no individual would be eligible to obtain more \nthan one voucher in any 3-year period.\n  Dealers, dismantlers and scrap recycling facilities would also be \neligible for a payment of $50 per vehicle, or an alternative amount to \nbe specified by the Secretary of Energy.\n  Simply put, this legislation offers a unique opportunity to both \nstimulate automobile industry sales and reduce vehicular oil use, \ncreating a win-win policy for all involved.\n  As we know, our Nation's automobile industry is in serious trouble.\n  Chrysler, General Motors, and Ford have all asserted in their recent \nviability plans that their dire financial situation is a direct result \nof the collapse in automobile sales.\n  The new car sales rate has dropped to less than 11 million vehicles \nsold annually, compared to the 16.2 million vehicles sold in the United \nStates in 2007.\n  The major Detroit and Japanese carmakers all reported double digit \nsales drops for December. General Motors reported sales dropped 31 \npercent; Ford Motor Co. reported a drop of 32 percent; Chrysler LLC \nreported sales plummeted 53 percent; Honda Motor Co. said its sales \nfell 34 percent; Nissan North America said its sales fell 30 percent \nand Toyota Motor Co. said its U.S. sales fell 37 percent.\n\n  Bottom line: The automobile companies are all in trouble because far \nfewer people are buying automobiles.\n  According to J.D. Power and Associates, this has produced dealer lots \nfull of vehicles that can't be sold. Over the past year the number of \ndays that a vehicle sits on a lot has almost doubled.\n  The problem is most severe for Chrysler, GM and Ford. Their vehicles \nall sat on dealer lots for in excess of 100 days last year.\n  By encouraging automobile sales, this legislation would go a long way \nto addressing the significant troubles that America's once mighty car \nindustry now faces.\n  While emergency bridge loans help auto companies make payroll, only \nstimulating automobile sales will cure the disease that confronts the \nautomobile sector.\n  By creating a voucher system for the purchase of a vehicle with \ncertain attributes, this legislation would stimulate sales at precisely \nthe right moment.\n  Perhaps that is why General Motors went out of its way to endorse \nthis kind of program in its recent Viability Plan, recommended ``tax \ncredits for scrapping older, higher-carbon emitting vehicles.''\n  This legislation would also assist owners of the least efficient \nvehicles who are least likely to trade their cars in for something more \nefficient.\n  The trade-in value of inefficient vehicles has plummeted, making a \ntrade-in financially difficult.\n  In a November 2008 analysis, Kelley Blue Book concluded: ``[T]his \nyear's vehicles with the lowest retained value include vehicles that \nare not fuel friendly with large V-8 engines. . . . These gas misers . \n. . will only maintain 20 percent of their original value after five \nyears of ownership.''\n  Bottom line: The legislation is stimulus of the most important kind. \nIt would provide incentives for new vehicle sales, incentivize the \ntrade-in of inefficient vehicles, and reward consumers who want to \nreduce their oil use and carbon footprint.\n  This proposal also provides important benefits for the environment--\nand addressing the challenges of climate change.\n  I have been a long time champion of increasing fuel economy \nstandards, and I was extremely proud to have authored the new fuel \neconomy law with Senator Snowe, which was enacted by Congress and \nsigned into law in December 2007.\n\n  But new CAFE standards will not take effect until model year 2011. \nThey cannot make up for our failure to increase standards for the past \n3 decades.\n  The bill we are introducing today would target the very vehicles that \nCAFE standards are unable to reach: older fuel-inefficient cars, trucks \nand SUVs\n  It will provide incentives to consumers who wish to buy the most \nefficient vehicles available during the 2 years before the new CAFE \nstandards will require improvement.\n  It will provide incentives to remove the most inefficient vehicles \nthat would have never been part of the fleet had Congress acted to \nincrease CAFE standards 5 years ago.\n  The result is considerable oil savings and significant reductions of \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  According to analysis by the non-partisan American Council for an \nEnergy Efficient Economy, ACEEE, by 2013 this legislation would prompt \nthe trade in of between 500,000 and 1 million of the dirtiest, least \nefficient vehicles on the road today.\n  As a result, by 2013 between 40,000 and 80,000 fewer barrels of oil \nper day will be burned; between 6.6 million metric tons and 13.3 \nmillion metric tons of carbon dioxide per year will not be emitted.\n  This is the equivalent of removing between 1.1 million and 2.2 \nmillion cars from the road.\n  In our current economic and environmental circumstance, there are few \nopportunities to both help the automobile industry evolve and improve \nthe fuel economy of the fleet.\n  This idea--providing consumers with an incentive to trade in their \ninefficient vehicle for something far better--will stimulate the \neconomy and save oil, and I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  I strongly encourage the Obama administration and the Appropriations \nCommittee to authorize and fund this proposal in the stimulus.\n  I am committed to advancing the goals of stimulus and fuel savings, \nand have put what I believe to be the best proposal to meet these \ngoals.\n  I understand that within the details of this idea, there may be \ndifferent views. I am open to suggestions that improve the structure of \nthe program proposed by this legislation, and ask my colleagues to \ncommunicate their thoughts soon.\n  Finally, I hope non-related matters--such as trade policy--will not \nprevent my colleagues from supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S396]]\n\n                                 S. 247\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the use of certain interrogation \ntechniques and for other purposes; to the Select Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Limitations on \nInterrogation Techniques Act of 2009. This bill is identical to one I \nintroduced last summer, along with Senators Hatch, Chambliss, Burr, and \nWarner. Last week, my colleague and good friend on the Intelligence \nCommittee, Senator Feinstein, introduced a bill that, among other \nthings, requires all intelligence interrogations to be conducted only \nin accordance with the Army Field Manual. The Army Field Manual was \ndesigned to monitor and to describe the techniques which could be used \nby the many thousands and tens of thousands of Army personnel who might \nbe engaged in interrogating people caught in field operations. \nUnfortunately, I believe this is the wrong approach.\n  First, the Army Field Manual is a document that can be changed by the \nSecretary of the Army without ever coming back to Congress. It was \nmeant to deal with Army personnel--the fine men and women of the Army. \nThe next problem is that by setting legislative standards according to \na departmental policy manual, Congress, in effect, would be ceding our \nlegislative function to the Secretary of the Army. Even more \nimportantly, I don't believe we should have a one-size-fits-all \napproach when we are talking about interrogations that would be \nconducted by the military or the FBI over here or the CIA over here and \na host of other different agencies, all with different missions and \npriorities.\n  Mr. President, if you have followed the history of intelligence from \nthe post-9/11 system, you know there are certain high-value detainees--\nwho are captured on infrequent occasions--who are questioned at length \nby skilled interrogators to find out the details of potential plans of \nwhich they know--attacks on allies or in our country. It is different \nfrom capturing somebody in the field who might be able to yield \ntactical intelligence but certainly has no strategic intelligence. We \nare much safer today because we have been able to garner intelligence \nfrom high-value detainees who have known about a broad range of people \ninvolved and those potential operations they may undertake.\n  The final, and perhaps the most important reason not to limit \ninterrogation techniques for other agencies beyond the Army--to limit \nthem to that published in the field manual--is because broadcasting to \nal-Qaida and other terrorists exactly what techniques will be used in \ninterrogating them is a recipe for failure. We know these high-value \ntargets, the people who are leaders of these organizations, will train \nfor whatever techniques we tell them we are using. It is not too hard \nto figure out that if we tell them\n\n[[Page S398]]\n\nwith certainty only 19 techniques listed in the field manual will be \nused, they will train to resist them, and the net result will be we \nwill not get anymore intelligence.\n  The bill I am introducing does not have that flaw. Rather than \nauthorizing intelligence agencies to use only those techniques that are \nallowed in the Army Field Manual--the AFM--I believe the better \napproach, if any change needs to be made to current law, is to preclude \nthe use of specific techniques that are prohibited under the AFM. \nSpecifically, the bill says you cannot use interrogation techniques; \nNo. 1, forcing the individual to be naked, to perform sexual acts or \npose in a sexual manner; No. 2, placing hoods or sacks over the heads \nof individuals or using duct tape over the individual's eyes; No. 3, \napplying beatings, electric shock, burns or similar forms of physical \npain; No. 4, using the technique known as waterboarding; No. 5, using \nmilitary working dogs; No. 6, inducing hypothermia or heat injury; No. \n7, conducting mock executions; or, No. 8, depriving the individuals of \nadequate food, water, or medical care.\n  Now, these list the kinds of techniques that are generally described \nas torture. Let me assure you there are many techniques which are \nsimilar in degree of duress to those permitted in the Army Field \nManual. The reason to be able to use others is because the most \nimportant part of any interrogation technique is the unknown. When the \ndetainee does not know what techniques are permitted, then the detainee \ndoes not know what to expect. Under those circumstances, even though \nthe techniques are no more harsh, no more painful than Army Field \nManual techniques, there is a much greater chance a skilled \ninterrogator will get that information.\n  I believe in this way Congress can state clearly that harsh \ninterrogation techniques will not be permissible without advertising \nthe techniques that are permissible. The Intelligence Committee will be \nbriefed on any techniques that are considered for use and have the \nopportunity to object to anything we believe should not be permissible. \nThis new approach allows for the possibility that new techniques that \nare not explicitly authorized in the Army Field Manual but which comply \nwith law may be developed in the future.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation. \nThis legislation establishes an important principle, and I hope we can \nadopt this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/14/senate-section/article/S398-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S398]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 22.
