Mr. President, our economic troubles can be tallied in \nstatistics but numbers alone cannot tell their toll. Every American \nknows this. The people in Nevada know this especially well. They have \nfelt the full force of this recession as intensely as anyone in \nAmerica.\n  I received a letter this month from Bobby Mockbee. Bobby, his wife \nJulia, and their two children live in North Las Vegas, NV. Bobby is a \nstay-at-home dad, and a little over a year ago Julia was laid off from \nher job. Finding themselves near the end of tens of thousands of \ndollars they had saved and put away, Bobby and Julia recently tried to \nget a loan. Similar to many families who are hurting now, the Mockbees \nplayed by the rules. They had never been late on any bill at any time. \nThey had excellent credit. Their credit score was terrific. They were \nno strangers to the ins and outs of the housing market--the job Mrs. \nMockbee lost was as vice president of a large title and escrow company. \nBut they were turned down for that loan. Now that the Mockbees are so \nstretched, they fear that before long they will be the latest in a long \nline of Nevada families to have lost their homes.\n  Unemployment in Nevada is now in the double digits--the highest it \nhas been in a quarter of a century. To a worker such as Julia Mockbee, \nwho can no longer collect a paycheck, job loss is more than an economic \nindicator. Families in my State lose their homes at the worst rate in \nthe Nation. But to someone who has lost a share of the American dream, \nforeclosure is more than a cause and effect of the Wall Street \ncollapse.\n  I am confident the steps we have taken this year to address this \ncrisis will ultimately anchor our recovery, but it has not done so yet. \nAs I visited with Nevadans over the past couple weeks, one message \nbecame very clear: We as legislators must keep going. We must do more. \nThe hole we have inherited from George Bush is deep, and our long climb \nback has just begun.\n  We have seen promising progress and are beginning to see a return on \nthe investments we made in our economic recovery plan, but we are still \nfar closer to the starting line than the finish line. In that \nlegislation, we indicated we would create or save at least 3\\1/2\\ \nmillion jobs. In States such as Texas, Florida, and Ohio, thousands of \nnew construction jobs are already on their way. Students are getting \nbetter schools and a better education in Illinois and Tennessee. \nVeterans, children, and low-income families in New Mexico and Maryland \nare getting better health care. In Nevada, investment in green \ntechnology is leading us not only to economic recovery but energy \nindependence.\n  This Congress faced monumental challenges when we convened a few \nshort months ago. Our response has been swift and strong. We cut taxes \nfor the middle class so they can keep more of their paychecks at a time \nwhen they need it most. We made sure more children get the health care \nthey need to stay healthy with the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram--4 million more. We outlawed pay discrimination, to be sure \nwomen will be treated as equals in the workplace and ensure that hard \nwork is rewarded fairly no matter who you are. That is the Ledbetter \nlegislation. We passed a responsible budget that, when put into action, \nwill make investments in health care, clean energy, and education to \nhelp us not only recover but to prosper. We passed one of the most \nimportant conservation bills in a quarter of a century. That \nlegislation will protect our environment and natural resources for \ngenerations to come, and it created more than 2 million acres of \nwilderness. We also passed national service legislation--legislation \nthat will allow 750,000 Americans to become involved in public service \nand, in the process, better their education.\n\n  I wish I could say we did these things with broad support from \nRepublicans, our colleagues in the Senate. It would have been good for \nthe country if we had. Unfortunately, we only had the help of a few \ncourageous Republican Senators and basically no help in the House. \nNevertheless, our progress so far is a healthy downpayment.\n  There is much more to do to address this crisis. That is why, in the \ncoming weeks, we will keep going. We will attempt to give bankruptcy \njudges the chance to modify existing mortgages so responsible families \nwho played by the rules can make their payments and stay in their \nhomes.\n  It is so unusual that the law in our great country says that if \nsomeone has a home on the beach, in addition to their primary \nresidence, or near a ski area in the mountains, and they have financial \nproblems, they can go to bankruptcy court and readjust those loans on \ntheir second homes but they can't do that on their primary residence. \nIf a person has lost their job, such as Julia Mockbee, or may lose \ntheir job, they can't go to bankruptcy court and get a readjustment of \ntheir loan. We have to change that.\n  We also wish to fight financial fraud in the mortgage business--there \nis a lot of that going on now--and hold accountable those who game the \nsystem on the backs of those who make an honest living. We will fix the \ncriminal code to punish leaders who betray the public trust, take \nadvantage of American families, and further endanger our economy. We \nwill finish work on the budget we passed earlier this month so we can \nbegin to correct the mistakes of the past and invest in our future. We \nwill ensure our troops will have the resources they need to fight \neffectively the extremists in the Middle East and make Americans safer.\n  These are not small ambitions, but they are not luxuries. They are \npriorities we must pass because American families are still suffering. \nThey are still worried about losing their jobs and losing their homes. \nNo effort to recover can succeed unless Democrats and Republicans work \ntogether. I had hoped this year for change would have inaugurated a new \nera of common purpose. Instead, Democrats have met an all-too-familiar \nwall that reflects Republican opposition. I still hold the hope that we \nwill see the bipartisan cooperation necessary to fulfill the rest of \nour obligations to the American people. I still believe we can put \naside our political differences and move forward.\n  The last time America looked up from an economic hole so deep, it \nresoundingly elected a new leader--Franklin Roosevelt--not with a \nmandate for reticence or for repeating the mistakes of the past but \nwith an urgent instruction--in 1932--to lift our Nation, reject fear, \nand recover from financial turmoil. Just weeks before the election--\nagain, in 1932--Americans would soon swarm to the polls, but they would \nalso pack theaters to see a Marx Brothers blockbuster called ``Horse \nFeathers.'' The film starts with a song that could just as easily have \nbeen written by today's Republican Senators. Groucho Marx sang the \nfollowing in that movie:\n\n       I don't know what they have to say. It makes no difference \n     anyway. Whatever it is, I'm against it.\n\n  That was Groucho Marx. The lyrics were a hit in Hollywood, and that \nis where the song should stay. As a legislative strategy, it is nothing \nshort of reckless. The American people expect more from their leaders, \nand their serious problems deserve better than a vaudeville act, but \nthat is what the Americans have gotten from the Republicans in the \nSenate: Whatever you want, we are against it.\n  Nearly eight decades after this song sung by Groucho Marx and this \nmovie with the Marx Brothers, in the face of familiar troubles, we \ncannot afford to say no because it is easier than doing the hard work \nto make life better for struggling families. We cannot afford to work \nagainst each other because it is more politically convenient than \nworking together. We cannot afford to bet against America's resilience \nand recovery, as the Republicans are doing. The American people did not \nsend anyone here to simply be against everything. They still want to \nhear what Republicans support, not just what they oppose.\n  One of the Republican leaders in the House said: We are going to be \nlike a thousand mosquitoes. That is the effort\n\n[[Page S4407]]\n\nof the Republican leadership in the House--a thousand mosquitoes--just \nbiting, not accomplishing anything.\n  Families are too busy trying to make this week's paycheck last until \nthe next to keep track of who is scoring political points. They worry \nabout paying the electric bill, the mortgage bill or the tuition bill--\nnot about games and gimmicks. In the history of American Government, \npartisan bickering has never saved a single job or kept one family from \nlosing their home.\n  I hope Republicans will join us to confront the crises in our \ncommunities and around the world, and I hope they will start this \nafternoon when we vote on moving forward with the nomination of \nChristopher Hill.\n  To this point--this few short weeks we have been in session--we have \nhad to file cloture on five of the President's nominees. The Secretary \nof Labor, a very important job--Hilda Solis--was held up. We had to \ninvoke cloture. The Deputy Attorney General, a man by the name of \nOgden, we had to invoke cloture on the Republicans' filibuster of him. \nIn his job, second in command, he is in charge of all the criminal \nprosecutions in this country. He is also the chief administrator of the \nattorney general's office. We had to invoke cloture on that.\n\n  Two members of the Council of Economic Advisers--we had to invoke \ncloture. Who are these people? They are the primary economists on whom \nthe President depends. We had to waste valuable time invoking cloture \non two filibusters there.\n  Incredibly, now, tonight, we are going to invoke cloture on the \nAmbassador to Iraq. I talked to Secretary Gates just a couple of days \nago about a number of issues. One of the things he brought up was--\nGates said that every time he talks to General Odierno, he asks: When \ncan I get my civilian commander, my civilian counterpart in Iraq? That \nis what this is all about. We did everything we could prior to the 2-\nweek recess to let us have a vote. No; cloture. We have to file cloture \non the Ambassador to Iraq. What a shame.\n  Christopher Hill is a strong and skilled negotiator who has tackled \nsome of the most complex diplomatic challenges in the world. After he \ngraduated from Bowdoin College, he joined the Peace Corps and served in \nAfrica. He joined the Foreign Service immediately after that and served \ntours in half a dozen countries. He has been an ambassador in any \nnumber of countries and served so well. He earned a graduate degree \nfrom the Naval War College.\n  The man we will send to Iraq is no stranger to dealing with difficult \ngovernments. He has worked hard on ethnic civil wars. He successfully \ncoordinated multilateral negotiations on North Korea's nuclear program \nand was a key player in the peace talks that ended the conflicts in \nboth Kosovo and Bosnia.\n  General Petraeus has always said that the cure of Iraq's troubles \nwill be prescribed politically, not militarily. General Odierno has \ncalled for civilian help to secure what his brave troops have \naccomplished. Experts from the left and the right alike have warned \nagainst taking our eye off the ball in Iraq. Yet our top diplomat in \nthat country where more than 4,000 Americans have given their lives--\nand each day, 143,000 more risk their own--sits and waits. When is this \nman going to be able to come and go to work? It is a shame we have to \ngo through this process on the Ambassador to Iraq.\n  Each of our three Ambassadors to Iraq since the beginning of the war \nhas called on us to urgently fill this gaping hole in our diplomatic \nlineup and to fill it with Ambassador Hill. He has spent his entire \ncareer in the Foreign Service, and he is ready to answer his country's \ncall once again. It is simply wrong that we have to wait for this man \nto get over there.\n  I didn't bring the subject up with Secretary Gates; he brought it up.\n  I hope Republicans will not make us use all of the 30 hours of \nprocedural time. What do I mean by this? For those who are watching, \nafter we invoke cloture there is 30 hours of time. I say to everyone, \nwe are going to vote on this when the 30 hours expires. If it is \nmidnight tomorrow night or 1 a.m. Wednesday morning, we are going to \nvote. We are not going to hold this up 1 minute. It is absolutely wrong \nthat we have to do this. We cannot wait any longer for civilian \nleadership in Iraq. Those who stand in the way should stand down so \nAmbassador Hill can get to work making America more secure and so the \nSenate can move to the important work of getting our economy back on \ntrack. Democrats and Republicans alike have an interest in stabilizing \nthe Middle East. Democrats and Republicans alike have an interest in \nstabilizing our economy. But neither security abroad nor prosperity at \nhome can happen unless both Democrats and Republicans work together \ntoward those common goals.\n  As we begin our common work here after a 2-week recess, I hope my \ncolleagues keep in mind what they saw and heard across the country in \nthe last few weeks. It was what I heard, that hard-working people in \ntheir communities are struggling against conditions they did not \ncreate, that the earliest signs of recovery are beginning to bloom in \nthe spring, and with much more to be done, they hope their leaders will \nbe up to the task.\n  I urge my Republican friends to think twice before they return to the \nrefrain: Whatever Democrats are for, we are against. I remind them what \nwe are for is the success and security of the American people. If we \nare going to turn the tide, if we are going to change the tone, it is \ntime to sing a different tune and not a song sung by Groucho Marx.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4407-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, toward the end of 2006, President Bush \nconcluded that American security interests in the Persian Gulf were not \nbeing advanced by the military strategy that was then in place in Iraq. \nHe directed a review of military plans and decided to accept the \nrecommendation of GEN David Petraeus and other advisers to adopt a \ncounterinsurgency strategy that would involve a surge of ground forces \nto secure the Iraqi population. In the face of growing sectarian \nviolence in Iraq, President Bush announced this strategy in early 2007, \nand the success of this strategy is now so widely acknowledged that it \nis hard to believe that just 2 years ago some in Washington wanted to \ncut off funding for our forces on the battlefield and establish \narbitrary deadlines for withdrawal without consideration to conditions \non the ground.\n  Over the past 2 years, the American people have witnessed a gradual \nmaturation of the Iraqi Government. Iraqi security forces, working with \ncoalition forces, took control of Basra and Sadr City. General \nPetraeus's efforts to shift responsibility to the Iraqi Army took place \nin front of a pessimistic audience that included, of course, Iran. But \nit worked.\n  During the recess, I visited General Odierno in Baghdad, and despite \nongoing challenges in some provinces and the continuing need of the \nIraqi security forces for coalition support, he is optimistic that the \nsecurity gains made in Iraq are indeed sustainable.\n  That is why I was encouraged when President Obama moved away from his \ncampaign promise to withdraw all U.S. forces from Iraq within 16 months \nof his inauguration. Instead, he accepted the advice of Generals \nPetraeus and Odierno to draw down forces at a pace that will recognize \nconditions on the ground, the challenges associated with Iraqi \nelections, and the need to maintain a presence to conduct training, \nforce protection, and counterterrorism.\n  To those of us who ignored the calls for arbitrary deadlines for \nwithdrawal and efforts to cut off funding for our forces in combat, it \nis likewise encouraging to see President Obama has accepted the \nrecommendations of General McKiernan and General Petraeus to order a \nsurge of additional forces in Afghanistan in order to succeed there. I \nvisited with General McKiernan in Kabul last week, and he explained his \nplans to deploy these additional forces. He is mindful of the \nchallenges associated with Afghan national elections, the need to \ncontinue expanding the Afghan National Army and police, and the need to \ncombat corruption within\n\n[[Page S4408]]\n\nthe Afghan ministries. Nonetheless, he is confident of military \nsuccess. With the lives and security of so many at stake, it is \nimportant that the Obama administration follow the best military \nadvice. So far in Afghanistan, this is precisely what the President has \ndone, and he deserves a lot of credit for it.\n  During the recess, President Obama submitted a supplemental \nappropriations request to fund the war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan, \nand Republicans will aggressively support our combat forces just as we \ndid in the last Congress. In the coming months and years, Congress will \ncontinue to play an essential role in preserving and extending the \nsecurity gains our service men and women have made in Iraq and in \nfighting the Taliban and al-Qaida in Afghanistan. By approving \nPresident Obama's request for war funding, we will provide our men and \nwomen in uniform with resources they need to complete their missions \nand return home with honor.\n  This is a solemn duty, and Members of Congress should resist the \ntemptation to use these war funding requests as an opportunity to fund \nunrelated projects. The President's war funding request should be used \nfor its intended purpose; that is, the national defense.\n  In that vein, this war spending bill falls short in one important \nrespect. It requests up to $80 million for the purpose of shuttering \nthe secure detention facility at Guantanamo Bay before the \nadministration has a place to put the roughly 240 inmates who live \nthere. The administration has sought to mollify our critics overseas by \nsaying it will transfer the inmates at Guantanamo in a matter of \nmonths. The administration should, instead, be assuring the American \npeople that these inmates will not be transferred to American soil or \nallowed to return to the battlefield--an assurance that so far the new \nadministration has not been able to give.\n  This is an extremely important issue. As the clock runs out on the \nadministration's plan to shut down Guantanamo within the next 9 months, \nAmericans are paying closer and closer attention to what this means for \nthem. It is one thing to announce the goal of closing this facility; it \nis quite another to set an arbitrary date for closure before anyone has \neven come up with a safe alternative. The administration hasn't even \nbeen able to assure us that these 240 detainees will not be scattered \nacross the United States. Indeed, when it comes to Guantanamo, the \nadministration doesn't seem to have any plan at all for dealing with \nmen whom many consider to be the most dangerous terrorists alive. \nMeanwhile, Guantanamo has provided Americans with a high degree of \nsafety and certainty. Of the 800 terrorists who have been held there \nover the years, not a single one has ever escaped to harm anyone. Not \none has escaped to harm anyone.\n  In the days ahead, Republicans will remind the American people about \nthe dangers of closing Guantanamo without a safe alternative--and prod \nthe administration to rethink its strategy in the same way the \nPresident has rethought his campaign proposals on Iraq. In the end, the \nsafety of the American people is of far more important concern than \npleasing our foreign critics, many of whom have been far quicker to \ncriticize our detention policies than they have been in offering a hand \nin adjusting them. On Guantanamo, it is increasingly important that we \nget the policy right and put the politics aside. If it does so, the \nadministration can expect strong bipartisan support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4408-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RESTORING FISCAL BALANCE\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the President has announced today he is \ndirecting the members of his Cabinet to cut wasteful Government \nspending. Obviously, I applaud such an effort, but it is important that \nwe not lose sight of the enormity of our current spending and debt \nlevels, which will only really be addressed through major, bipartisan, \npolitically difficult reforms. The Cabinet has been asked to find $100 \nmillion savings in a $4 trillion budget. Any amount of savings, \nobviously, is welcome, but according to the Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers, that is about the average amount we will spend every single \nday--that $100 million is about the average amount we will spend every \nsingle day just covering the interest on the stimulus package we passed \nearlier this year.\n  We need to cut waste, but we will need to do much more to restore \nfiscal balance. Senators Gregg and Conrad have proposed a plan that \nwould force us to get debt and spending under control. It deserves our \nserious attention.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4408-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4408-S4426]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     FRAUD ENFORCEMENT AND RECOVERY ACT OF 2009--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to S. 386, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to consider S. 386, a bill to improve \n     enforcement of mortgage fraud, securities fraud, financial \n     institution fraud, and other frauds related to federal \n     assistance and relief programs, for the recovery of funds \n     lost to these frauds, and for other purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is there on S. 386?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont has 87 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, under the normal circumstances, I would \nspeak as chairman of the Judiciary Committee and as the chief sponsor \nof this bill. Then we would go, by normal protocol, to either the \nRepublican ranking member or the senior Republican who is cosponsor, \nwhich I assume will be done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senator from Delaware, Mr. Kaufman, \nbe recognized next. I ask further unanimous consent that at the \ncompletion of my statement, if there is no member of the Republican \nparty seeking recognition, Senator Kaufman be recognized; if there is a \nmember of the Republican party seeking recognition on this bill, that, \nof course, they be recognized first, and then the next person to be \nrecognized be Senator Kaufman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this afternoon we begin consideration of \nthe bipartisan Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act. What this does is to \nstrengthen the Federal Government's capacity to investigate and \nprosecute the kinds of financial frauds that have so severely \nundermined our economy; that not only undermined our economy, they have \nhurt so many people in this country.\n  It is going to give the resources and the legal tools needed to \npolice and deter fraud. We have massive recovery efforts now being \nimplemented. But if we do not go after those who are committing fraud \nagainst people in this country, much of that effort is going to be \nwasted.\n  I commend the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, our lead cosponsor, \nfor his contributions to this package, and his dedication to protecting \ntaxpayer funds by deterring, investigating, and prosecuting fraud. He \nworked with me to write this bill. He has been a leader on this \nlegislation every step of the way.\n  I thank our many cosponsors for their steadfast support for this \neffort. Senator Schumer has not only supported this measure but has \nalso introduced additional legislative proposals with Senator Shelby. \nSenator Kaufman is an original cosponsor and has been a strong ally. He \nhas spoken and written about the need for fraud enforcement all year. \nSenator Klobuchar has participated throughout the course of Judiciary \nCommittee consideration of this bill. As former prosecutors, she and I \nboth know how important it is to have sufficient resources on the \nground committed to deterring and discovering these devastating crimes. \nMore recently, we have been joined in our efforts by the ranking \nRepublican on the Judiciary Committee, another former prosecutor and \nfriend, Senator Specter, and by Senators Snowe, Harkin, Levin, Dorgan, \nWhitehouse, Bayh, Shaheen, and Murray.\n  It is a bipartisan effort. And, actually, if you are going to go \nafter people committing crimes and fraud, you should not consider it a \nDemocratic or a Republican effort; this is a bipartisan effort. And we \nought to be able to do it, because those who are committing the frauds \ndid not ask if the person they are going to defraud is a Republican or\n\n[[Page S4409]]\n\nDemocrat, they want to defraud them. But what we want to do is to stop \nthem. So whether one supported the economic recovery efforts proposed \nby President Bush and President Obama or not, I think we can all agree \nno one wants that money squandered by fraud.\n  Whether we want to help homeowners in hard times or people who have \nlost their jobs or were lured into subprime mortgages--some may think \nit may be their fault they were lured into their subprime mortgages. \nBut if you had people involved in mortgage fraud, they should be held \naccountable.\n  I thank the majority leader for moving to proceed to this measure. It \nis my hope we can get to a time agreement without being filibustered. I \nhope we will not have to spend a lot of time in a filibuster before we \nconsider antifraud efforts on behalf of the American people. Everybody \nI talk to, whether it is in Vermont or any other State, says those who \nare involved in mortgage fraud, those who are involved in stealing the \nmoney, especially at a time of economic downturn, ought to be \nprosecuted.\n  Frankly, as a former prosecutor, I can tell you nothing so focuses \nthe minds of those who want to commit fraud as if they think they might \nactually be arrested, convicted, and sent to prison.\n  We are returning from the Easter recess. During these first months of \nthe year, the Judiciary Committee has concentrated on what it can do to \nassist in the economic recovery. We have already considered and \nreported this fraud enforcement bill, we considered and reported a \npatent reform bill, and we also put law enforcement assistance in the \neconomic recovery legislation. The President's efforts are beginning to \nshow dividends. As he said last week at Georgetown University, this \nadministration has responded to an extraordinary set of economic \nchallenges with extraordinary action, action that has been \nunprecedented both in terms of its scale and its speed.\n  We have seen the recovery plan enacted, the bank capitalization \nprogram, the housing plan, the strengthening of the nonbank credit \nmarket, the auto plan, and the work with the G-20. Those are signs \nintended to generate economic progress. That is good. That is \nnecessary. I agree with that. But it is not enough. We have to make \nsure when we send public money, taxpayers' money, that it is going to \nwhat it is supposed to go to, it is not being stolen, it is not being \ndissipated by fraud, it is not going to the hands of people whom nobody \nin this Chamber, Republican or Democrat, would want it to go to.\n  We need to ensure those responsible for the downturn through \nfraudulent acts of financial markets and in the housing market are held \nto account. That is why we have to enact the Fraud Enforcement and \nRecovery Act. We have to make every effort to ensure accountability, \nand this bill will do that. It will build our Nation's capacity to \ninvestigate and prosecute financial fraud.\n  Take a look at this chart. These are the reports of mortgage fraud. \nThis is at near epidemic levels. Look at the number of reports in 1998. \nLook at them now. In 1998, 2,269. Last year, 65,049. Frauds are up 682 \npercent over the past 5 years and more than 2,800 percent in the past \ndecade.\n  Some would estimate that we are losing $4 billion each year in \nmortgage fraud alone. Then you have massive new corporate frauds, such \nas the $65 billion Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Bernard Madoff. These \nare being uncovered. How many more are there?\n  In the past 2 weeks alone, the Justice Department announced \nprosecutions in mortgage and security scams involving more than $200 \nmillion in fraud. This kind of fraud has even touched my own State of \nVermont. We are a very small State. We are the second smallest State in \nthe Union, 650,000 people. But last fall, Federal authorities uncovered \na $26 million mortgage scam involving more than 50 properties being run \nout of the small town of Highgate, VT. It is affecting everybody. Let's \ngo after these people. Let's prosecute them. Let's throw them in jail. \nBecause, otherwise, if you simply give them a fine, it is a cost of \ndoing business and nobody is deterred by it.\n  The victims of these frauds must be protected now more than ever. \nThey are homeowners who have been fleeced by unscrupulous mortgage \nbrokers or so-called foreclosure experts who promise to help. Instead \nof helping them, they leave them unable to keep their homes and in \nfurther debt than before.\n  We have retirees who have lost their life savings with stock scams \nand Ponzi schemes. These have come to light only when the markets and \ncorporations have collapsed. They also include the American taxpayers \nwho have invested billions of dollars to restore our economy and \nsupport our banking system, and they assume that taxpayers' dollars are \ngoing to be there to support our industries, that taxpayer dollars are \ngoing to be there to help bail out our economy, that somebody is not \ngoing to steal it.\n  As the economic crisis worsened last fall, I called upon Federal law \nenforcement to track down and punish those who were responsible for the \ncorporate and mortgage frauds that helped make the economic downturn \nfar worse than anyone predicted. This year, as Congress reconvened, I \njoined with Senator Grassley to draft and introduce the Fraud \nEnforcement and Recovery Act, the legislation we consider today, which \nwill provide the new tools and resources needed by law enforcement to \ncarry out this effort. Now, I call on all Senators to support and \npromptly pass this bill, so we can make sure that those responsible for \nthese frauds are held fully accountable and that the many millions, \nlikely even billions, of dollars lost will be recovered for fraud \nvictims and for the American taxpayer.\n  Federal law enforcement needs this legislation now to combat fraud \neffectively. In the last 3 years, the number of criminal mortgage fraud \ninvestigations opened by the Federal Bureau of Investigation--FBI--has \nmore than doubled, and the FBI anticipates that number may double yet \nagain. Despite this increase, the FBI currently has fewer than 250 \nspecial agents nationwide assigned to financial fraud cases, which is \nonly a quarter of the number the Bureau had more than a decade ago at \nthe time of the savings and loan crisis. At current levels, the FBI \ncannot even begin to investigate the more than 5000 mortgage fraud \nallegations referred by the Treasury Department each month.\n  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, we faced a similar financial \ncrisis with the collapse of the federally insured savings and loan \nindustry. At the time, Congress responded by passing legislation to \nhire prosecutors and agents similar to the bill we consider today, and \nthat effort resulted in more than 600 fraud convictions nationwide and \nrecovery of more than $130 million in ordered restitution. But the \nsavings and loan collapse is dwarfed in scale by the current crisis, as \nfinancial institutions have lost more than $1 trillion in assets in the \npast year, compared to only $160 billion in assets lost during the \nentire savings and loan era. Clearly, we must respond at least as \nstrongly as we have in the past.\n  Two decades ago we responded during the savings and loan crisis by \nhiring more agents, analysts and prosecutors and allocating the \nresources needed to catch those who took advantage to profit through \nfraud. We need to do so, again.\n  At a February 11, 2009, Judiciary Committee hearing, we heard from \nthe FBI, the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief \nProgram, TARP, and the Justice Department. All witnesses testified \nconcerning the need for this legislation and these additional law \nenforcement resources.\n  Deputy Director Pistole of the FBI testified that the number of \nmortgage fraud cases opened by the FBI had more than doubled in the \npast 3 years, with 721 cases open in 2005, and more than 1,800 open at \nthe end of 2008. He warned that the losses in this economic crisis \ndwarf those of the savings and loan debacle, and the need for more \nenforcement is even greater now than it was then.\n  Special Inspector General Barofsky described how law enforcement \nresources had understandably been diverted from traditional white \ncollar crime to terrorism following the attacks on September 11, 2001. \nThis trend left the Justice Department's capacity to respond to \nfinancial and securities fraud significantly weakened, and with the \nrecent trends shifting even more resources to mortgage frauds, other \nwhite collar efforts were even further ``underfunded and \nunderprosecuted.'' He warned that with trillions of dollars\n\n[[Page S4410]]\n\nbeing spent under TARP and other associated programs, ``it is essential \nthat the appropriate resources be dedicated to meet the challenges of \nboth deterring and prosecuting fraud.'' I agree.\n  Acting Assistant Attorney General Glavin of the Justice Department \ntestified that our bill would provide the Justice Department with \nneeded tools ``to aggressively fight fraud in the current economic \nclimate'' and ``provide key statutory enhancements that will assist in \nensuring that those who have committed fraud are held accountable.''\n  The committee also received written testimony supporting this \nenforcement effort from the inspector general for the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development, and from the Acting Chief Postal \nInspector.\n  We all know about Bernard Madoff's infamous $65 billion Ponzi scheme \nthat went undetected for years. And every month we learn of more and \nmore kinds of schemes. We have to clean this up.\n  This would allow the FBI, the Justice Department, other agencies, to \nrespond to the crisis. In total, the bill authorizes $245 million a \nyear over the next two years to hire more than 300 Federal agents, more \nthan 200 prosecutors, and another 200 forensic analysts and support \nstaff to rebuild our nation's ``white collar'' fraud enforcement \nefforts. While the number of fraud cases is now skyrocketing, we need \nto remember that resources were shifted away from fraud investigations \nafter \n9/11. Because today the ranks of fraud investigators, of prosecutors, \nare drastically understocked.\n  Some have said, well, we cannot afford to authorize additional money \nfor fraud investigations. I think that is a bad mistake. The only way \nyou are going to stop it is to show you are going to stop it. The only \nway you are going to deter it is if you act to deter it, if you \ninvestigate the people, if you go after them, if you make them pay, and \nif we recover money for American taxpayers.\n  I see the distinguished senior Senator from Minnesota on the floor. \nShe is a former prosecutor. She knows that the way you go after these \npeople is to really go after them. If fraud goes unprosecuted and \nunpunished, then victims across America lose money. In many cases, \nAmerican taxpayers take the loss directly. For example, in the case of \nmany mortgage frauds where the Federal Government has guaranteed the \nloans, and when the fraud remains hidden, American taxpayers, as well \nas the victim, lose out. If we don't take action to investigate and \nprosecute this kind of fraud, Americans will lose far more money than \nthis bill costs.\n  In fact, fraud enforcement is an excellent investment for the \nAmerican taxpayers. According to recent data provided by the Justice \nDepartment, the Government recovers, on average, $32 for every dollar \nspent on criminal fraud litigation. Think about that. If you are an \ninvestor, you would love to invest and get that kind of return. We \nspend $1 on criminal fraud litigation, we get back $32. The nonpartisan \ngroup, Taxpayers Against Fraud, has found that in civil fraud cases, \nthe Government recovers $15 for every dollar spent in civil fraud \ncases.\n  Last year the Justice Department recovered nearly $2 billion in civil \nfalse claims settlements, and in criminal cases, the courts ordered \nnearly $3 billion in restitution and recovery. That is why we should \npass this and pass it quickly.\n  I do not want, 8 months from now, when suddenly we find here another \nhundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars, taken from \nAmerican taxpayers in fraud and theft that we could have stopped, but \nto say: Gosh, if only that bill had passed.\n  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act also makes a number of \nstraightforward, important improvements to fraud and money laundering \nstatutes to strengthen prosecutors' ability to combat this growing wave \nof fraud. Specifically, the bill amends the definition of ``financial \ninstitution'' in the criminal code in order to extend Federal fraud \nlaws to mortgage lending businesses that are not directly regulated or \ninsured by the Federal Government. These companies were responsible for \nnearly half the residential mortgage market before the economic \ncollapse, yet they remain largely unregulated and outside the scope of \ntraditional Federal fraud statutes. This change will apply the Federal \nfraud laws to private mortgage businesses like Countrywide Home Loans \nand GMAC Mortgage, just as they apply to federally insured and \nregulated banks.\n  The bill would also amend the major fraud statute to protect funds \nexpended under the Troubled Assets Relief Program and the economic \nstimulus package, including any government purchases of preferred stock \nin financial institutions. The U.S. Government has provided \nextraordinary economic support to our banking system, and we need to \nmake sure that none of those funds are subject to fraud or abuse. This \nchange will give Federal prosecutors and investigators the explicit \nauthority they need to protect taxpayer funds.\n  This bill will also strengthen one of the core offenses in so many \nfraud cases--money laundering--which was significantly weakened by a \nrecent Supreme Court case. In United States v. Santos, the Supreme \nCourt misinterpreted the money laundering statutes, limiting their \nscope to only the ``profits'' of crimes, rather than the ``proceeds'' \nof the offenses. The Court's mistaken decision was contrary to \ncongressional intent and will lead to financial criminals escaping \nculpability simply by claiming their illegal scams did not make a \nprofit. Indeed, Ponzi schemes like the $50 billion fraud perpetrated by \nBernard Madoff, which by definition turn no profit, are exempt from \nmoney laundering charges under this formulation. This erroneous \ndecision must be corrected immediately, as dozens of money laundering \ncases have already been dismissed.\n  The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act also strengthens one of the \nmost potent civil tools we have for rooting out fraud in government--\nthe False Claims Act. The Federal Government has recovered more than \n$11 billion using the False Claims Act since it was modernized through \nthe work of Senator Grassley in 1986, but the statute still can be more \neffective. Recent court decisions and changes in government--\ncontracting practices have limited the effectiveness of the False \nClaims Act. As we did in the last Congress, Senator Grassley and I have \njoined together to update and restore the False Claims Act to protect \nthe American taxpayer.\n  Some may argue that the legal fixes in this bill constitute \noverreaching by the Federal Government, In fact, this bill does not \nover-federalize or over-criminalize, as we took great care in crafting \nit to avoid those kinds of excesses. The bill creates no new statutes \nand no new sentences. Instead, it focuses on modernizing existing \nstatutes to reach unregulated conduct and on addressing flawed court \ndecisions interpreting those laws.\n  This bill has broad bipartisan support. It has the strong backing of \nthe Justice Department and the Obama administration, along with Senator \nGrassley and Senator Specter, the ranking Republican member of the \nJudiciary Committee. We have Senator Snowe joining us as a cosponsor. \nThey have joined with Senators Kaufman, Schumer, Klobuchar, Levin, \nHarkin, Dorgan, Whitehouse, Bayh, Shaheen, and Murray who have \ncosponsored this bill.\n  The Justice Department sent us a letter. They said:\n\n       The Department strongly supports enactment of [the bill]. \n     The provisions of the legislation would provide Federal \n     investigators and prosecutors with significant new tools and \n     resources . . . to combat mortgage fraud, securities and \n     commodities fraud.\n\n  Look what the Director of the FBI said:\n\n       FERA [referring to our bill,] will be tremendously helpful \n     in giving us the tools to investigate . . . to help \n     prosecutors prosecute, and finally to obtain the convictions \n     and jail sentences that are the deterrent to this activity \n     taking place in the future.\n\n  Remember, we certainly want to recover money. Certainly we want those \nforfeitures. Certainly we want those fines. But I want people to go to \njail for this. Because if you think if you are going to defraud someone \nor groups defraud people of $100 million, you might get a $10 million \nfine, that is 10 percent of your cost of doing business. But if you \nthink you might go to jail, then you are going to think twice.\n  That is why we received this support of the Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the\n\n[[Page S4411]]\n\nFederal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the National Association \nof Assistant United States Attorneys, the Association of Certified Tax \nExaminers, and Taxpayers Against Fraud.\n  The current epidemic of fraud went hand in hand with the greed and \nneglect that poisoned our economy in recent years. As banks and private \nmortgage companies relaxed their standards for loans, approving ever \nriskier mortgages with less and less due diligence, they created an \nenvironment that invited fraud. Private mortgage brokers and lending \nbusinesses came to dominate the home housing market, and these \ncompanies were not subject to the kind of banking oversight and \ninternal regulations that had traditionally helped to prevent fraud. We \nare now seeing the results of this lax supervision and lack of \naccountability.\n  The problem spread as home mortgages were packaged together and \nturned into securities that were bought and sold in largely unregulated \nmarkets on Wall Street. Here again, the environment invited fraud. As \nthe value of the mortgages started to decline with falling housing \nprices, Wall Street financiers began to see these mortgage-backed \nsecurities unravel. Some were not honest about these securities, \nleading to even more fraud, and victimizing investors nationwide.\n  Only by reinvigorating our antifraud measures and giving law \nenforcement agencies the tools and resources they need to root out \nfraud can we ensure that fraud can never again place our financial \nsystem at risk and victimize so many Americans. Taxpayers, who bear the \nburden of this financial downturn, deserve to know that the government \nis doing all it can to hold responsible those who committed crimes in \nthe run-up to this collapse.\n  There should be strong support for this. The Justice Department \nsupports it. The FBI supports it. The Secret Service supports it. The \nPostal Inspection Service supports it, the HUD Inspector General \nsupports it, the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset \nRelief Program supports it, on and on and on.\n  And, most importantly, some of the most thoughtful members of this \nbody, Republican and Democratic Members alike, support it. So let's go \nas quickly as we can. Let's have a decent time agreement on this bill.\n  Let's get it passed. Let's get it through the other body. Let's get \nit on the President's desk. Then let's go and investigate and lock up \nthe people who cost the American taxpayers hundreds of millions, even \nbillions of dollars.\n  I see the distinguished cosponsor, the Senator from Iowa. I yield the \nfloor and withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Would the Chair please inform me as to the time \nallotted on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The minority has 95 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Vermont for his leadership in \nthis area. I very much enjoy working with him. We may come from \ndifferent political parties, but he has been very cooperative in a lot \nof the efforts I wanted to make on individual pieces of legislation. On \nthis one, he and I are working together very closely. I thank him for \nthe opportunity to work with him and thank him very much for including \nwithin this legislation some things both he and I have an interest in \ndealing with the False Claims Act.\n  I am pleased to be an original cosponsor of the Fraud Enforcement \nRecovery Act. This is a timely piece of legislation, given the current \neconomic downturn and the unprecedented amount of taxpayer dollars that \nare being expended to shore up banks and financial institutions, \ncorporations, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, et cetera. When taxpayer money \nis being injected into these corporations, there is more opportunity \nfor fraud, and we ought to stay on top of it. We have a responsibility \nas Senators, as guardians of taxpayer money, to make sure fraud does \nnot occur anytime but, more importantly, when there is taxpayer money \nkeeping a lot of these organizations afloat that would not otherwise be \nthere.\n  There can be honest differences between Senators about whether this \ntaxpayer money should have been used in the first place. Some of that I \nhave voted against using. But the fact is, we were in the minority. The \nmoney is being used to sustain some of these institutions and \ncorporations and, consequently, we have every responsibility to make \nsure taxpayer money is protected. That is what this piece of \nlegislation is all about.\n  For instance, the economic stimulus package handed out nearly $1 \ntrillion in new spending. Whether a Member supported or opposed these \nexpenditures, he or she must agree we simply cannot allow unscrupulous \nindividuals defrauding the Government and ripping off the taxpayers. \nThis legislation ensures that our law enforcement officials as well as \nprosecutors have the tools necessary to enforce our laws and also the \nresources to hunt down bad actors. It makes minor revisions to our \ncriminal fraud laws to ensure that bad actors are not outside the scope \nof Federal jurisdiction. Further, it amends the civil False Claims Act \nto ensure that taxpayer money lost to fraud, waste, and abuse can be \nrecovered. These changes will deter potential defrauders from \nattempting to scam the Government. In addition, this legislation will \nhelp instill confidence back into the housing and financial markets.\n  Over the last few years, unscrupulous individuals found housing and \nfinancial markets that were lax in oversight enforcement and \nregulation. As a result, it was easy for these unscrupulous individuals \nto commit fraud against homeowners, lenders, and businesses across the \ncountry. For example, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, \nreferred to as FinCEN, released an updated report outlining filing \ntrends in mortgage loan fraud suspicious activity reports. This report \nshowed that SARs have continued to increase and for the last year \nending in June 2008, there were more than 62,000 suspicious activity \nreports, SARs, filed related to mortgage fraud alone.\n  While this raw data simply represents investigative leads, it \nrepresents a 44-percent increase in suspicious activity from the \npreceding year. We need to act now to stamp out new fraud claims, to \nsend a message that American taxpayers will not be taken for a ride.\n  This rise in the number of suspicious activity reports has also \nincreased the need to investigate leads that come in these reports. As \na result, we need to make sure there are resources available so that \nlaw enforcement agencies can follow these leads.\n  During the height of the savings and loan crisis in the late 1980s \nand early 1990s, the FBI had over 1,000 agents and experts working \nmortgage fraud cases. Today, it is a lot less, compared to a much \nbigger amount of money that is at stake. Today the FBI has 180 agents \ndedicated to mortgage fraud investigations, a significant decrease \ncompared to the 1,000 agents and experts during the S crisis.\n  While this number represents an effort to combat fraud, it is a \nsignificant decrease when we consider the hundreds of millions of \ndollars in write-downs during the S crisis--in other words, small--\ncompared to the estimated $1 trillion in write-downs that may occur as \na result of the financial and housing crisis. This bill enables law \nenforcement agencies, including the FBI, Secret Service, the Housing \nand Urban Development inspector general, and the Postal Inspection \nService to procure the funding necessary to make sure this fraud \ndoesn't happen because you need this sort of joint effort to combat \nwhat will be complex financial crimes.\n  It is important to note this bill recognizes the important work of a \nnumber of Federal law enforcement agencies that work to combat and \nprevent financial crimes.\n  You don't often think of the Secret Service when you think of \nmortgage fraud, but the dedicated men and women at the Secret Service \nhave been on the front lines in combating mortgage fraud since the S \ncrisis and continue to unravel complex financial crimes. The Postal \nInspection Service and the inspector general of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development also continue to make significant \ncontributions to stamping out mortgage fraud that abuses Federal \nGovernment programs and utilizes the mail to commit this fraud.\n  In addition to authorizing funding for law enforcement prosecutors so \nwe get the number of people to get the job\n\n[[Page S4412]]\n\ndone, the bill also makes some necessary changes in Federal criminal \nlaw. The bill redefines ``financial institution'' to include mortgage \nlending businesses, a category currently missing in that definition. It \nalso amends the statute to make it illegal to make false statements on \nmortgage applications and appraisals. It might surprise Members since \ncommon sense ought to dictate that, but common sense has not prevailed \nin that instance, so we will make that a crime.\n  Further, it ensures that economic relief funds and TARP funds are \nincluded in criminal laws prohibiting fraud against the Government. It \nadds commodities futures to the securities fraud statute. The bill also \nmakes two important clarifications to the antimoney laundering laws; \nfirst, by defining the term ``proceeds'' so that a recent Supreme Court \ndecision doesn't limit the ability to go after criminals and drug \ndealers who launder the proceeds of their ill-gotten gain. This is an \nincredibly important provision, especially given the recent concerns \nabout the outbound bulk cash smuggling going across the border with \nMexico.\n  Second, the bill amends the international money laundering statute to \nmake it a crime to transport or transfer money out of the country to \nevade taxes. This provision is also timely given the recent efforts by \nthe Justice Department and the Internal Revenue Service to clamp down \non tax cheats and evaders who move money offshore for the sole purpose \nof avoiding paying taxes with no economic rationale behind it.\n  Finally and most importantly, the legislation makes important changes \nto the Federal False Claims Act. The False Claims Act is the \nGovernment's premier tool to recover Government money lost to fraud and \nabuse. The Government has used the False Claims Act to recover over $22 \nbillion since 1986 when I introduced legislation that amended the \nprevious False Claims Act. This legislation will ensure that the law \nadheres to the original intent of the False Claims Act.\n  I think I have some expertise in that area, being the author of this \nlegislation and finding the Supreme Court's ruling contrary to \ncongressional intent, albeit their motivation may be to interpret the \nlaw and that is the way they interpret it, but it does not keep us from \ngoing back to what we think is the original intent and saying to the \ncourts: You got it wrong.\n  Specifically, these amendments address a loophole that was created in \nthe False Claims Act by the Supreme Court decision in the Allison \nEngine case which could be used by fraudfeasors to evade liability by \nhiring subcontractors to perform work on Government contracts. Some \ndefendants are already filing briefs in court seeking to have the false \nclaims cases dismissed because of that decision. It needs to be \naddressed to protect taxpayer dollars.\n  This legislation could not come at a more important time. It will \nsend a message to those who have defrauded homeowners and mortgage \nlenders and will send an even stronger message to those thinking about \ncommitting a future crime. I hope my colleagues will join in supporting \nthe legislation to make sure that taxpayer dollars are protected.\n  I want to add a little editorial comment outside of this piece of \nlegislation we have before us. There will be a lot of new Members \ncoming to the Senate, maybe not understanding the motivation behind the \nFalse Claims Act of 1986. There was tremendous fraud, particularly in \ndefense contracting, that caused me at that time, as a first-term \nSenator, to be concerned about it. We got proper amendments to the \nFalse Claims Act to protect whistleblowers and to use the information \nthat whistleblowers give us to bring cases.\n  The motivation behind the False Claims Act is that maybe for \nphilosophical reasons, the Justice Department might want to pursue \nsomething or maybe their workload is such that a certain case might \nhave a lower priority. It gives the individual citizen in qui tam type \nsuits the ability to bring cases in a sense as a citizen prosecutor. Of \ncourse, if a person is not a lawyer, they will have to hire lawyers to \ndo that for them. But as a motivation for doing it, they get a percent \nof what is recovered.\n  Remember, $22 billion has been recovered since this law was passed. \nThat may not be a lot of money over the period of years, but it sure is \none big hunk of money that we wouldn't have access to if it wasn't for \nwhistleblowers and people who were willing to pursue it to the nth \ndegree to make sure that the case is made and to bring back the \ntaxpayer money at the same time.\n  Consequently, I am sure somebody is going to try to make a case that \nwhen some whistleblower gets $1 million, well, isn't that an awful lot \nof money for information that has brought back maybe tens of millions \nof dollars or maybe hundreds of millions of dollars? But the point is, \nwe would not have the case if it was not for the information from the \nwhistleblower.\n  A lot of people will make a judgment: Well, if you are a public \nemployee or connected to a government program, it is your duty to \nreport that. Well, that is exactly what a lot of people have done \nwithout even knowing the false claims law exists. A lot of people whom \nI have met as whistleblowers have brought to the attention of people \nhigher up in the Government attempts at fraud or actual fraud and got \nnowhere, and then everybody assumes the only reason they brought it up \nis because they knew: Well, I can make a case out of this, and I can \nget a large award for bringing this to people's attention. Most of the \nwhistleblowers whom I know about did not even know about whistleblower \nprotection laws, did not even know about false claims laws until they \ngot into it. Then they find out there is some law that protects them, \nthere is some law that encourages them to move forward.\n  The point I am trying to make is that when Government cannot do its \njob of recovering fraud or does not know about it, it seems to me both \nthe $22 billion that has come back to the Federal Treasury as well as \nthe nature of preventing fraud that is behind it--and that probably \ndoes much more good, but you cannot measure it, than what is evidenced \nby the $22 billion--should not be challenged.\n  Defense contractors during the late 1980s into the 1990s tried to gut \nthis legislation through amendments on appropriations bills or through \nother attempts. When the defense contractors could not do it, they got \npeople in the health care industry to front for them to try to gut it. \nIn almost every respect, in 20 years, we have stopped various special \ninterests in this town from gutting this legislation. But as we brought \nthis bill forward with Senator Leahy, we have found those people kind \nof coming to the surface once again.\n  I say to my colleagues--and particularly I would like my new \ncolleagues to be aware of this--you are going to find those same \nspecial interests that have been around for over a period of the last \n20 years trying to gut this legislation because it is one of the most \neffective tools against fraud. You are going to find them surfacing, \nnot necessarily in amendments that are very transparent that there is a \nspecial interest behind it. But let me tell you from the experience I \nhave had defending this legislation over the last 20 years, they are \nthere. They do not like the False Claims Act. I do not mean these \ninterests are about doing fraud, but they do not want the overseer the \nFalse Claims Act is, and they do not want the encouragement to \nwhistleblowers that if something is wrong, it might be reported.\n  I hope my colleagues--as the False Claims Act provisions of this bill \nmight be countered by some of our colleagues--think in terms of this \nnot being a new attack, this is just a return of a constant attack this \nlegislation had on it from maybe 1986 for about 10 years. I have not \nheard it surface a whole lot since then. But it is there.\n  Remember, this was a piece of legislation that was originally \nintended to go after military contract fraud. But let me tell you, now \nit is one of the best tools to get at health care fraud. That is \nsometimes the impetus for some of these crippling amendments. So please \nkeep that in the back of your mind as we consider this legislation, or \nat least this part of this bill dealing with the False Claims Act.\n  I surely thank Senator Leahy for including this in the bill, bringing \nthis back to its original intent, so it can be even a more forceful \ntool to be used against false claims, since it has been\n\n[[Page S4413]]\n\nweakened by some court decisions. It will help us ferret out fraud. I \nam sure happy we have a President who is also interested in doing that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that following my \nremarks, Senator Klobuchar be recognized and then Senator Inhofe.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, just for \nclarification purposes, generally, we go back and forth on both sides, \nbut it is fine with me to do it this way so Senator Klobuchar can \nfollow the Senator. Does the Senator think the two of you will be more \nthan 30 minutes all together?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I say to Senator Inhofe, we will not be. I will only \ngo 10 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is fine. Thank you very much. I do not object. I \nfurther ask unanimous consent that following Senator Klobuchar, I have \nat least 30 minutes. I believe that is the time that is allotted me.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I am proud to join with Chairman Leahy \nand Senator Grassley in sponsoring the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery \nAct.\n  I applaud their leadership on this issue. I also want to note the \nsignificant contributions of Senators Schumer and Klobuchar, who have \njoined us on this bill and have improved it in important ways.\n  Today's economic crisis has many causes, from serious regulatory \nfailures to recklessness and greed. While we are learning more each day \nabout what happened, one thing is certain right now: financial fraud \ncontributed mightily to this economic collapse.\n  It is the job of law enforcement to ferret out the behavior that was \ncriminal as opposed to merely reckless or foolish or unethical.\n  Yet I am certain that in the complex web of systemic failures that \nhave caused devastating harm to so many Americans, law enforcement will \nuncover a continuum of behavior and requisite blame. At one end will be \nthose responsible bankers and mortgage brokers who never engaged in \nunduly risky behavior.\n  There will also be those on the continuum who were merely reckless \nand based their business plans on the false assumption that housing \nvalues would always increase.\n  But the continuum will be anchored on the other end by mortgage \nbrokers who promoted fraud, and by bankers and financiers who \ndeliberately ignored excessive risk in designing mortgage-related \nproducts, and then hid those risks from investors while self-dealing \nand lining their own pockets. Those people, in my view, should be \ntargets of the FBI.\n  If we want to restore the public's faith in our financial markets and \nin the rule of law, then we must identify, prosecute, and send to \nprison those individuals who broke the law. Their fraudulent conduct \nhas severely damaged our economy and harmed countless hard-working \nAmericans.\n  The public needs to know that when mortgage brokers or credit raters \nor Wall Street bankers break the law, they will be treated like the \ncriminals they are. We can't have one set of rules for people who rob \nbanks and another set of rules for banks who rob people.\n  Unfortunately, our law enforcement agencies do not have the resources \nthey need to do the job. Right after September 11, Federal law \nenforcement resources were shifted dramatically, and understandably, to \ncounterterrorism. Regrettably, they have not been replaced.\n  As a result, our capacity to investigate and prosecute financial \ncrimes has been severely depleted. At the height of the savings and \nloan crisis, as many as 1,000 FBI agents were investigating financial \nfraud. As of last month, there were fewer than 250. And no one doubts \nthat the scope of the problem today is far greater than it was during \nthe S & L crisis.\n  That is why the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act begins by \nproviding the resources necessary to rebuild the Nation's white collar \nenforcement program. Building this capacity is doubly important today, \ngiven the substantial Federal funds being spent in connection with \nbailout and recovery programs.\n  We need the investigators and analysts in place as soon as possible, \nnot only to uncover and prosecute crimes that have already occurred, \nbut also to deter future crimes.\n  Prosecuting bad people won't put an end to bad behavior. But it will \nhave an impact on those people in the mortgage industry, on the trading \ndesks, and in the board rooms, who might be tempted to put greed ahead \nof the law.\n  The bill authorizes $165 million a year for hiring fraud \ninvestigators and prosecutors at the Department of Justice for fiscal \nyears 2010 and 2011. That includes $75 million in 2010 and $65 million \nin 2011 for the FBI to add 190 agents and 200 professional staff and \nforensic analysts.\n  The bill also includes $50 million a year for U.S. Attorneys' \nOffices, where much of the financial crime prosecution takes place, and \n$40 million for the criminal, civil, and tax divisions at Main Justice, \nto provide special litigation and investigative support.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes $80 million a year over the next 2 years \nfor investigators and analysts at the Postal Inspection Service, the \nSecret Service, and the inspector general at HUD, all to combat fraud.\n  This authorization, $490 million over the next 2 fiscal years, is \nactually quite modest, given the work that needs to be done. It is also \nan investment. History tells us that funds spent on fraud enforcement \nnet money for the Government, at a rate of about $15 recovered for \nevery $1 spent. In so many ways, this is an investment we can't afford \nnot to make.\n  Beyond providing resources, this bill modernizes several critical \nareas of Federal fraud law, ensuring that prosecutors have the tools \nnecessary to combat past and future financial fraud.\n  Chairman Leahy has spelled out these changes in some detail. I want \nto highlight a couple of points.\n  First, the bill updates the definition of ``financial institution'' \nin Federal fraud statutes to cover mortgage lending businesses that are \nnot directly regulated or insured by the Federal Government. These are \nbusinesses that were responsible for close to half of the residential \nmortgage market before the economic collapse. Just last month, FBI \nDirector Mueller stated that this single change would be ``tremendously \nhelpful'' in the fight against mortgage fraud.\n  The bill also amends Federal fraud law to protect funds expended \nunder both the Troubled Asset Relief Program and the Economic Recovery \nAct. The Federal Government has provided extraordinary financial \nsupport to our banking system, and we need to protect those funds \nagainst fraud and abuse.\n  Finally, I note that the bill provides narrow but important fixes to \nill-considered Supreme Court decisions in the areas of money laundering \nand the False Claims Act. Here, as in the rest of the bill, we have \ntaken an approach that is both carefully considered and precisely \ntargeted. We are not creating new crimes, or establishing entirely new \npaths to recovering ill-gotten gains. Instead, we have focused on \nmaking narrow changes that make sure lawbreakers don't slip through the \ngaps in existing law.\n  Complex and sophisticated crimes demand a broad-based and \nsophisticated response.\n  In terms of crimes already committed, we can't afford to let the \ntrail get cold.\n  In terms of future crimes, we must provide both the legal tools and \nthe law enforcement resources necessary to make would-be criminals \nthink twice before allowing their greed to do such terrible damage.\n  This is not about vengeance or politics. In our haste to target \nwrongdoers, we should not paint the entire banking industry with a \nbroad brush. Banks struggling to make loans during a deep recession are \nnot bad actors. Indeed, those who avoided the subprime market, avoided \nsecuritized pools of subprime mortgages, and never traded in credit \ndefault swaps were, in hindsight, models of discipline and prudential \nmanagement during an era when many lost their heads to greed. Those \nbanks should be applauded and supported, as they continue to work their \nway through difficult times and a very challenging real estate market.\n\n[[Page S4414]]\n\n  The wrongdoers will be known by their deeds and held accountable to \nthe law by a jury, not by the need to scapegoat an entire industry or a \nfew sacrificial lambs to satisfy popular anger.\n  There will be tell-tale signs for law enforcement to investigate: To \nfind those who used inside information to bail out early while failing \nto disclose material information; to investigate traders who hid and \ndistorted their trading books until they cashed out a huge bonus; to \ntarget mortgage brokers who repeatedly and fraudulently induced \nmortgage loans which they could quickly package and sell without any \nresponsibility for the ticking time bombs that became weapons of mass \nfinancial destruction.\n  Frauds of the sort addressed by this bill attack the heart of our \nfinancial system. For our economy to work for every American, we must \nrestore the public's faith that no one, from Main Street to Wall \nStreet, is above the law.\n  Speaking of Main Street, the people I talk to are very patient as we \nwork hard to get the financial system and the economy back on track. \nThey understand this will be a long process and that we cannot expect \nimmediate returns on the significant Federal investments made in recent \nmonths. At the same time, they rightly expect the Federal Government to \nspend the time and money necessary to bring to justice the criminals \nwho helped create the crisis in the first place. The authorization of \nthis bill--$490 million over the next 2 years--is very modest in light \nof the enormity of the crisis. The American public will not understand \nif we refuse to make this small investment in order to restore public \nconfidence, both in the markets and in the rule of law.\n  I again thank Chairman Leahy and Senator Grassley for their \nleadership on this issue, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on the 30 \nminutes on our side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Twelve minutes.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Thank you very much.\n  Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for being so \ngracious to allow me to speak at this time. I am speaking today in \nsupport of the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act which I believe is an \nimportant and timely piece of legislation that I cosponsored and helped \nto vote out of our Judiciary Committee. I also thank Senators Leahy, \nGrassley, and Kaufman, all of whom spoke this afternoon, for their \nleadership and their work on this bill. I believe this bill will \ngreatly increase our ability to prosecute and prevent financial crime.\n  I also note that the President and the administration have come out \nwith their statement on administration policy on this bill and it is \nvery positive, and they are supportive of this bill.\n  Unfortunately, the need for this legislation could never have been \nclearer. The Madoff scandal is only one big example of why we need this \nbill. Because of one man--one man--$65 billion has been lost in this \ncountry. It has been a loss to investors, a loss to people who have \nnothing left, a loss to some of the charities and charitable \norganizations in this country that are trying to help people in need \nduring this difficult time. In my home State of Minnesota, literally \ndozens and dozens of people have lost significant sums of money, and \nour charities are suffering. This isn't right.\n  After years of lax oversight and investigation, we are beginning to \nsee many financial crimes come to light as the victims of financial \nfraud have emerged to tell their stories.\n  During a recent Judiciary Committee hearing on fraud enforcement, the \nActing Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division of the \nJustice Department said that as the economy has declined:\n\n       What we may be starting to see [are] . . . these sorts of \n     Ponzy schemes that were able to go along for a little while. \n     And then all of a sudden, there's a rush by the victims of \n     schemes who don't know they're victims yet. And then the \n     money's not there when they go to get the money out.\n\n  In other words, as we would say in Minnesota, the chickens are coming \nhome to roost.\n  All of this reminds me of a famous passage about embezzlement in John \nKenneth Galbraith's classic book, ``The Great Crash 1929.'' I remember \nthis because I would often use it as a prosecutor in Minnesota when I \nwould address the legislature about the need to focus on white-collar \ncrimes, especially in times of economic difficulty, and this is what he \nsaid:\n\n       In goods times, people are relaxed, trusting, and money is \n     plentiful. But even though money is plentiful, there are \n     always many people who need more. Under these circumstances \n     the rate of embezzlement grows [and] the rate of discovery \n     falls off. In depression, all this is reversed. Money is \n     watched with a narrow, suspicious eye. The man who handles it \n     is assumed to be dishonest until he proves himself otherwise. \n     Audits are penetrating and meticulous. Commercial morality is \n     enormously improved.\n\n  This may be an almost perfect description of our own time. As \nGalbraith suggested, our bad economy is now exposing financial crimes \nthat have been concealed for many years.\n  In the past 3 years, the number of criminal mortgage fraud \ninvestigations opened by the FBI, as Senator Leahy explained, has \ndoubled. And in the past 6 years, there has been a nearly tenfold \nincrease in the number of reports filed with the Treasury Department \nalleging mortgage fraud.\n  I fear this is the tip of the iceberg. As our economy has declined, \ncrime will be on the rise. And with billions of dollars going out the \ndoor to stimulate the economy--important job-creating investments in \ntransportation infrastructure and broadband networks and much more--we \nknow there are going to be people trying to bilk the system, whether it \nis for that or the TARP money, and steal money for their own personal \nprofit.\n  So it is critical that we have a Justice Department and an FBI that \nwill hold accountable the people who are getting government funds, that \nwill watch over the taxpayers' money, and that will make sure people \nsuch as Bernie Madoff are prosecuted and brought to justice. In order \nto do that, we need to make sure law enforcement has the tools and the \nresources they need to effectively fight, investigate, and prosecute \nthese crimes.\n  Before entering the Senate, I served as the chief prosecutor for \nHennepin County in Minnesota, which consists of Minneapolis and 45 \nsuburban communities. We worked extensively with the U.S. Attorney's \nOffice and the FBI and other Federal agencies on white-collar crime. I \nremember it well because after the tragedy on 9/11, a number of the \nwhite-collar cases that were previously being prosecuted by the U.S. \nAttorney's Office came to our office since we were the largest \nprosecutor's office in the State. We took both cases on. We got the \npeople in place to handle them. But I saw then how resource intensive \nthese cases can be.\n\n  Most prosecutors have a simple saying about financial fraud cases: \n``Follow the money and you will find the crooks.'' Of course, in \nreality, it is often very hard to do that. It is very time consuming \nand very expensive to look through thousands and thousands of boxes of \ndocuments and computer files to find that money trail and to follow it \nto where it goes to mortgage fraud and financial fraud. In fact, many \nwhite-collar crimes require complex investigations and significant \nresources to catch the crooks and prosecute them. They often require \nspecial--and expensive--expertise such as individual skills in \naccounting or computer forensics.\n  Although it is hard and more complex to catch white-collar criminals, \nit is no less important. For the sake of our economy, for the sake of \njustice, we must hold people accountable for their crimes, whether it \nis robbing a convenience store or using a computer to bilk investors \nout of millions of dollars.\n  Prosecuting financial crimes also has a ripple effect. Increased \nenforcement acts as a deterrent, sending a clear message to those who \nmight want to commit financial fraud that wrongdoers will be prosecuted \nand subject to the full extent of the law. So oftentimes these white-\ncollar criminals somehow see themselves above the law because they have \na good job and because they know people in town. I can say that once we \nstarted prosecuting these people, a lot of people started turning money \nin. My favorite was\n\n[[Page S4415]]\n\nwhen we started prosecuting nine commercial airline pilots for not \npaying taxes to the Minnesota Revenue Department. We suddenly got \nmillions of dollars into the coffers of the revenue department in the \nState of Minnesota because it turned out other people were also maybe \nopening up post office boxes in other States and pretending to live \nthere instead of in our State. So there can be a great deterrent effect \nand bring money in from people who haven't been paying their taxes or \nactually committing fraud.\n  Unfortunately, in the last 8 years on the Federal level, I believe \nthere hasn't been enough of this, partly because we haven't had the \nresources and partly because some of the regulatory agencies have been \nbasically asleep at the wheel.\n  After the attacks on September 11, the FBI understandably reduced its \ncriminal investigator work to expand its national security role, \nshifting more than 1,800 agents--or nearly one-third of all agents who \nwere in criminal programs--to terrorism and intelligence duties. \nCurrent and former officials say that the cutbacks have left the FBI \nseriously exposed in investigating an area such as white-collar crime. \nRight now, the FBI doesn't have enough staff to investigate or even \nreview the 5,000-plus fraud allegations that the Treasury Department \nreceives every month.\n  Make no mistake, this is having an effect on our economy. In addition \nto the many families losing their hard-earned money and their homes, \nfraud has contributed to the collapse in the mortgage-backed securities \nmarket. In the past year, banks and financial institutions in our \ncountry lost more than $500 billion because of the subprime mortgage \nindustry.\n  That is why the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act is so important. \nThe bill authorizes $165 million a year for the Justice Department to \nhire fraud prosecutors and investigators, including funds for the FBI \nto bring on an additional 190 special agents and more than 200 \nprofessional staff and forensic analysts to rebuild its white-collar \ninvestigation program. Additionally, the bill will provide resources \nfor the FBI to double the number of mortgage fraud task forces \nnationwide that target fraud in the hardest hit areas of our country. I \nam a big believer in these task forces as a way of bringing local and \nFederal law enforcement together. We have seen it work effectively in a \nnumber of areas across the country.\n  In addition to making sure law enforcement has the resources it \nneeds, this legislation also makes sure they have the tools needed to \ncrack down on financial crime. This bill makes it easier to prosecute \nmortgage lending businesses for fraud--the predatory lenders. These \ncompanies were responsible for nearly half of the residential mortgage \nmarket before the economic collapse. Yet they currently remain largely \nunregulated and outside the scope of traditional Federal fraud \nstatutes. This makes no sense. By amending the criminal code, we can \nhold unregulated mortgage businesses responsible for their actions. \nFederal fraud laws should apply to private mortgage businesses such as \nCountrywide Home Loans and GMAC Mortgage, just as they apply to \nfederally insured and regulated banks. I know we have a lot of very \nhealthy banks in Minnesota and they have been fighting for this for \nyears.\n  Why should they be held to a different standard? Why should some of \nthese mortgage companies not be held to the same fiduciary duty as \nthese banks? As a former prosecutor, I know firsthand how challenging \nit can be to go after these financial crimes, but I also know how \nimportant it is. If we are going to get our economy back on track, we \nhave to restore trust in our financial system. That starts with \nstopping fraud and crime. The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act will \ngive our law enforcement agencies the tools and resources they need to \ndo this.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill and to support \nthis incredibly important piece of legislation. The time is right. We \nnot only have the fraud we are already seeing come to light but we also \nknow there are a number of possibilities for fraud as we have seen in \nthe past when government funds go out. There has to be the policeman on \nthe corner. That is our FBI, that is our task forces with local law \nenforcement, and that is our prosecutors watching what happens so we \ndon't let another Bernie Madoff slip through the cracks.\n  Thank you very much, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it was my understanding earlier that I had \nabout 15 more minutes than the 30 minutes that I understand are \nallotted me now. So if there is time at the end of my main message, I \nwish to address the problem of the David Hamilton nomination. In fact, \nI will announce that I will filibuster that nomination. The EPA \nendangerment findings, the Obama gun control, and then the DHS report \nthat is very damaging to our veterans.\n\n\n                          Obama Defense Budget\n\n  First of all, the main reason I am here is to speak out about a great \nconcern that we are now heading down a very dangerous road leading to \nthe gutting of our military and settling for adequacy as opposed to \nsupremacy. I first made my concerns known on a YouTube video that I did \nwhen I was in Afghanistan immediately following the announcement by the \nObama administration. My concerns drew an interesting reaction from the \nleft. Not only did they say I was wrong to say that there were proposed \ncuts to the budget, they actually said the Obama administration \nproposed to increase the budget. I must confess it is a rare day when \nliberals actually claim to support increasing our Nation's military.\n  MSNBC was so outraged with my video that three of their prime time \nhosts took aim at my comments from Afghanistan that very same night. \nMSNBC host Ed Schultz featured my video as part of his regular feature \n``Psycho Talk'' and called my concerns ``absolutely false'' and said I \nwas joining Cheney and Giuliani.\n  Keith Olbermann said I should ``do the math'' and his guest, the very \nunbiased Speaker Pelosi, said my criticism of the Obama defense budget \nwas simply ``desperation'' and that we are going to be spending more on \ndefense than in 2009.\n  Not to be left out, Rachel Maddow repeated the same talking points \nand said once again the budget was actually going to increase. Then she \nbrought on a guest, Eugene Robinson, an associate editor and columnist \nwith the Washington Post, who went so far as to say I was making stuff \nup and lying.\n\n  Not to be outdone, CNN's Rich Sanchez said he was doing a ``fact \ncheck.'' He called my words ``ridiculous'' and brought on a liberal \nthink tank policy wonk, whom Sanchez referred to as a ``moderate,'' to \ndefend his claims. It is interesting that all of the liberal \njournalists were jumping on and assailing me but not the moderate ones.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of my remarks, this \neditorial from the Wall Street Journal be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. INHOFE. The problem is that the left is focused on one number, \none piece of military spending, when they need to look at the total \ndefense budget--what DOD actually spends on military operations, and \nhow that money is used to maintain our military capabilities.\n  In actuality, thanks to the Obama administration, our overall defense \nspending has been cut by $10.7 billion in fiscal 2009 and then cut \nagain in 2010. You might say fiscal 2009 was from the previous \nadministration. But the second part of the emergency supplemental is \nwhere the cuts came in, and that was done by the Obama administration.\n  We have reached a crossroads where we will choose to either invest in \nmodernization and readiness of our military or mistakenly ``kick the \ncan down the road,'' which we have been doing.\n  Based on the projected defense budget for the next 10 years, it looks \nas if this administration is taking us down a path that leads to a \nweaker military that is poorly equipped. Two weeks ago, on April 6, \nSecretary Gates announced a broad plan of cuts and adjustments in the \nfiscal year 2010 DOD\n\n[[Page S4416]]\n\nbudget. His plan intends to ``reshape the priorities of America's \ndefense establishment'' and ``profoundly reform how the DOD does \nbusiness.''\n  However, the programs and systems he intends to cut will severely \naffect the ongoing effort to rebuild and modernize our military. I was \nin Afghanistan when this decision was announced. Most of the liberal \njournalists responded.\n  This plan comes at a time in our history when we have dramatically \nincreased domestic spending by trillions of dollars under the umbrella \nof ``emergency bailouts'' and ``stimulus packages.''\n  Think about it. I think that $700 billion, quite frankly, was thrown \naway. It was supposed to be used for damaged assets and it was used to \nbail out friendly banks. I will defend Paulson a little, because it was \nTim Geithner who was the architect behind all of this. I will elaborate \non that later.\n  If you want to stimulate the economy, there are three ways to do it. \nOne would be for military spending, defense spending; another is \ninfrastructure investment--highways, construction, bridges--and another \nis tax cuts.\n  Sadly, this President is on track to grow the country's obligations \nto 22 percent of our GDP, while he is shrinking defense spending in \nrelation to GDP to 3 percent in 2019.\n  This chart shows that during the Clinton administration, in the \n1990s, we took a holiday from the procurement of new weapons and \nmodernizing the aging weapons systems. This black line is what he \ninherited in the beginning. If you add inflation to it, that is what it \nwould have been. This line was the Clinton budget--$412 billion less \nthan what normal inflation would be. It looks like that is where we are \ngoing from this point on.\n  Many of us in the Senate and in the House repeatedly spoke on the \nfloor during the 1990s. We were concerned about the dangers of the \nmassive cuts in personnel and procurement that were taking shape. With \nvery few exceptions, our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have \nbeen using the same weapons systems while fighting a two-fronted war on \nterror for 8 years. They are weapons and weapons systems designed and \nproduced during the Cold War--weapons used repeatedly over the past two \ndecades around the globe--weapons and weapon systems still in use \ntoday.\n  We have been unsuccessful in trying to get past a bow wave created in \nthe 1990s, when the military budget was cut $412 billion and \nacquisition programs and research and development were pushed to the \nright--delayed.\n  The cost of kicking our military modernization down the road is a \ntwofold increase in our cost to modernize--an increase to develop and \nfield new weapons and weapon systems, and an increased cost to operate \nand maintain our aging equipment.\n  It is also forcing the military to accept more risk as they decide \nhow to operate with less equipment, how to fight with equipment \nincreasingly difficult to maintain, and what to do when weapon systems \nreach the end of their service life without an operational replacement.\n  The major combat systems that our troops use today are those \ndeveloped and procured during the 1980s and, in some cases, going back \nto the 1950s.\n  The Reagan administration was handed a military that was a hollow \nforce in many respects--low morale, low pay, outdated equipment, and \nunable to maintain the equipment it possessed. Ronald Reagan expanded \nthe military budget, increased troop size, reenergized weapons \nprocurement, and revived our intelligence capabilities, returning this \ncountry to its superpower status. He guaranteed the superiority of the \nU.S. military's weapon systems and capabilities through long-term \ninvestment and ensuring that our troops were provided with the most \nadvanced equipment available.\n  As Secretary Gates said in January 2009, our military must be \nprepared for a ``full spectrum'' of operations, including the type of \ncombat we are facing in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as large-scale \nthreats that we face in places such as North Korea and Iran.\n  By the way, I don't blame Secretary Gates for all of this. He had to \nuse the numbers that the Obama White House gave him.\n  Far too often we have learned the hard way that we don't have a \ncrystal ball to precisely predict what types of national security \nthreats the Nation will face. During a hearing in the House Armed \nServices Committee--this happened when I was on that committee in 1994. \nWe had somebody testify who said that in 10 years we will no longer \nneed ground troops. Look at this. After 7 years engaged in the war on \nterror, we know he was wrong. The strategic environment has become \nincreasingly complex, dynamic, lethal, and uncertain.\n  Today, our military is fighting with equipment that is decades old \nand a force structure that is 40 percent less than what we had in the \n1980s.\n  The Air Force has 2,500 fewer aircraft. The Navy cut its fleet size \nin half; that is down to 300 ships. The Army reduced its force to half \nthe number of divisions it had during the first gulf war.\n  For the past 17 years, our military has been asked to do more with \nmuch less and older equipment. It is taking a toll on our troops. \nUnfortunately, what took less than a decade to field in the 1980s will \nnow take us multiple decades to field. A case in point: The KC-X, which \nwill take up to 30 years to replace. We are using KC-135s for these \ncapabilities. The KC-X program would have modernized that. In the case \nof the KC-135s, some are 50 years old. It gets to the point where the \nmaintenance is more than buying something new.\n  The United States will have to build and sustain military \ncapabilities required to respond to possible future threats across the \nspectrum of conflict, and there are numerous potential threats that \ncould impact our national security.\n  The next war will not be like the last one. We cannot predict. You \ncan talk to smart generals and ask what do we have to pay for 20 years \nfrom now, and they are smart, but they will be wrong, just like the \nguys who said we would no longer need ground troops in 10 years. We \ndon't know.\n  In February of 2009, a marine general wrote to one of the young \nmarines:\n\n       You say the next conflict will be a guerrilla conflict. I \n     say, it depends. In my lifetime, we have been in five big \n     fights and a bunch of little ones. In only one of those \n     five big ones (Desert Storm) had we prepared for the type \n     of war we wound up having to fight. It is one thing to say \n     that a certain type of fight is more or less likely; it is \n     quite another to say it is certain to be one or the other. \n     In war, the only thing that is certain is uncertainty.\n\n  We weren't able to predict the fall of the Soviet Union, the rapid \ngrowth of the ballistic missile capability of North Korea, or the rise \nin asymmetric warfare. We were wrong in all of that. It doesn't matter \nhow great our military leaders or intelligence are, our strategic \nthinking will always be imperfect.\n  In order to provide stability, America must be able to deter or \ndefeat any threat, be it an insurgency or a challenge from a near-peer \ncompetitor.\n  We can no longer afford to fool ourselves that we are sending our \nkids out with the best of equipment. Quite often, I talk to people who \nare really not into this. They are working hard and paying taxes for \nall this fun we are having up here. When you tell them that our kids \nare going out there without the very best of equipment, they are \noutraged. They cannot believe it. Unfortunately, that is the case.\n  Let's do the math that they are so critical of. As I said, we need to \nlook at the total defense budget, everything DOD spends. This includes \nnational defense funds, DOD funds, DOE funds for nuclear ships and \nweapons, and other defense-related items, such as selective service \nsystem, plus the wartime supplemental.\n  First, there is a net loss in defense spending in 2009 of $10.7 \nbillion. President Bush increased the total defense budget in 2009 by \n$37.2 billion. He also approved $65.9 billion in supplemental funds for \nthe first part of fiscal 2009.\n  President Obama's supplemental request for defense spending is only \n$75.5 billion to cover an increase of 21,000 troops in Afghanistan, \nincreased operations in Afghanistan, continued operations in Iraq, and \nthen withdrawing from Iraq. A GOP report on the cost of Iraq withdrawal \nsaid it will be a ``massive and expensive effort''--that costs would \nmore often increase in the near term. What they are saying is that \nthese things were not included in Obama's budget, but we will pay for \nthem anyway. So he comes out with a\n\n[[Page S4417]]\n\nfigure that he says is going to be more costly.\n  They went on to say that the cost of equipment repairs, replacements, \nclosing and turning over 283 military installations in Iraq and moving \ntroops and equipment ``will likely be significant.'' This is what we \ncall the cost of withdrawal.\n  Let's compare 2009 to 2010, where I have been accused of not being \nable to do the math. Defense spending does increase from 2009 to 2010 \nby $14.9 billion. But according to President Obama's letter to Speaker \nPelosi on April 9, there will be no more supplementals.\n  That would mean DOD would have to fund all wartime operations out of \nthe hide of DOD to the tune of about $100 billion plus.\n  However, President Obama does fence off $130 billion for overseas \ncontingency funds, which could be used for getting out of Iraq and \nincreased operations in Afghanistan.\n  Even adding the entire $130 billion to defense spending, which is \nnever the case with supplemental funding, the overall increase in \ndefense spending for 2010 is $3.5 billion.\n  If we estimate 2 percent inflation for cost growth of just the \ndefense budget, defense spending actually decreases by $7.3 billion.\n  Now, add in the accelerated growth of the Army and Marine Corps--a \n65,000 and 22,000 increase, respectively, which will cost approximately \n$13 billion to cover pay and health care costs, and you start to see \nthe beginnings of how our military modernization gets gutted.\n  DOD must pay for personnel, operations and maintenance, ongoing \nwartime and contingency operations. With a zero supplemental fund, the \nmoney to pay for these ``must pays''--the things we have to buy--has to \nbe taken from DOD's base budget, and the areas that are always hit are \nR and acquisition.\n  Look at what is being cut. If you question what I am saying here in \nterms of dropping down the costs, look at the programs we have to have \nthat they are cutting. They are eliminating future combat systems. This \nis something we started putting together 8 years ago--the first \ntransformation of ground operations and capabilities in probably 30 \nyears. The C-17s--we need more of them. They have cut the additional C-\n17s. And the F-22--I am proud that we finally bit the bullet and \nrealized we want to send our kids out in strike vehicles that are \nbetter than the ones they are making in Russia. That is the F-22, the \nfifth generation. They have stopped that.\n  Originally, we were going to have some 750 F-22s. Now they are \nstopping it in this budget at 187. So historical defense spending as a \npercentage of GDP has been 3 percent during the Clinton drawdown; 4.6 \npercent during the gulf war; 6 percent during the Reagan buildup; 8.9 \npercent during the Vietnam war; 11.7 percent during the Korean war; and \nabout 35 percent during World War II.\n  When compared to a sustained annual defense investment of 4 percent \nof the GDP to recapitalize and modernize our military, the 10-year \nproposed Obama defense budget is $1.3 trillion in the red.\n  We have a similar chart that we had here during the Clinton \nadministration. One thing the Obama defense budget guarantees is that \nthe oldest military in the history of the Nation will get older and \nmore expensive to maintain and operate.\n  Ships currently average 18 years; Naval aircraft averages 18 years; \nMarine Corps aircraft, 21 years. Refueling tankers are over 44 years \nold; Air Force fighter aircraft, 19 years old; special operations \naircraft, over 27 years old; and bomber aircraft, over 33 years old.\n  In order to keep 40-year-old KC-135s, as I mentioned a minute ago, in \nthe air, DOD has to reprogram almost $3 billion from the KC-X program \nto repair KC-135s. That means the program that was there to pay for \nmodernizing, to buy new aircraft--the KC-X it is termed--now we are \ndrawing down from that just to repair the old, ancient KC-135s.\n  In the Army, the current fleet of combat vehicles was developed and \nprocured 30 to 60 years ago and is aging at an increasingly rapid rate. \nThe M1 Abrams tank developed in the 1970s and fielded in the eighties \nis currently on its third iteration and update and being used \nextensively on the battlefield.\n  The M2 Bradley fighting vehicle, also developed over 25 years ago, is \non its third significant modification and has been crucial in defending \nour troops against IED and RPG threats in Iraq.\n  Both of these combat-proven vehicles continue to undergo fleetwide \nreset programs because of their rate of use in the war on terror.\n  The oldest combat vehicle in the Army inventory is the Paladin \nHowitzer. This is kind of interesting because this is part of the FCS \nand is the furthest along right now in its development. The Paladin \ntechnology is World War II technology. Every time you fire it, you have \nto get out and swab the breech. There are now five countries, including \nSouth Africa, that make a better cannon than our kids are using.\n  Over 19,000 artillery rounds were shot from the Paladins in Iraq in \n2008; over 27,000 were shot in 2007. Despite some parochial criticism \nin the media and in this Congress, the fact remains that the U.S. Army \nis using a system developed over 50 years ago.\n  By the way, people accuse me of doing something that is parochial. If \nwe look at the footprint that was given by the lead systems integrator, \nit shows Oklahoma in the bottom 20 in terms of getting funding for the \nFCS program.\n  Our artillery soldiers are using this system that has a chassis \ndesign that is a half century old and slated to undergo its seventh \nmodification. Let me say at this point that I believe the defense \nbudget should at the very least continue the PIM Program--the Paladin \nIntegrated Management Program--just to keep those vehicles going. We \nshould keep the FCS on track but don't dump the PIM Program with the \nFCS Program.\n  Even with the implementation of the PIM update, the Army expects to \nkeep the Paladin in use until 2060. That is 100 years on the \nbattlefield. Our Army is long overdue a thorough and comprehensive \nmodernization program instead of throwing billions of dollars toward \nupdating and maintaining decades-old vehicle platforms.\n  The proposed defense budget would cancel the manned vehicle portion \nof the Army's Future Combat System, the modernization program intended \nto replace the Paladin, Abrams, and the Bradley over the next 25 years.\n  The FCS vehicles would bring improved armor, a state-of-the-art \ncommunications network. These are life-and-death issues. These are our \ntroops on the ground being able to have something that is actually \nbetter than our prospective enemies. That is what we are losing in this \ndefense budget.\n  The Air Force: For nearly two decades, our U.S. Air Force has \ndominated the skies to ensure our superiority around the world. \nHowever, the most recent GAO study stated that the Air Sovereignty \nAlert Operations--the post-9/11 operations that protect our homeland--\nare at risk during aging aircraft and insufficient procurement.\n  The Air Force grounded 259 of its 441 F-15 Eagles in November to \nJanuary while it looked into the breakup of an F-15C.\n  Last May, the service parked all 500 of its T-38 trainers. Last \nOctober, the Air Force ordered more than half of the 356 A-10 fighters \nto stay put because of cracks in the wings.\n  While we have enjoyed the benefit of the investment during the 1980s \nof the F-15, F-16, A-10, and the F-117s, the F-117 is now retired and \nthe Air Force will be retiring 137 of the F-15s, 177 of the F-16s, and \nseveral of the A-10s.\n  What we are saying is, we are already shutting down and the only way \nto replace them, if we are going to have a fifth generation strike \nvehicle, is with the F-22. We are supposed to have 750 of these F-22s. \nThis budget stops the line at 187. That means if something comes along \nand we have a more responsible, defense-oriented administration coming \nin, they would have to start up the line, and it will cost much more.\n  This is being done at a time when Secretary Gates told reporters that \nthe intelligence he has seen indicates a Russian fifth generation \nfighter could become operational about 2016, and previous estimates by \nthe Pentagon on China's J-12 fifth generation fighter could be fielded \nby 2020.\n  Increasing the number of F-35s is not going to do it; the functions \nare different; their missions are different.\n\n[[Page S4418]]\n\n  The Navy: At a time when it is being called on to project a presence \nin more parts of the world than ever before, Secretary Gates has \nrecommended the Navy shrink its carrier fleet to 10 aircraft carriers \nby 2012 and delay the acquisition of other portions of the fleet.\n  This reduction of the aircraft carriers goes further below the \nprevious QDR. That is the Quadrennial Defense Review. They stated 20 \ncarriers would be required for moderate risk. When they use ``moderate \nrisk,'' we are talking about lives of our soldiers, sailors, and \nairmen.\n  In the last 3 weeks, we have seen how relevant and important the Navy \nis while watching the various pirate activities off Somalia and some of \nthose activities that are going on now. We did not realize we needed to \ndo that prior to that time. It shows how fluid this is in terms of our \nexpectations and our needs.\n  China, Japan, Australia, India, Malaysia, Pakistan, Indonesia, \nSingapore, Bangladesh, South and North Korea either now have or are \nplanning to acquire submarines to compete with ours.\n  In all, the Navy would be left with less than 300 ships, and that is \nabout half of what it was during the eighties.\n  Missile defense: I am going to run out of time. I should have had \nthis on before. On February 3, we all know, Iran launched a satellite \non the 30th anniversary of the 1979 Islamic revolution, demonstrating \nkey technologies for propulsion, staging, and so forth.\n  Two weeks ago, North Korea furthered their missile and nuclear \ndevelopment by launching the Taepodong 2 missile in the South China \nSea, despite widespread world condemnation. Despite this, the \nadministration has recommended a 16-percent cut in missile defense. It \nis interesting, this would come along right at the time of the 26th \nanniversary when Ronald Reagan put SDI together, recognizing, so \nprophetically when we were going to have a system, the technology to \nhit a bullet with a bullet. We have it now.\n  We told the Czech Republic and Poland that we will be supporting \nthem, putting together a radar and launch system. Now they don't know \nwhat we want because that also has either been delayed or canceled. I \nsuggest it has been canceled.\n  By the way, if Iran develops the capability of doing something from \nIran and aiming toward Western Europe, this is the only safeguard we \nwould have. The Czech Republic and Poland have gone along with us, and \nnow we are pulling the rug out from under them.\n  The last point I wish to make is on the Airborne Laser Program. I \nwish there was time to explain this program. There are three phases. \nYou have the launch phase, midcourse phase, and terminal phase. These \nphases are necessary for a national missile defense system.\n  I agree we need to do something on the acquisition processes. We have \nbeen trying to do it for a long period of time. However, acquisition \nreform should be done in conjunction with, not in lieu of, modernizing \nand properly equipping our Armed Forces to dominate across the full \nspectrum of warfare.\n  I have stated many times in this Chamber that the greatest trust \nplaced in Congress by the American people is to provide for their \nsecurity by maintaining a strong national defense. We can avoid this \nfar too frequent debate on defense budgeting by assuring a minimal \nlevel of funding for our military.\n  I believe when you talk to the average man on the street as to what \nis the primary function of Government, that function should be to \ndefend America, and that is the threat we are facing now. Somehow this \nhas taken a back seat to what we are supposed to be doing.\n  As the Congress considers the administration's budget recommendations \nin the coming weeks, we have to ask several questions: Are the forces \nbeing provided to our commanders in the field postured to counter the \nfull spectrum of threats? Are we providing our troops with the best and \nmost capable equipment available? Certainly we are not today. And can \nwe afford to kick the can down the road further? The answer is a \nresounding no.\n  Finally, the total cost for 2010 to reach this expectation would \nrequire an increase of $28 billion in 2010. With the Obama budget of \nsocial welfare that will triple the public debt in 10 years, we have \nalready spent almost $2 trillion. Mr. President, the $700 billion of a \nbank bailout we now know is Tim Geithner's plan to start with, and in \nOctober of 2008, we gave $700 billion to an unelected bureaucrat to do \nwith as he wished with no oversight whatsoever.\n  I have to say this is the time when we look at the amount of money \nthat is being spent on all the social welfare programs and say: Why not \ndefend America? Clearly, that is not the primary goal of this \nadministration.\n  I think my fellow Oklahoma Congressman, Tom Cole, said it best. He \nsaid: President Obama's charm and eloquence is no substitute for a \nstrong national defense.\n  I believe that is right. I hope we have a chance to relook at this \nand make adjustments.\n  I also remind the administration, you can come out with all these \ncuts, cutting the F-22s and the Future Combat System and the C-17s and \nthe national missile defense system, but that still has to go through. \nAnd thank God we have three branches of Government so we will be able \nto get the House Armed Services Committee and the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee to review this and try to put America back in a position \nwhere its primary goal is to defend America. That is what this is all \nabout.\n\n\n                        EPA Endangerment Finding\n\n  I am very troubled by the EPA proposed endangerment finding that will \nunleash a torrent of regulations that will destroy jobs, harm \nconsumers, and extend the Agency's reach into every corner of American \nlife. Despite enormous expense and hardship for the American economy, \nthese regulations will have virtually no effect on climate change.\n  It now appears EPA's regulatory reach will find its way into schools, \nhospitals, assisted living facilities, and just about any activity that \nmeets minimum thresholds in the Clean Air Act. Representative John \nDingell was right: the endangerment finding will produce a ``glorious \nmess.'' ``It is worth noting that the solution to this ``glorious \nmess'' is not for Congress to pass cap-and-trade legislation, which \nreplaces one very bad approach with another.\n  Congress should pass a simple, narrowly targeted bill that stops EPA \nin its tracks.\n\n\n                           gun treaty support\n\n  Next, we discovered that President Obama, in his announcement last \nweek, plans to urge the Senate to ratify the Inter-American Convention \nAgainst the Illicit Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, \nAmmunition, Explosives, and Other Related Materials, known by the \nacronym CIFTA.\n  The idea that American-manufactured firearms are responsible for the \ngrowing violence in Mexico is not grounded in reality, but the Obama \nadministration is using this violence as justification to require \nstricter licensing requirements and markings on firearms by U.S. \nmanufacturers. The majority of the gun violence that is occurring in \nthe drug wars in Mexico is the result of assault weapons, including \nfully automatic versions, which are not even available for sale in the \nUnited States. Many of these weapons are coming from other countries in \nCentral and South America and deserters from the Mexican military.\n  I am strongly opposed to placing more stringent requirements on U.S. \ngun manufacturers, especially when the evidence shows that they are not \nthe problem. This is an instance of the Obama administration using \nalternative means to place greater regulations on the manufacture and \nsale of legal firearms in the United States. I believe that my \ncolleagues in the Senate understand this to be the case and will do as \nthey have for the last 10 years and not ratify this treaty.\n\n\n       Letter to DHS Expressing Outrage over Controversial Report\n\n  I was shocked to learn of a new report by the Department of Homeland \nSecurity entitled ``Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political \nClimate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment'' which \nclassifies the brave men and women returning home from combat and \noperational deployments around\n\n[[Page S4419]]\n\nthe globe, who have been honorably defending our country, as potential \nterrorists.\n  As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, I am \nespecially proud of our soldiers returning home, and I find it \nextremely regretful that they have been subjected to such an insult by \nthis report. Furthermore, I find it reprehensible that within this \nreport Americans who hold certain beliefs regarding issues such as \nimmigration, the second amendment, and abortion fall under the report's \nbroad generalization of rightwing extremists, and are, therefore, \nconsidered a potential threat. I believe this report to be very \noffensive to many Americans.\n  As a result, I joined Senators Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, David Vitter \nof Louisiana, Sam Brownback of Kansas, Jim DeMint of South Carolina, \nRichard Burr of North Carolina, and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska to send a \nletter to Secretary Janet Napolitano expressing concerns.\n\n\n                             david hamilton\n\n  Mr. President, I am not impressed with President Obama's judiciary \nand Department of Justice nominees. Eric Holder, David Ogden, Dawn \nJohnsen, Elena Kagan, and Thomas Perelli are all extreme liberals in \ntheir views on everything from the second amendment to abortion to \npornography and obscenity. I applauded when President Obama kept \nSecretary Gates on as his Defense Secretary, and I really hoped that he \nwould choose other individuals who were at least moderate in their \npolitical ideology, but that just has not been the case.\n  Just prior to recess, my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee \nboycotted the nomination hearing of David Hamilton to sit on the \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals. A hearing was scheduled a mere 2 \nweeks after the announcement of his nomination. Senator Specter and \nseven of my other Republican colleagues requested another hearing after \nthe spring recess, citing a Senate rule that allows a majority of the \nminority side of the committee to request a followup. Many remember \nDavid Hamilton because of his 2005 decision as a Federal district court \njudge presiding over the case Hinrichs v. Bosmah, in which he enjoined \nthe Speaker of Indiana's House of Representatives from permitting \n``sectarian'' prayers to be offered as part of that body's official \nproceedings, meaning that the chaplain or whomever opened the \nproceedings with prayer could not invoke the name of Jesus Christ. In \nhis conclusion, Hamilton wrote: ``If the Speaker chooses to continue \nany form of legislative prayer, he shall advise persons offering such a \nprayer (a) that it must be nonsectarian and must not be used to \nproselytize or advance any one faith or belief or to disparage any \nother faith or belief, and (b) that they should refrain from using \nChrist's name or title or any other denominational appeal.'' Further, \nruling on a postjudgment motion, Hamilton stated that invoking the name \nof ``Allah'' would not advance a particular religion or disparage \nanother. So, praying to Allah would be perfectly acceptable. I find \nthis line of reasoning to be insane. Who in this body would not \nidentify the name of ``Allah'' with the religion of Islam any less than \nthey would identify the name of Jesus with Christianity? But I believe \nthese are the kind of opinions we may see coming from the Seventh \nCircuit if David Hamilton is confirmed. I understand that Judge \nHamilton's nomination is still pending before the Judiciary Committee, \nbut I had to come to the floor to speak so that the American people, \nwho are very concerned about this nomination, will know that I and my \nRepublican colleagues on the Judiciary Committee are taking interest \nand are not just going to let this nomination sail through. In fact I \nwill filibuster David Hamilton.\n  I would also like to speak for a moment on a couple of the nominees \nthat we will be voting on this evening. Tony West, the nominee for \nAssistant Attorney General for the Civil Division served as cocounsel \nfor John Walker Lindh. As you all know, Lindh joined the Taliban and \nfought against our very own American soldiers in the liberation of \nAfghanistan. Lindh is a traitor and terrorist, but after a plea deal \nthat Mr. West helped obtain, he is only serving 20 years in prison.\n  Lanny Breuer, the Assistant Attorney General nominee for the Criminal \nDivision, helped obtain a great plea deal for Sandy Berger, who \nadmitted to stealing classified documents from the National Archives. \nHe received a $50,000 fine, probation, and community service. I \nunderstand that every criminal defendant is entitled to representation \nand that it was the duty of these men to vigorously represent their \nclients' interests, but it is also the choice of this administration \nwho they nominate to these positions, and I truly believe that better \nchoices could have been made.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     The Pentagon's New Priorities\n\n       Defense Secretary Robert Gates, a man not known for having \n     his head in the stars, announced his strategic Pentagon \n     blueprint this week, saying his proposals ``will profoundly \n     reform how this department does business.'' We hope he \n     informed Congress, home to 535 procurers in chief.\n       The Defense procurement system is a mess, and previous \n     Pentagon reforms have faltered thanks mostly to the \n     micromanagers on Capitol Hill who are often more interested \n     in funneling money to their home states than in spending \n     dollars most effectively. Democrats and Republicans both \n     belly up to this bar, usually while castigating the executive \n     branch for failing to make ``tough choices.''\n       So give the Defense Secretary an A for optimistic effort, \n     even if we have our disagreements with some of his strategic \n     choices. In announcing his spending priorities, Mr. Gates \n     said he wants to focus on the current wars in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan, rather than on the unknown wars of the future. \n     Among his cuts are the Army's Future Combat Systems and a \n     gold-plated new Presidential helicopter that is late and way \n     over budget. Meanwhile, he added money for unmanned aerial \n     vehicles, increased the number of special forces and \n     announced plans to recruit more cyberwarfare experts.\n       These seem like reasonable judgment calls, and the focus on \n     combating asymmetrical threats will help the U.S. in Iraq and \n     Afghanistan. But it's worth remembering that the reason our \n     enemies have resorted to terrorism and insurgency is because \n     U.S. conventional forces overwhelmingly dominate on the \n     ground, in the sea and in the air.\n       That's not an advantage we can take for granted as the \n     Clinton Administration did in the 1990s, when it slashed \n     defense spending to 3% from nearly 5% of GDP. China and \n     Russia are upgrading their conventional forces, and China in \n     particular is aiming to build a navy that can neutralize U.S. \n     forces in the Western Pacific.\n       Mr. Gate's strategy implies a shrinking Navy with fewer \n     ships and perhaps one fewer carrier group. It's good that he \n     wants to build more Littoral Combat Ships, which are handy \n     for operations such as tracing pirates. Even so, the Navy is \n     left with a fleet of fewer than 300 ships, which strikes us \n     as perilously small. When a U.S.-flagged container ship \n     was briefly taken by pirates off Somalia this week, the \n     Navy's nearest vessel was hours away.\n       Mr. Gates's decision to kill the stealthy F-22 fighter jet, \n     which outclasses everything in the sky, is also troubling. We \n     already have 183 F-22s--original plans called for 750--and \n     Mr. Gates wants to order just four more before shutting down \n     the production line. His proposal to double the number of F-\n     35 Joint Strike Fighters and Pentagon buys next year--to 30 \n     from 14 in 2009--is no quid pro quo. The F-35 is a cheaper, \n     more multipurpose plane but it can't begin to compete with \n     the F-22 as a fighter jet.\n       Pentagon spending is now about 4% of GDP and is expected to \n     decline, which means too little investment against potential \n     threats. In particular, Mr. Gates's budget priorities give no \n     indication of how the Pentagon will ensure that U.S. military \n     dominance extends to the battlefield of the future, outer \n     space. President Obama has said he opposes the \n     ``militarization of space,'' but space is already a crucial \n     area of operations and China is looking for advantages there.\n       The $1.4 billion in cuts to missile defense are especially \n     worrisome, with losers including the Airborne Laser, designed \n     to shoot down ballistic missiles in the boost phase, and \n     additional interceptors planned for the ground-based system \n     in Alaska. Instead, Mr. Gates favors theater defenses for \n     soldiers on the battlefield with $700 million more in \n     funding, arguing that this will address the near-term threat \n     of short-range missiles. But as North Korea's weekend launch \n     showed, rogue regimes aren't far away from securing long-\n     range missiles that could reach the U.S.\n       Mr. Gates shrewdly made no budget recommendations on \n     nuclear forces, except to say that he'll defer judgment until \n     after the forthcoming Nuclear Posture Review. Perhaps he's \n     counting on being able to change President Obama's mind on \n     the need for updating U.S. strategic weapons and going \n     forward with the Reliable Replacement Warhead for America's \n     aging nuclear arsenal.\n       Mr. Gates's budget proposals now go to Congress. Since the \n     end of World War II there have been more than 130 studies on \n     procurement reform. Good luck.\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum. I ask unanimous consent that the time in a quorum call be \nequally divided between both sides.\n\n[[Page S4420]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I wish to speak about S. 386, the Fraud \nEnforcement and Recovery Act, which Senator Leahy and others will bring \nto the floor of the Senate. It is astounding to me that a piece of \nlegislation that provides and strengthens the Justice Department and \ninvestigative agencies with the ability to go after fraud and recovery \nwith respect to this financial collapse--even something that is \nbipartisan and is so fundamental--is now subject to a filibuster.\n  Think of it: You can't do anything around here without there being a \nfilibuster. We have to file a cloture petition and ask that it ripen \nfor 2 days and then do 30 hours postcloture. It is unbelievable. It \ndemonstrates, unfortunately, an inability of the majority to get things \ndone because of a minority deciding it wants to filibuster everything.\n  But look, this legislation authorizes substantial funding to \nstrengthen the ability of the Justice Department, the FBI, and other \ninvestigative agencies to fight fraud.\n  This money, well spent, will recapture that amount of money many \ntimes over in the pursuit of financial fraud. If anyone who is reading \nthe papers and watching television and seeing what is happening in the \nfinancial crisis in this country believes that there ought not be \nsubstantial, enhanced investigative capabilities by the Justice \nDepartment to go after fraud and to prosecute where they find fraud, \nthey must be living on a different planet. This reforms the statutes \nthat deal with fraud and with money laundering.\n  Senator Leahy and others have put together a bill that I believe will \nsubstantially improve the capability to prosecute financial crimes. I \nthink most Americans will be surprised to learn that taxpayers' funds \nexpended under what is called the TARP funds in the economic stimulus \npackage are not necessarily protected under the Federal fraud statutes. \nBy the same token, Federal fraud statutes presently do not include \nmortgage lending businesses that are not directly regulated or insured \nby the Federal Government. These companies, by the way, were \nresponsible for nearly half of the residential mortgages before the \neconomic collapse. Yet they remain largely unregulated. This piece of \nlegislation would begin to address that.\n  Let me give some examples of what has happened and what continues to \nhappen. This is something that is on the Internet today. You see all \nthe financial collapse we have had in this country caused by bad \nmortgages, subprime mortgages. You can go to the Internet and find \nthis:\n\n       CC Financial Group, working together to build your \n     dreams. You have bad credit, poor credit, good credit, we can \n     get you into your dream home.\n\n  They are advertising: If you have bad credit, we will loan you some \nmoney and get you a dream home. It is unbelievable.\n  They say:\n\n       With the fantastic values that are available today due to \n     foreclosures and short sales, now is the time to get into \n     your own home. Come to us, we will get you some money.\n\n  It is exactly the same thing that steered this country into a ditch \nin the first place.\n  This on the Internet today, called ``Speedy Bad Credit Loans.'' Is \nthat unbelievable? That is unbelievable to me, a company called Speedy \nBad Credit Loans. Shame on them.\n  This says:\n\n       Bad credit mortgage--bad credit? OK. No credit? OK. \n     Bankruptcy? No problem. No downpayments, no delays.\n\n  Shame on them.\n  But it is not just these fly-by-night fleabags that are running these \nschemes. What was the biggest mortgage company in the country? \nCountrywide--Countrywide mortgage, the biggest mortgage company in \nAmerica. Here is what they said in the middle of the subprime scandal:\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? \n     Call us.\n\n  ``Call us,'' they said--the biggest mortgage lender in the country.\n  There were mortgage companies willing to lend you money with no \nprincipal payment. You just pay interest; or if you can't pay interest \nand no principal, then just part of the interest and they will put the \nrest of it on the back of the loan; or no principal and just part of \nthe interest, but you don't have to pay anything for the first 12 \nmonths because they will make the first 12 months' payments for you.\n  If you want to get a loan without having to document your income--\nthey call it a ``no doc'' loan, a no-documentation loan--you don't have \nto document what your income is. By the way, don't worry about making \npayments anytime soon because we will give you a loan no matter what. \nThen if it doesn't work out, your home value is going to increase and \nyou can sell it off for a profit. Good for you.\n  This is a shameful display of what is going on in the marketplace. \nCountrywide, of course, went belly-up. The folks who ran it got off \nwith a couple hundred million dollars, we are told. In the meantime, go \nto the Internet and see if it is still going on.\n  This legislation being brought to the floor of the Senate is \nbipartisan legislation that reforms the statutes that deal with some of \nthese issues, to say: Stop it. You cannot do this stuff anymore.\n  There is a lot of work to do in investigating and cracking down on \nfinancial fraud, including mortgage fraud. The bill we are considering \nthis week is going to go a long way toward that effort. This bill is \ngoing to give law enforcement the investigators they need, the \nprosecutors the resources they need. It is supported by the National \nFraternal Order of Police, Taxpayers Against Fraud, Federal Law \nEnforcement Officers Association, National Association of Assistant \nU.S. Attorneys, and the National Association of Certified Fraud \nExaminers.\n  Finally, let me just say that I am going to be talking to the \nchairman of the committee. I have a couple of suggestions for \namendments. One will be a sense of the Senate to establish an economic \nor financial crisis task force in the Justice Department, a multiagency \ntask force that goes after these kinds of crimes. Second, I want to \ntalk to the chairman of the committee and with my colleagues as well \nabout a Senate select committee to investigate the cause of the \neconomic crisis. That is a piece of legislation I introduced with \nSenator McCain a couple of months ago. I want to visit with my \ncolleagues, Senator Dodd, the chairman of the Banking Committee on \nthis, and Senator Reid, of course, and Senator Leahy. I think all of \nthese things need to be discussed.\n  I especially wanted to say that the underlying bill brought to the \nfloor of the Senate has great merit. I hope this week we will be able \nto finish work on this bill. It will make this country a better place \nby holding accountable those who have been engaged, in my judgment, in \nsome cases, in some high crimes. The American people have paid a very \nstiff price for that activity. I think it needs to be investigated and \nprosecuted aggressively.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                     north dakota natural disasters\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I would like to take a few minutes to \nspeak on the unfolding crisis in my State with respect to record \nflooding all across North Dakota.\n  We are facing something unseen in recorded history in the State of \nNorth Dakota. From east to west, from north to south, there is massive \nflooding, never seen before in all of recorded history. The eyes of the \nNation have been on our State.\n  As I have said many times in North Dakota, people across the country \nhave liked what they have seen about the response of the people of \nNorth Dakota. In Fargo, a town of 90,000, the mayor said we have 80,000 \nvolunteers. That is exactly what it has been like--all across the \nState, thousands of people coming out, neighbors helping neighbors, \nhelping to protect their homes, helping to protect the community. There \nwas an outpouring of volunteer effort I have never seen before.\n\n[[Page S4421]]\n\n  Several weeks ago, I was home with General Walsh, who is the \ncommandant of the Mississippi River Division of the Corps of Engineers, \nthe chief flood fighter for that part of the country. We walked into \nthe FARGODOME, which is a place where NDSU--North Dakota State \nUniversity--plays its football games, and there were thousands of \nvolunteers filling sandbags. There were 3 million sandbags made in just \na few days--3 million sandbags--by tens of thousands of volunteers \nworking around the clock. I went into that FARGODOME, and it was \ninspirational to see the efforts of people to protect their homes and \ntheir community.\n  By the way, it was not just in Fargo, it was every town up and down \nthe Red River Valley, every town up and down the Cheyenne River Valley, \nevery town up and down the James River Valley, every town up and down \nthe Missouri River Valley, every town up and down the Souris River \nValley, because this was flooding on a scale never seen before.\n  In the midst of it all, in my hometown, here was the newspaper \nheadline: ``A Double Shot of Blizzard and Flooding.'' These two people \nyou can perhaps see here are wading knee-deep through ice and water. \nThis is very close to where I grew up. Ultimately, they had demolition \nteams come in and blow up the ice because logjams were forming and \nwater was being forced into the southern part of my hometown, which is \nthe capital city of North Dakota.\n  Well, that was Bismarck, ND. Here is the headline from the Fargo \nForum at about the same time: ``Race Against Time Spring Flood 2009.''\n  This is a shot of water completely surrounding this particular home \nand volunteers using shovels to keep the sand moving into funnels to \nfill the sandbags around the clock in Fargo, ND.\n  This is the headline from Grand Fork, ND, that was so badly flooded \nin 1997. There we had a 100-year flood, perhaps a 200-year flood. You \nwill recall that was the flood that was fought in the midst of a \nblizzard after the worst winter storm in 50 years. This is from Fargo, \nwith the headline: ``Fear Is Setting In.''\n  This shows people in winter garb placing sandbags on top of \nsnowbanks. This is the kind of conditions that people were confronting, \nfighting massive flooding days in the midst of some of the biggest snow \nstorms in our State's history.\n  Here are some of the headlines that appeared: ``Records Fall in Snow \nStorm;'' ``Minot Sets December Snowfall Record, 24 Inches in One \nMonth;'' ``Looks Like A Record December In Grand Forks, 90-Year-Old \nRecord Broken There With 29 Inches of Snow;'' ``December 2008, Snowiest \nMonth on Books In Fargo-Moorehead;'' ``Fargo Nears Record December \nSnowfall.''\n  This is the news from one end of our State to another. So many people \nhave asked me: How did this happen? How could it be that you have \nflooding unprecedented in recorded history?\n  Well, as we try to reconstruct events this past fall, precipitation \nin the eastern part of the State was 2 to 300 percent of average, \nresulting in the wettest fall on record.\n  Soil observations taken just prior to the freeze-up revealed nearly \nsaturated moisture levels in the upper 8 inches of soil across the Red \nRiver Valley. Then the onset of winter came very abruptly. The quick, \nhard freeze occurring with minimal snow cover and saturated soil \nmoisture conditions allowed the frost to quickly penetrate the ground \nto a level of 2 feet.\n  Then, in December, the cities from west to east across the State had \nrecord snowfalls. Over the past 2 months, areas of North Dakota have \nhad 150 to 300 percent of normal precipitation. In fact, the city of \nFargo saw both record rainfall and record snowfall in the month of \nMarch.\n  Who could have believed it? I was in the little town of Linton, ND. I \nwas with the mayor; I was with the sheriff. They told me they were \nexpecting pretty much normal flooding. Then they got hit by 2 inches of \nrain. That 2 inches of rain brought that snow off the hills surrounding \nthe town, flooded 50 of the homes of people who lived on largely fixed \nincomes, who have been devastated by these developments. And it is not \njust in the Red River Valley; as I have indicated earlier, it is all \nacross North Dakota in a way that is unprecedented. In my adult life I \nhave never seen anything like it.\n  This is the little town of Pembina, ND. I landed there last week. I \nlanded on an airstrip completely surrounded by water--completely \nsurrounded by water. The only thing that was not covered by water was \nthe airstrip itself, and the people I was with, as they were landing, \nsaid to the pilot: Boy, it gives you an eerie sense. It feels as if you \nare landing in the middle of the ocean. That is really what it felt \nlike.\n  That is Pembina. But we have seen it in town after town. Here in \nValley City, the sewer system failed. The sewer system, under this \nincredible water pressure, broke down. Here is the headline: ``Shutdown \nContinues. Nonessential Businesses Ordered Closed. Porta-Potties Dot \nThe City.''\n  Well, part of this has a humorous note to it. But I tell you, not if \nyou are in that town and you have been asked to shut down, if you are a \nnonessential business, the mayor has asked thousands of people to do a \nvoluntary evacuation because of a catastrophic breakdown in the \nsanitary sewer system on Friday morning. That is this last Friday.\n  I just talked to the mayor, Mayor Mary Lee Nielson, by the way, who \nhas provided outstanding leadership in that community. But you talk \nabout a community that has been dealt a tough hand. You can see work \ncrews out from the public works department, National Guardsmen out \ntrying to contain the damage, and they have done an outstanding job. \nBut now the mayor has said to stop using water in that community, stop \nusing water. ``Valley City Sanitary Sewer System Has Failed.'' \nBasements are filling with sewage. The newspaper has had sewage come \ninto its location, the police station as well.\n  But I can tell you, this is when you really measure the character of \npeople, and the people of my State are proving their grit and their \ndetermination because they keep on fighting and they have just done an \nincredible job of taking on this crisis.\n  We have so many communities that have been hit. Here the headline is: \n``Valley City Residents Urged To Get Out.'' This is a town of 8,000 or \n9,000 people. You can imagine having to make the decision to ask people \nto leave.\n  Here is a little town, the town of Kathryn. It had to be cleared out, \ncompletely evacuated, a small town, less than 100 people. It had to be \nevacuated because a dam above the town was getting ready to break. To \nwatch what they have done to fight this effort is absolutely \nfascinating because they brought in not regular sandbags, they have \nbrought in 1-ton sandbags, sandbags bigger than anything I have ever \nseen before.\n  Here is a picture of the helicopter. These sandbags are 1-ton \nsandbags, each of them weighing 2,000 pounds. They were used to drop \ninto this failing dam. That is the kind of effort that has been \nunderway here. This is an eight-bag sling load that was destined for \nClausen Springs, which is the dam that threatened the entire community \nof Kathryn, ND.\n  Not only have people and homes and communities been so adversely \naffected, farm families in many cases cannot get out. Here is a \nfarmstead, and you can see it is completely surrounded by water. Here \nis a big tractor coming out to try to help these people, and you can \nsee their place is completely surrounded by water.\n  Again, it is certainly families and communities, but it is also \nlivestock. The estimates are now that we have lost nearly 100,000 head \nof livestock in North Dakota; 100,000 cows and calves have died. They \nthink 80 percent of the deaths are young calves. This is calving \nseason. I talked to one rancher. He was beside himself. He just came \nback from the fields, digging through snow banks trying to rescue \nlittle calves.\n  Here are cows from one farmstead. You see them trying to swim against \nthe current. Some were able to make it, some not. As we indicated, some \n100,000 head of livestock has been lost, and 80 percent of the calves. \nThis looks like a calf right here. And you can imagine, look at the \npower of that current. These cattle are trapped, in many cases, in a \nway that there was no place to escape.\n\n[[Page S4422]]\n\n  I bring this to the attention of the Senate because already \ntremendous assistance has been extended to my State. The President \ndeclared an emergency in record time. He has also provided individual \nassistance, which has already helped hundreds and hundreds of families \nin our State. Many more will need assistance. The roads, bridges, and \nhighways in my State have been devastated by this flooding; again, the \nworst in recorded history. And what is most stunning about it is the \nextent of it.\n  Typically, flooding in my State has been up and down the Red River. \nBut this time every river system in our State--the Cheyenne, the Red, \nthe Souris, the James, the Missouri, all of them--has been badly hit. \nThousands and thousands of people are adversely affected, thousands of \npeople forced from their homes, and hundreds and hundreds of homes \nlost, devastated, destroyed.\n  North Dakota is an agricultural State. This is the time normally you \nwould be planting crops to be harvested in the fall. But, obviously, \nwhen the farmland is flooded you cannot plant. So we are going to see \nthis unfolding disaster continue to hurt the people of my State, \ncertainly the economy of my State, because we are not going to plant.\n  In many parts of the State perhaps you cannot get a crop at all this \nyear. The ground is going to simply be too wet. So we are going to need \ncontinuing assistance. That is one reason I am glad in the last farm \nbill we provided for permanent disaster assistance for circumstances \njust like this one.\n\n  I also want to thank the thousands of volunteers across North Dakota \nwho came out to help in this crisis--the National Guard, thousands of \nsoldiers deployed all across our State. I thank them for their \nincredible performance. I thank the Corps of Engineers for building \nhundreds and hundreds of miles of dikes that have so far saved \ncommunity after community across North Dakota.\n  Thanks to FEMA for being there and setting up disaster assistance \nthat has already provided substantial sums to individual families who \nhave been hard hit. Thanks to the local officials who have headed up \nthe flood fight, and the mayors, the county commissioners all across \nNorth Dakota who have performed so admirably. Thanks to the State \nleadership for what they have done to coordinate the flood fight and do \nso effectively.\n  This is a disaster that is still unfolding. We pray for the families \nwho are affected. They are very much in our hearts and minds, and we \nare thinking about what can be done to help them; first, win the fight, \nand then recover from these series of disasters.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank my colleagues for the many who have called \nme and written me and spoken to me in the halls and pledged that they \nwould be willing to help our people at a time of such need. I thank the \nMembers of the House of Representatives who similarly have reached out \nto us, and thanks certainly to the Obama administration. I want to \nthank Janet Napolitano, the head of Homeland Security who has been so \nresponsive. Thanks to Rahm Emanuel, the President's Chief of Staff. I \nwant to thank the President himself for meeting with us to get a \nfirsthand report and for again turning around disaster aid in record \ntime at a time when our State really needed it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would say to the Senator from North Dakota that all \nof us have noticed the courage of his constituents, the citizens of \nNorth Dakota, and we admire that courage and their resilience in the \nface of such adversity.\n  Senator Corker and I saw this same thing in the faces of the men and \nwomen in Murfreesboro, TN, who were suddenly hit with a tornado in the \nspringtime. While the size of the disaster was not comparable to the \nsize of the disaster in North Dakota, it was to those families of that \nkind of disaster. So I appreciate his comments and our thoughts and \nprayers go out to the families in North Dakota.\n\n\n                  Association of American Universities\n\n  About 1 hour ago I spoke to the Association of American Universities, \nwhich is a group which includes many of our finest public and private \nresearch universities, some of them in the State of North Carolina, I \nmight note.\n  I would like to say to my colleagues on the Senate floor and to our \ncountry what I said to them in a private meeting. I told them that not \nlong ago a few of us in the Senate had supper in the majority leader's \noffice with former Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who \nwas completing a year as a scholar-in-residence at the Library of \nCongress.\n  One of us asked Dr. Cardoso what memory he would take back to Brazil \nabout his time in the United States.\n  He replied unhesitatingly:\n\n       The American university. The greatness and the autonomy of \n     the American university. There is nothing in the world quite \n     like it.\n\n  The United States doesn't only have the best universities in the \nworld, it has almost all the best universities in the world. A recent \nranking by Jiao Tong University in Shanghai ranks 35 universities among \nthe top 50 in the world, 8 among the top 10. Higher education, says \ncommentator Fareed Zakaria, is America's best industry. Along with our \nnational laboratories, managed by the Department of Education, our \nresearch universities have been our secret weapon in developing many of \nthe competitive advantages that make possible the high American \nstandard of living. In the midst of our pride about our universities, I \nsuggest we remember the warning George Romney, then president of \nAmerican Motors, gave Detroit's automakers a half century ago:\n\n       Nothing is more vulnerable than entrenched success.\n\n  At that time, the big three automakers didn't just make the best cars \nin the world, they made almost all the best cars. But the automakers \ndidn't listen to George Romney. We know the rest of the story. The \nJapanese and others perfected smaller, fuel-efficient cars, and today \nwe are bailing out the automakers that didn't listen. American higher \neducation today would do well to heed George Romney's warning of 50 \nyears ago, and so should the rest of us, since our country's success \ndepends so much upon the quality of our colleges and universities as \nwell as upon our access to them. I suggest, therefore, we begin by \naddressing our research universities. I propose that the national \nacademies assemble a distinguished group of Americans to assess the \ncompetitive position of American research universities, both public and \nprivate, and then respond to the following question: What are the top \n10 actions, in priority order, that Congress, State governments, and \nthe universities themselves could take to assure the ability of the \nAmerican research university to maintain the excellence needed to help \nthe United States compete, prosper, and be secure in the global \ncommunity of the 21st century?\n  I hope this proposal sounds familiar. It is a narrower version of the \nrequest I, along with a bipartisan group of Senators and Congressmen, \nmade in 2005, when we asked the national academies to respond to this \nquestion: What are the top 10 actions, in priority order, that Federal \npolicymakers could take to enhance the science and technology \nenterprise so the United States can successfully compete, prosper, and \nbe secure in the global community of the 21st century?\n  The academies responded to that request by creating a distinguished \ncommission, headed by Norman Augustine, which reported within 10 weeks \nfrom its first gathering a list of 20 recommendations, along with \nstrategies to achieve them. That report was entitled ``Rising Above the \nGathering Storm.'' After a great deal of bipartisan work in this \nChamber and in the House, Congress and the President produced the \nAmerica COMPETES Act of 2007, which included many of the Augustine \nCommission recommendations and established a blueprint for maintaining \nAmerica's competitive position.\n  That blueprint provided a helpful basis for additional funding that \nbecame available earlier this year.\n  I can still remember the afternoon in the spring of 2005, when I sat \nthrough a long Senate Budget Committee meeting. What was bothering me \nmost and\n\n[[Page S4423]]\n\nwhat I heard that day was that the uncontrolled growth of entitlement \nprograms--mainly Medicare and Medicaid--would squeeze out essential \ninvestments in education and research critical to the Nation's \nprosperity. I had seen this as well during the 1980s, when I was \nGovernor of Tennessee, as I struggled, as has almost every Governor \nsince, to pay the growing cost of Medicaid, as well as prisons and \npublic schools, and still have funds left to support quality in higher \neducation. Those struggles have become a losing battle for public \nuniversities.\n  My own research shows that over 6 years, between 2000 and 2006, total \nState higher education funding has gone up 17 percent, while average \ntuition at public 4-year institutions has gone up 63 percent, and State \nfunding for Medicaid has gone up 62 percent.\n  In a 2003 study of funding of public universities, Thomas J. Kane and \nPeter Orszag, now Director of the Office of Management and Budget in \nthe Obama administration--and he spoke to this same group of university \npresidents this morning--suggested the quality of students and the \ncompensation of faculty has declined significantly at public \nuniversities relative to private universities. They concluded:\n\n       Taken together, the results suggest a startling and \n     troubling deterioration of the relative quality of public \n     universities. The most recent set of state budget cutbacks, \n     if anything, will accelerate this trend . . . as a result, \n     the traditional model of higher education finance in the \n     [United States] with large state subsidies to public higher \n     education and modest means tests grants and loans from the \n     federal government is becoming increasingly untenable.\n\n  The recent stimulus package with support for higher education offers \nsome relief but only temporary. Here is how Tennessee Gov. Phil \nBredesen described the situation in his budget address on March 23. The \nGovernor said:\n\n       Higher education presents a challenge. Under the rules we \n     have been given, they are getting a lot of the Tennessee \n     stimulus money;\n\n  He means higher education.\n\n       they not only won't have to make cuts, but cuts they have \n     already taken in Tennessee have been restored; about $100 \n     million extra in this fiscal year. Yet when this money ends \n     21 months from now, our campuses will suddenly need to begin \n     operating with about $180 million less in state funding than \n     they had this year. More than most other areas, higher \n     education has dodged a bullet and [they have] bought some \n     time, but there is a great deal of work to be done to \n     recognize and streamline for a much leaner future . . .\n\n  That was about 2 weeks ago. I considered asking that this new \nnational academies report be only about the pressures on public \nresearch universities, but that would have set up competing \nrecommendations and presented an incomplete picture. Private \nuniversities have their challenges, too, especially during this \nrecession. But the changing role of State support for public research \nuniversities and its impact on quality deserves special attention in \nthe report I am suggesting. I also believe a portion of the academies' \nassessment should include the relationship or lack of relationship of \nour research universities to our 17 Department of Energy national \nlaboratories, which employ more than 30,000 scientists. These labs, \nthree of which were founded during the Manhattan Project in World War \nII, are also secret weapons in our Nation's strive for competitiveness. \nI have seen firsthand how the alliance between the University of \nTennessee Knoxville and the Oak Ridge National Laboratory has produced \njoint professorships, distinguished scientists, centers of excellence, \nand a thriving science alliance between the two campuses.\n  During the next few days, I will meet with National Academy of \nSciences President Ralph Cicerone and discuss with him creating a \nformal bipartisan letter of request to the national academies and how \nthe academies will respond to that request.\n  One way Congress could improve the quality of higher education is to \nstop overregulating. I voted against the new higher education bill \nenacted by Congress last summer because, after 3 years of work, the \nSenate spewed forth a well-intentioned contraption of unnecessary rules \nand regulations that wastes time and money that ought to be spent \ninstead on students and improving quality. At the close of the debate, \nI carried onto the Senate floor--to be accurate, I asked my staff to \nbring on the floor and some of the pages--a stack of boxes as tall as I \nam that contained the rules and regulations for the 6,000 higher \neducation institutions that accept Federal grants and loans. Senator \nMikulski, who has agreed to work with me to try to reduce the number of \nthese regulations, came over and stood by the stack, and the stack was \na foot taller than she.\n  The former president of Stanford has estimated that these regulations \ncost institutions--from Harvard to the University of North Carolina to \nDuke to Vanderbilt to the University of Tennessee and the Nashville \nAuto Diesel College--7 cents for each Federal dollar to do the busy \nwork to fill out paperwork to comply with the regulations. The bad news \nis, the new law we passed doubles the rules and regulations with 24 new \ncategories and 100 new reporting requirements. These new requirements \ninclude a total of 54 so-called college watch lists, which I believe \nwill be too confusing for families to understand, and complicated rules \ninvolving textbooks which will only prove that Members of Congress have \nno idea how faculty members prepare courses.\n  Most of these complications of rules, including graduation rates in \n48 different categories, disaggregation of student-reported data by 14 \nracial, ethnic, and income subgroups, and employment rates of graduates \nof institutions, will leave college administrators scratching their \nheads and create thousands of new jobs for people to fill out forms. \nAll this will be put on the Web, and most of it will be shipped to \nWashington, DC, for someone to read. Having once been the Secretary of \nEducation myself, I do not know who will read all these reports and all \nthese new regulations, and I don't know what they would do about them \nif they did read them.\n  The academies, in the report I am suggesting, may also suggest that \nCongress and States make changes in the way we fund and regulate \nresearch universities, but much of the heavy lifting will have to be \ndone by the universities themselves. They are the ones who should be \nmost concerned about George Romney's warning:\n\n       There is nothing more vulnerable than entrenched success.\n\n  I guarantee that if some of the recommendations are going to have to \ndo with additional funding, Members of Congress and State legislators \nare going to be asking what universities are doing to reduce costs, \nespecially the cost of attending university.\n  At the American Council on Education meeting in February, I said that \nwhat I hear in Congress every time the issue comes up is, every time we \nincrease Pell grants, colleges raise tuition. That is what my \ncolleagues say to me. That is one reason why, in exasperation, \nCongressmen and Senators pile new rules on already overregulated \ncolleges. I suggested in February that university administrators might \nwant to be ready with a concrete explanation of what they are doing to \nreduce costs before asking for more money. I offered two suggestions: \nOne, that colleges offer some--not all, but some--well-prepared \nstudents the option of a 3-year baccalaureate degree, cutting one-third \nthe time and one-fourth the cost from a college education; and, two, \nthat community college be free for well-prepared students.\n  I cited to them a group of Tennessee counties and businesses in \nnortheast Tennessee that make up the difference between the cost of the \ncommunity college and Federal and State scholarships for qualified \nlocal students.\n  Two weeks ago, I visited a university president in Nashville who \nactually listened to what I had to say in February. On April 13, Randy \nLowry, at Lipscomb University in Nashville, announced a new 3-year \noption for some qualified students, a plan for veterans to attend \ntuition free, and a plan to make it easier and cheaper for community \ncollege students to attend Lipscomb. Taking into account the student \nearnings during the year that he or she is in the workforce instead of \nattending the university, President Lowry estimates that a Lipscomb \ngraduate with a 3-year degree might avoid up to $50,000 in debt. In \noffering a 3-year option, Lipscomb has good company in Hartwick College \nin New York, Judson College in Alabama, Bates College in Maine, and \nValparaiso in Indiana. In February, the State of Rhode Island decided \nto create a pilot program for a 3-year degree model.\n\n[[Page S4424]]\n\n  It may seem like a simple, even inconsequential request to ask the \nnational academies to tell us the top 10 actions Congress, States, and \nresearch universities need to take to maintain university excellence, \nbut my experience is that most ideas fail in Washington for lack of the \nidea. We have plenty of planners, publicists, and politicians to run \nwith a good idea. I look forward to the idea: the recommendations in \npriority order--one set for Congress, one set for the States, one set \nfor the research universities themselves.\n  There is no reason these recommendations should not have the same \nimpact the ``Rising Above the Gathering Storm'' report had and \ncontinues to have. And remembering George Romney's warning of a half \ncentury ago, there is nothing more vulnerable than entrenched success. \nWe should all hope this new report from the National Academies does \nhave that impact.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, today I rise in support of the Fraud \nEnforcement and Recovery Act. I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this \nlegislation, and I thank Senators Leahy and Grassley and the members of \nthe Judiciary Committee for their critical work on this very important \neffort to increase our capacity to investigate and prosecute the \nfraudulent activity that has severely weakened our economy and hurt the \ntaxpayer.\n  Fraudulent lending contributed to the collapse of the mortgage-backed \nsecurities market, sending our economy into a tailspin and putting \ntaxpayers on the hook for a huge Wall Street bailout. Taxpayers deserve \nto know that those fraudulent lenders are being held accountable. And \nwe need to send a message to those who would commit fraud in the future \nthey will also be held accountable.\n  With their current resources, however, Federal agencies are not able \nto properly investigate claims of mortgage fraud, which have increased \nmore than 10 times in the past 6 years. With the funding authorized in \nthis bill, the Department of Justice will be able to hire more \nprosecutors and the FBI will be able to nearly double its mortgage and \nfinancial fraud program.\n  The bill would also allow the Department of Justice to prosecute \nfraud committed by all mortgage lenders, not just those who are \nregulated by the Federal Government. Under current law, Federal fraud \nlaws do not apply to nondepository mortgage lenders, which made nearly \nhalf of residential mortgages before the housing market collapsed. \nIncluding these businesses in the fraud statute will allow the \nDepartment of Justice to properly investigate and prosecute fraud in \nthe entire mortgage market.\n  Last month, I offered an amendment to the budget to expand the \ncapacity of the Housing and Urban Development inspector general to \nfight mortgage fraud. I was pleased to have the Senate agree with that \namendment. Now we have an opportunity to follow up with an explicit \nauthorization of funds to protect vital HUD programs.\n  The Federal Housing Administration, which a few years ago insured \nonly 2 percent of all new mortgages, now insures roughly a third. Yet \nthe HUD inspector general's office has not expanded. We need to make \nsure HUD has the resources to properly investigate and remove \nfraudulent lenders.\n  With the sharp decline in private mortgage lending, programs such as \nFHA insurance make home ownership a reality for millions of Americans. \nBy providing HUD with the resources it needs to fight fraud, we will \nprotect FHA's long-term vitality while preventing the taxpayer from \nfooting the bill for another bailout.\n  Fraud in the financial system greatly contributed to this economic \ncollapse we are experiencing. Every day, taxpayers in New Hampshire and \nacross the country bear the burden of fraudulent activity. I am \nconfident this legislation will help protect those taxpayers by \nproviding the resources and legal tools we need to root out fraud.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in support of this bill.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe three nominees whose votes are scheduled a little later this \nafternoon. All three of these nominees were voted out of the Judiciary \nCommittee on a voice vote. All three have outstanding credentials for \nthe positions for which they have been nominated.\n\n\n                         Christine Anne Varney\n\n  Ms. Christine Varney is the nominee for Assistant Attorney General in \nthe Antitrust Division. She has an outstanding academic record, having \ngraduated magna cum laude at Syracuse University in 1978 and having \nreceived her law degree from Georgetown University Law Center.\n  She served as a Commissioner on the Federal Trade Commission from \n1994 to 1997, and has been a partner in the firm of Hogan & Hartson for \nthe past 12 years.\n  I believe her tenure on the Federal Trade Commission gives her a good \nbackground beyond being an antitrust lawyer in private practice for \nthis job. We discussed quite a number of legal issues in a private \nmeeting I had with her.\n  I consider the Antitrust position to be of unique importance. They \nare all important in the Department of Justice. But I believe she will \nbring a vigor to the job which I think is most appropriate.\n\n\n                            Lanny A. Breuer\n\n  The nominee for Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal Division \nis Lanny A. Breuer, who also has a fine academic background: a \nbachelor's degree from Columbia and a law degree from Columbia in 1985 \nand was a Harlan Fiske Stone Scholar. I am impressed with his resume \ngenerally but especially the fact that he was an assistant district \nattorney in the Manhattan DA's Office from 1985 to 1989. I am \nespecially partial to people who have been assistant district \nattorneys.\n  One further comment about Mr. Breuer. I emphasize the importance of \nseeking jail sentences in appropriate cases. Too often, criminal \nprosecutions result in fines which turn out in the context of the case \nto be really a license to do business. White-collar crime especially is \nan area where there can be effective deterrence, and his commitment on \nthat subject was reassuring.\n\n\n                               Tony West\n\n  The nominee for Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Division is \nDerek Anthony West, who also has a fine academic record: Harvard \nbachelor's degree, was publisher of the Harvard Political Review--that \nmight be a more important document than the Harvard Law Review; might \nbe--a law degree from Stanford in 1992, president of the Stanford Law \nReview, so he covered them both. Again, he has an outstanding resume \nprofessionally. Of particular interest to me is having been assistant \nU.S. attorney, Northern District of California, for 5 years, from 1994 \nto 1999, and was adjunct faculty member of the Lincoln Law School of \nSan Jose, which I think is significant, and has been a partner at \nMorrison & Foerster for the last 8 years.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have these resumes printed in the \nCongressional Record following my brief statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I think this is an appropriate time to \npoint out a few factors on the confirmation process.\n  The first is that Senators are being afforded less time to review the \nrecords of almost all of President Obama's nominees than they were for \nPresident Bush's nominees. The Judiciary Committee has held hearings \nfor 8 of the 11 Department of Justice nominees faster than it held \nhearings for President\n\n[[Page S4425]]\n\nBush's first nominees to the same positions. The committee has held \nhearings, on an average, 22 days earlier for these eight nominees. The \nSenate is confirming almost all of President Obama's Department of \nJustice nominees faster than it confirmed President Bush's first \nnominees to the same positions. Assuming that the three nominees \nscheduled for votes today are confirmed, of the eight Department of \nJustice nominees who have been confirmed, only two took more time to \nconfirm than President Bush's first nominee to the same position. \nAttorney General Eric Holder was confirmed 63 days after his \nnomination. John Ashcroft was confirmed 42 days after his nomination. \nLanny Breuer will be confirmed 56 days after his nomination. Michael \nChertoff, 24 days. The other six nominees who have been confirmed this \nyear have been confirmed, on average, 44 days faster than President \nBush's nominees to the same position.\n  So I offer these statistical points to counter the contention that \nthere is a slowdown here. The facts simply do not support it. \nAcknowledging that a little more time was taken with a couple of the \nnominees, it was for good cause. But as a generalization, the \nprocessing has been more expeditious now than under President Bush.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                          Christine A.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 3 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I rise to lend my support to the three \nnominees with the Justice Department that are pending today and to give \nmy support to Tony West for Assistant Attorney General of the Civil \nDivision, Lanny Breuer for Assistant Attorney General of the Criminal \nDivision, and Christine Varney for Assistant Attorney General of the \nAntitrust Division. I have documents I wish to submit for the Record \nfor all three.\n  I wish to speak for a moment about Lanny Breuer, a friend and someone \nwhom I know somewhat socially through actually children's activities, \nbut I have known of him and his reputation for quite some time. I \nwanted to come to the floor to say how pleased I am that the committee \nhas seen fit to pass his nomination on to us. I believe the ranking \nmember and the chairman have outlined his phenomenal credentials, but I \nwould just add that, having been a graduate of one of the most \nprestigious law schools in the country--Columbia Law School--he began \nhis career as an assistant U.S. attorney in New York City, which is a \ngood place to begin to really cut your teeth and learn the ropes, if \nyou will, a place that they say: If you can make it there, you can make \nit anywhere. And this is true of the work he has undertaken for his \nlife.\n  He served as a White House counsel, the Office of Special Counsel \nfor, of course, President Clinton. I think most notable to me and to \nmany of my colleagues is the endorsements he has received not just from \nDemocrats but from Republicans as well, people such as Michael \nChertoff, who worked with him. He led the Criminal Division at the \nDepartment of Justice during the Bush administration. He said Mr. \nBreuer has ``exceptionally broad legal experience as a former \nprosecutor and defense attorney.'' He has ``outstanding judgment, a \nkeen sense of fairness, high integrity and an even temperament.'' For \nthe job we have called him to do, he is going to need all of those \nqualities and qualifications. Brad Berenson, a veteran of the Bush \nadministration's White House Counsel's Office, writes that Mr. Breuer \nis ``everything one could hope for in a leader of the Criminal \nDivision.'' So he comes with not just great academic credentials, great \nlife experience, tremendous qualifications for this post, but from his \npeers--both Democrats and Republicans--who believe he is the right \nperson for this job.\n  So I am pleased to come to the floor for a few minutes today to lend \nmy support to this outstanding nominee, and I look forward to working \nwith him and these other nominees as we build a stronger justice system \nin the city of New Orleans, south Louisiana, and parts of the gulf \ncoast that still remain, as my colleagues know, in a rebuilding mode \nfrom Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. What people don't realize, it\n\n[[Page S4426]]\n\nis not just houses and schools, but the criminal justice system was \nhard-hit in terms of jail space, the sheriff's office, the district \nattorneys. So we have an extra responsibility to work with this team in \nWashington to make sure they keep their eyes on our people down in the \ngulf coast as we rebuild that great region of this country. I know this \nteam will, and I am happy to support Lanny Breuer for Assistant \nAttorney General.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4426-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4426-S4430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  NOMINATIONS OF TONY WEST TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL; LANNY A. \n BREUER TO BE ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL; CHRISTINE ANNE VARNEY TO BE \n                       ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In my view, they should have been confirmed before \nthe 2-week Easter recess. There was once a time in the Senate when we \nacted on nominees pending on the Senate Executive Calendar before a \nlong recess. Certainly at the beginning of a presidential term, it \nmakes sense to have the President's nominees in place earlier, rather \nthan engage in needless delay, especially when there is no controversy. \nI know of no controversy regarding any of these outstanding \nnominations.\n  All three nominees were named by the President on January 22, 3 \nmonths ago. They each participated in a confirmation hearing on March \n10, 6 weeks ago. After allowing time for follow-up written questions \nand answers, they were each considered by the Judiciary Committee, \napproved without a single negative vote, and reported to the Senate on \nMarch 26. Another week passed, but Republicans remained unwilling to \nconfirm them before the April recess. That is how we find ourselves \nhere, more than 12 weeks after they were designated by the President, \nwithout having acted on those named to head the Criminal Division, the \nAntitrust Division, or the Civil Division.\n  I will be very interested to hear why these nominations could not be \napproved before the Senate recessed on April 2, and why these \nadditional weeks of delay were needed. I will be interested to see who \nopposes these nominees, who comes to the floor to speak against them, \nand who justifies the delay in their confirmations. To date, I know of \nno one who opposes them. I know that no Republican member of the \nJudiciary Committee voted against any of them when they were considered \nby the committee at a business meeting more than 3 weeks ago. As I say, \nthere used to be a tradition of comity, and of acting on executive \nnominations before a recess. I will be interested to learn how that \ndelay is justified to the Justice Department, to the country and to \neach of these nominees.\n  In a statement 2 weeks ago, I noted my disappointment that the \nRepublican minority has returned to the tactics of anonymous and \nunaccountable holds, and needless delays. Attorney General Holder needs \nhis leadership team in place to rebuild and restore the Department. \nNone of these are controversial nominees. They all received numerous \nletters of strong support, and endorsements from both Republican and \nDemocratic former public officials. They were all reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee by unanimous consent. They should have been \nconfirmed weeks ago.\n  What accounts for the delay? I hope that someone will explain. To \ndate no one has. I am left to think back to a February column written \nby William Kristol, where he urged the Republican minority to practice \nobstruction and delay. He was specifically referring to the Republican \nefforts to oppose the President's proposals to revive our economy and \nbuild a new foundation for lasting prosperity. That they have done. Not \none Republican Member of the House or Senate voted for the budget and \nnot one Republican Member of the House voted for the emergency economic \nrecovery package. They are adhering to a pundit's advice on important \nlegislation and on the President's nominations. Their creed is to \n``obstruct and delay.'' It is not one of bipartisanship to help the \nPresident enact his agenda this year. It is one designed to ``slow down \nthe train.'' Mr. Kristol counseled Republicans to insist on ``lengthy \ndebate,'' while noting that they ``can't win politically right now,'' \nbut they can ``pick other fights--and they can try in any way possible \nto break Obama's momentum.'' That is a destructive prescription, and we \nsee it being played out day after day, issue after issue, nomination \nafter nomination. Rather than join with the new President as he rallies \nthe country and the world to economic recovery and enhanced security, \nthey persist in their efforts to obstruct and delay.\n  Recently the New York Times described the results of a New York \nTimes/CBS News poll of the American people. Since the Republican \nopposition is so interested in poll-driven politics, I urge them to \nconsider it, and reconsider their own ill-fated course. The Obama \nadministration is just 11 weeks old, and already the American people \nhave grown more optimistic about the economy and the direction of the \ncountry. Americans approve of the President's handling of the economy \nand foreign policy with fully two-thirds saying they approve of his \noverall job performance. Following his recent trip to Europe, meetings \nwith other world leaders, his outreach to Turkey and his visit to Iraq, \nI expect those numbers may be even higher today. More and more people \nfeel that things are headed in the right direction--despite Republican \nobstruction. Two and one half months into office, President Obama has \nbroad support on economic and national security matters with almost \ntwo-thirds of Americans believing that President Obama is likely to \nmake the right decisions.\n  By contrast, only 20 percent of Americans believe that congressional \nRepublicans would more likely make the right decisions about the \nnation's economy. The Republican nay-saying is sinking in. So I urge \nSenate Republicans, if they will not honor our traditional deference to \na new President and vote for his nominees, if they will not join \ntogether with President Obama at a time of great challenges to America \nby working cooperatively and quickly to approve the administration's \nlaw enforcement leadership team, if none of those worthwhile reasons \nconvince them to do the right thing, then I urge them to consider how \nthe American people are reacting to their obstruction. I urge them to \nabandon the across-the-board tactics of resistance and delay. The \nmajority of the American people are calling for us to work together and \nare rejecting Republican obstruction and delay.\n  Tony West knows the Department of Justice well. He served in the \nDepartment as a Special Assistant to Deputy Attorneys General Philip \nHeymann and Jamie Gorelick. He then worked as a Federal prosecutor in \nthe U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of California. His \ncommitment to public service continued when he became a\n\n[[Page S4427]]\n\nSpecial Assistant Attorney General in the California Department of \nJustice. He has also worked in private practice. Mr. West is a graduate \nof Harvard University and Stanford University Law School, where he \nserved as president of the Stanford Law Review.\n  His nomination has earned support from both sides of the aisle. The \nformer chairman of the California Republican Party, George Sundheim, \nsent a letter to the committee stating that Mr. West is admired by \n``both sides of the aisle'' for his ``integrity, honesty and decency,'' \nand that there is no one ``more qualified to assume a position of \nleadership in the Department of Justice.'' The Federal prosecutors who \nworked across the table from Mr. West during the high-profile \nprosecution of John Walker Lindh witnessed Mr. West's ``extraordinary \nprofessionalism,'' and ``smart advocacy . . . executed with the highest \ndegree of integrity.'' We should confirm this outstanding leader for \nthe Civil Division and should not have delayed his confirmation this \nlong.\n  President Obama has said that Lanny Breuer has the ``depth of \nexperience and integrity'' to fulfill the highest standards of the \nAmerican people and the Department of Justice. I agree. Mr. Breuer \nbegan his legal career as an assistant district attorney in the \nManhattan District Attorney's Office. He told us during his hearing \nthat his commitment to ensuring justice for all Americans stemmed from \nhis days working on the front lines of the fight against crime as a \nManhattan prosecutor. His call to public service continued while \nserving in the White House Counsel's Office as a special counsel to \nPresident Clinton. Mr. Breuer has also worked in private practice for \nthe prestigious Washington, DC, law firm of Covington & Burling. He is \na graduate of Columbia Law School and Columbia University.\n  Michael Chertoff, who led the Criminal Division at the Department of \nJustice during the Bush administration, endorsed Mr. Breuer's \nnomination, saying he has ``exceptionally broad legal experience as a \nformer prosecutor and defense attorney'' and has ``outstanding \njudgment, a keen sense of fairness, high integrity and an even \ntemperament.'' Brad Berenson, a veteran of the Bush administration's \nWhite House counsel's office, writes that Mr. Breuer is ``everything \none could hope for in a leader of the Criminal Division.''\n  Mr. Breuer's former colleagues from the Manhattan District Attorney's \nOffice have said that as a criminal prosecutor, he ``distinguished \nhimself as a tenacious but scrupulously fair trial lawyer, driven by \nthe unwavering goal of achieving justice.'' Former Deputy Attorney \nGeneral Larry D. Thompson and former Congressman and DEA Administrator \nAsa Hutchinson have also written to the committee in support of Mr. \nBreuer's nomination. I agree with all their comments and wish the \nRepublican minority had not stalled the confirmation of Mr. Breuer's \nnomination needlessly for an additional 2 weeks.\n  Christine Varney was confirmed to be a U.S. Federal Trade \nCommissioner in 1994, after being nominated by President Clinton. As a \nFederal Trade Commissioner, Ms. Varney gained valuable experience in \nantitrust enforcement and in reducing anticompetitive measures that \nharm American consumers. Her Government service work includes a high \nlevel position in President Clinton's White House, where she served as \nan assistant to the President and secretary to the Cabinet. She has \nworked in private practice for the prestigious Washington, DC, law firm \nof Hogan & Hartson. She also graduated from my alma mater, the \nGeorgetown University Law Center.\n  Her nomination is supported by individuals who served in the \nAntitrust Division during both Democratic and Republican \nadministrations. John Shenefield and James Rill, both former heads of \nthe Antitrust Division, say that she is ``extraordinarily well \nqualified to lead the Antitrust Division.'' Twenty former chairs of the \nAmerican Bar Association section of antitrust law have described Ms. \nVarney as a ``highly accomplished, capable nominee who will serve \nconsumers and this country with distinction'' and who will have \n``immediate credibility'' in her new position.\n  I agree. At a time when our economy is suffering, there is a \ntemptation to act anticompetitively. We need to make sure that we have \na strong and effective advocate for competition and the interests of \nconsumers in place. This was not the time for delay.\n  Republican Senators delayed for weeks the confirmation of Harvard Law \nSchool dean Elena Kagan to be the Solicitor General of the United \nStates, before demanding an extended debate on her nomination. They \ndelayed for 2 weeks what was a unanimous vote in favor of David Kris to \nserve as the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the National \nSecurity Division at the Justice Department. And they have refused for \nmore than a month to consent to a time agreement for debate and a vote \non the nomination of Dawn Johnsen to lead the critical Office of Legal \nCounsel. The nominations the Senate considers this evening are three \nadditional nominations they held up needlessly this month.\n  On April 1, both the New York Times and Roll Call featured reports \nsuggesting that Senate Republicans intend to, and are planning to, \nfilibuster the nomination of Dawn Johnsen to serve as the Assistant \nAttorney General for the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice \nDepartment. That was no April fool's joke. That is a serious matter and \none that hurts the President's efforts to restore the rule of law. I \ncannot remember a time when Democratic Senators filibustered a Justice \nDepartment nomination.\n  Speech after speech by Republican Senators just a few short years ago \nabout how it would be unconstitutional to filibuster Presidential \nnominees appear now to be just speeches that served a partisan \npolitical purpose at the time. Last month, in an online column for \nSlate entitled ``How Many Ways Can Senate Republicans Show Intellectual \nHypocrisy?'' Dahila Lithwick observed:\n\n       ``The irony now on display among Republicans on the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee is staggering.'' She could have included \n     Republican Senators who have recently championed the \n     principle that ``elections have consequences,'' that the \n     President is entitled to his nominees, and that filibustering \n     is an ``obstructionist tactic'' and ``obscene.''\n\n  In her April 8 column in the Washington Post, Ruth Marcus reminded \n``the people who are considering a Johnsen filibuster how hypocritical \nthis stance would be.'' She reminded them that Democrats did not \nfilibuster President Bush's nominations of John Ashcroft or Ted Olson, \nalthough there were more than 40 negative votes on each of those \nnominations. She noted:\n\n       ``[T]he president is entitled, absent extraordinary \n     circumstances, to have the advisers of his choosing. Voting \n     against a president's nominee is a serious step. Voting to \n     prevent that nomination from getting an up-or-down vote kicks \n     it up several notches.'' She concluded by explaining why, \n     from her own experience and knowledge, Dawn Johnsen is not \n     out of the mainstream or extreme: ``This is hardly the kind \n     of nominee so extreme that she should not be entitled to an \n     up-or-down vote.''\n\n  The men and women at the Department of Justice have a special duty to \nuphold the rule of law because, as President Obama reminds us, ``laws \nare only as effective, only as compassionate, [and] only as fair as \nthose who enforce them.'' The three nominees Republicans agreed to \nconsider this evening, and Dawn Johnsen, whose nomination they refuse \nto debate and vote on, are all nominees who meet President Obama's \nstandards and will work on behalf of the American people in the best \ntraditions of the Department of Justice. I urge Republican Senators to \nvote to confirm these Assistant Attorney General nominations tonight.\n  Then I hope we will be able to proceed to a time agreement to \nconsider and vote on the nomination of Dawn Johnsen to serve as the \nAssistant Attorney General to head the important Office of Legal \nCounsel at the Justice Department. Her work has been delayed too long. \nThe President designated her back on January 5. The time has come to \ndebate that nomination and vote it up or down. The President has \nsuspended the OLC opinions until they can be reviewed; she will head \nthat review. The delay has gone on long enough. The Senate should vote.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Tony West to be Assistant Attorney General for the Civil \nDivision of the Department of Justice.\n\n[[Page S4428]]\n\n  As we saw from his confirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee, \nTony West has the superb intellect, seasoned judgment, and wealth of \nexperience necessary to be an outstanding head of the Civil Division.\n  Mr. West's academic credentials are extremely impressive. He earned \nhis BA from Harvard, where he was the publisher of the Harvard \nPolitical Review. He received his JD from Stanford Law School, where he \nwas president of the Stanford Law Review.\n  Following law school, Mr. West began a career in which he has \ndemonstrated great devotion to public service. In 1993 and 1994, he \nserved with distinction as a Special Assistant in the Department of \nJustice, where he was involved in the development of national crime \npolicy, including the 1994 omnibus crime bill. He has also served as an \nassistant U.S. attorney for the Northern District of California, and as \na California special assistant attorney general.\n  In private practice at one of the country's leading law firms, Mr. \nWest has also excelled, representing a wide range of clients from \nindigent individuals in civil rights litigation to multinational \ncorporations in complex commercial matters.\n  Outside of his practice, Mr. West has been a significant contributor \nto the legal community. He has served on the governing board of the \nNorthern California Association of Business Trial Lawyers, as a Ninth \nCircuit lawyer representative, and as a member of the Litigation \nSection Executive Committee for the San Francisco Bar Association.\n  Just as important, while in private practice, Mr. West has directed \nhis considerable talent and energy to important pro bono work and \npublic service. By way of example, he has served as a judge in \nOakland's McCullum Youth Court, a courtroom run by students that \nfocuses on rehabilitation of first-time youth offenders.\n  The Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division has a set of \nresponsibilities that are always important, never more so than right \nnow.\n  As just one example, the Civil Division is integral to keeping \nAmericans, and taxpayer dollars, safe from financial fraud. In the \naftermath of the financial meltdown that has thrown the American \neconomy into a serious recession, we must ensure that lawbreakers do \nnot keep their ill-gotten gains. And for our economic recovery plans to \nwork, we must ensure Americans' faith in our government's ability to \nexercise appropriate oversight in the use of the economic recovery \nfunds Congress has appropriated.\n  The President has made an excellent choice in selecting Tony West to \nlead the Civil Division. He is a skilled and accomplished lawyer, a \nleader and a team player, and a person of unquestioned integrity. The \nAttorney General and the country need him in place as soon as possible.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, we yield back all remaining \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time is yielded back.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Tony West, of California, to be Assistant Attorney General? On this \nquestion, the yeas and nays have been ordered, and the clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Begich), the \nSenator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Illinois (Mr. \nDurbin), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from \nConnecticut (Mr. Lieberman), the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller), and the Senator from Oregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. \nCochran), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kyl), the Senator from Arizona \n(Mr. McCain), the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts), and the Senator \nfrom Mississippi (Mr. Wicker).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 82, nays 4, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 155 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--82\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Burr\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Coburn\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dorgan\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n\n                                NAYS--4\n\n     Bunning\n     Chambliss\n     Isakson\n     Shelby\n\n                             NOT VOTING--13\n\n     Begich\n     Bennett\n     Cochran\n     Dodd\n     Durbin\n     Kennedy\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Wicker\n     Wyden\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on the Breuer \nnomination.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, we have three nominations that should \nhave been confirmed by voice vote. Before we left on recess, the \nRepublicans asked to hold them up for 2 weeks. I wish they had not \nbecause these are nominiees to vital positions in the Department of \nJustice. Only four Senators, after holding them up for 2 weeks, not \nallowing them to be there, only four Senators voted against Tony West \nto be head of the Civil Division. We now have Lanny Breuer to serve as \nAssistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division. These are people \nwho were voted out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously by \nRepublicans and Democrats. I hope we have a similar vote. A rollcall \nhas been requested on the Republican side, which is fine; they have \nthat right. But I hope we will confirm this nomination also.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I believe Mr. Breuer warrants \nconfirmation.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination Lanny Breuer to be Assistant Attorney General for the \nCriminal Division of the Department of Justice.\n  Lanny Breuer is a superb lawyer with unquestioned integrity. We are \nfortunate that the President has selected him to head the Criminal \nDivision of the Department of Justice.\n  As we saw from his confirmation hearing in the Judiciary Committee, \nMr. Breuer has the sharp intellect, wealth of experience, and superb \njudgment necessary to be an outstanding leader.\n  Early in his career, he served as a prosecutor in the Manhattan \nDistrict Attorney's Office, working for the legendary Robert \nMorgenthau. While there, he not only gained an appreciation for the \nimportant work on the front lines of criminal prosecution, but he also \ndemonstrated the sort of temperament and judgment that are critical to \nsuccess in the position for which he has been nominated.\n  Mr. Breuer also served with distinction in the White House as Special \nCounsel to the President. From there, he moved to one of the country's \ngreat law firms, where he currently cochairs its white collar defense \nand investigations group. Taken together, this broad experience will \nserve him well as Assistant Attorney General.\n  Just as important, Mr. Breuer has a deep appreciation for the \nimportance of public service. Since 2003, he has served as vice chair \nof his firm's Public Service Committee, which oversees the firm's pro \nbono programs.\n  His personal pro bono work has been impressive as well. One of the \nletters in support received by this committee details Mr. Breuer's \napplication of his impressive legal skills and considerable\n\n[[Page S4429]]\n\ndetermination to rid a District of Columbia neighborhood of a powerful \ndrug dealing organization that operated out of a local bar. Almost 20 \nyears later, the neighbors he helped still remember and praise his \nimportant work on their behalf.\n  The Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division has a set of \nresponsibilities that are always important, never more so than right \nnow.\n  As just one example, the Criminal Division is integral to keeping \nAmericans safe not only from violent crime but also from financial \nfraud. In the aftermath of the financial meltdown that has thrown the \nAmerican economy into a serious recession, we must ensure that \nlawbreakers will be identified and prosecuted for financial fraud.\n  Punishing complex financial crimes and deterring future fraud are \nvital to restoring confidence in our decimated financial markets. We \nneed to get Lanny Breuer in place just as soon as we can, to make sure \nthat the trail of any criminals who contributed to this meltdown does \nnot grow cold.\n  Finally, I would like to add that Mr. Breuer is not just a brilliant \nlegal mind, but he's also a person of great character. As Robert \nMorgenthau said in his letter of support:\n\n       Mr. Breuer consistently handled his responsibilities with \n     keen analytical ability, common sense, total integrity and an \n     exemplary sense of justice. . . . [H]e also understood that \n     the power and authority possessed by a prosecutor will be \n     best balanced by humility and discretion. He never wavered in \n     his pursuit of fairness and justice.\n\n  That is precisely the sort of person we need, right now, to head the \nCriminal Division of the Department of Justice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Lanny A. \nBreuer, of the District of Columbia, to be an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral?\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Begich), the \nSenator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), the \nSenator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller), and the Senator from \nOregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. \nCochran), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kyl), the Senator from Arizona \n(Mr. McCain), and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Are there any other Senators in \nthe Chamber desiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 88, nays 0, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 156 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--88\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--11\n\n     Begich\n     Bennett\n     Cochran\n     Dodd\n     Kennedy\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Wyden\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 2 minutes of debate prior to \na vote on the Varney nomination.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the 88-to-0 vote, again, was one that, \ninstead of having a voice vote before the recess on a key member of the \nDepartment of Justice, our friends on the Republican side insisted we \nhave. We held it up for 2 weeks. I am glad to see that now the right \nthing has been done with not a single dissenting vote. I wish it could \nhave been done 2 weeks earlier so they could get to work at the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I can't hear Senator Leahy, so I will \nnot know how to formulate my rebuttal.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont may continue.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, the third vote is Christine Varney--and I \nhope we have a similar vote--to serve as Assistant Attorney General for \nthe Antitrust Division. Again, I wish it could have been done 2 weeks \nago, but I would hope we would go forward.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, as the ranking Republican on the \nAntitrust Subcommittee, I rise to voice my support for the confirmation \nof Christine Varney to be the next Assistant Attorney General in charge \nof the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division.\n  This is a role to which, I believe, she is ideally suited.\n  Ms. Varney served as a Federal Trade Commissioner from 1994 to 1997. \nAs we all know, our Nation has two separate agencies, the Department of \nJustice's Antitrust Division and the Federal Trade Commission, that are \nresponsible for enforcing our antitrust laws. Ensuring that these \nagencies efficiently and effectively execute those laws is a major \nconcern of the Antitrust Subcommittee. In fact, I recently posed the \ntheoretical question as to whether a merger of the FTC's antitrust arm \nand the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division would not create a \nmore efficient regulatory regime. Although I believe this question \ndeserves further close consideration by the Antitrust Subcommittee, I \nwas delighted to see that Jon Leibowitz, Chairman of the FTC, was \npresent, and even an active participant, at Ms. Varney's nomination \nhearing. Undoubtedly, this was to support her confirmation and, \npresumably, to show the intent of these two leaders to bring greater \ncooperation between the Antitrust Division and the FTC.\n  In addition to Ms. Varney's experience with an executive agency \nenforcing our antitrust laws, she has also developed a strong \nreputation in the private sector. Ms. Varney was heavily involved in \none of the most important antitrust cases of modern time: U.S. v. \nMicrosoft. In that matter, she represented Netscape. She also \nrepresented Netscape in its merger with AOL. Presently, she is a \npartner at Hogan and Hartson, where she is head of that firm's Internet \nLaw practice group. Her experience in these matters is of particular \nrelevance due to the recent number of proposed mergers affecting the \nInternet. The importance of these contemplated mergers has only been \nhighlighted by the number of hearings that the Antitrust Subcommittee \nhas held on the issues that have arisen because of these proposed \ntransactions.\n  I also appreciate the commitment she made in her written responses to \nthe committee's questions to work with me on an antitrust issue that is \nclose to the hearts of every Utahn: the inequities that occur currently \ndue to the so-called Bowl Championship Series. The current system is a \nclear violation of our Nation's antitrust laws and I look forward to \nworking with the Antitrust Division to develop an appropriate remedy.\n  On a personal level, I have had an opportunity to meet and talk to \nMs. Varney. I appreciate her collegial and professional manner. I \nbelieve she is an individual who will strive to work with Congress to \nensure that fair competition is maintained and the rule of law \nenforced.\n  Therefore, I recommend Ms. Varney's confirmation to colleagues and \nlook to working with her in the years to come.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nnomination of Christine Varney to be Assistant Attorney General for the \nAntitrust Division of the Department of Justice.\n  In selecting Ms. Varney, the President has chosen wisely. She has the \nexperience, the intellect, and the judgment necessary to be a superb \nleader of\n\n[[Page S4430]]\n\nthe Antitrust Division. Just as important, she has the character and \nintegrity to help the Attorney General restore the public faith in the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  Over the course of her impressive 23-year legal career, Ms. Varney \nhas held a wide range of significant positions that make her uniquely \nqualified for this critical position. After starting her career in \nprivate practice, she served in the Clinton administration as an \nAssistant to the President and Secretary to the Cabinet. In October \n1994, President Clinton nominated Ms. Varney to the Federal Trade \nCommission. After Senate confirmation, she held that position until \n1997. As a Commissioner, she distinguished herself in several important \nways. Most important to me, she demonstrated her commitment to the idea \nthat antitrust enforcement must be both vigorous and fair.\n  At this decisive time for our Nation's economy, we need an approach \nto antitrust enforcement that promotes competition, drives innovation, \nand protects the consumer. Based on her time at the FTC, and in private \npractice, I have no doubt that Ms. Varney is the right person to lead \nthe Antitrust Division. Ms. Varney should be confirmed without delay.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination, as the Republicans had requested.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Is my time reserved, Madam President?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Yes, it is. I am just asking for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Let's confirm her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  Does the Senator from Pennsylvania wish to use his time?\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I used all the time I wanted. Let's \nconfirm her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Christine Anne Varney, of the District of \nColumbia, to be an Assistant Attorney General?\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Alaska (Mr. Begich), the \nSenator from Connecticut (Mr. Dodd), the Senator from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Kennedy), the Senator from Connecticut (Mr. Lieberman), the \nSenator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller), and the Senator from \nOregon (Mr. Wyden) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the \nSenator from Utah (Mr. Bennett), the Senator from Mississippi (Mr. \nCochran), the Senator from Arizona (Mr. Kyl), the Senator from Arizona \n(Mr. McCain), and the Senator from Kansas (Mr. Roberts).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 87, nays 1, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 157 Ex.]\n\n                                YEAS--87\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Bond\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Brownback\n     Burr\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Inouye\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Risch\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Sessions\n     Shaheen\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Thune\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--1\n\n       \n     Bunning\n       \n\n                             NOT VOTING--11\n\n     Begich\n     Bennett\n     Cochran\n     Dodd\n     Kennedy\n     Kyl\n     Lieberman\n     McCain\n     Roberts\n     Rockefeller\n     Wyden\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to state my support for \nthe three nominees that the Senate confirmed earlier today. Due to \nweather delays, I was unavoidably absent from the Senate during the \nvotes on the three nominees to be Assistant Attorneys General in the \nDepartment of Justice. Had I been present I would have voted yea for \nall three nominees.\n  All three individuals are eminently qualified and I believe will be \nsuperb additions to President Obama's administration.\n  Let me briefly talk about these well-qualified individuals. Tony West \nwill be the next Assistant Attorney General for the Civil Division. He \nserved previously in the Department of Justice as a Special Assistant \nto two Deputy Attorneys General during the Clinton administration. He \nalso served in the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of \nCalifornia as a prosecutor. Mr. West is a graduate of Harvard \nUniversity and Stanford University Law School, where he served as \npresident of the Stanford Law Review.\n  Lanny Breuer received both his undergraduate and law degree from \nColumbia University. After law school, he worked as an Assistant \nDistrict Attorney in Manhattan. During the Clinton administration, he \nserved as Special Counsel in the White House. He has also worked at the \nlaw firm Covington & Burling. Mr. Breuer will serve as the next \nAssistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division.\n  Finally, Christine Varney will serve as the next Assistant Attorney \nGeneral of the Antitrust Division. I believe she is uniquely qualified \nfor this position. A graduate of the Georgetown University Law Center, \nMs. Varney served as a U.S. Federal Trade Commissioner and, later, as \nan assistant to President Clinton and Secretary to the Cabinet.\n  Again, had I been present I would have voted yea on these nominations \nand I am pleased that all three nominees were approved overwhelmingly \nin the Senate today.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, on vote No. 155, I was unavoidably \ndetained. Had I been present for the vote, I would have voted to \nconfirm the nomination of Tony West to be an Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Department of Justice, Civil Division.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4430-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4430-S4434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NOMINATION OF CHRISTOPHER R. HILL TO BE AMBASSADOR TO IRAQ\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the next nomination.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Nomination of Christopher R. Hill, of Rhode Island, a \n     Career Member of the Senior Foreign Service, Class of Career \n     Minister, to be Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary \n     of the United States of America to the Republic of Iraq.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 20 \nminutes equally divided for debate on the motion to invoke cloture on \nthe nomination of Christopher Hill.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KERRY. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Indiana, the \ndistinguished ranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Madam President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nChristopher Hill to be Ambassador to Iraq. During his 32-year career, \nhe has led three embassies and served as Assistant Secretary of State \nfor East Asian and Pacific Affairs. In that position, he was the Bush \nadministration's point man at the six party talks on North Korea. As \nAssistant Secretary, Chris Hill demonstrated outstanding diplomatic and \nmanagerial skills in dealing with one of our most difficult foreign \npolicy challenges. His innovative approach contributed to successes, \nincluding the ongoing disablement of the Yongbyon nuclear complex in \nthe presence of American monitors, the re-entry into North Korea of \nIAEA officials, and the potential transition of the six party process \ninto a forum for broader multilateral engagement in Northeast Asia.\n  North Korea remains an inscrutable regime with unpredictable \nmotivations. Any suggestion that the North Korea nuclear issue lends \nitself to obvious solutions or the application of a\n\n[[Page S4431]]\n\nstandard diplomatic playbook is off the mark. Ambassador Hill had to \napply both imagination and persistence in moving this complex process \nforward in five foreign capitals.\n  Now President Obama has tapped him to address another of the most \nimportant foreign policy challenges confronting the United States. In \nmy judgment, it would take extraordinary circumstances for the Senate \nto deny the President his choice of an Ambassador to carry out his \ndirectives in Iraq, especially given that the President will be judged \nmeticulously on what happens there.\n  Ambassador Hill has unique experience in managing the type of \nregional diplomatic effort that is likely to be required at this stage \nof Iraq's development. Iraq's success will increasingly depend on \nregional factors involving the activities of both friends and \nadversaries. We must seek to reassure allies and send adversaries the \nclear message that the United States remains committed to regional \nstability and has no intention of leaving a vacuum in Iraq that could \nbe exploited.\n  Prime Minister Maliki's outreach to Sunnis has already reduced \ntensions among Iraq's Sunni neighbors. Leaders from Turkey, Jordan, \nSyria, and virtually all of the Gulf States, including Kuwait, have \npaid high-level visits and appointed ambassadors, indicating acceptance \nof the Shia-run government.\n\n  Across the region, and internationally, the incentive structure for \ninvolvement in Iraq is fundamentally different than it was 2 years ago. \nCoupled with the drawdown, the time is right to expand our engagements, \nsolidify regional security gains, and cultivate more robust regional \nand international cooperation in Iraq. Ideally, this cooperation would \ninclude regular and wide-ranging talks with neighboring states on \nbroader issues of regional security. One of the purposes of these talks \nmust be to avoid surprise and miscalculation in the region that could \nignite further conflict.\n  Through the confluence of many factors, Iraq is showing positive \ntrend lines. American casualties are at their lowest mark since the \nconflict began 6 years ago. The Iraqi government held successful \nelections last month, and those provincial councils are convening, \nelecting chairmen, and beginning to set their agendas.\n  But progress in Iraq remains vulnerable to political rivalry, outside \ninterference, and the slow pace of economic reconstruction. Government \ninstitutions at all levels remain underdeveloped, inefficient, and \nsubject to corruption. The economy, which grew at a rate of 3.5 percent \nin the first two quarters of 2008, has slipped as oil prices have \ndropped. Oil production rates are flat, and reduced revenues may slow \nthe efforts of Iraq's government to make necessary infrastructure \ninvestments. Unemployment and underemployment remain high. Because of \nthese and other conditions, Ambassador Crocker and General Odierno have \ndescribed Iraq's progress as fragile and reversible. It is important to \nget our next Ambassador in place as quickly as possible.\n  I have appreciated Ambassador Hill's accessibility to the Senate \nForeign Relations Committee. In addition to nine appearances before the \ncommittee in the last 5 years, he has always been willing to meet with \nus privately about developments on the Korean Peninsula or elsewhere in \nEast Asia.\n  I also appreciate his willingness to accept this difficult post, \nespecially after several years of an unrelenting diplomatic activity. I \nam hopeful that the Senate will move forward on his nomination. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  Colleagues, tomorrow is a terrible day. It is Holocaust Remembrance \nDay. I want to put up a picture of something that is all too familiar \nto the world. It is Auschwitz, the main camp. You can see the different \nbuildings that were there. What took place there was a horrible thing \nthat happened. The world will remember that.\n  There was a new movie out on it last night that was put forward by a \ngroup of students from Kansas. They found a lady who had moved through \nthe Polish concentration camp, actually the internment that they did in \nthe city, the slum. She saved a bunch of orphans. It was a beautiful \nstory about a terrible situation.\n  Tomorrow, Holocaust Remembrance Day, we remember this type of a \npicture. Let me show you a modern picture that looks eerily similar. It \nis not the same situation but just look at the barracks. Look at the \ndesign. Just look at the setting. This is North Korea. It is a gulag. \nWe have tens of thousands who have been killed. We have 10 percent of \nthe population that have died over the last decade and a half in North \nKorea.\n  You want to see an eerie resemblance to something that we always say \nnever again, never again, and yet in our time we see this. Here is the \nmost infamous of the camps. Here is Camp 22. You can get this on Google \nEarth if you do not trust my images. We did not have that of Auschwitz \nat the time. We have it now. We know what is going on at Camp 22 from \npeople who have been in North Korea who have made it out. Here is a \nlist of the places where the gulags are throughout the country. We know \nwhere these are. We did not know at the time what was taking place in \nAuschwitz, what was taking place there. We had thoughts about it. We \nthought it might be taking place. We were not exactly sure. In some \ncases I am afraid we acted like we didn't want to know.\n  I am afraid that is what we are acting like on this issue; we do not \nwant to know this is taking place. Yet it is. We have witnesses and we \nhave Google Earth. You can show pictures of it. Tomorrow we have \nHolocaust Remembrance Day. Today we consider what is taking place here, \nand we are considering a nominee to be our most key ambassadorial \npost--this is in Iraq--who was the key strategist on North Korea \nstrategy, on the six-party talks, who ignored this situation, who lied \nto me about it that he would involve our human rights ambassador to \nNorth Korea in the six-party talks.\n  That never happened. I have a letter from Jay Lefkowitz, who stated \nthis to me March 25, 2009:\n\n       At no point during my tenure as special envoy for human \n     rights in North Korea, either before or after July 31, 2008, \n     did Chris Hill or anyone acting on his behalf invite me to \n     participate in any six-party talks.\n\n  We know it is going on. We have the pictures. We do not even involve \nour guy to talk about it, and this is the person now we want to promote \nto the biggest diplomatic post that we have in the world, a diplomat \nwho ignores the human rights abuses in North Korea. The Washington Post \neven said this about Chris Hill:\n\n       . . . a stunning lack of urgency on human rights in North \n     Korea.\n\n  That is my biggest beef, but let's also look at the diplomatic \nscorecard on what we have negotiated. Oh, OK, so we ignored human \nrights in North Korea. Chris Hill, he is the lead of our negotiators. \nHe is also over that region. We are going to ignore human rights. But \nwe must have gotten a great deal out of North Korea then because we are \ngoing to ignore this piece of it.\n  Here is the diplomatic scorecard of what Kim Jung-Il got and what we \ngot out of the six-party talks. I might remind you what happened during \nthe break that we were on, 2 weeks since our adjournment: The North \nKorean regime launched a multistage ballistic missile over the mainland \nof Japan toward Western United States; kidnapped and imprisoned two of \nour citizens, American citizens; pulled out of the six-party talks; \nkicked out international nuclear inspectors and American monitors; \nrestarted its nuclear facilities; and, according to at least one news \nsource, is now under investigation for shipping enriched uranium to \nIran.\n  Now, that just happened in the last 2 weeks. That is a pretty good 2 \nweeks for Kim Jung-Il, I guess. And the guy who negotiated this great \ndeal, now we want to put him in charge of Iraq. Well, here is the \nscorecard: Kim Jung-Il gets delisted as a state sponsor of terrorism; \nhe obtains key waivers of U.S. sanctions imposed after the regime's \nillegal nuclear detonation in 2006; he received tens of millions of \ndollars' worth of fuel oil assistance from us--that is, what the \nSoviets used to give him; now that we are sponsoring we are giving him \nthis sort of stuff so\n\n[[Page S4432]]\n\nhe can operate these gulags--allowed to continue totalitarian \noppression and starvation of the North Korean people.\n  We ignore human rights. He likes that. He is never required to \nrelease or account for all of the abductees or POWs or to acknowledge a \nclandestine uranium enrichment program and its role in the Syrian \nnuclear facility that the Israelis bombed. Remember that one. That was \na North Korean facility. It was North Korean designed, able to test \nballistic missile technology in violation of U.N. Security Council \nsanctions without any meaningful consequences.\n  And what did we do? What did we do? Obtained incomplete declarations \nfrom North Korea. I might note to my colleagues, some of you may \nremember this, the actual papers we got, they radiated. They had \nradiation coming from the papers themselves. That was probably a gift \nfrom Kim Jung-Il.\n  Implosion of the Yongbyon cooling tower, through the reversal they \nare already starting to produce plutonium or they are setting back up \nto produce plutonium at this plant after they blew up the tower. So \nthey did probably the least safest thing, blowing up the tower, but \nthey can still produce plutonium.\n  That is what we got out of this deal, and now we are going to put \nChris Hill in charge of Iraq, a situation and a case where we need the \nmost diplomatic skill, the most accomplished diplomat, and somebody \nthis body trusts because increasingly this moves from a military \nengagement to a diplomatic engagement. We have to trust the diplomat \nwho is coming forward, who we are putting forward in this situation, \nand this is what he did on our last account for the United States of \nAmerica. This is what he did the last time. The camps and human rights \nis what he ignored the last time around.\n  Now, I think Chris Hill as an individual is a fine individual. I have \nmet with him, as my colleague from Indiana has. I have great regard for \nmy colleague from Indiana and the chairman from Massachusetts--\nwonderful individuals. But I am saying, sort out and move away from \nRepublican and Democrat. I opposed Chris Hill and what he was doing \nduring the Bush administration. This is not me saying I am opposed to \nhim because this is about President Obama. It is not. It is about \nignoring human rights, it is about the terrible diplomatic scorecard. \nWe are getting skunked. If this were baseball, they would call the game \nfor the mercy rule. We are just getting skunked on this situation.\n  Now we are going to put him in Iraq, and we are going to ask him to \nmove this ball forward for us. I, for one, cannot seem to be able to \nsupport him to do that. That is why I want to have a fulsome debate \nabout this. I want to have a debate about why we take these sanctions \noff on North Korea. We should put them back on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 8 minutes.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am going to speak to the issue raised by Senator \nBrownback in a moment. But let me say, Ambassador Christopher Hill has \nmade a career, which is now entering his fourth decade, of taking on \nsome of the toughest assignments in our Government.\n  Today, the President, our country, and our troops, need him to take \non this task in Iraq. I hope my colleagues will join the overwhelming \nmajority of the Foreign Relations Committee and Senator Lugar who has \nspoken on this in moving to this nomination which is long overdue. This \nshould not be a controversial nomination. There are very few American \ndiplomats with more experience than Chris Hill where it matters most: \nin negotiating complex, high-stakes, multilateral deals in conflict \nzones.\n  In addition to serving as Ambassador to Macedonia, Poland, and South \nKorea, Chris Hill was one of the top negotiators at the 1995 Dayton \nAccords that ended the war in Bosnia.\n  He served as Special Envoy to Kosovo during the 1999 NATO bombing \ncampaign. As Ambassador to South Korea from 2004 to 2005, he managed \nthe bilateral relationship that includes the presence of nearly 30,000 \nAmerican troops, and, of course, he was the point person in the talks \nSenator Brownback has referenced. Make no mistake, our troops are \nbeginning to draw down in Iraq, and the entire resolution of Iraq as a \nsuccess will revolve around the diplomacy we apply and our ability to \nseek political reconciliation which will be implemented by that \ndiplomacy. We will have more time tomorrow to talk about this, I hope, \nif we can move to the nomination.\n  Let me speak quickly to what Senator Brownback has said. Chris Hill \nwas working under daily communications and instructions from the State \nDepartment, from Secretary of State Condi Rice, and from the President. \nWhat he did was in response to those instructions. He was never \nadmonished publicly or otherwise for going outside those instructions. \nThe argument is made about humanitarian and human rights issues. I ask \nunanimous consent that the portion of Ambassador Hill's Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee testimony be printed in the Record so Senators can \njudge for themselves.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Hill on the Allegation That He Reached an Agreement With the North \n             Koreans While They Were proliferating to Syria\n\n\n SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE NOMINATION HEARING, MARCH 25, 2009\n\n       Senator Wicker: Okay. Let me ask you one other thing. \n     There's a letter by--signed by some five Senators--Ensign, \n     Inhofe, Bond, Kyle, Brownback--in which they are urging the \n     President not to choose to appoint you. And they say this, in \n     testimony before the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee, Secretary \n     Hill said, ``Clearly we cannot be reaching a nuclear \n     agreement with North Korea if at the same time they're \n     proliferating, it is unacceptable,'' your quote. And yet they \n     say that--that at a time when Congress was trying to answer \n     key questions about Korea's proliferation to Syria, you were \n     involved in those negotiations, contrary to what they believe \n     was your clear statement to the subcommittee.\n       Mr. Hill: That we cannot reach an agreement if they're \n     proliferating, yes.\n       Senator Wicker: Yes, well do you see a contradiction there? \n     Congress was still wrestling with the fact that--that North \n     Korea was proliferating to Syria. And yet you went ahead. I'd \n     just ask you to respond to that.\n       Mr. Hill: Well, yeah. To the best of our estimate--that is \n     other agencies in the U.S. Government, to the best of their \n     estimate--the North Koreans ceased proliferating after this \n     facility was destroyed.\n       Now, the--it is very clear, at least it's very clear to me \n     and I think very clear to most people--that unbeknownst to \n     us, the North Koreans had carried on a program to assist \n     Syria in the construction of a nuclear reactor. We are not \n     aware, to this day, of any transfer of actual nuclear \n     material. But we are aware, of course, of the transfer of \n     nuclear technology, or we became aware of this. The North \n     Koreans subsequently stated, and it's part of our agreement, \n     that they have no--no ongoing proliferation activity. We \n     wanted that statement to be expanded to acknowledge the fact \n     that they were proliferating. And so, what they did was they \n     acknowledged our concerns about it, they did not acknowledge \n     their past activities.\n       Do I think that is an honest reaction from the North \n     Koreans, is that in the spirit of what we're trying to do? \n     No, it isn't. The North Koreans are--are a people who try to \n     play by their own set of rules and it is difficult to get \n     things done with them. We felt it was--given that we had \n     assurances that they had stopped, but more importantly we had \n     indications that it stopped.\n       Because frankly, getting assurances or getting any \n     statements from the North Koreans are not what we're after, \n     we're after facts not statements.\n       But when we saw that the activities had stopped, we felt it \n     was worthwhile to continue the effort to disable their \n     nuclear facilities in Yongbyon because at the end of the day, \n     if we can prevent the North Korean nuclear problem from \n     becoming a bigger problem than it is--right now it is a 30 \n     kilo problem. Had we not succeeded in shutting down their \n     facilities and in disabling their facilities, that 30 kilo \n     problem could have been a 60 kilo problem, a 100 kilo \n     problem. But I--I am the first to say, Senator, that the job \n     is not done. They have some 30 kilos and we can not rest \n     until we get the 30 kilos from them.\n       The issue that I've had to deal with as an implementer of a \n     policy, and I want to stress there was a chain of command \n     here and I was not off on my own. I was receiving \n     instructions pretty much on a daily basis, and during the \n     actual negotiations I received instructions even from \n     Secretary Rice--that our effort was to try to shut down and \n     disable the production of nuclear materials and then to--to \n     continue and get them to put on the table the nuclear \n     materials they had already produced, that is the 30 kilos.\n       And it was at that phase, which did not come, but that was \n     the phase where we anticipated--and where I explained to \n     Senator Brownback--that is that next phase that we would be \n     prepared, and in return for that nuclear material on the \n     table, we would be prepared to launch a normalization effort \n     with the North Koreans.\n       Senator Brownback, quite rightly, and I fully respect this \n     position, said, ``We can't be\n\n[[Page S4433]]\n\n     normalizing with a country with one of the world's worst \n     human rights records.'' And so, I quite--by the way, I really \n     respect that position as someone who's dealt with human \n     rights in my 30-some, 32-year career, I know about that, I \n     know very well about that--so I agreed to recommend, and \n     Secretary Rice completely agreed with this, to create a human \n     rights track. So as we're going forward in normalization--\n     this was not just going to be a normalization, you give up \n     the nukes and we treat you like you're some ally--this is a \n     normalization that would include dealing with some of the \n     issues that, serious issues that stand between us.\n       And so, that is what I--what I supported doing and I regret \n     that we were not able to get the verification agreement that \n     would have allowed us to get onto this next phase.\n       Senator Wicker: Thank you.\n       Senator Wicker: [Quoting an article by Stephen Hayes in the \n     Weekly Standard] ``Secretary of State, Condoleezza Rice, had \n     given Hill permission to meet face to face with the North \n     Koreans, but only on the condition that diplomats from China \n     were also in the room. Although the Chinese participated in \n     the early moments of the discussions, they soon left, Hill \n     did not leave them.\n       Now, the article goes on to say that Secretary Rice was \n     angry with you, and that CNN reporter Mike Chenoi wrote, \n     ``Although Rice remained supportive of reviving the \n     diplomatic process, Hill had held the bilateral discussion \n     with North Korean negotiator Kim Chyguan in defiance of her \n     instructions.'' And the author, Hayes, of this article \n     concludes that the Secretary of State expressly forbade you \n     from participating in the bilateral talks, but that you \n     thought otherwise. So, this is an opportunity for you to give \n     us your version of that.\n       Mr. Hill: Well, thank you, thank you very much. Actually, \n     what this was--was the start of the--this was in the summer \n     of 2005, and this was an effort to get the Six Party process \n     going, because the North Koreans had boycotted.\n       And so, what Secretary Rice agreed to--to do, was to have \n     bilateral talk--a bilateral meeting--with the understanding \n     that the North Koreans would then announce, at the end of the \n     bilateral meeting, their participation in the Six Party \n     process, but she wanted the Chinese to be there.\n       The Chinese came, but the North Koreans were not willing to \n     carry on the meeting with the Chinese, so I was there in the \n     meeting room, the North Koreans were arriving, and the \n     Chinese were disappearing.\n       So, the question I had--and Secretary Rice was in the air \n     between Anchorage, where she had a refueling stop--and coming \n     into Beijing. So, the audible I had to call at that point \n     was, do I continue the meeting or do I walk out? And I made a \n     judgment to continue the meeting.\n       We had the meeting, and at the end of the meeting, the \n     North Koreans announced that they were returning to the Six \n     Party process. Secretary Rice arrived that night in Beijing \n     and in the morning--and I remember this very clearly--she \n     was--she was quite angry, but quite angry with the Chinese \n     for not having remained through the process. And she \n     expressed that directly to the Chinese Foreign Minister in a \n     meeting that I--that I attended, that is the next morning.\n       So that was the incident, with respect to the--to the \n     meeting with the North Koreans.\n       I know there's some journalists who've tried to make this a \n     rather dramatic moment, quite frankly, it was a little less \n     dramatic than some of the journalistic retellings of it.\n       Senator Wicker. Was she angry with you?\n       Mr. Hill. Not to my knowledge. She was angry with the \n     Chinese for not persevering.\n       Senator Wicker. You and she did not have a verbal \n     confrontation about your audible that you called?\n       Mr. Hill. Never.\n       Senator Lugar. . . . Now, let me just say, Ambassador Hill, \n     you have tried in your opening responses to the chairman's \n     questions to talk about the experience with regard to \n     diplomacy and Iraq, and I have attempted in my opening \n     comments to indicate what I saw to be regional implications, \n     not only the shoring up and strengthening of the Iraqi \n     government.\n       But for this record, would you respond to Senator Brownback \n     and to others that I have cited personally and from this \n     quote who have raised serious questions about testimony about \n     the South Korean nominee before and the holdup in the Armed \n     Services Committee and other issues that need to be addressed \n     as a part of our moving this nomination forward?\n       Ambassador Hill. Senator, I would be happy to do so.\n       First of all, I want to make very clear that I very much \n     respect Senator Brownback's concern about human rights. These \n     are concerns that are deeply felt, and they are well placed. \n     I have said on a number of occasions--and I will say it again \n     here--that the North Korean human rights record is one of the \n     worst in the world. There is no question it is one of the \n     worst in the world, and I have had those conversations with \n     Senator Brownback.\n       Now, with respect to the specific issues that he raised or \n     were raised in the Armed Services Committee, I would like to \n     make a couple of points.\n       What I agreed to do was that as we were going through the \n     phase two of the disablement process and verification of the \n     North Korean nuclear declaration, we anticipated moving on to \n     phase three, or a next phase, if you look in the transcript. \n     And what I told Senator Brownback we would do in that next \n     phase was to--the next phase was to include bilateral \n     normalization talks with the North Koreans.\n       Now, of course, we were not ever going to normalize with \n     North Korea until it had done away with all of its nuclear \n     materials and nuclear ambitions. But the plan was in phase \n     three to sit down with the North Koreans for talks aimed at \n     normalization.\n       I told Senator Brownback that when we got to that stage, I \n     would be prepared to support--and I emphasized I would be \n     prepared to support because I did not make the decisions. The \n     decisions were made by Secretary Rice and an interagency \n     group, but I would be prepared to support the creation of a \n     human rights track within the normalization talks.\n       And what did I have in mind for a human rights track? I \n     thought we could, in this track, acquaint the North Koreans \n     with the fact that if their aspiration is to join the \n     international community, which was the whole concept of the \n     Six Party Talks, they would have to do something about their \n     human rights record. Specifically, we would look at whether \n     we could, for example, give them lists of prisoners of \n     conscience, of whom there are many in North Korea. We would \n     also look to see whether we could stand up some activities, \n     for example, help them with their criminal procedures code or \n     things like that, work with other countries on this. So I \n     told Senator Brownback that we would create, in the context \n     of this bilateral normalization working group, a human rights \n     track.\n       The second point concerned his concern that the human \n     rights envoy who was envoy from 2005 and 2009, and Senator \n     Brownback was concerned that this envoy should be made a part \n     of the six parties. I told Senator Brownback that I would \n     support--indeed, that I would invite the envoy to any \n     negotiations with the North Koreans that did not deal with \n     nuclear matters, that is, anything beyond nuclear, he would \n     be a participant in. In fact, this statement on my part is \n     addressed in a press release that Senator Brownback issued on \n     July 31st, 2008.\n       The problem, Senator, was that we were not able to get \n     beyond phase two. We were not able to get beyond phase two \n     because, although the North Koreans did issue a nuclear \n     declaration, we did not get adequate verification measures to \n     verify the entire declaration. We got some verification \n     measures. We got their agreement to allow people to visit \n     sites. We got their agreement to allow people to visit sites \n     that are not already listed on their declaration. We got them \n     to agree to give us documentation on how the reactor \n     operated. That is, we got daily production records from them \n     from 1986 so that we could track the production of the \n     reactor, and that would help verify whether, indeed, they had \n     produced 30 kilos versus 35.\n       So we got some verification, but what we were seeking was a \n     fuller international standard verification of the type that \n     one would have in the context of a country that has \n     completely denuclearized and a verification that would be \n     familiar to anyone who has dealt with the IAEA.\n       So we were not able to get that, and therefore, we were not \n     able to complete phase two, and therefore, we never got on to \n     having these bilateral talks. And so that is why we were not \n     able to do that.\n       Senator Lugar. Thank you.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Senator Lugar asked him about this. He said specifically \nthat, yes, he would have been willing to have the additional \nparticipation of the human rights appointee at the talks, but that \nreferred to the talks when they moved beyond the nuclear component. The \nfact is that he said to Senator Lugar in committee that they never got \nto that phase. I will quote him:\n\n       We were not able to get beyond phase two because although \n     the North Koreans did issue a nuclear declaration, we did not \n     get adequate verification measures to verify the entire \n     declaration. We got some verification measures.\n\n  Then he goes on about that. He says:\n\n       But what we were seeking was a fuller international \n     standard verification, and we were not able to complete phase \n     two. Therefore, we never got on to having the bilateral \n     talks.\n\n  They never got to the period where he would have been perfectly \nhappy, as he always was, to deal with the human rights issues.\n  The fact is, Ambassador Hill has explained this. I respect Senator \nBrownback's long track record of outspokenness on human rights. What he \nhas shown there in those photographs is unacceptable. It is \nunacceptable to all of us. But the fact is, Chris Hill, following the \nPresident's instructions, kept his primary focus on the \ndenuclearization, while also trying to address a host of other \nconcerns, including human rights, missile proliferation, \ncounterfeiting, drug smuggling, and other illicit activities. That \nfocus was entirely appropriate given the direct threat to our security. \nMoreover, those who criticize him for not\n\n[[Page S4434]]\n\naccomplishing more in the area of human rights ought to appreciate that \nhe was, in fact, implementing the specific daily instructions he was \nreceiving. If they don't like that policy, then their real complaint is \nagainst President Bush and the Secretary of State.\n  I will have more to say about this tomorrow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I appreciate my colleague from \nMassachusetts and his statement, as well as the ranking member.\n  This was Chris Hill's strategy in North Korea. He was Assistant \nSecretary of East Asia and Pacific Affairs during the same period of \ntime. It was a failed strategy. We should have him in the middle of \ndesigning our diplomatic strategy toward Iraq on such a failure, where \nhe will be coming back before this body asking us for support?\n  I will have more to say on this tomorrow.\n  I will file a bill tonight for myself and several other cosponsors \nasking that we consider, at the same time as we consider the Chris Hill \nnomination, reimposing sanctions on North Korea that were lifted during \nthe Bush negotiations. The North Koreans, over this recess, launched a \nmissile and are being investigated for selling uranium to the Iranians. \nClearly, we have it within our power to put U.S. sanctions back on \nNorth Korea, and that should take place. I hope that during the process \nof discussing Chris Hill's worthiness for the Iraqi post, which I do \nnot support, we will also vote to put sanctions back on North Korea \nthat were lifted. Clearly, that should take place. I will be filing \nthis bill tonight and asking for its consideration tomorrow.\n  I yield back my time and urge a ``no'' vote on cloture against \nAmbassador Hill.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley).

Mr. President, 2 days ago, Roxana Saberi from Fargo, ND, \nwas convicted of espionage by an Iranian revolutionary court and \nsentenced to 8 years in prison after a very brief trial that was held \nbehind closed doors.\n  I have said very little publicly about this case But when the \nsentence was announced, I said I thought it was a terrible miscarriage \nof justice. I don't come to the floor today to inflame the passions \nabout this issue, but I wish to, for a few moments, say some words \nabout Roxana Saberi and to urge the Iranian Government to do the right \nthing and release this young woman from prison and allow her to come \nhome to the United States.\n  Roxana Saberi is not a spy. She is an Iranian American. She was born \nand raised and educated in Fargo, ND. Her father is Iranian, which \nmeans she has dual citizenship. She went to Iran as a journalist \nbecause she is interested in the culture of the country which her \nfather came from.\n  I know Roxana and her family, and let me tell you a bit about the \nyoung woman who sits today in a prison in Iran. Roxana was born in \nFargo, ND, 31 years ago. Her father Reza is an Iranian, her mother \nAkiko is Japanese. She is a 1994 honors graduate of Fargo North High \nSchool. She was active in music and soccer and key club and dance. She \nis a member of that high school's hall of fame. She earned a double \nmajor in French and communications in 1997 from Concordia College in \nMoorhead, MN. She was active in music and a sports star in soccer. She \nreported for the campus television and newspaper. In 1997, she was \nselected as Miss North Dakota. In 1997, she was one of the 10 finalists \nin the Miss America Pageant. When she received her Miss North Dakota \ntitle, Roxana said her aim was to encourage other young people to \nappreciate cultural differences. That ambition led her to a career in \njournalism.\n  In 1999, she completed a master's degree in broadcast journalism from \nNorthwestern University in Chicago, IL. In 2000, she received a \nmaster's degree in international relations from Cambridge University in \nEngland. She\n\n[[Page S4435]]\n\nmoved in 2003 to Iran as a freelance journalist. She reported for \nNational Public Radio, Fox News, and the BBC. This is a young woman of \ngreat accomplishment. She has two master's degrees, she has a great \neducation, and she so celebrated her culture that she wanted to spend \ntime in the country of Iran, where her father was born, and she did \nreporting in the country of Iran. She stayed in Iran after her press \ncredentials lapsed in 2006. She stayed to write a book and complete \nwork on a master's degree in Iranian studies and international \nrelations.\n  At the end of January in this year, Roxana was picked up and sent to \nprison. She was held nearly 2 months without charge in a prison outside \nof Tehran. As I indicated, this Saturday she was convicted of espionage \nand sentenced to 8 years in prison. The trial was a brief closed-door \ntrial, and this young woman was not allowed to speak in her own \ndefense.\n  Since Roxana Saberi was convicted and sentenced on Saturday, \nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has sent a letter to the Tehran's \nprosecutor saying Roxana's rights must not be violated in any way and \nhe asked the prosecutor to ensure that she is allowed to offer a full \ndefense in her appeal.\n  In addition, the head of Iran's judiciary has ordered a ``quick and \nfair'' appeal of Roxana's case. Perhaps they understand that because of \nworldwide attention to the imprisonment of this young woman, Iran's \ncredibility is on trial as well. When Iranian authorities review \nRoxana's cases, they will see she has not been granted the basic human \nand judicial rights that are guaranteed--or supposed to be guaranteed--\nunder Iran's Constitution and penal code.\n  As I said, she was arrested in late January, she was held without \ncharge and kept without communication with her family for weeks before \nbeing allowed to call her parents in faring Fargo, ND. It took about 6 \nweeks before she was allowed to see the lawyer who was hired by her \nparents. At first, she was told she was imprisoned because she bought a \nbottle of wine, and the person who sold her the bottle of wine had \nreported it to Iranian authorities. Then she was accused of working as \na journalist without a valid press card. Finally, she was accused of \nespionage, of spying for the United States, and at the trial--conducted \nbehind closed doors, according to her lawyer--was not allowed to speak \nin her own defense.\n  Roxana Saberi's parents have traveled to Iran to work on their \ndaughter's behalf. They say they have been treated courteously by \nIranian officials. They have now been able to visit Roxana in prison, \nand they have been allowed to work with the lawyer and speak to the \npress. I visited with Roxana's father today and a couple times last \nweek. He is enormously gratified at the outpouring of support for \nRoxana from all around the world. President Obama, I know, has spoken \nof this issue, Secretary Clinton, media outlets around the world and \nnongovernment organizations, foreign governments and the European Union \nhave all appealed on her behalf. Roxana's father has indicated she has \nnot been abused in prison but that she is frail, has lost weight, and \nhe fears she may not survive in prison for a lengthy term.\n  Some have said this case suggests we shouldn't have any dialogue or \ndiscussions with Iran. I think quite the opposite. One of the \ndifficulties of this case is that an American citizen has been \nimprisoned unfairly in Iran and then charged and tried and sentenced \nunfairly. We have no embassy and no Ambassador in Iran, so we must work \nthrough the Swiss Embassy, which is the protecting power for American \ncitizens in Iran.\n  My hope is that as a result of what has happened internationally and \nas a result of what we have heard from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \nand the chief of Iran's judicial system, the Iranian authorities will \nunderstand this is a travesty of justice; that this doesn't meet any \nstandard of fairness and that Roxana Saberi is not--is not, I repeat--a \nspy. My hope is the Iranian authorities will decide enough is enough, \nand they will allow this young woman to be freed from prison and to \ntravel back to this country.\n  She is an American citizen, born, raised, and educated in this \ncountry. The Iranians make the case she is an Iranian citizen. That \nignores the fact that she was born and raised and educated here. She is \nan American citizen. To have an American citizen imprisoned in Iran, \nheld 2 months without charge, and then charged in a closed-door trial \nwith espionage is, in my judgment, an affront to fairness, and I think \nit is an unbelievable miscarriage of justice. My fervent hope is the \nIranian authorities will do what should be done in this case and \nrecognize that a miscarriage has occurred. They have the ability and \nthe capability to rectify it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to first address the matter \nof Roxana Saberi, a young woman from our home State. Roxana Saberi is \nsomeone I know. She has interviewed me many times. Roxana is a \njournalist, and a very good one. She is somebody who had parents with \nIranian tradition and legacy in their family. She went to Iran to learn \nmore about her own legacy, her own inheritance. She was always \nimpressed by what she had learned about the Iranian people. She is \nsomeone who loves the Iranian people and respects their culture. She is \nsomeone who was there in a role as a reporter, providing reports to \nNational Public Radio as well as British Broadcasting. So it was with \namazement that we heard of these charges, as Senator Dorgan outlined \ncorrectly, first being told she was jailed because she had bought a \nbottle of wine, then told she had filed reports without a proper \nauthorization, and then the stunning news that she was being charged \nwith espionage and put through a 1-day trial in which she was not able \nto speak in her own defense. These are circumstances which require us \nto speak out and to ask the judicial system in Iran to provide a swift \nappeal and allow Roxana to come home. She was sentenced Saturday to 8 \nyears in prison. Her family reports that while she is not being \nmistreated, she is somebody who is vulnerable. This has been very \ndifficult for her. So we ask the Iranian authorities to give her a \nswift appeal and allow her to return to the United States.\n  Roxana is someone I know well. She is a warm, loving person, somebody \nwho is well regarded as a journalist in my home State, someone about \nwhom I think anyone who would meet her would say: Here is someone who \nis proud of her heritage, proud of the history of the Iranian culture, \nand somebody who loves the Iranian people.\n  I was encouraged that President Ahmadinejad has indicated that he \nwould like to see the court provide justice and that he has asked them \nto take up the appeal swiftly and to give Roxana and her defense all of \nthe opportunities anyone should be able to expect if they are charged \nwith such serious crimes.\n  I make my own personal appeal here on the floor of the Senate this \nevening. Roxana is somebody, as I have said, I know well. She is a \nterrific reporter, has interviewed me many times. There is no question \nin my mind that Roxana was in Iran for the purpose of preparing a book \non the people of Iran and to do reports to NPR, British Broadcasting, \nand even to outlets back home.\n  I hope the Iranian authorities will think very carefully about how \nthey are seen on the world stage based on how they treat this young \nreporter. Like all of us in public life, we are judged by what we do. \nWe are held accountable. I hope the Iranian authorities are thinking \nvery carefully about how they will be seen in this matter. I plead with \nthem to release Roxana and to permit her to come home. She is a North \nDakotan. She is someone of whom we are very proud. She is a reporter. \nShe deserves to be released.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4435-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4435-S4436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO SERGEANT FIRST CLASS LARRY HAWKS\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to honor a brave \nKentuckian and soldier who has been awarded the Silver Star for valor \nin defense of our country.\n  SFC Larry Hawks, a native of Edmonson County in my home Commonwealth \nof Kentucky, received our Nation's third highest award for gallantry in \naction against an enemy of the United States. Those rare few who \nreceive the Silver Star do so because of their display of selfless \nsacrifice and\n\n[[Page S4436]]\n\nunparalleled courage under fire and Sergeant First Class Hawks has \ncertainly demonstrated that to his fellow soldiers.\n  Sergeant First Class Hawks showed his bravery and patriotism to all \nduring a 14-hour battle in 115-degree heat while stationed in \nAfghanistan on July 25, 2005. That morning on combat patrol in the \nOruzgan province, his unit encountered and gave chase to a large number \nof enemy fighters. Our soldiers soon found themselves facing an intense \nvolley of fire from machine guns, small arms and rocket-propelled \ngrenades.\n  Without regard for his own safety, Sergeant First Class Hawks came \nout from behind cover to draw and return enemy fire while directing his \nunit into position to more effectively engage the enemy. He also \ndirected fire from Apache gunships overhead. He passed up a chance to \nmove to a safer position and insisted on staying in the best vantage \npoint over the enemy.\n  ``There were times when some of the guys thought that we weren't \ngoing to make it,'' Sergeant First Class Hawks was quoted as saying \nafter the ordeal. ``But I was thinking, you may not, but I am coming \nout of this. That was my whole thought process.''\n  SFC Larry Hawks's service is continuing proof that there is no finer \nfighting man on the face of the Earth than the American soldier. \nAccordingly, a ceremony was held last December at the U.S. Army John F. \nKennedy Special Warfare Center and School, in Fort Bragg, NC, for him \nto receive this honored award.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing Sergeant \nFirst Class Hawks for the many sacrifices he has made to our country. \nWe Kentuckians are honored to know and be among such heroes.\n  I also ask unanimous consent that the full article from the \nBrownsville, KY, Edmonson News of March 19, 2009, detailing SFC Larry \nHawks's service and the actions that led to the awarding of his Silver \nStar, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Edmonson News, Mar. 19, 2009]\n\n       SFC Larry Hawks Awarded Silver Star for Defending Comrades\n\n       Edmonson County native Larry Hawks, a 1988 graduate of \n     Edmonson County High School, was recently awarded the \n     nation's third-highest honor for valor in combat, the Silver \n     Star.\n       Sergeant First Class Hawks's extraordinary acts of heroism \n     while engaged in a military operation in Afghanistan were \n     witnessed by his comrades.\n       Hawks, his wife Callie, and their four children Tristan, \n     10; Lorin, 8; Addie, 6; and Aidan, 4, reside in Salemburg, \n     N.C.\n       In a letter to superiors, it was explained by Sfc. Donald \n     Grambusch that during a 14-hour battle in 115-degree heat, \n     and taking enemy fire from every angle, Hawks, with disregard \n     for his own personal safety, returned fire during their ATV \n     movement which enabled other ATVs in the group to reach \n     sufficient cover. Hawks then directed Apache gunships fire \n     onto the enemy, while using his own weapon to defend their \n     position.\n       Hawks was recommended for the Distinguished Service Cross \n     for his bravery.\n       In addition to the Silver Star, Hawks has attained a long \n     list of accolades and awards throughout his distinguished \n     military career.\n       During his tenure of duty with the 82nd Airborne Division \n     Hawks served in Panama, Egypt, Desert Shield and Desert \n     Storm. In 1992 Hawks was assigned to the XVII Airborne Corps' \n     Long Range Surveillance Co.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a \ndedicated philanthropist from my home State of Kentucky, Jerrilyn Dyer. \nMrs. Dyer is well known in her community for her bright smile and \ncomforting personality.\n  Mrs. Dyer has contributed countless hours to Kentucky through her \nvolunteer work, including helping at the Pattie A. Clay Hospital Gift \nShop and with the Home Meals Delivery service, helping to better the \nlives of so many over the years. In addition to her work in Kentucky, \nshe was also well known for her volunteer work in Indiana particularly \nin Madison County.\n  Along with all her volunteer work, Jerrilyn is a dedicated wife, \nmother, and grandmother and finds time to travel with her husband of 49 \nyears, Jack, and enjoys spending time with her two children and four \ngrandchildren.\n  Recently, the Richmond Register in Richmond, Kentucky, published an \narticle detailing Mrs. Dyer's service and accomplishments. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Congressional \nRecord.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Jerrilyn \nDyer and her service to the Commonwealth.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Richmond Register, Mar. 28, 2009]\n\n               Jerrilyn Dyer: A Non-Stop Volunteer Force\n\n                          (By Ronica Shannon)\n\n       Jerrilyn Dyer, 67, and her husband Jack moved to Madison \n     County from central Indiana in 1967 when Jack accepted a \n     teaching position at the Eastern Kentucky University.\n       She has been an active part of the community in several \n     areas ever since. Jack began his doctoral studies and the \n     couple moved to Lexington in 1969, only to return to Richmond \n     in the fall of 1989.\n       The two graduated from high school in Spencer, Ind. \n     Jerrilyn graduated from Kentucky Christian College with a \n     teaching degree in 1989.\n       She refers to herself as `a late bloomer.' Jerrilyn is \n     involved with several volunteer organizations in the \n     community including Home Meals Delivery, which delivers \n     midday meals to homebound residents and hosts the annual \n     ``Empty Bowls Friday.''\n       She also is a member of the Madison County Republican \n     Women's Club, which is affiliated with the National \n     Federation of Republican Women. The organization supports the \n     Republican Party and Republican candidates.\n       ``I have served in many capacities for the party and worked \n     as a poll officer,'' she said. ``I feel strongly about voting \n     and each citizen's duty to do so. It's not only a \n     responsibility, but a privilege to participate in our \n     government. There's great satisfaction in helping make our \n     community environment a better place in which to live.\n       ``We need to continually support competent people in our \n     community leadership,'' she said.\n       No matter the circumstances, Jerrilyn always seems to have \n     a smile on her face and laughter in her voice. How does she \n     do it? Simple. She thrives at what she does.\n       ``I love volunteering time and effort to several causes,'' \n     she said. ``It always blesses me more than what I give. Home \n     Meals Delivery, for instance, is a program started in 1980 \n     when there was a need. It's not the federally funded program \n     started by the government, but is a locally endowed program \n     relying on volunteers. I have been involved with it for about \n     15 years since I first heard of it at a club meeting. I am \n     currently serving on the board.''\n       Jerrilyn also is a volunteer at the Pattie A. Clay Hospital \n     Gift Shop and has seen the expansion of the shop over the \n     years.\n       ``It's a lot of fun selling gift items and talking with all \n     the customers who many times just need a friendly listener,'' \n     she said.\n       Proceeds from the shop benefit the hospital needs.\n       ``Just recently we were able to donate several thousand \n     dollars for the new East Wing Project,'' she said. ``I've \n     been a member of the Richmond Woman's Club for several years \n     and have participated with the ladies on several community \n     projects including Habitat for Humanity, New Opportunity \n     School for Women, The Salvation Army and (local) veterans \n     (organizations).''\n       Aside from volunteering, Jerrilyn also has worked as a \n     secretary for several businesses and organizations, \n     including: Westinghouse in Bloomington, Ind.; Indiana State \n     University and 8th Avenue Baptist Church and at Christian \n     Student Fellowship on the University of Kentucky Campus.\n       ``I've also done substitute teaching and been a teacher's \n     aide, and a merchandiser for Gibson Greetings,'' she said.\n       Jerrilyn and her husband will celebrate 49 years of \n     marriage this year. The two have a son who is a high school \n     basketball coach (honored as coach of the year in his \n     conference this year) and he teaches in Bristol, Tenn. Their \n     daughter has taught special education for years and is a \n     teacher consultant for six counties, including Shelby County, \n     where she is a resident.\n       ``We have four adorable grandchildren--two girls and two \n     boys,'' she said ``It is truly great being grandparents.''\n       She and her husband enjoy traveling and have made it all \n     over the United States.\n       Throughout the years, she and her husband have visited all \n     50 states, all the presidential libraries, all 30 Major \n     League Baseball parks and all the Kentucky state resort \n     parks.\n       They also spend a lot of time shopping for their \n     grandchildren and playing cards with friends, she said.\n\n[[Page S4437]]\n\n       The church also plays a large role in the Dyers' life.\n       She and her husband have been active members of Gardenside \n     Christian Church in Lexington, where their children grew up.\n       ``Over the years we've been Sunday School teachers, youth \n     sponsors, Bible School leaders, etc.'' Jerrilyn said. \n     ``Currently, we're on the Missions and Benevolence Committees \n     and members of a Sunday School Class. I've served in a \n     Women's Circle and Jack is on the board as an elder and \n     deacon.''\n       So why is volunteering in her community so important to \n     Jerrilyn? ``There is much to be said for volunteering in a \n     community,'' she said. ``It can promote so much good will \n     among the citizens and can give a special spirit of unity and \n     pride. Volunteers can get so many projects done that \n     otherwise wouldn't be possible using only its paid staff. \n     And, of course, the volunteer probably gets back more than he \n     or she gives.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4437-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Corporal Jason G.

Mr. President, while Congress was in recess, Rwanda \ncommemorated the 15-year anniversary of the genocide. Fifteen years \nago, a deliberate, centrally planned, and organized campaign of mass \nmurder and rape was set in motion, which displaced millions and \neventually took the lives of over 800,000 people. People were killed \nsimply because of their ethnicity or political beliefs or an \nunwillingness to participate in the violence. The unspeakable acts of \nterror that ensued over those months in 1994 shocked the world, and yet \nthe international community, including the United States, failed to \nact. The promises of ``never again'' rang hollow.\n  Fifteen years later, Rwandans have come a long way to repair their \nlives and rebuild their institutions. I am pleased that the \nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda and the Gacaca Courts \ncontinue to work to bring to justice those guilty of the most egregious \ncrimes. Accountability is an essential step to promote healing for the \nsurvivors and to prevent a return to conflict in Rwanda. At the same \ntime, I have been deeply moved that many survivors of this terror have \nbeen willing to forgive and live side by side with many of those who \nparticipated in it. Continuing to foster tolerance and openness, and \nensure there is sufficient political space for dissent and discussion \nis critical to maintain future stability in Rwanda.\n  As a Washington Post editorial recently noted, while the current \nRwanda government has made impressive ``accomplishments in righting its \ncountry and improving basic services it continues to be intolerant of \ncriticism.'' According to the State Department's reports and those of \nnon-governmental organizations, there is a worrying pattern of \nrepression in Rwanda against political opponents and civil society. \nOver the long run, suppression and intimidation can undermine security \nrather than protect it, forcing healthy debates into illicit channels, \nand casting doubt on the legitimacy of the prevailing order. If this \npattern continues, it could intensify Rwanda's ethnic and social \ntensions, and ultimately lead to future conflicts.\n  Rwanda has become a good friend and partner of the United States over \nthe years, and our countries have worked together on many important \njoint initiatives. Most notably, they have become a leader on the \nAfrican continent in responding to mass atrocities and contributing to \npeacekeeping operations. This is deeply inspiring given all that they \nhave gone through, and we should continue to work with them to prevent \nfuture genocide and mass atrocity. However, we fail to be true friends \nto the people of Rwanda when we turn a blind eye to patterns of \nrepression in their country, or fail to raise our voices in support of \ncivil and political rights. As we remember those tragic events 15 years \nago and commemorate those who perished, we should resolve to pay close \nattention to the present. The people of Rwanda deserve more than our \nregret; they deserve our support for their efforts to build a more \njust, more free and more secure future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4437-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4437-S4438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   HOMELESS EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE AND RAPID TRANSITION TO HOUSING ACT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the introduction of S. \n808, the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid Transition to Housing \nAct or ``HEARTH'' Act, which I am very proud to cosponsor. The HEARTH \nAct is a landmark housing bill as it significantly improves Federal \nprograms designed to end and prevent the tragedy of homelessness that \nafflicts too many American individuals and families.\n  Before I offer some comments on the bill, I praise Senator Jack Reed \nfor his long-term commitment and hard work on addressing homelessness. \nSenator Reed has been a longtime leader in housing issues and I value \nthe strong partnership we have had over the past several years. I also \napplaud his staff, led by Kara Stein, who has worked tirelessly and \npatiently over the past 8 years on homeless legislation. Further, I \nwould be remiss to not mention the work of our former colleague, \nSenator Wayne Allard, who also was heavily involved in this legislation \nbefore he retired from this Chamber. Finally, I thank Nan Roman of the \nNational Alliance to End Homelessness and Dr. Dennis Culhane of the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania School of Social Policy and Practice who \nhave provided us invaluable insights and research on homelessness that \nhelped guide our policy work.\n  Over 20 years ago, the Federal Government took its first major step \nin addressing the plight of homelessness through the enactment of the \nStewart B. McKinney Homeless Assistance Act, which was later renamed \nthe McKinney-Vento Act after the death of Representative Bruce Vento \nwho was an early advocate of the law. When this comprehensive law was \nenacted back in 1987, some legislators thought that homelessness was a \ntemporary problem that could be solved in a few years. Unfortunately, \nthis was clearly not the case. Despite billions of private and public \ndollars spent on the homeless, millions of veterans, families, \ndisabled, and children have and continue to experience the sad tragedy \nof living without a home.\n  Fortunately, homelessness is not a hopeless situation. As the former \nchair and current ranking member of the Senate Appropriations \nsubcommittee that funds most of the Federal homeless programs, I have \nworked with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--especially \nSenators Barbara Mikulski and Patty Murray--to ensure resources were \nbeing provided to the appropriate programs. This is an important task \nand I am proud of being in position to make a difference.\n  We learned that throwing money at the problem was not going to solve \nhomelessness but that a smarter, more effective approach was needed. \nSpecifically, we learned that providing permanent supportive housing \nwas the key component in solving homelessness, especially those \nconsidered to be chronically homeless. Research led by Dr. Culhane \nfound that chronically homeless received housing primarily through \nregular, long-term use of the emergency shelter system. Serving the\n\n[[Page S4438]]\n\nchronically homeless through emergency shelters interfered with their \ntreatment regimen, resulting in costly hospital and jail stays. \nFurther, local emergency systems became clogged with permanent users, \nreducing their ability to address the more temporary problems of \nfamilies and individuals who are homeless because of an economic \ncrisis. Moving away from emergency shelter programs to permanent \nsupportive housing has become the most critical change over the past \nseveral years and based on recent studies and programs I have seen in \nmy home state of Missouri, it has clearly worked.\n  To implement this approach, I worked with Senator Mikulski to include \na provision, beginning in fiscal year 1999 VA-HUD Appropriations Act \nand carried every year thereafter, to require that at east 30 percent \nof the Department of Housing and Urban Development's--HUD--homeless \nassistance grants be used for permanent housing. Focusing a significant \namount of funds towards permanent housing helped reverse the revolving \ndoor for the homeless using local emergency systems.\n  We also learned the importance of gathering data and analyzing the \ncharacteristics of our homeless population to design and target funds \nto programs needed to serve the homeless. The establishment of the \nHomeless Management Information Systems or HMIS through HUD has now \nbecome a critical tool for local continuum of care systems throughout \nthe Nation in addressing their particular homeless populations. \nRequiring and funding HMIS systems through the VA-HUD appropriations \nbill was another critical component.\n\n  Finally, we learned that despite the involvement of several Federal \nagencies in serving the homeless, there were gaps in services and \ncoordination was lacking. Again, I worked with my colleagues to \nreactivate the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness to improve \nFederal, State, and local coordination of homeless programs. We also \nrequired that 25 percent of HUD homeless funds used for supportive \nservices be matched with other funds to expand funding for these needs \nby encouraging other Federal agencies such as the Department of Health \nand Human Services and Department of Veterans Affairs to meet their \nobligations.\n  The HEARTH Act codifies these important provisions that have been \ncarried in appropriations and builds on our work over the past several \nyears. In addition, the act includes a number of other important \nprovisions that create a new program to assist rural communities help \nthe homeless, increases local flexibility by combining HUD's \ncompetitive grant programs, and provides incentives to house rapidly \nhomeless families.\n  Homelessness is a national tragedy. We are reminded of this tragedy \nwhen walking around Washington, DC, St. Louis, and other towns and \ncities across the Nation. It is my hope that one day, our Nation's \nhomeless will not be worrying about where they will receive their next \nmeal or where they will be sleeping that night. It is an unacceptable \nsituation. But by working together with advocates, the private sector, \nand government, we can solve homelessness. The HEARTH Act is a prime \nexample of that partnership and advances our ability to end \nhomelessness.\n  Updating and improving our homeless programs is even more critical as \nmore Americans face the prospects of homelessness due to the economic \ndownturn. The housing crisis has already displaced many families and \nindividuals creating more strain on social safety net and homeless \nprograms.\n  Again, I thank Senator Jack Reed for his leadership and commitment on \nhomeless issues and I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation so it can be enacted as soon as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4438-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   JOHN J.

Mr. President, on March 27 colleagues of Congressman \nJimmy Duncan from the House of Representatives gathered in Knoxville to \ncelebrate the naming of Lincoln Memorial University's John J. Duncan, \nJr. School of Law.\n  This is an appropriate honor both for Congressman Duncan and for the \nuniversity.\n  The proposed Duncan School of Law received Tennessee Board of Law \nExaminer approval last month. This allows its graduates to be eligible \nto sit for the bar exam in Tennessee.\n  LMU has already submitted a letter of intent to pursue accreditation \nfor the proposed law school. It hopes to begin admitting students and \nbegin classes in August of this year. That first class will consist of \napproximately 75 part-time students. The full-time program will begin \nin fall 2010 and consist of another 125 students.\n  Congressman Duncan earned his journalism degree at the University of \nTennessee, Knoxville, and his law degree at George Washington \nUniversity. He has served as Captain in the U.S. Army National Guard \nand practiced law in Knoxville.\n  In 1981, when I was Governor of Tennessee, I appointed Jimmy Duncan \nas State trial judge. He served until 1988 and I was always proud of \nthat appointment.\n  It is especially appropriate to combine the names of President \nLincoln and the Duncan family. President Lincoln proposed creating the \nuniversity as a gesture to the mountain people who fought with the \nUnion in the Civil War. The Duncans, like the Alexanders and many \nothers, were early Scotch-Irish settlers who remained loyal Lincolnites \neven though the State of Tennessee seceded from the Union. So have been \nmost of the people in the Second Congressional District that \nCongressman Duncan and his father have served. The district has elected \nonly Republicans to the Congress since Abraham Lincoln was President.\n  President Lincoln once said that education ``is the most important \nsubject which we as a people can be engaged in.'' Naming Lincoln \nMemorial University's law school for Congressman John J. Duncan, Jr., \nunites two great traditions that will encourage educational excellence \nin our region.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4438-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4438-S4439]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows.\n\n       I get my health care and medications at the V.A. hospital \n     in Boise, Idaho. That requires a four hour drive of over 170 \n     miles, each way. This year I had to cancel my lab \n     appointments and medication renewal exam because it would \n     have cost me over $250 to make the trip. My only alternative \n     was to drive to the newly opened V.A. clinic in Lewiston, \n     Idaho an 80-mile trip each way. I was then told that I would \n     have to wait an unknown period of time ``to get on a waiting \n     list''. This trip cost me over 90 plus dollars and gas/diesel \n     is still climbing. If we allow new oil exploration in ANWR \n     and off of our coast, what guarantees are we going to get \n     that this ``oil'' will be used for the benefit of Americans. \n     As I understand it now most of the oil from Alaska is shipped \n     to Japan, while some is used for U.S. consumption. This is a \n     national resource on national land and appropriate royalties \n     should be dedicated to make gas and diesel affordable for all \n     Americans. Thank you for your time and consideration.\n     Dwight, White Bird.\n                                  ____\n\n       I'm 72 yrs of age, my wife is 70. We have worked hard all \n     our lives, have been responsible, caring citizens. I am a \n     vet, have served in various leadership positions in different \n     organizations, involvement in Boy Scouts and other youth \n     programs, as a responsible citizen over the years we have \n     voted at all elections to exercise our civic responsibility. \n     We are retired, live on a fixed income, with\n\n[[Page S4439]]\n\n     a modest retirement future. In retirement, one has to adjust \n     your ``wants'' to what is really needed. When I retired, how \n     could I have anticipated $4.00+ a gallon for gas? Somehow, I \n     felt my civic input over the years had placed the correct \n     people in government to oversee the changing variables in \n     life and make the proper adjustments needed to hold sure and \n     steady on course!\n       Instead now we have intense partisanship, people voting for \n     the good of the ``party'' instead of what is best for the \n     country, self-interest and self aggrandizement with very \n     little being accomplished--all upon the backs of the \n     ``people'' who have put them in office. Gas is now a \n     political football; drill here and now, against those who say \n     whatever we can find here is not enough `` a liberal party \n     line,'' if all this is our future, I am sure glad I am 72 and \n     have only a few years to see the further denigration of our \n     political system and our way of life. My biggest regret is \n     the mess my generation is leaving to our children and \n     grandchildren.\n     Lloyd and Carol.\n                                  ____\n\n       You are asking Idahoans to write about gas prices? [Does \n     that mean that you] do not know? I think [questions like that \n     indicate that those in Congress may be out of touch with \n     reality.]\n       [One of] your colleagues [suggested that] Americans to use \n     alternative routes of transportation and that it is a good \n     thing that gas prices force people to take the bus, ride \n     Bikes, or walk to their destination because it helps reduce \n     global warming. [But that suggestion fails to recognize \n     reality]. I am a driver for a living. I deliver products \n     right here in Boise. I have to drive I have no choice. I am \n     also a salesman, and a night supervisor. I do not have the \n     option of riding the bus! I cannot walk my deliveries or ride \n     my bike with my products. I find it absolutely insulting [to \n     have this lack of comprehension of real life displayed by our \n     political leaders].\n       I have three jobs! Three jobs, and I am still having \n     problems fueling up! I have had to open credit card accounts \n     for the first time in my life! And my debt is still going up.\n       You would think with three jobs and three paychecks for one \n     person, I would be doing well? I am not married, no kids! I \n     would be starving with fuel prices if I had a family! I am \n     just barely paying my bills on time as they are, to about \n     $1500 a month, not including gas prices!\n       Starting in 2005 till 2007 I did very well financially; I \n     was saving up and putting money away in my savings account. I \n     loved myself for putting money away. This month in June I had \n     to take one-fourth of my life savings out of the bank to pay \n     bills, including gas because the price skyrocketed from $3 to \n     $4 a gallon in one month!\n       This is outrageous! I am [extremely angry at the political \n     leaders who have failed to address this problem. And Congress \n     carries most of the blame.] Congress has done this because \n     [environmentalists have protected caribou in ANWR where we \n     have lots of oil. I am dismayed that Congress displays more \n     concern for the] caribou than they do for the economy! My \n     jobs? My gas prices? My bills? My lifestyle? [Congress should \n     be concerned more about the people it represents, not the \n     animals.]\n       You will not allow drilling off shore? Well, did you know \n     that China is drilling for oil off the coast of Florida? But \n     we cannot? Why? This is outrageous!\n       Do not listen to those radical environmentalists. They were \n     wrong about the second Ice Age in the 70s. When I was kid in \n     school in the 1980s, my teachers told me by the year 1999 New \n     York would be underwater and Los Angeles would be a bunch of \n     Islands. It has not happened. Of course, the Earth's \n     temperature changes and jumps over time. The Earth's climate \n     changes all the time; it has been since the Earth cooled and \n     formed. The Earth's temperature does not stay the same all \n     the time. There are so many scientists and people who \n     disagree with [climate change theories].\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       The area of Terreton, Mud Lake, Monteview, and Hamer has no \n     grocery store in any of the areas. We live approximately 45 \n     miles from Idaho Falls, or Rexburg, whichever way we go. \n     Either of these towns contains our nearest grocery store. \n     Therefore, we have to drive 90 miles to get to a grocery \n     store and home. Some people live as far as 19 miles farther \n     north in Monteview, so for them it is over a 125-mile trip to \n     a grocery store and home. I am sure that none of our Senators \n     or Congressmen can even fathom something like this. We do \n     have an implement dealer and a great hardware store in our \n     area but still, for some of the people it is a 20 mile drive \n     to and from this store from the outskirts of Monteview and \n     Hamer.\n       We try to make our trips count when we grocery shop, but \n     milk and fresh produce does not last as long as other items. \n     So sometimes it becomes a 125 mile trip for just a few \n     groceries. This makes groceries extra expensive when the trip \n     itself costs $20 plus just in gas costs. They have to \n     realize, not everyone is in walking distance of all products \n     and services.\n       Doctors, hospitals, clothing stores, entertainment, etc., \n     are all the same distance. We either stay home or we drive \n     125 miles for about anything we need. The answer for us is \n     not ``just drive less''. We have no choice, and this involves \n     a lot of people.\n     Kent and Shelma, Terreton.\n                                  ____\n\n       I want to first of all thank you for all of your efforts to \n     help us achieve energy independence. For the one priority of \n     Congress to act upon for our country's energy policy, we need \n     domestic oil, both drilling and more refining. This would \n     stabilize both out economy, and national security, because it \n     would make it so that we are not beholden to the whims of \n     foreign governments, but you already know that, I just wish \n     that some other members of Congress could understand that \n     also.\n       As far as current fuel cost having an impact on my \n     situation, let me share a few details with you. I own a small \n     window cleaning business, that currently services from Idaho \n     Falls up to Ashton and the Driggs area. We have been planning \n     to expand our service area to include down to Pocatello and \n     up to Island Park this year. But, because of fuel cost, we \n     have had to put off expanding up to Island Park for now. This \n     delay has not only affected me, but I have one other person \n     working for me, and it has also affected him because he gets \n     paid a percentage of any work done. We have been able to do \n     some expanding into the Pocatello area, but it has not gone \n     as fast as we had planned because of the fuel cost.\n     Scot, Teton.\n                                  ____\n\n       I just heard on the news that a couple of states are \n     charging a surcharge to speeding tickets. This extra fee \n     penalizes those who are speeding and using more fuel, \n     endangering the lives of their fellow citizens. The money is \n     used to augment the police departments who must pay more for \n     fuel because of higher prices. These higher prices are \n     causing problems with the budgets of the police departments. \n     It is only fair that those who speed should pay to augment \n     the police departments gasoline bill. Please use your \n     influence to encourage the states to add this surcharge to \n     their speeding tickets and designate the money to the police \n     departments gasoline bills.\n       We must do something about the high cost of gasoline. It \n     will ruin our country and put millions out of work, as it has \n     done already. The answer is not more supply the answer is to \n     stop the greed of the American oil companies. Its just that \n     simple. It is not right, it is criminal for the oil companies \n     to make billions in profits while bankrupting the citizens of \n     the USA.\n       Your web site says the average American will spend more \n     than $50 per month on gasoline than last year. [But] we are \n     spending more then $50 more per tankful than we did last \n     year! I bought a Subaru that gets 30 MPH on the highway, and \n     it cost over $50 to fill the tank! The same amount I spend on \n     my 350 V8 Chevrolet pick-up a year ago and it holds 30 \n     gallons. I do not even drive my truck anymore.\n     Cynthia.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4439-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4439-S4440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO STAN JONES\n\n Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I wish to honor Stan Jones, a man who \nhas dedicated his professional life to improving the quality of \neducation for countless students across Indiana.\n  Stan is Indiana's longtime commissioner of higher education and will \nunfortunately retire from our State's highest education post this \nmonth. Stan has led the Commission for Higher Education since 1995 and \nduring his remarkable tenure was charged with planning and coordinating \nIndiana's State-supported postsecondary education system and giving \nstudents the ability to secure their personal futures.\n  Stan's commitment to education began in 1974, when, at the age of 24, \nhe was elected to the Indiana House of Representatives. As a member of \nboth the House Education and State Budget Committees, he developed an \nexpertise in higher education and higher education finance that would \nbe enormously beneficial in the years ahead.\n  Between 1990 and 1995, Stan was one of my closest advisers when I had \nthe privilege of serving as Indiana's Governor. He deserves credit as a \nprimary architect of several landmark education-policy initiatives, \nincluding the 21st Century Scholars Program. This program promises at-\nrisk middle school students full tuition scholarships to Indiana \ncolleges and universities in return for being drug, alcohol and crime \nfree and maintaining good grades. I am proud to say that this \ngroundbreaking program was the first of its kind in the Nation to \nsuccessfully graduate students and has increased the number of low-\nincome students completing postsecondary education.\n  In his current role, Stan has led several initiatives to increase \nadult participation in higher education, including the development of \nthe Community College of Indiana. He has also worked relentlessly to \nincrease the number of students pursuing higher learning and\n\n[[Page S4440]]\n\nto improve their preparation through a focus on raising Indiana's K-12 \nacademic standards. More recently, Stan has led a comprehensive \ncampaign to significantly increase college graduation rates in Indiana.\n  On a personal note, I have known Stan Jones for nearly 25 years. I am \npersonally grateful to have had the benefit of Stan's wisdom for all \nthese years.\n  Throughout his public career, Stan has been a tireless advocate for \nmoving educational policy issues to the forefront of Indiana's \npolitical agenda. On behalf of all Hoosiers, we thank Stan for a job \nwell done, for his passion and commitment to education, and above all, \nfor his service to the people of Indiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4440-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL THOMAS L. CARTER\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an \noutstanding military leader, public servant, true patriot, and citizen \nof Charleston, SC: MG Thomas L. Carter.\n  General Carter is currently the Mobilization Assistant to the \nSecretary of the Air Force, and on May 1, after nearly 35 years of \ndistinguished and honorable service, General Carter will retire from \nthe U.S. Air Force Reserve.\n  General Carter began his active duty service in 1975 after graduating \nfrom the ROTC program at Memphis State University. As an Air Force C-\n141 pilot he flew over 4,000 hours performing missions in support of \nthe U.S. Special Forces. He also had the distinction of serving as the \nAir Force Aide to President Ronald Reagan from 1984 to 1986, where he \nspent countless hours with the President ``carrying the football'' at \nthe height of the Cold War. Following his active duty career, he served \n23 years in the U.S. Air Force Reserve.\n  General Carter's public service also extends to the Senate. From 1986 \nto 1989 he served as Assistant to the Republican Leader for National \nSecurity Affairs in the Office of Senator Robert Dole. His keen \nunderstanding of the Senate made him the leader's chief adviser on \ndefense, foreign policy and veterans' affairs matters, and also \nresulted in his selection as a key member of Senator Dole's 1996 \nPresidential campaign.\n  General Carter's legislative prowess was so respected, that he left \nthe Senate to assume the role of Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense \nfor Senate Affairs in 1989. In that capacity, he counseled the \nDepartment of Defense leadership and individual service executives on \nissues before Congress.\n  For 13 years, General Carter also served in the Secretary of Air \nForce's Office of Legislative Liaison, advising numerous Secretaries on \ngovernment affairs matters. He also trained countless Air Force \nofficers in the ways of Washington, DC. His trademark was his \ncommitment to providing each new assignee to the office with his ``Hill \n101'' where military officers, and many times new congressional staff, \nwould be given the secrets to success for navigating the legislative \nbranch. Many of those he mentored have gone on to tremendous success in \nthe public and private sector, due in large part to General Carter's \ntutelage.\n  In 2003, General Carter was named Assistant to the Chairman for \nGovernment Affairs during the Columbia Accident Investigation Board. He \nalso served as a civilian in the Department of Defense as a member of \nthe Senior Executive Service while Senior Counselor to the Coalition \nProvisional Authority--CPA--from 2003-2004. In that capacity, he led \nnumerous congressional delegations through areas of ongoing combat \noperations including visits to Baghdad, Mosul, Tikrit and Fallujah.\n  The Nation will miss General Carter's congressional expertise, \ntireless advocacy for the Air Force, and unwavering commitment to \npublic service. However, I know he will continue to serve his Nation \nwherever he goes. Tom is the proud father of Kathryn, 28, Will, 26, and \nMary-Lee, 15. I am proud to speak on behalf of a grateful Nation in \nsaying thank you to General Carter for his years of service and \nsacrifice.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in wishing him well in all his \nfuture endeavors and hope that those who follow in his footsteps will \ncontinue his legacy of selfless dedication to our great Nation. Good \nluck and Godspeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4440-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4440]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         135TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SCHOOL SISTERS OF ST. FRANCIS\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I honor the School Sisters of \nSt. Francis which will be celebrating 135 years of service in Milwaukee \non April 24, 2009. I want to share with my colleagues a bit of \nbackground on the Sisters and call attention to the pivotal role they \nplay in Milwaukee's faith community.\n  The School Sisters of St. Francis was founded in 1874 in Wisconsin by \nthree courageous women Emma Franziska, Mother Alexia; Paulina Schmid, \nMother Alfons; and Helena Seiter, Sister Clara. A year prior, these \nwomen left Germany and came to the United States to fulfill their dream \nof founding a Franciscan religious order.\n  Their central mission was to help their fellow immigrants and address \nthe need for service within the Church. Their dedication to helping \nothers has culminated in a network of Sisters who always strive to \nrespond to the times they are in, and to the needs of the people whose \nlives are affected by their inspiring work.\n  Today that spirit lives on with Sisters, associates, staff, and \nvolunteers in India, Europe, Latin America and the United States. The \nSisters continually demonstrate their compassion for others and have \noften been recognized for their pioneering spirit and innovation in \neducation, health care, pastoral ministry, and the arts. Their \noutstanding work promotes human dignity, justice, and outreach to the \npoor. It is with great pride that the people of Wisconsin wish the \nSchool Sisters of St. Francis a happy 135th anniversary and continued \nsuccess as they carry out their mission in Wisconsin and across the \nglobe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4440-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4440-S4441]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO VICKIE VANZANDT AND STEVE HICKOK\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I wish to recognize Vickie \nVanZandt and Steve Hickok for their exemplary record of public service \nto the Bonneville Power Administration, the people of Washington State, \nand the Pacific Northwest.\n  Vickie VanZandt retired on March 28, 2009 after 35 years with the \nBonneville Power Administration. She most recently served as \nBonneville's transmission business line senior vice president. As the \nsenior executive, Vickie assured the transmission grid operated safely \nand reliably in order to provide power to over 12 million customers. \nHer work involved coordinating and setting policy for transmissions \nsystem planning, design, construction, operations, and maintenance--\nclearly, no small feat.\n  Vickie graduated magna cum laude from the University of Washington's \nSchool of Engineering, is a registered engineer, and is a member of Tau \nBeta Pi engineering honor society. She has been a board member of the \nWestern Regional Transmission Association, past president of the \nNorthwest Regional Transmission Association, and has chaired the \narbitration committees of both of these organizations. At the request \nof the Department of Energy, she also chaired the Operations Team \ninvestigating the East Coast Blackout of August 13, 2003.\n  Steve Hickok, Bonneville Power Administration's deputy administrator, \nretired on April 4, 2009, after 27 years of faithful service. Previous \nto his time with Bonneville, Steve served on the staff of my former \ncolleague, Senator Mark Hatfield, as well as with the Senate Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on \nAppropriations. His experience here in the Senate served him well, and \nat Bonneville, Steve has served as the assistant administrator for \nconservation and renewable resources development, the chief operating \nofficer, and the group vice president for sales and customer service. \nHe was appointed as the deputy administrator, the organization's second \nhighest-ranking position, in 2001.\n  Steve graduated with honors from Pomona College in Claremont, CA, and \nis also a graduate of the Stanford Executive Program.

A bill to provide a Federal income tax credit for Patriot \nemployers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, when companies make headlines today it is \noften for all the wrong reasons: outrageous bonuses, tax avoidance, \nfraud, profiteering, etc. Yet many of the companies that provide jobs \nare conscientious corporate citizens that try to treat workers fairly \nand at the same time create good products that consumers want and \nmaximize profits for their shareholders. I believe that we should \nreward such companies for providing good jobs to American workers and \ncreate incentives to encourage more companies to do the same. The \nPatriot Employers Act does just that.\n  This legislation, which I am introducing today along with Senator \nBrown, would provide a tax credit to reward the companies that treat \nAmerican workers best. Companies that provide American jobs, pay decent \nwages, provide good benefits, and support their employees when they are \ncalled to active duty should enjoy more favorable tax treatment than \ncompanies that are unwilling to make the same commitment to American \nworkers. The Patriot Employers tax credit would put the tax code on the \nside of those deserving companies by acknowledging their commitments.\n  The Patriot Employers legislation would provide a tax credit equal to \n1 percent of taxable income to employers that meet the following \ncriteria.\n  First, invest in American jobs. Maintain or increase the number of \nfull-time workers in America relative to the number of full-time \nworkers outside of America, maintain corporate headquarters in America \nif the company has ever been headquartered in America, and maintain \nneutrality in union organizing drives.\n  Second, pay decent wages. Pay each worker an hourly wage that would \nensure that a full-time worker would earn enough to keep a family of \nthree out of poverty, at least $8.50 per hour.\n  Third, prepare workers for retirement. Either provide a defined \nbenefit plan or provide a defined contribution plan that fully matches \nat least 5 percent of worker contributions for every employee.\n  Fourth, provide health insurance. Pay at least 60 percent of each \nworker's health care premiums.\n  Fifth, support our troops. Pay the difference between the regular \nsalary and the military salary of all National Guard and Reserve \nemployees who are called for active duty, and continue their health \ninsurance coverage.\n  In recognition of the different business circumstances that small \nemployers face, companies with fewer than 50 employees could achieve \nPatriot Employer status by fulfilling a smaller number of these \ncriteria.\n  There is more to the story of corporate American than the widely-\npublicized wrongdoing. Patriot Employers should be publicly recognized \nfor doing right by their workers even while they do well for their \ncustomers and shareholders. I urge my colleagues to join Senator Brown \nand me in supporting this effort. Our best companies, and our American \nworkers, deserve nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 829\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide enhanced authority to the Congressional \nOversight Panel established pursuant to the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act of 2008; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation to \nprovide the Congressional Oversight Panel, COP, with subpoena authority \nso that it can more effectively conduct oversight on behalf of American \ntax payers. Created as part of last fall's Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act, EESA, to be Congress' watchdog over the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program, TARP, it has become apparent that a lack of \nsubpoena authority is actively preventing the COP from obtaining all \nnecessary information to safeguard rescue fund dollars. I would like to \nthank Senator Wyden for cosponsoring this legislation that would grant \nthe COP subpoena power should three of the Panel's five members feel it \nis appropriate.\n  One of three organizations charged with overseeing TARP, the COP's \nrole is to ``review the current state of the financial markets and the \nfinancial regulatory system'' and to report to Congress every 30 days. \nThrough regular reports, COP must oversee Treasury's actions; assess \nthe impact of spending to stabilize the economy; evaluate market \ntransparency; ensure effective foreclosure mitigation efforts; and \nguarantee that Treasury's actions are in the best interest of the \nAmerican people. Notably, Congress provided the COP in EESA the \nexplicit power to secure information from any government agency upon \nthe request of its Chair.\n  Unfortunately despite the yeoman efforts of COP Chair Elizabeth \nWarren and her four colleagues, the Panel is having difficulties \ndischarging its duties. In particular, the Panel appears to be having \nproblems obtaining necessary information from the Treasury Department, \nwhich is administering the TARP. Indeed, Ms. Warren told the Senate \nFinance Committee on March 31 that she feels as though the Panel and \nits requests for information are simply not a priority for the \nDepartment. Unfortunately, the facts appear to bolster Ms. Warren's \nconclusion.\n  Ms. Warren's written testimony before the Finance Committee notes, \n``The Oversight Panel has repeatedly called on Treasury to articulate a \nclear strategy for its use of TARP funds; the absence of such a vision \nhampers effective oversight. In fact, our first report outlined a \nseries of ten basic questions, starting with the question, `What is \nTreasury's strategy?' Months later, Congress and the American people \nhave no clear answer to that question. The ongoing uncertainty has \nhindered recovery efforts. I have sent two letters to Treasury \nSecretary Geithner asking for clarification on this specific point. I \nam disappointed to report that the Oversight Panel has not received a \nsubstantive response.''\n  In addition to a letter the Panel sent to Secretary Geithner on March \n5 asking him to outline a strategy for TARP and respond to questions \nregarding the approach taken by the recently announced Financial \nStability Plan, Ms. Warren asked that Mr. Geithner testify before the \nCOP on March 12 or March 19. Although Ms. Warren reports that Secretary \nGeithner replied to her March 5 letter on April 2, nearly two weeks \nafter the requested response date of March 20, a COP hearing with Mr. \nGeithner as a witness will only now take place on April 21, a delay \nthat has only further impeded the Panel's effectiveness.\n  Furthermore, other COP members have also noticed Treasury's apparent \npattern of failing to respond to critical questions. Deputy Chair Damon \nSilvers testified before the Joint Economic Committee, JEC, on March 11 \nabout the Panel's attempt to answer the critical question of whether \ntaxpayers are receiving assets commensurate in value with TARP dollars \nbeing expended. Unfortunately, the Treasury Department appears to have \nbeen less than helpful in assisting the Panel in its analysis. In fact, \nMr. Silvers told JEC the following:\n  ``Our valuation report relied entirely on publicly available data. \nThe Panel did make a broad document request of the Treasury Department \npursuant to our authority under Section 125 of the EESA on December 17, \n2008. Our purpose was to obtain any non-public information that \nTreasury possessed that would go to issues of valuation, in addition to \ncontributing to our general ability to oversee the TARP program. In a \nletter dated December 24, 2008, the Treasury Department declined to \nprovide the material we requested, and raised concerns about our newly \nformed Panel's internal controls over the confidential documents. \nDespite extensive discussions between our staff and the Treasury \nDepartment, Treasury has only produced a small number of the documents \nthe Panel requested.''\n  With $700 billion in TARP funds at stake, providing the Congressional \nOversight Panel with the tools and resources it requires to conduct \neffective oversight is absolutely essential. The fact is that we in \nCongress are duty bound to correct TARP inadequacies but can only do so \nwith reliable information from its overseers. Clearly, the examples I \nhave just cited demonstrate that providing the Panel subpoena authority \nis warranted so that it can compel Treasury and any other entities to \nprovide all requisite information.

Res. 104\n\n       Whereas the month of April has been designated ``National \n     Child Abuse Prevention\n\n[[Page S4450]]\n\n     Month'' as an annual tradition initiated in 1979 by President \n     Jimmy Carter;\n       Whereas the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System \n     reports that 794,000 children were victims of abuse and \n     neglect in the United States in 2007, causing unspeakable \n     pain and suffering for our most vulnerable citizens;\n       Whereas over 95,000 of those children were younger than 1 \n     year old;\n       Whereas more than 4 children die each day in the United \n     States as a result of abuse or neglect;\n       Whereas children younger than 1 year old accounted for over \n     40 percent of all child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2007, \n     and children younger than 4 years old accounted for nearly 76 \n     percent of all child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2007;\n       Whereas abusive head trauma, including the trauma known as \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome, is recognized as the leading cause of \n     death among physically abused children;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome can result in loss of vision, \n     brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death;\n       Whereas medical professionals believe that thousands of \n     additional cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome and other forms of \n     abusive head trauma are being misdiagnosed or left \n     undetected;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome often results in permanent and \n     irreparable brain damage or death of the infant and may \n     result in extraordinary costs for medical care during the \n     first few years of the life of the child;\n       Whereas the most effective solution for preventing Shaken \n     Baby Syndrome is to prevent the abuse, and it is clear that \n     the minimal costs of education and prevention programs may \n     avert enormous medical and disability costs and immeasurable \n     amounts of grief for many families;\n       Whereas prevention programs have demonstrated that \n     educating new parents about the danger of shaking young \n     children and how to protect their children from injury can \n     significantly reduce the number of cases of Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome;\n       Whereas education programs raise awareness and provide \n     critically important information about Shaken Baby Syndrome \n     to parents, caregivers, childcare providers, child protection \n     employees, law enforcement personnel, health care \n     professionals, and legal representatives;\n       Whereas National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week and \n     efforts to prevent child abuse, including Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome, are supported by groups across the United States, \n     including groups formed by parents and relatives of children \n     who have been injured or killed by shaking, whose mission is \n     to educate the general public and professionals about Shaken \n     Baby Syndrome and to increase support for victims and their \n     families within the health care and criminal justice systems;\n       Whereas 20 States have enacted legislation related to \n     preventing and increasing awareness of Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas the Senate has designated the third week of April \n     as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'' since \n     2005; and\n       Whereas the Senate strongly supports efforts to protect \n     children from abuse and neglect: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the third week of April 2009 as ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'';\n       (2) commends hospitals, child care councils, schools, \n     community groups, and other organizations that are--\n       (A) working to increase awareness of the danger of shaking \n     young children;\n       (B) educating parents and caregivers on how they can help \n     protect children from injuries caused by abusive shaking;

which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 105\n\n       Whereas Global Youth Service Days is an annual public \n     awareness and education campaign that highlights the valuable \n     contributions that young people make to their communities \n     throughout the year;\n       Whereas the goals of Global Youth Service Days are to \n     mobilize the youth of the United States to identify and \n     address the needs of their communities through community \n     service and service-learning opportunities, to support young \n     people in embarking on a lifelong path of volunteer service \n     and civic engagement, and to educate the public, the media, \n     and policymakers about contributions made by young people as \n     community leaders throughout the year;\n       Whereas Global Youth Service Days, a program of Youth \n     Service America, is the largest service event in the world \n     and in 2009 is being observed for the 21st consecutive year \n     in the United States and for the 10th year in more than 100 \n     countries;\n       Whereas young people in the United States and in many other \n     countries are providing more volunteer service to their \n     communities than in any other generation in history, thereby \n     demonstrating that children and youth not only represent the \n     future of the world but are also leaders and assets today;\n       Whereas recent research shows that when high quality, \n     semester-long service-learning is used as a teaching and \n     learning strategy that integrates meaningful community \n     service with the academic curriculum, it increases students' \n     cognitive engagement, motivation to learn, school attendance, \n     and academic achievement scores;\n       Whereas several private foundations and corporations in the \n     United States support community service and service-learning \n     as a means for young people to explore career aspirations and \n     develop the leadership and career-preparedness skills that \n     are necessary for the United States to be competitive in the \n     21st century, including time management, decision-making, \n     teamwork, and problem solving;\n       Whereas a fundamental and conclusive correlation exists \n     between youth service, character development, lifelong adult \n     volunteering, philanthropy, and other forms of civic \n     engagement;\n       Whereas community service and service-learning provide \n     opportunities for youth to apply their knowledge, idealism, \n     energy, creativity, and unique perspectives to improve their \n     communities by addressing a myriad of critical issues, such \n     as poverty, hunger, illiteracy, education, natural disasters, \n     and climate change;\n       Whereas a growing number of Global Youth Service Days \n     projects involve youth working collaboratively across borders \n     to address global issues, to increase intercultural \n     understanding, and to promote the sense that they are global \n     citizens;\n       Whereas Global Youth Service Days engages millions of young \n     people worldwide with the support of 50 International \n     Coordinating Committee member organizations, more than 150 \n     National Partners in the United States, 75 State and local \n     Global Youth Service Days Lead Agencies, and thousands of \n     local organizers; and\n       Whereas both young people and their communities will \n     benefit greatly from expanded opportunities for youth to \n     engage in volunteer community service and service-learning: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and commends the significant contributions \n     of the youth of the United States and encourages the \n     cultivation of a civic bond between young people dedicated to \n     serving their neighbors, their communities, and the Nation;\n       (2) designates April 24 through 26, 2009, as ``Global Youth \n     Service Days''; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     Global Youth Service Days by--\n       (A) encouraging youth to participate in community service \n     and service-learning projects and joining youth in such \n     projects;\n       (B) recognizing the volunteer efforts of the young people \n     of the United States throughout the year; and\n       (C) supporting the volunteer efforts of young people and \n     engaging them in meaningful community service, service-\n     learning, and decision-making opportunities, as an investment \n     in the future of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4450-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4450-S4451]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n               COMMITTEE ON ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN.

Res. 104\n\n       Whereas the month of April has been designated ``National \n     Child Abuse Prevention Month'' as an annual tradition \n     initiated in 1979 by President Jimmy Carter;\n       Whereas the National Child Abuse and Neglect Data System \n     reports that 794,000 children were victims of abuse and \n     neglect in the United States in 2007, causing unspeakable \n     pain and suffering for our most vulnerable citizens;\n       Whereas over 95,000 of those children were younger than 1 \n     year old;\n       Whereas more than 4 children die each day in the United \n     States as a result of abuse or neglect;\n       Whereas children younger than 1 year old accounted for over \n     40 percent of all child abuse and neglect fatalities in 2007, \n     and children younger than 4 years old accounted for\n\n[[Page S4465]]\n\n     nearly 76 percent of all child abuse and neglect fatalities \n     in 2007;\n       Whereas abusive head trauma, including the trauma known as \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome, is recognized as the leading cause of \n     death among physically abused children;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome can result in loss of vision, \n     brain damage, paralysis, seizures, or death;\n       Whereas medical professionals believe that thousands of \n     additional cases of Shaken Baby Syndrome and other forms of \n     abusive head trauma are being misdiagnosed or left \n     undetected;\n       Whereas Shaken Baby Syndrome often results in permanent and \n     irreparable brain damage or death of the infant and may \n     result in extraordinary costs for medical care during the \n     first few years of the life of the child;\n       Whereas the most effective solution for preventing Shaken \n     Baby Syndrome is to prevent the abuse, and it is clear that \n     the minimal costs of education and prevention programs may \n     avert enormous medical and disability costs and immeasurable \n     amounts of grief for many families;\n       Whereas prevention programs have demonstrated that \n     educating new parents about the danger of shaking young \n     children and how to protect their children from injury can \n     significantly reduce the number of cases of Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome;\n       Whereas education programs raise awareness and provide \n     critically important information about Shaken Baby Syndrome \n     to parents, caregivers, childcare providers, child protection \n     employees, law enforcement personnel, health care \n     professionals, and legal representatives;\n       Whereas National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week and \n     efforts to prevent child abuse, including Shaken Baby \n     Syndrome, are supported by groups across the United States, \n     including groups formed by parents and relatives of children \n     who have been injured or killed by shaking, whose mission is \n     to educate the general public and professionals about Shaken \n     Baby Syndrome and to increase support for victims and their \n     families within the health care and criminal justice systems;\n       Whereas 20 States have enacted legislation related to \n     preventing and increasing awareness of Shaken Baby Syndrome;\n       Whereas the Senate has designated the third week of April \n     as ``National Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'' since \n     2005; and\n       Whereas the Senate strongly supports efforts to protect \n     children from abuse and neglect: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the third week of April 2009 as ``National \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome Awareness Week'';\n       (2) commends hospitals, child care councils, schools, \n     community groups, and other organizations that are--\n       (A) working to increase awareness of the danger of shaking \n     young children;\n       (B) educating parents and caregivers on how they can help \n     protect children from injuries caused by abusive shaking; and\n       (C) helping families cope effectively with the challenges \n     of child-rearing and other stresses in their lives; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States--\n       (A) to remember the victims of Shaken Baby Syndrome; and\n       (B) to participate in educational programs to help prevent \n     Shaken Baby Syndrome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4465-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GLOBAL YOUTH SERVICE DAYS\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

Res. 105\n\n       Whereas Global Youth Service Days is an annual public \n     awareness and education campaign that highlights the valuable \n     contributions that young people make to their communities \n     throughout the year;\n       Whereas the goals of Global Youth Service Days are to \n     mobilize the youth of the United States to identify and \n     address the needs of their communities through community \n     service and service-learning opportunities, to support young \n     people in embarking on a lifelong path of volunteer service \n     and civic engagement, and to educate the public, the media, \n     and policymakers about contributions made by young people as \n     community leaders throughout the year;\n       Whereas Global Youth Service Days, a program of Youth \n     Service America, is the largest service event in the world \n     and in 2009 is being observed for the 21st consecutive year \n     in the United States and for the 10th year in more than 100 \n     countries;\n       Whereas young people in the United States and in many other \n     countries are providing more volunteer service to their \n     communities than in any other generation in history, thereby \n     demonstrating that children and youth not only represent the \n     future of the world but are also leaders and assets today;\n       Whereas recent research shows that when high quality, \n     semester-long service-learning is used as a teaching and \n     learning strategy that integrates meaningful community \n     service with the academic curriculum, it increases students' \n     cognitive engagement, motivation to learn, school attendance, \n     and academic achievement scores;\n       Whereas several private foundations and corporations in the \n     United States support community service and service-learning \n     as a means for young people to explore career aspirations and \n     develop the leadership and career-preparedness skills that \n     are necessary for the United States to be competitive in the \n     21st century, including time management, decision-making, \n     teamwork, and problem solving;\n       Whereas a fundamental and conclusive correlation exists \n     between youth service, character development, lifelong adult \n     volunteering, philanthropy, and other forms of civic \n     engagement;\n       Whereas community service and service-learning provide \n     opportunities for youth to apply their knowledge, idealism, \n     energy, creativity, and unique perspectives to improve their \n     communities by addressing a myriad of critical issues, such \n     as poverty, hunger, illiteracy, education, natural disasters, \n     and climate change;\n       Whereas a growing number of Global Youth Service Days \n     projects involve youth working collaboratively across borders \n     to address global issues, to increase intercultural \n     understanding, and to promote the sense that they are global \n     citizens;\n       Whereas Global Youth Service Days engages millions of young \n     people worldwide with the support of 50 International \n     Coordinating Committee member organizations, more than 150 \n     National Partners in the United States, 75 State and local \n     Global Youth Service Days Lead Agencies, and thousands of \n     local organizers; and\n       Whereas both young people and their communities will \n     benefit greatly from expanded opportunities for youth to \n     engage in volunteer community service and service-learning: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes and commends the significant contributions \n     of the youth of the United States and encourages the \n     cultivation of a civic bond between young people dedicated to \n     serving their neighbors, their communities, and the Nation;\n       (2) designates April 24 through 26, 2009, as ``Global Youth \n     Service Days''; and\n       (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe \n     Global Youth Service Days by--\n       (A) encouraging youth to participate in community service \n     and service-learning projects and joining youth in such \n     projects;\n       (B) recognizing the volunteer efforts of the young people \n     of the United States throughout the year; and\n       (C) supporting the volunteer efforts of young people and \n     engaging them in meaningful community service, service-\n     learning, and decision-making opportunities, as an investment \n     in the future of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/20/senate-section/article/S4465-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4465]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MEASURE READ THE FIRST TIME--H.R. 131\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.
