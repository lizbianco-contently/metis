Mr. President, Americans are focused on a number of \nimportant issues at the moment relating to the economy and to the \nadministration's response to it, but it would be a mistake in the midst \nof all of these immediate concerns to take our eye off the \nadministration's long-term economic plan as outlined in its budget. The \nAmerican people already have an idea that this budget spends too much, \nit taxes too much, and it borrows too much, particularly in the midst \nof a severe recession. They are also concerned about the staggering \nnumber of things the administration is trying to do. Still, it is \nimportant to look closely at the details of the administration's long-\nterm budget plan so people have an idea of what is coming.\n\n[[Page S3382]]\n\n  Over the past 2 weeks, Republicans have discussed the spending side \nof the budget and some of the massive new taxes the budget calls for on \nenergy use and on small businesses. Today, I wish to briefly discuss \nanother element of the tax plan, and that is the proposal to limit the \nbenefit taxpayers receive for making charitable donations to nonprofits \nand charitable organizations.\n  Let's be clear about something from the outset. This is not something \nonly Republicans oppose. This proposal has been met with wide \nbipartisan opposition in Congress and widespread criticism from the \nmany thousands of organizations that would be adversely affected by it. \nWith a challenged economy already causing endowments at colleges and \nuniversities, charities, museums, and other nonprofits to shrivel up, \nthe last thing America's nonprofit organizations expected was for the \nadministration to introduce yet another disincentive to charitable \ngiving, and many of them, including many of them from the opposite ends \nof the political spectrum, are uniting in strong opposition to the \nadministration's proposal. One reason: According to a February survey \nin the Chronicle of Higher Education, college and university endowments \nlost more than 20 percent of their value in a recent 5-month period, \nlargely as a result of the plunging stock market. The administration's \nproposal is a bad one, frankly, at any time, but now is the worst time \nof all.\n\n  Earlier this week, I received a letter on this very proposal from the \npresident of Western Kentucky University in Bowling Green. He said the \nuniversity has worked hard over the past year to increase its support \nfrom charitable gifts and that they have had a lot of success doing \nthat. He also noted that WKU is in the middle of a major annual \nfundraising campaign to increase opportunities for students and that 95 \npercent of the total will come from the generosity of fewer than 500 \ndonors.\n  The message was clear: The importance of major gifts to Western \nKentucky University and to thousands of other colleges and universities \nacross the country is impossible to overstate, and disincentivizing \nthose gifts would strike a serious blow to every one of these \ninstitutions--every single one of them.\n  There is another important aspect of this issue, and it is one \nPresident Ransdell at WKU pointed out in his letter. Americans are \nknown the world over for their generosity. That generosity was \nencouraged by the creation of the charitable gift deduction in the \nearly part of the last century, and that deduction is one of the \nreasons that last year Americans gave more than $300 billion to \ncharitable causes--that was back in 2007--and roughly 75 percent of \nthose donations--or $229 billion--came from individuals. I will say \nthat again: 75 percent of the $300 billion given to charitable causes \nin 2007, which is $229 billion, came from individuals. One of the \nthings Americans are most proud of is that no other industrialized \nnation in the world gives more to charity than the United States. It is \nnot even close. As a share of our GDP, Americans give more than twice \nas much as Britain and 10 times more than France. Seven out of ten \nAmerican households donate to charities, supporting a wide range of \nreligious, educational, cultural, health care, and environmental goals. \nThis is something to be proud of. It is uniquely American. It is not \nsomething we want to discourage.\n  So Americans from all walks of life and both political parties are \nworried about this proposal. They don't understand why charitable \norganizations and the people they serve should suffer in order to pay \nfor new or expanded Government programs. According to one study, this \nproposal could lead to $9 billion less in charitable giving each year. \nThat is less money for places such as Western Kentucky University, the \nJuvenile Diabetes Foundation, hospitals, churches, food pantries, and \ncountless other causes that are quite worthy of our support. These \norganizations are hurting enough. The administration doesn't need to \nhit them up for more tax revenue while they are down, and it doesn't \nneed to blunt one of the things Americans are most proud of; that is, \nof course, our generosity.\n  The following quote attributed to President Kennedy sums up the way \nmost Americans feel about this issue, and it captures my own sentiments \nas well. This is what he had to say:\n\n       The raising of extraordinarily large sums of money, given \n     voluntarily and freely by millions of our fellow Americans, \n     is a unique American tradition . . . Philanthropy, charity, \n     giving voluntarily and freely . . . call it what you like, \n     but it is truly a jewel of an American tradition.\n\n  Charities provide a valuable public service to society's most \nvulnerable citizens. Now more than ever, these organizations need our \nhelp. This plan to disincentivize charitable giving is absolutely \nwrong. Many of us on both sides of the aisle will be working hard to \nmake sure it doesn't become law. Congress should preserve the full \ndeduction for charitable donations and actually look for additional \nways to encourage charitable giving, not discourage it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3382-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3382]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this morning I want to address the budget a \nlittle bit, and to all Americans, I want to be clear: I want to work \nwith the President to get our economy back on track. I want to fix \nhousing, reform the financial markets, and help every citizen get \naccess to high-quality, affordable health care. I want our President to \nsucceed in leading our Nation out of this economic crisis.\n  But I draw the line with President Obama's idea of raising taxes. He \nmay think it is a great idea to raise taxes in the midst of a \nrecession, but I surely don't. The President's proposed tax increase is \na whopper--$1.4 trillion in new taxes, which is equal to the annual \neconomic output of all of Spain.\n  Despite the White House rhetoric, these taxes will hit all Americans. \nNo one is spared. This budget raises taxes on energy. If you drive a \ncar or heat your home, your taxes are going to go up.\n  This budget raises taxes on small business. More than half of small \nbusinesses that employ between 20 and 500 employees--that is the \nFederal definition of ``small business,'' 20 and 500 employees--will \nsee their tax bills rise and jobs eliminated.\n  This budget raises taxes on senior citizens who are dependent on \ndividend and capital gains income for retirement income.\n  This budget raises taxes on charitable contributions. Just the \nannouncement that it will happen, we have already seen decreasing \ncharitable contributions. Of course, a lot of those charitable \ncontributions are ones that come from these small business employers \nwho have single proprietorships or small business corporations where \nthey have to pay their taxes right away, even though they have to put \nall that money back into the company. I will talk about that later.\n\n[[Page S3383]]\n\n  This budget reinstates the death tax, making it harder to keep the \nfamily farm, the family ranch, or the family business in the family.\n  This budget simply taxes too much. I heard lots of complaints from \nWyoming ranchers about the President's tax increase. Many of our \nranches and farms are structured as S corporations or limited liability \ncorporations, and this tax hike would hurt them.\n  The President will say his proposal to let some 2001 tax cuts expire \nwill affect only 3 percent of all taxpayers, but this statistic \nobscures the fact that these taxpayers employ the most number of \nworkers and generate the most economic activity of all small business \nentities.\n  According to a 2007 Treasury Department report, over 30 percent of \nall business income comes from passthrough entities, such as S \ncorporations, partnerships, and limited liability companies. That means \nit goes right back in to take care of the business.\n  Last weekend, I was in Wyoming. I visited Sanford's restaurant in \nGillette, WY. They started with one restaurant and now they have eight \ndifferent locations. At the location I went to, one of the owners \nhappened to be there. He said proudly, and he should: We started this \nbusiness on $2,000. Now we have eight stores, and we still only have \n$2,000. That is because everything has been plowed back into the \nbusiness, which results in more jobs for more people.\n  That is what we are talking about. We want this economy to grow. \nSmall businesses are the ones making this grow. It is the guys and \nwomen with an idea they can take their last $2,000 and put it into \nsomething productive and they can grow it. The problem is, when they \ngrow it, they pay the taxes on it immediately. They pay the taxes as \nthough it actually flowed into their pocket. But it doesn't. As a \nresult, some of these people who have been successful who are creating \nall these jobs make more than $250,000 a year. They don't get to keep \nit. That is the important part. They don't get to keep it. They have to \npay taxes on it right away. That puts them into this new higher tax \nbracket.\n  It is going to have a devastating effect. Suddenly, the house they \nown--they are not going to have the same kind of house deduction, as if \nthey didn't have a business at all.\n  Charitable contributions--it is the small businesses that keep the \ntowns going. It isn't the big corporations that buy the ads in the \nyearbooks. It isn't the big corporations that make a donation when \nsomebody comes around because there has been a fire. It is those little \nbusinesses that want to grow. They are growing, but they have to put \neverything they have back into it. I know small businessmen who have \nbeen able to pay everybody who works for them but not themselves.\n  We are not talking about the big corporations with the big bonuses. \nWe are talking about the little corporations that are family. By \n``family'' I mean every employee who works for them understands how \ndifficult the business is, how close to not succeeding the business is, \nand because they want their job, they help the business to succeed. As \na result, they are included in ``the family.'' All of those people are \ngoing to suffer.\n  Because 30 percent of all business income that comes through these \npassthrough entities, such as S corporations, partnerships, and limited \nliability companies, these small businesses that are hiring people--\nthey are hiring people; they are not laying them off. The unemployment \nwould be tremendously higher if it were not for this 30 percent of all \nbusiness income that gets passed through and back into the business.\n  Over 70 percent of that income is concentrated in the top two \nmarginal income-tax rates. They pay the highest rate we have because \nthey did business and because the business is making money. But it \nisn't money they get to put in their pockets; it is money they put back \ninto the business. So nearly a quarter of all business income would be \nsubject to higher taxes under this budget.\n  Let me repeat that. Nearly a quarter of all business income would be \nsubject to these higher taxes under this budget. According to a 2007 \nsurvey completed by Gallup for the National Federation of Independent \nBusinesses, 50 percent of all businesses that employ between 20 and 499 \nworkers will face higher taxes if the 2001 rate reduction in the top \ntwo rates is allowed to expire. Fifty percent of all businesses that \nemploy between 20 and 499 workers will face higher taxes if we do not \nchange that, if we allow it to expire. And the plan, according to the \nbudget, is to let it expire, to shove these taxes off on these small \nbusinesses, the ones that are still doing well, the ones that have not \nsuccumb to the greed, the ones that have been doing the right thing, \nparticularly with their community. Raising taxes on our Nation's job \ncreation engine at any point in the business cycle is just bad economic \npolicy.\n  The key to our Nation's economic growth and our ability to recover \nfrom a crisis such as this one is the flexibility and the vibrancy of \nour non-corporate sector. Small business is the incubator for \nentrepreneurship, and we should protect it and nurture it, not tax it.\n  For example, many in the companies that fueled the economic growth of \nthe 1990s and beyond started as passthrough entities: For example Yahoo \nand Microsoft, just to mention a few that the President mentioned \nearlier in the week when he was talking about the importance of helping \nout small business and said all the right things about small business.\n  I am encouraged by what he said. I am encouraged by the differences \nhe is going to make in the way the Small Business Administration works. \nBut it is going to come back again in the way of higher taxes for those \nsame people. We need to encourage, not discourage, those people.\n  When I was in Wyoming, I had a procurement conference. That is where \nthe Federal Government comes to Wyoming and talks to my businessmen to \nsee if small business can't provide for some of the Government \ncontracts. Every year it is a huge success. People from all over the \nNation, not just Wyoming, are able to take advantage of that sort of \nthing.\n  At that conference, a guy in Montana was talking about the need for \nsome liquidity so he could get a loan--a loan, not a bailout--a loan so \nhe could grow his business. As we learned at the White House summit on \nMonday, the banks do not have a secondary market for their loans. That \nmeans when they make the loan, they cannot turn around and sell the \nloan to free up the capital to make another loan. When that happens, \nthese small businesses cannot get loans, and a lot of them need short-\nterm credit.\n  You have to order your inventory a year ahead of time often. When it \ngets there, you have to pay for it, and then you sell it. A lot of them \nneed just a kind of cashflow loan, one that will pull them through that \ntime when all the inventory hits and gets paid off and the time the \ninventory gets sold.\n  A guy in Montana talked to a guy in Wyoming who talked to me and \nproposed several different ways that I have passed on to the White \nHouse and to Secretary Geithner that money could be freed up for these \nbusinesses to grow. I am encouraged and hope that will happen. I hope \nit is not reversed by these new taxes.\n  I will fight to preserve low taxes for our Nation's small business, \nand I am prepared to offer an amendment to any legislation that \nattempts to raise taxes on small business income.\n  I have pledged to work with the White House to fix housing, to reform \nour financial markets, and to help every citizen get access to high-\nquality, affordable health care. My question today is: Will the White \nHouse work with me to protect small business from the harmful effects \nof this budget's tax increase?\n  This budget taxes too much, spends too much, and borrows too much.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask the Chair to let me know when 9 \nminutes has elapsed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

He had another one on entitlements. He has been to a wind \nturbine factory. He was in California yesterday. He has overruled some \nof President Bush's environmental decisions. And yesterday he did what \nmany Americans are doing: he picked his bracket in the NCAA basketball \ntournament, and he picked North Carolina, which predictably caused \ntheir rival, the coach of Duke, Coach ``K,'' to say the following:\n\n       Somebody said we're not in President Obama's final four, \n     and as much as I respect what he is doing, really, the \n     economy is something that he should focus on, probably more \n     than the brackets.\n\n  That was our U.S. Olympic coach yesterday. There is some truth to \nthat. The President is very impressive and is capable of doing many \nthings at once. But, we don't need a lot of things done at once right \nnow. We have one big issue--it's the economy, Mr. President.\n  While all of us have our role to play in this--Senators, \nbusinesspeople, all of us across the country--there is only one person \nwho can do what the President of the United States can do. He is the \nagenda setter. He is the mobilizer. If the President of the United \nStates focuses on one single big issue and throws everything he has \ninto it for as long as he can, he will wear everybody else out and he \nwill solve the problem, if it can be solved. I am confident in this \ncountry the problem can be solved.\n  He has been there for 4\\1/2\\ months now. We still have a big economic \nproblem. It was going on before he came in, correct. Some people say \nAmericans don't pay attention to history, but I am not so sure about \nthat. In October of 1952, General Eisenhower was running for President \nand said: I shall go to Korea. He was elected. The Korean war was a big \nproblem then.\n  On November 29, he went to Korea, and said he would concentrate his \nattention on the job of ending the Korean war until it is honorably \nended. There were a lot of other things going on in 1952 and 1953 that \nneeded to be solved. But President Eisenhower focused on the Korean \nwar, ended it, and the country was grateful.\n  It is time for President Obama to focus on fixing the banks and \ngetting the economy moving again. He can do that. The country needs for \nhim to do that, and the country would be grateful if he did.\n  There are other issues, but we only have one President; we have one \nbig issue. Mr. President, it's the economy. That is where the focus \nneeds to be.\n  We are currently debating the President's budget, and we have some \ndifferences of opinion. As the Senator from Wyoming said, we believe on \nthe Republican side it spends too much, it taxes too much, and it \nborrows too much. It is a blueprint for a different kind of country. It \nis an honest blueprint, in my opinion. It is a 10-year picture of where \nAmerica would go under the President's proposed budget. It will bring \nmuch more Government, add much more debt, and it will be turning over \nto our children a country that they will have a hard time affording and \nin which they will have fewer choices. It is not the kind of country I \nwant to see.\n  The new higher tax rates would raise taxes by $1.4 trillion over 10 \nyears. It is the largest tax increase in history.\n  Going back to history a little bit, we can learn lessons from \nhistory. President Hoover in 1932, as we were entering a recession, \nraised taxes. He raised taxes on the wealthy people. The top tax rate \nrose from 25 percent to 63 percent. What were the effects of the 1932 \ntax increase? Tax revenue decreased, the Federal deficit increased, and \nthe Great Depression continued for a number of years. The middle of a \ndeep recession is no time to be raising taxes on anyone. I know the \nPresident is saying: Well, this only goes into effect later. But \neverybody makes plans today based on what happens tomorrow. We also \nknow that if they say we are only going to tax the rich people, we have \nheard that said before. In 1969, everybody became concerned because \nthere were 155 people in America who didn't pay any taxes. So we had \nwhat was called the millionaire's tax to catch them. We put in a new \ntax rate 40 years ago. If Congress had not acted, that tax rate that \nwas set to capture 155 people who didn't pay taxes 40 years ago would \nhave captured 28 million Americans this year.\n\n  In this country, you rise. You make more money and you rise into the \nhigher tax rates. So if you put a high tax rate to capture 155 people, \nwhat we find 40 years later is that you capture 28 million Americans \nwho are paying higher taxes, and many of those individuals are making \nincomes of $60,000, $70,000, and $80,000 a year.\n  President Kennedy and President Reagan both lowered taxes when they \nbecame President and were in economic slowdowns. When President Reagan \ncame in, we had a serious economic slowdown. I was Governor of \nTennessee at the time, and unemployment was higher then than it is \ntoday. Inflation was a lot more then than it is today. Interest rates \nwere terrifically high then. President Kennedy and President Reagan \ndecided to lower taxes during the economic slowdowns. President Obama \nis proposing the largest tax increase in history, and the tax \nespecially goes on the engine that creates the most new jobs.\n  In America, all businesses are important for creating jobs. In my \nhome State, we have Federal Express. It employs almost 300,000 people \naround the world. On the Republican side of things, we would like to \nhave immediate expensing of all the big airplanes Federal Express buys, \nor the software Microsoft buys--which is not based in my State. Because \nif these companies can deduct those expenses in the first year, they \nwill make more money, they will hire more people, and Tennessee will do \nbetter. Jobs are what we are talking about. But most of the new \nbusinesses come from small businesses.\n  Secretary Geithner, the Treasury Secretary, says this tax they want \nto impose only affects the rich people, and only 2 or 3 percent of the \nsmall businesses are affected. Well, I checked into that a little bit. \nIf you work for a company with 20 or more employees--up to 500 \nemployees is a small business--chances are 50-50 that you are working \nfor somebody whose taxes are going to be raised by this proposed tax \nincrease in the President's budget. If those taxes go up in the half of \nthe small businesses that create most of the new jobs, then there is no \nmoney to buy new equipment, there is no money to hire a new person, \nthere is no money to raise salaries, there is no money to pay health \ncare benefits and there might not be enough money to pay employees and \njobs may be at risk. Raising taxes on owners of small businesses in the \nmiddle of a recession is not the way to create new jobs.\n  Then there is the national sales tax on electric bills and energy. \nClean air and climate change is an important issue with me, especially \nclean air. I live at the edge of the Great Smoky Mountains, where we \nhave unhealthy air that's polluted with nitrogen, sulfur, and other \npollutants. I have introduced legislation to have higher clean air \nstandards. I have also, every Congress since I have been here, \nintroduced legislation to have caps on carbon that comes out of the \ncoal-fired powerplants. Not caps on the whole economy, just the \npowerplants, which produce about 40 percent of the carbon. Some other \nSenators would like to have what is called a cap-and-trade tax on the \nentire American economy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 9 minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair very much.\n  Mr. President, the recession is no time to impose a $600-plus billion \ntax on everybody's electric bill. This is not the time to do that, if \nthe time is ever right to do that. MIT suggests a bill such as the one \nthe President has proposed would cost each American family $3,100 a \nyear. In the middle of a recession, that is not a good idea.\n  In conclusion, I think Coach K's advice to our impressive new \nPresident is good advice. We know he can have summits, make trips, and \ndeal with a lot of different things. He has smart people dealing with \nhim. But we have a tough economic problem, and it is the economy, Mr. \nPresident. We need the President to focus on the economy and \nconcentrate on it, until the banks are fixed and the credit is flowing. \nWe need a budget that doesn't spend so much, tax so much, and raise \ndebt so much. Otherwise, we will deliver a country to our children and \ngrandchildren that they can't afford.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S3385]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Madam President, I rise to speak about the public's \noutrage over the revelations that senior executives at AIG have \nreceived bailout bonuses. This company received $173 billion in \ntaxpayer money, including tens of billions of dollars through the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program. The American people do deserve to know \nwhere their money is going.\n  I confess that last year I supported the first round of TARP money \nbased on the representation from what I thought were the smartest \npeople in the country that it was absolutely necessary to unfreeze the \nfrozen credit markets in our country. But I did not support additional \nmoney for the TARP funding when it was requested--the second tranche, \nso to speak--because the accountability and the transparency we were \npromised by the Treasury Department the first time around never \nmaterialized. We were told this money was necessary to prevent a crisis \nin our country. Now, we do have a crisis, but that crisis is a crisis \nof confidence in this administration and in the leaders of this \nCongress.\n  The American people have legitimate and urgent questions about these \nbailout bonuses, and these questions demand answers. First of all, they \nwant to know how this happened. A lot of people are pointing fingers \nover these bailout bonuses, and right now there is a lot we do not \nknow.\n  I appreciate the fact that President Obama said: You know what, \npeople are trying to find fault. I accept the blame.\n  I appreciate the gesture, but that is simply not good enough. We do \nnot know when the administration became aware of these bonuses. \nSecretary Geithner says he learned of the bonuses last Tuesday. \nPresident Obama said he learned about them on Thursday. Yet the Federal \nReserve Bank of New York says it notified Treasury in February. And \nEdward Liddy, the CEO of AIG, testified that everyone knew about these \nbonuses for months and that he and Secretary Geithner spoke about the \nbailout bonuses 2 weeks ago. What is clear is that the administration \nshould have known about these bonuses a lot earlier and they should \nhave taken action before they sent AIG another $30 billion this month.\n  We also know how these bailout bonuses got legal protection in the \nstimulus bill. I voted against the stimulus bill for reasons too \nnumerous to mention here. Yet the bill that passed out of this Chamber \nhad two amendments that addressed bailout bonuses: One amendment, \nsponsored by Senator Wyden and Senator Snowe, would have taxed these \nbonuses; another, sponsored by Senator Dodd, the Senator from \nConnecticut, would have banned the bailout bonuses altogether. These \namendments were in the bill that passed out of the Senate, but \nsomething happened in the conference. The Snowe-Wyden amendment \ndisappeared completely and the Dodd amendment was changed so that it \ngrandfathered in all the bailout bonuses in place on or before February \n11. No one admits to knowing how this happened. None of the conferees \nadmit to knowing. There have been conflicting reports about who knew \nwhat when. But the American people need to know who protected these \nbailout bonuses in a law that was signed by President Obama--one among \nthose who claim outrage at the revelation that now these bonuses are \ngoing to be received. He signed the law into effect that actually \nprotected these bonuses in the stimulus plan.\n  The American people deserve to know who proposed these changes in the \nstimulus bill, who knew about these changes, and who approved these \nchanges. The American people deserve to know who is responsible and how \nthey intend to fix this problem and get the bailout bonus money back in \na constitutional and legal way.\n  How do we assure this does not happen again? As those responsible \nscramble to come up with an explanation, we must also understand what \nwe must do to ensure this type of thing never happens again. I would \nlike to offer a few suggestions.\n  First, Congress needs to stop passing bills without reading them, \nfinding out what is in them, and preparing for their implementation. \nDuring the transition, the then-incoming administration said they \ndidn't want to waste a crisis, and Congress complied. Yet their \nleadership has taught us a different lesson: Treating everything like a \ncrisis actually leads to waste.\n  Second, it is clear the administration needs to get its team in \nplace. Better oversight by the Treasury Department could have avoided \nthis problem. Yet, as Paul Volcker observed, Secretary Geithner ``is \nsitting there without a deputy, without any under secretaries, with no \nassistant secretary responsible in substantive areas at a time of \nobviously very severe crisis.'' I appreciate that President Obama has \ncompleted his March Madness tournament bracket. Yet the organization \nchart for this administration still has far too many open slots.\n  Third, the President needs to shelve his plans to grow the size of \nGovernment. His plans to raise more taxes can wait until the \nadministration proves they can be good stewards of the tax dollars we \nare already spending. His plans to nationalize health care, energy, and \neducation can also wait until he addresses the problem of toxic assets \nin our financial system and gets our economy moving again.\n  Fourth, the President needs to fulfill his pledge to promote \ntransparency and accountability and bipartisanship in Washington--\nsomething I agree with. The President won the support of the American \npeople because he promised to be a different kind of leader. Yet we see \nthat the more things change, the more they seem to be the same here in \nWashington. Lack of transparency in Congress helped protect these \nbailout bonuses in law--passed by the Senate without my vote and signed \nby the President of the United States. Lack of accountability at the \nother end of Pennsylvania Avenue speeded this money out the door.\n  If the President's efforts at bipartisanship had been substantive--\nmore than photo ops and press releases--then we might have delivered a \nbetter stimulus bill and not squandered the trust of the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3385-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I rise today to urge colleagues to \nsupport Chairman Bingaman on the upcoming amendments and to speak in \nfavor of this extraordinarily important public lands package.\n  This legislation would designate over 2 million acres of our great \ncountry as wilderness, surpassing the wilderness acreage designated by \nthe last three sessions combined. The wilderness protected in this bill \nspans nine States, including my home State of Oregon. In addition, it \nadds close to 1,100 miles to the National Wild and Scenic Rivers System \nin seven States--again including Oregon.\n  It is going to allow for much needed upgrades to national trails, \nmonuments, national conservation areas, oceans, the National Landscape \nConservation System, forest landscape restoration, and water resources. \nMost significantly, the bills contained in this legislation would serve \nto protect our public lands from encroachment and preserve them for \nfuture generations to cherish and enjoy.\n  The legislation includes provisions that are very near and dear to \nour country but especially to Oregonians. It includes the Lewis and \nClark Mount Hood Wilderness Act of 2007, the Copper Salmon Wilderness \nAct, the Cascade-Siskiyou National Monument Voluntary and Equitable \nGrazing Conflict Resolution Act, the Oregon Badlands Wilderness Act of \n2008, and the Spring Basin Wilderness Act of 2008.\n  Today, I also wish to say that it is important to protect these \nspecial places because it will also be good for our economy to go \nforward with this legislation. This is legislation that is important to \ndo whether we are in good times or in bad times--whether the economy is \nweak or strong. Because the nation's public lands of course, have \nenduring benefits, benefits we are going to pass on to our children \nlong after these challenging days become a footnote in our country's \nhistory. So protecting public lands is a smart thing to do, and it is \nespecially important given the significant economic benefits you will \nsee generated by this legislation. And there are many that know, this \nis also a smart thing to be doing in a recession because our public \nlands--accessible to all for free or for a small fee--are where \nAmerica's families turn for affordable recreation. And that recreation \nin turn, fuels the economy in many communities that rely on our \nnation's public lands.\n  Appreciating the outdoors is not just a passion for Oregonians and \nthe people of our country, it is also an economic engine, which is more \nurgently needed than ever in these challenging economic times. It is \ncertainly an economic engine in my State, where the unemployment rate \nis over 10 percent.\n  So passing this legislation isn't just the right thing to do \nmorally--it is the right thing to do economically.\n  In these times, folks have been losing their jobs. They do not know \nwhere their next job is going to come from. The fact is, there are \nsignificant economic benefits through recreation generated by this \nlegislation. The Outdoor Industry Association, which closely tracks \nAmerican's use of the outdoors and all the economic engine that \nencourages, has found recently that American's participation in outdoor \nactivities increased in 2007 to 50 percent.\n  They found that the national active outdoor recreation economy \ncontributes $730 billion annually to our Nation's economy; it supports \nnearly 6.5 million jobs; it generates $49 billion in annual national \ntax revenue; and produces almost $300 billion annually in retail sales \nand services across the country. In Oregon, it contributes more than \n$5.8 billion annually to Oregon's economy.\n  So outdoor recreation, what this legislation is going to promote, is \na huge economic bonanza for our Nation. I can tell you, because \ncolleagues have asked about Oregon, one of the national treasures this \nbill would protect, Mt. Hood, has had a banner skiing season. The \nForest Service estimates visitation to the Mt. Hood National Forest is \nmore than 2 million visitors a year, making it one of the most popular \nin our country.\n  Some other areas that we protect in this bill, the Badlands and \nSpring Basin are near Central Oregon--a region that has a well-earned \nreputation as a hub for diverse outdoor recreation. They are also on \nBureau of Land Management Lands, ``BLM.'' The BLM estimated that in \nOregon alone, BLM lands had 8.3 million recreation visits. Those visits \nbrought people, jobs and investment to the surrounding towns.\n  The same is true in the other two areas this legislation would \nprotect--the Cascade Siskiyou National Monument, where we would create \na new 23,000 acre Soda Mountain Wilderness and Copper Salmon, where \nfishermen from all over the country journey to fish in one of the last \nintact watersheds on the southwestern Oregon Coast.\n  A number of Senators have worked hard to make this legislation \npossible. I wish to thank them. And certainly Michele Miranda in our \noffice, Mary Gautreaux, and my chief of staff, Josh Kardon, who has \ntried for years and years to bring together community leaders, all \ndeserve special credit.\n  We have gems in this legislation that are going to make for \nrecreational industry meccas. I hope that all colleagues will support \nChairman Bingaman when the amendments come up and ultimately support \nthis legislation. We ought to pass this legislation. It is time to do \nit for millions of Americans and for future generations enjoying these \ngreat treasures, and we ought to do it because this legislation will \nalso help stoke the economic engine for our country.\n  I know colleagues are waiting too. I wish to thank Chairman Bingaman \nfor this opportunity to speak. I urge all colleagues to support \nChairman Bingaman with respect to these amendments and get this bill \npassed in the Senate today.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, how much time remains in opposition to \nthis first amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes remaining. The Senator \nfrom New Mexico has 4 minutes and the Senator from Oklahoma has 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Let me take 2 of the 4 minutes because I know my \ncolleague from Alaska was hoping to speak also. If she arrives, I will \nyield that time to her. If she does not, I will reclaim it.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Madam President, I was under the impression that I \nwould be allowed to speak in opposition to amendment No. 683 as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That amendment is not the first amendment to \nbe voted on.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, since I am controlling the remaining 10 \nminutes, I would be happy to yield to the Senator from Florida 2 \nminutes of that time.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I understand it is not the first amendment. Will there \nbe an opportunity to speak in opposition to the amendment prior to that \nvote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 4 minutes of debate evenly \ndivided.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. If I might suggest, through the chair, that the Senator \nfrom New Mexico go on and take his time. I will yield time to the \nSenator from Florida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 677\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me go ahead and briefly describe \nmy reasons for urging we not support this first amendment. This first \namendment is an amendment Senator Coburn offered and is very nearly \nidentical to an amendment he offered to the Consolidated Natural \nResources Act of 2008. That was the package of public land bills the \nHouse sent us that year.\n  Most of the Senate voted against the amendment. I hope they will \nagain. The amendment required the Director of the Office of Management \nand Budget to post an annual report on the Internet detailing a great \ndeal of information about lands owned by the Government: buildings, \nstructures on those lands, extensive information on which are used, \nwhich are not used, the cost of operation of those lands, and those \nstructures estimated backlog for maintenance of various structures of \nthe agencies.\n  The issue the Senator is trying to get at was dealt with in the \nprevious administration, when President Bush issued Executive Order \n13327. Therein, he set up the Federal Real Property Council, a Federal \nreal property council, that has, as its job, tracking asset management, \ninventory of assets, setting up systems to do that, working\n\n[[Page S3387]]\n\nunder the auspices of the General Services Administration; the \nGovernment Accountability Office or the General Services \nAdministration.\n  I believe that is a much better thought-through way to proceed with \nthis. The cost of this amendment would be fairly extensive. We do not \nhave an exact estimate, but we have been told there are 1.2 billion \npieces of real property or real property assets worldwide, over 636 \nmillion acres of land we are talking about here, that would have to be \ninventoried and reported on in an updated fashion every year. So this \nis an extensive undertaking.\n  Madam President, how much time remains on my side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I withhold my time until the Senator from Alaska can \nhave a chance to get her thoughts together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I yield 3 minutes to the Senator from \nFlorida.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 683\n\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma for yielding.\n  I rise in opposition to his very amendment, which shows why I often \nfind myself in agreement with the Senator from Oklahoma, because of his \nkind nature to allow me to do this in opposition to his very amendment.\n  While I often find myself in agreement with him, in this instance I \nmust depart and not concur. The amendment is not well founded. It is \ntrying to strike the authorization for the St. Augustine 450th \nCommemoration Commission Act. This is a commemoration of 450 years of \nthe first European settlement on the North American Continent, the \nfirst in the continental United States.\n  St. Augustine was founded by the Spanish a full 50 years before \nJamestown. We created, in the year 2000, a commission to commemorate \nthat event, the 400th anniversary of Jamestown. Likewise, this one is \nidentically patterned to that. It is the same thing. But here is the \nsignificance and importance of it. Our Hispanic heritage in this \ncountry, which necessarily is of more and more importance to many of \nus, is something we ought to recognize and celebrate.\n  How many young Hispanic children do not have the heritage or the \nfoundational heritage to understand their culture and their proud \nheritage, and how many of them would benefit by understanding that this \ncelebration is about them. It is about their heritage and their \nheritage in this very country of ours.\n  It is the oldest permanent settlement in the United States, St. \nAugustine, FL. It is the birthplace of Christianity. It is in St. \nAugustine, FL, that the first Christian Catholic mass took place. It is \nthe first blending of cultures. It was a place that was at times \nSpanish, it was then English, it was then French. It has Native \nAmerican influence as well as African-American influences as well. The \nfirst free Black settlement in North American was in St. Augustine.\n  Nearly a century before the founding of Jamestown, Spanish explorer \nJuan Ponce de Leon landed on the coast of St. Augustine looking for the \nfabled Fountain of Youth, but instead he founded a colony known as La \nFlorida.\n  Because of St. Augustine's location along strategic trade routes, \nSpain constructed the Castillo do San Marco in 1672 to protect the \ncapital of La Florida from the French and the British interests. That \ncastle, which was later rebuilt, still stands today and is a terrific \ntourist attraction.\n  Florida is not only going to celebrate this for Florida's sake, but \nthis is a national celebration. There are over 70 million visitors to \nour State of Florida every year. Many of them will find their way to \nSt. Augustine, and, of course, countless others throughout and around \nour country will celebrate this anniversary by seeing the celebrations \non television and in other ways.\n  It is an important linkage to our Hispanic heritage, and so I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in opposition to this amendment and support the \nbill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I wish to rebut some of what the Senator \nfrom New Mexico said in terms of the real property reform.\n  What you heard in his statements is a profound admission that we do \nnot have the information right now. We do not have it. We have over 650 \nmillion acres of land, we have over 21,000 empty buildings now that we \nknow of. That is just a guess.\n  How, in a time when we are going to run a $2.2 trillion deficit this \nyear, can we say we do not want the tools to manage the real property \nin this country. The Executive order has not done it. It was basically \nabout buildings, Federal buildings.\n  I worked with the OMB on that 3 years ago to set that up. Much to the \navail, we now know we have the 21,000 buildings, but the Senate \ncontinues to block any real property reform so we cannot get some of \nthe $18 billion we are wasting every year on those 21,000 buildings. We \ncannot get any of them sold; we cannot dispose of any of them; we \ncannot even raze any of the ones that need to be razed.\n  The very fact that we would oppose having the information we need to \nmake real decisions, frugal financial decisions with America's taxpayer \ndollars, at a time when we are in an economic malaise, and have a \ndeficit that is going to be $6,000 to $7,000 per every individual in \nthis country is amazing to me.\n  This requires 1 year of hard work and requires very little work \nanyway after that. So it is not an onerous task. But even if it were an \nonerous task, the thing we ought to be doing is getting the information \nwith which to make good management decisions, which we continue to not \nwant to have, so it can be an excuse so we can do what we want to do \nwithout knowing what the facts are.\n  Nobody would run any organization without trying to know about their \nassets. Yet we are going to refuse to list out and know what we own, \nwhere it is, where we are behind, what needs to get fixed, and what \ndoes not need to get fixed.\n  Common sense would dictate that if, in fact, you have a large number \nof assets and a limited budget, and it is going to get more limited as \nthe years progress given the tremendous borrowing, the tremendous \ntaxing that is getting ready to come about in this country, common \nsense would suggest we know what we are doing and that we have the \ninformation with which to make good decisions.\n  To defeat this amendment says we want to continue to go on blindly; \nwe do not want to have the information at our fingertips with which to \nmake good, informed decisions about where to put taxpayer dollars. The \nvery fact that the GAO now says we have between a $13 and $19 billion \nbacklog just on structures in national parks and that the Department of \nthe Interior is so far behind and is growing about $400 million every 6 \nmonths in terms of its backlog and for us to not know what is there and \nwhat should be prioritized to me is the height of foolishness.\n  So we can defeat this amendment, and we can continue to go on \nblindly, making poor decisions because we are not making them within \nthe perspective of the complete knowledge of what we own, what is \nimportant, and what should be prioritized. The Senate continues to \nrefuse to prioritize its spending. The whole purpose behind this \namendment is to give us the knowledge with which to make those \ndecisions. But our political nature tells us we want an excuse so we do \nnot have to make those good decisions. We do not want to have the \ninformation.\n  Consequently, we put the credit card in, we spend money not wisely, \nnot fiscally responsibly, and we charge it to our grandkids. At some \npoint in time it has to stop. Now, it is probably not going to stop \nwith this amendment. But you would not run your personal household this \nway. If you had your own business, you would never run it this way. You \nwould never want your city government to not know what it owned and \nwhat its backlogs were, you would have an accounting.\n  States do not do that. But we do that, and we do it at our own \nconvenience, which I think is a shame. It belies our responsibility to \nfuture generations. It also belies the fact that we need the capability \nto make the tough choices. Not having this information means we will \ncontinue to make\n\n[[Page S3388]]\n\nchoices that are politically expedient but are policy poor and policy \nfoolish.\n  So I understand--actually I do not understand. Let me correct that. I \ndo not understand why somebody would not want this information, and \nwhy--even though it is hard to get the first year, why we would not \nwant it.\n  Now, 100 percent of the Senators agreed we ought to have the Federal \nFinancial and Transparency Act where we put online where we are \nspending the money, 100 percent of us. We thought that was a good deal. \nHere is another step toward transparency we can make that will give us \ninformation, give the American people the information to judge us.\n  If we are going to put X money on a certain project, they ought to be \nable to see it in relationship to everything else we are doing. We are \ngoing to refuse to do that. I don't understand why. I don't have a clue \nto understand why we would not want factual information with which to \nmake priority decisions in terms of the Department of Interior and in \nterms of national parks and forestland. It belies any sense of reality \nand any connection with common sense that we would refuse to do that.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, I do not disagree with my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma that we should, as the Federal Government, know more \nabout our assets, know more about our land and buildings, what it costs \nto manage and maintain them, to operate these properties. It is a \nreasonable request. Where he is going with this is something we should \nbe working together to develop and perhaps refine the concept of what \nhe is asking for through a freestanding bill. My concern with the \namendment, as it is now, is that we have to make sure as we gain this \ninformation, we have a way to protect it. Right now it would be the \nOffice of Management and Budget that has sole responsibility for making \ndecisions in terms of military intelligence, Department of Energy \nfacilities, and what gets included within public reports. That concerns \nme and, therefore, I will be objecting to the amendment.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 677\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 677 \noffered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me answer my colleague. There is an exception in this \nbill for anything of national intelligence or confidence, that it \nshould not be related to the general public. It is already in there. So \nthere is no problem where we would expose things we should not. It has \nbeen covered in the amendment. If Members truly believe we need to have \nthe information, they need to be voting for the amendment. This is a \nwise approach to give us information we need to make cogent decisions.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Let me speak on that one issue. I think my colleague from Alaska is \ncorrect, this does involve a change in current law. It says that the \ndecision as to what affects national security will be made by OMB for \npurposes of this inventory and display. It will not be made by agencies \nsuch as the Department of Defense, CIA, Department of Energy, and \nothers that currently make those decisions. That is a mistake. It also \nspecifies that items can be left out for national security reasons. The \nExecutive order made clear that items could also be left out or should \nbe left out if they involved foreign policy issues or safety issues for \nthe public.\n  The amendment is not consistent with what I believe we ought to be \ndoing in this area. I urge colleagues to oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. To follow up with the Senator from New Mexico, we do \nrecognize there is political sensitivity when we are asking for \ninformation regarding the military, our intelligence and security \ninformation. We want to make sure there are protections there. The \nSenator from Oklahoma is correct that there is that provision in the \nbill. But what it does is, it gives the Office of Management and Budget \nthe authority to make the determination as to what will be included in \nthis public report. I would be far more comfortable if it were the \nDepartment of Defense that made that determination, not the Office of \nManagement and Budget. Again, the Senator from Oklahoma is correct in \npushing us to look to make sure that we know where our assets are and \nhow much it costs to operate and maintain and manage them. We should be \nlooking to that in the future.\n  I will be opposing the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, that argument rings hollow. The two of \nyou sitting right there have the power to amend and change this and fix \nit with what your concerns are. It hasn't been offered once. You say \nyou are for it. You have the power to change it to meet what you think \nare problems with the amendment. Yet there has been no offer to do \nthat. That says one of two things: Either you don't want us to have \nthis information or you are claiming a false claim that there is a \ndefect with the amendment. You have every ability to change this, offer \nan amendment, modify it with my consent to meet your needs, but it has \nnever been offered. The real fact is, we don't want the information. We \ncan't manage 650-plus million acres; we can't manage millions of \nfacilities without the information. We are going to sit here in the \ndark of night and continue to throw darts, missing the dart board all \nthe time with what we do when we don't have this information.\n  I yield back the balance of my time and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is not a sufficient second at this time.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) and the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 58, nays 39, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 104 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--58\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Martinez\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--39\n\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--2\n\n     Kennedy\n     Klobuchar\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 682\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 682 \noffered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n\n[[Page S3389]]\n\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, this amendment No. 682 is one I have \nadvised the Senator from Oklahoma is acceptable to Senators on this \nside of the aisle.\n  Let me briefly describe what it does. It would modify the underlying \nprovisions of the substitute amendment dealing with the protection of \nfossil resources on Federal land by making three changes. First, the \nunderlying bill says the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of \nAgriculture may allow casual collecting of common fossils without a \npermit for personal use. That is consistent with the management \npolicies of the Federal land in question. The Coburn amendment says it \nrequires that the two Secretaries allow that casual collecting for \npersonal use. Secondly, the Coburn amendment would remove a provision \nthat would have authorized agencies under some circumstances to acquire \nnew lands. Finally, the amendment removes a provision in the underlying \nbill that would have authorized forfeiture of any vehicle or equipment \nused by someone illegally removing fossil resources.\n  I think all three of these changes improve the bill and I support the \namendment. I believe we can act on this with a voice vote, but I will \nleave it to the Senator from Oklahoma to make his statement.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, the chairman is correct. I will gladly \naccept a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 682) was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 683\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 4 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 683 \noffered by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, we yield 2 minutes in opposition to \nthis amendment to Senator Feinstein from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the manager of the bill.\n  The Coburn amendment would destroy a court-approved settlement of an \n18-year legal battle involving the release of water from the Friant \nDam, from which 15,000 farmers get their water over the restoration of \nsalmon in the San Joaquin Valley. The agreement is agreed upon by the \nGovernor of California, the Department of the Interior, the Bureau of \nReclamation, the water contractors. It has a broad consensus. The \nreason is because the belief is--and my belief is--that the Federal \nGovernment has lost the case and, therefore, the judge would order a \nhuge release of water from this dam which would provide a lack of \ncertainty for the farmers and would not provide for the salmon \nrestoration.\n  The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma has argued against the \nsettlement agreement--court approved--by saying its goal is 500 fish. \nIts goal is not 500 fish; it is 30,000. It is to restore a historic \nsalmon fishery.\n  Secondly, under the settlement, the State of California relieves the \nFederal Government of a number of payments: $200 million from the \nState, and the water contractors pick up another $200 million, equaling \n$400 million, which the Federal Government would have had to have paid.\n  So this is a court settlement. It should stand. It is the right \nthing. I urge a no vote on the Coburn amendment.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise in support of the Coburn amendment \nbecause it would eliminate the authorizations for a number of \nquestionable projects. Given the exploding Federal budget deficits, we \nought to forgo the millions of taxpayer dollars for such things as the \n450th birthday celebration for St. Augustine, FL; a study to determine \nwhether Alexander Hamilton's boyhood estate in St. Croix, Virgin \nIslands, should be designated as a new part of the National Park \nSystem; the maintenance of tropical botanical gardens in Hawaii and \nFlorida; and a shipwreck exploration program. These authorizations are \nnot urgent, have a tenuous Federal nexus, and could divert scarce \nFederal funds from more important safety and health programs.\n  Because the amendment eliminates authorizations for such programs, I \nam compelled to support it even though it would also eliminate a \nrelatively more credible provision in the bill relating to the San \nJoaquin River Restoration Settlement Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I won't spend the time to refute all of \nwhat the distinguished Senator from California said, other than to note \nthat in 1924 the salmon were gone from that river; before any of the \nwater canals or anything else was built. We are going to spend $30,000 \na fish based on the 300,000 salmon.\n  More importantly, this amendment talks about five total different \nearmarks in this bill. My office had a conversation with the mayor of \nSt. Augustine, FL, this morning. Here are his words: I am really \nworried about the fiscal nature of this country. I am really worried \nthat we are in real trouble, but I still want my money.\n  Well, the way a republic dies is when the constituency learns they \ncan vote themselves money from the public Treasury regardless of what \nthe overall financial situation of the country is. These are the main \nearmarks in this bill. The President has said he doesn't want a bill \nfull of earmarks. This strips them all out. We can either do what the \nAmerican people want--we can act fiscally responsibly--or we can \ncontinue the age-old process of putting our positions ahead of those of \nthe constituents we represent.\n  With that, I yield the floor and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I move to table the amendment and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) and the Senator from Minnesota (Ms. Klobuchar) are necessarily \nabsent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote, and I \nmove to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there is now 30 \nminutes of debate on the bill, equally divided between the Senator from \nNew Mexico and the Senator from Alaska.\n  The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me take 5 of the 15 minutes we \nhave. If you will advise me when that time is used.\n  In just a few minutes, the Senate will vote on final passage of H.R. \n146, the Omnibus Public Lands Act. I believe our actions this week will \nmake it\n\n[[Page S3390]]\n\nmore likely that the House of Representatives will be able to consider \nand approve the Senate amendments expeditiously.\n  Today's vote will culminate many years of work on more than 160 bills \nthat are included in this package and represents a major achievement \nfor the protection of our Nation's cultural, natural, and historic \nresources. As I have observed before, when you take all of these bills \ntogether, I believe they represent the most significant conservation \nlegislation passed by the Senate, at least in the last 15 years.\n  In addition, the bill will finally resolve three very important and \ncomplex water rights settlements in three different States and \nliterally decades of litigation and controversy about that water. The \nwilderness and other conservation areas designated in the bill \nrepresent years and years of efforts by local citizens, through \ncountless public meetings, in an effort to find a way to protect some \nof the most important scenic areas in their States, while balancing \nwilderness designations against other uses. In my opinion, the sponsors \nof these provisions have gone to great lengths to find that balance.\n  Some contend that the wilderness, national parks, wild and scenic \nrivers, and other conservation designations will frustrate our Nation's \nability to develop new domestic energy supplies. I strongly disagree. \nWe have gone to great lengths to assess the energy potential of the new \nareas, and in almost all cases the Bureau of Land Management has \nconcluded that the wilderness areas do not have significant energy \ndevelopment potential.\n  The Energy and Natural Resources Committee which I am privileged to \nchair and of which Senator Murkowski is ranking member is assembling a \ncomprehensive energy bill. We hope to bring it to the Senate floor for \nconsideration soon. That bill will provide an opportunity to promote \nprograms to expand the development of domestic energy resources.\n  I believe the question of whether we should protect our Nation's \nnatural and cultural heritage or instead develop our energy and other \nresources is a false choice. They are mutually exclusive goals. We can \naccomplish them both.\n  A former Senator from my State, who also chaired the then-Interior \nCommittee in the Senate, once said the following:\n\n       Wilderness is an anchor to windward. Knowing it is there, \n     we can also know that we are still a rich Nation, tending our \n     resources as we should--not a people in despair searching \n     every last nook and cranny of our land for a board of lumber, \n     a barrel of oil, a blade of grass, or a tank of water.\n\n  Let me also indicate that there are many provisions in this bill that \nare of particular importance to my State: the Navajo Nation Indian \nWater Rights Settlement; the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Project; \nthe Rio Grande Pueblo Irrigation Infrastructure legislation; the SECURE \nWater Act, which has national implications but is important to my State \nas well; Prehistoric Trackways National Monument; Fort Stanton-Snowy \nRiver Cave National Conservation Area; Sabinoso Wilderness, which \nSenator Udall has spearheaded; Rio Puerco Watershed Act; and also the \nForest Landscape Restoration Act.\n  This bill will have a far-reaching and positive impact on New \nMexico's precious and scarce water resources. The most significant \nprovision is the settlement of the Navajo Nation's water rights claims \nin the San Juan River basin.\n  This settlement will avoid conflicts, risks, and costs that would be \nborne by the Navajo Nation, individual water users, municipalities, the \nState of New Mexico, and the Federal Government if the Navajo claims \nwere litigated in-full. Instead, defining the Navajo Nation's water \nrights by agreement will improve water management in the basin and \nensure that future water demands can be addressed through an efficient \nadministrative process.\n  Most important, however, is that the settlement will provide a \nsustainable water supply to Navajo communities in the eastern portion \nof the Navajo Reservation. Currently, 40 percent of the population on \nthe reservation--approximately 70,000 people--must haul water for use \nin their homes. This situation has resulted in serious health, \neducation, and economic consequences for the Navajo people. This \nlegislation will begin to address these issues, as well as the United \nStates' obligations to the Navajo Nation.\n  On the opposite side of the State, several communities are facing an \nuncertain water future due to falling levels of groundwater in the \nOgallala aquifer. To address this problem, the bill authorizes the \nBureau of Reclamation to help develop the Eastern New Mexico Rural \nWater System. This project will use an available water supply in Ute \nReservoir to provide communities in eastern New Mexico with a renewable \nwater supply and the long-term security that is critical to the \nregion's future. As a measure of its importance, the State of New \nMexico already has provided about $8 million to develop the project. \nEnacting this legislation will help communities in Curry and Roosevelt \nCounties secure the water needed to sustain current economic activity \nand support future development in the region.\n  In the heart of New Mexico is the Rio Grande. Over the past decade, \nthere have been many conflicts over this magnificent, but limited \nresource. Conserving water and improving inefficient infrastructure has \nbeen a key factor in minimizing these conflicts. Unfortunately, Native \nAmericans residing in the Rio Grande basin have not benefited greatly \nfrom these improvements. This bill will change that situation by \ndirecting the Bureau of Reclamation to work with the Rio Grande Pueblos \nto assess irrigation infrastructure and initiate projects to \nrehabilitate and repair such infrastructure on Pueblo lands.\n  By focusing Federal resources and expertise on this problem now, the \nFederal Government, as part of its trust responsibility, will help \nprevent further deterioration of Pueblo irrigation systems and avoid \nadditional rehabilitation costs in the future. The Pueblos will benefit \nmarkedly from increased agricultural productivity, increased water \nconservation, and safer facilities. More importantly, however, these \nimprovements will help the Pueblos to sustain their historical way of \nlife, both economically and culturally. Finally, the overall health of \nthe Rio Grande basin will likely benefit through increased efficiency \nin water use.\n  The final water provision I want to mention is one that will benefit \nNew Mexico and many other States. The SECURE Water Act is based on the \nview that effectively addressing water issues requires a better \nunderstanding of the resource, and increasing the efficiency of its \nuse. For that reason, the bill seeks to strengthen the national \nstreamflow program, improve ground water monitoring efforts, enhance \nour understanding of water uses and availability, and provide grants to \nimplement water conservation and efficiency projects.\n  It also will improve our understanding of the impacts of climate \nchange on water and ensure that adaptation strategies are formulated \nand implemented. This is particularly important in New Mexico, where \none recent study by researchers at the University of New Mexico and New \nMexico State predicts that surface water in the Rio Grande basin could \ndecline by as much as 12 percent by 2030 and 33 percent by 2080.\n  New Mexico will also benefit from a number of important public land \nprovisions, including the designation of a new national monument.\n  The Prehistoric Trackways National Monument in Dona Ana County, New \nMexico, will protect a remarkable ``megatracksite'' of 290 million-\nyear-old fossils. This site of worldwide scientific significance has \npreserved the trackways of some of the earliest creatures to make their \nway out of the ocean, which will help fill in the gaps left from \nstudying only their fossilized bones.\n  Las Cruces resident Jerry MacDonald first brought the find to light \nin 1988, and thanks to a more recent discovery by MacDonald, we now \nknow that the National Monument also will protect a well-preserved 290 \nmillion-year-old petrified forest where three new species of trees \nalready have been discovered. The local curation of these specimens \nshould provide unique scientific and educational opportunities for the \nsurrounding community and visitors to the region.\n  The Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave National Conservation Area in \nLincoln\n\n[[Page S3391]]\n\nCounty, NM, will permanently protect the cave system, including a \npassageway containing a more than 4-mile-long continuous calcite-\ncrystal river bed, a unique formation that is believed to be the \nlongest one of its kind in the world.\n  While exploration of this cave began centuries ago, it was not until \n2001 that volunteers with the Fort Stanton Cave Study Group discovered \nthe Snowy River passageway, which defied their wildest expectations. \nThis discovery already has yielded valuable scientific research in \nhydrology, geology, and microbiology, the last of which may even have \napplications in interplanetary exploration. We will be proud to include \nthe Fort Stanton-Snowy River Cave on New Mexico's prestigious list of \nworld-class sites.\n  The bill also includes legislation spearheaded by Senator Tom Udall--\nthe designation of the 16,000 acre Sabinoso Wilderness in San Miguel \nCounty, NM. The Sabinoso Wilderness will protect a rugged and beautiful \nlandscape that provides important wildlife habitat and represents an \nimportant watershed to our State.\n  New Mexico is the home of the first congressionally designated \nwilderness area, and the Sabinoso Wilderness represents a well-deserved \naddition to the National Wilderness Preservation System. I hope our \nefforts to permanently protect this area will ensure that future \ngenerations can enjoy this outstanding public resource.\n  This bill also will reauthorize the Rio Puerco Watershed Act, which \nformalized the Rio Puerco Management Committee in New Mexico. The \ncommittee has become one of the most effective collaborative land \nmanagement efforts in the Southwest. And for more than 10 years, it has \nhelped facilitate the restoration of the highly degraded Rio Puerco \nWatershed, the largest tributary to the Rio Grande. There is much more \nwork to be done to restore this watershed, and this legislation will \nassist the committee in that effort.\n  Title IV of the bill--the Forest Landscape Restoration Act--holds \ngreat promise for our fire-dependant forests and communities in New \nMexico and across the country. Wildfire activity and suppression costs \nhave grown dramatically in recent years. The affects of global warming \nare increasingly impacting forest and watershed health. And communities \nacross the country are struggling economically.\n  This legislation will establish a program to select and fund \ncollaborative landscape-scale forest restoration projects that will \nimprove forest health, reduce wildfire management costs, and benefit \nlocal economies. The positive response that we have seen from Members \nof Congress, State and local officials, and communities across the \ncountry speaks to the importance of these issues and the promise of \nthis approach. I hope we can quickly provide funding to implement the \nlegislation, as we cannot afford to wait to begin this critical work.\n  It is past time for us to enact these measures to provide water to \nour communities, to protect our natural wonders, and to restore our \nnatural resources. Many New Mexicans have worked for years to see these \nprovisions enacted into law, and I am pleased the Senate is taking the \nimportant steps toward achieving that goal.\n  I yield the remainder of my time to the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, as we conclude the debate on this \npublic lands package, I think it is important to remind colleagues of \nperhaps a few facts--a little bit of the history as to how we got here.\n  As the chairman of the Energy Committee indicated, this omnibus \npublic lands package consists of 160 bills and what they represent in \nterms of the legislation and efforts of communities, of individuals, of \ngroups, of legislators, to come to a point where they may finally be \nseeing a resolution on the issues they have been working on, and I \nthink it is important to put this into context.\n  One of the measures in this public lands package that relates to my \nState is an issue we have been working on--a land exchange--for almost \ntwo decades now in an effort to try to resolve it. Through a great deal \nof compromise with agencies, with public interest groups, and with \npolicymakers, we have legislation that we believe works.\n  My colleague from Utah, Senator Bennett, has been working on a \nprovision that he, too, acknowledges has been over 10 years in the \nmaking. My colleague, Senator Crapo, from Idaho, has been working on \nlegislation that has been 8 years in the process. We on the Energy \nCommittee have been working with Members to try to advance good \nprojects and legislation that work in their respective States.\n  Our public lands States are a little different from what we see on \nthe East Coast. When you have 60 percent of the land in your State \nowned by the Federal Government, oftentimes just getting a transaction \napproved requires an act of Congress. So what we have today in this \npackage, big as it is, is a culmination of countless years of work by \nlawmakers in this body. It is time that we advance many of these very \nimportant measures.\n  This bill is a very bipartisan measure. It is, as I say, 160 bills, \nbut there are both Republican sponsors and Democratic sponsors. It is \nthe work of a lot of compromise on both sides. All but a handful of \nthese bills within the Energy Committee's jurisdiction were ordered \nreported by the committee on a unanimous voice vote.\n  We need to recognize that this is not the work of the 111th Congress. \nIt is not even the work of the 110th. It was before that. This is \ncarryover work in an attempt to take care of a lot of unfinished \nbusiness.\n  I am optimistic that this bill will pass both this body and the other \nbody and be finally signed into law. I am also optimistic that the \n111th Congress can then make a fresh start with public lands \nlegislation and perhaps find a better way to reach consensus on these \ntypes of bills. I hope the process for consideration of this package \ntoday is a harbinger of the future.\n\n  The package we have contains language that the House had sought to \nadd to clarify that access to recreation, including hunting, fishing, \nand trapping, would not be limited by land designations in this bill. \nThis language was bipartisan and bicameral, and the support truly is \nthere.\n  The amendments Senator Coburn brought before this body--six serious, \nrelevant amendments--while I have not agreed with the specifics of some \nof those amendments we have considered, I do take the issues and the \nconcerns raised by them very seriously. I always have and will continue \nto commit to continue to do so in the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources; as we look to legislation in the future, whether it is the \nissue of prioritization or acknowledging an inventory of what we own, \nwhat we are required to operate and maintain is something that is \nworthwhile to pursue.\n  Some of the issues that were raised--for instance, that of eminent \ndomain, locking up our Nation's energy resources--these are issues that \nare clearly legitimate. But I suggest a broad-brush or one-size-fits-\nall prohibition does not work in the real world.\n  The bills in this package were carefully evaluated for these and so \nvery many concerns as they went through the committee. The Energy \nCommittee is very concerned. Our focus is on access to our Nation's \nenergy resources. There was that consideration made bill by bill.\n  The last comment I wish to make is, it has been suggested that \nsomehow or another this lands package is a Federal land grab. In fact, \nthe bill actually transfers over 23,000 acres of Federal land into the \nprivate or State sectors through conveyance, exchange or sale. In most \ninstances, the Federal Government is giving more land into private \nhands than they are getting or the exchanges are of equal acres or \nequal value.\n  Again, I will not suggest the process we have gone through has been \nthe easiest. It is difficult when you have the number of bills we have \nand issues that are contentious and that require a great deal of effort \nand compromise. But the product before this body today is one where I \nwould agree with our chairman of the Energy Committee, it does help to \nprotect our country's great assets, it does allow for better \nenhancements of our public lands, and I think it is worthy of \nconsideration by this full body. I encourage its support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, today's vote will mark the second time in \n2 months the Senate has passed the Omnibus Public Land Management\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\nAct. On January 15, the Senate passed a similar bill, which encompasses \nover 150 bills related to our Nation's natural, historic, and \nrecreational resources. While I am pleased the Senate will again pass \nthis legislation, I am disappointed this widely supported bill has \nrequired nearly 2 weeks of Senate floor time during a time of severe \neconomic crisis.\n  The omnibus public land bill includes four provisions I authored that \nwill directly benefit Michigan by preserving precious natural resources \nand improving our parks and trails.\n  First, the bill would authorize the Federal Government to purchase \nland from willing sellers for the North Country National Scenic Trail, \nthe nation's longest hiking trail, 1,000 miles of which traverse \nthrough Michigan. This trail also runs through New York, Pennsylvania, \nOhio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and New York, with a total length of 4,650 \nmiles. For the majority of the other national scenic and historic \ntrails, the Federal Government has land acquisition authority, but for \nno good reason this authority has not been available for the North \nCountry Trail. Willing sellers, in many cases public-spirited citizens, \nshould have the right to sell easements or even portions of their land \nto the Federal Government should they choose to do so and if it is in \nthe national interest. In addition to important trail linkages, with \nwilling seller authority, sections of the current trail could be moved \nfrom roads where hikers and other trail users are unsafe. I have been \nworking on this willing seller legislation for nearly 10 years, and I \nam pleased that it is going to be approved by the Senate again today.\n  Second, the omnibus public lands bill also includes legislation I \nsponsored last Congress to improve the Keweenaw National Historical \nPark, located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. Established in 1992, this \nunique park, with nearly 20 independently operated heritage sites, \npreserves and interprets the incredible story of copper mining and \nproduction in Michigan's Keweenaw Peninsula that powered the Industrial \nRevolution. This legislation would enable the park to better carry out \nits statutory mission to preserve and bring to life the vibrant history \nof Michigan's ``copper country.'' Specifically, the legislation would \nchange the onerous matching requirement for federal funds from a 4:1 \nratio to a 1:1 ratio, which is typical for most other Park System units \nthat require a non-federal funding match. The legislation would also \nincrease the authorized level of funds to be appropriated for the park \nto enable the preservation, restoration, and interpretation of the \nnumerous historical properties within the park boundaries. Finally, the \nlegislation would eliminate an overly restrictive prohibition on the \nDepartment of the Interior from acquiring certain lands. Making these \nchanges would improve the visitors' experience, preserve important \nhistoric resources, and help with economic revitalization of the \nKeweenaw Peninsula.\n  Third, the bill provides important protections for about 16 percent \nof the land--or 12,000 acres--within the Pictured Rocks National \nLakeshore, located in Michigan's Upper Peninsula along the south shore \nof majestic Lake Superior. This wilderness legislation, which I \nintroduced during the last Congress, provides natural resource \nprotection while also ensuring that recreational opportunities and \naccess are maintained. The wilderness designation was proposed by the \nPark Service after 5 years of careful planning and extensive public \nconsultation. As a result of that open process, the final wilderness \ndesignation was changed from the initial proposal to respond to many of \nthe concerns expressed by citizens. For example, the access roads to \nthe lakes and campground are not included in the wilderness \ndesignation, so vehicles would still have access to this popular \nrecreation area. Also, motor boats would still be able to access the \nLake Superior shoreline, as the wilderness area does not include the \nLake Superior surface water. In addition, boats using electric motors \nwould still be allowed on Little Beaver and Beaver Lakes within the \nwilderness area. Since 1981, the Beaver Basin area has been managed as \na backcountry and wilderness area, and this wilderness designation \nwould ensure that the valuable habitat and pristine natural features of \nthe region remain the treasure and peaceful sanctuary they are today.\n  Finally, the omnibus lands legislation contains a bill that I \nsponsored in the Senate last year as a companion to Representative John \nDingell's legislation in the U.S. House of Representatives that would \ndesignate land on which the battles of the River Raisin were fought, \nduring the War of 1812, as a unit of the National Park System. This \nland, in Monroe County and Wayne County, MI, includes sites related to \na significant set of battles in an area that was once considered part \nof the ``Northwest,'' a key strategic front in the War of 1812. By \ndesignating this land as a unit of the National Park System, the public \nwill have an opportunity to learn about these battlefield sites. While \nhorrific actions took place at the River Raisin, these events prompted \na rallying cry that became a turning point in the War of 1812, which is \noften called America's ``Second War of Independence.'' I look forward \nto this legislation becoming law in time for the national celebration \nthat will take place on the 200th anniversary of the War of 1812.\n  I am hopeful the House will also pass this legislation and the \nPresident will sign it into law so that we can wrap up one of the major \npieces of unfinished business from the last Congress, which will \nbenefit Michigan and the Nation by improving the preservation of and \naccess to important natural, historic, and recreational resources.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, before the Senator from Oklahoma has \nthe final say, which he certainly should, let me say there are a great \nmany people, excellent staff working for the Democratic side of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee and staff working for Senator \nMurkowski on the Republican side of the committee who deserve great \ncredit. We enumerated those staff when we dealt with this legislation 2 \nmonths ago, and we will do so again in the Record. Let me particularly \nindicate David Brooks here with me and Kara Finkler as the two who have \ndone the most to make this possible. Without their good work, this \nwould not be legislation coming up for final consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, just to add to the comments of \nSenator Bingaman, it is appropriate that we acknowledge our staff. I \nappreciate him doing so. I thank those who worked on the Republican \nside as well. But I also wish to acknowledge some of the Members on our \nside who have been very dogged in an effort to reach final compromise \non this legislation.\n  Senator Crapo from Idaho has been diligent in his efforts, working \nalongside Senator Bennett from Utah and Senator Kyl. I appreciate their \nefforts in getting us to where we are today.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, let me add two additional individuals \nto the list of folks I particularly mentioned by name. Mike Connor, who \nis responsible for all the water rights legislation contained in the \nlegislation in the Secure Water Act, I note for my colleagues that he \nhas been named just today as the President's choice to be head of the \nBureau of Reclamation, which I think is a great thing for the country; \nand Scott Miller, who worked very hard on the forest issues involved \nwith this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I have just a few observations before we \nstart the vote. This has been a long process on this bill. I appreciate \nthe pain and patience of the chairman of the committee. He has been a \ngentleman to work with all the time in our discussions.\n  I also note for the Senate that over 70 of these bills could have \ngone by unanimous consent, but because we chose to have a procedure \nwhere up until now, over the last 2 years, no amendments were ever \nallowed to be offered on any of these bills--none; it was never an \noption--we have taken approximately 7 weeks on something we could have \ndone in 2 weeks if we had an open amendment process like the Senate is \nsupposed to. We find ourselves ping-ponging between the House and the \nSenate because we want to avoid the very purpose for which we\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\nare here, which is open debate and amendment.\n  It should be a lesson to us. The American people win when there is a \ndebate. They lose when we use unanimous consent to pass something that \nis controversial. To say it is not, the average we got on our \namendments was 31 votes. That is almost a third of the Senate. So to \nsay we should pass legislation by unanimous consent when a third of the \nSenate does not agree, I would say there is a great lesson for us and \nthat is, let's open up, let's have a debate, let's put a short period \nof time on it, and let's not have to use procedures to try to, in fact, \nget a debate for the American people.\n  I will also say, in looking at this bill, what have we done? There \nare a lot of good provisions in this bill. I am not opposed to half of \nthis bill. Half of this bill I am adamantly opposed to.\n  I was thinking, as we recognize the Republican and Democratic staff, \nwho is representing truly the American people rather than parochial \ninterests and what staff worked on that? We went through this. We \nrejected transparency for the American people. We rejected the ability \nto know what we have and how to deal with it and how to manage it. We \nhave said no by a vote of this body that we are not going to do that; \nwe like the darkness, the lack of accountability, the lack of \ntransparency that goes to the American people. We rejected eliminating \nearmarks. Every appropriator voted against that amendment, even though \nthe President says and the American people say that is not the way they \nwant to do business. But we rejected it.\n  We have rejected significant amounts of potential renewable energy. \nNinety percent of all geothermal, potential renewable clean energy, is \nput at risk by what we are doing. I know that is disputable, but our \nown Secretary of the Interior this week said we should not put the cart \nbefore the horse. We should have good planning on where we are going \nwith transmission lines, the grids, and everything else, so we can take \nadvantage of solar, wind, and geothermal. But yet we have rejected \nthat.\n  We have rejected prioritizing the needs of our national parks. That \nis what the Senate has done this week. We said: No, we are not going to \ndo that, if we want to do something new, even though we have between \n$12 billion and $19 billion worth of backlogs, as the Government \nAccountability Office said we have significant health and safety risks \nfor our employees and the American public who visit our parks--we \nrejected that. We said: No, we should not take care of what we have now \nbefore we start something new. We have done exactly the opposite of \nwhat the average American would be doing with their own assets.\n  The other thing we have done is we have taken a large amount of oil \nand natural gas and said you can never touch it again. Let me emphasize \nwhy. Of the 80 wilderness bills my colleagues put in this legislation, \n35 of them, under the Wilderness Study Area they said they never should \nbe put into the wilderness, and my colleagues put them in the \nwilderness anyway.\n  The whole project of having the Wilderness Study Area is to use the \nstudy to determine if an area should be wilderness. Not counting \nColorado and Utah, my colleagues put 448,000 acres into wilderness that \nthe study says should never go into wilderness area because they have \nsignificant oil and gas and other energy.\n  We rejected the process by which we do it because parochial interests \nhave trumped the national energy needs of this country, and that does \nnot count Colorado and Utah. Utah has a significant area. So probably \nwell over 35 percent of all the land my colleagues have taken away and \nsaid forever we are never going to touch, we are never going to utilize \nthe natural resources that this country could utilize when we are \nsending $400 billion a year overseas for carbon-based energy which we \nare going to do for the next 20 years no matter what, you have taken it \naway. You said never.\n  As I said earlier, you have taken clean renewables. We don't know \nwhat the percentage is but a significant percentage of geothermal for \nsure. A bill is going to be introduced that is going to take several \nhundred thousand acres out of the California desert by the Senator from \nCalifornia which is prime land for solar. It is getting ready to be \nintroduced so that can never be touched.\n  We have to have energy, and we are ignoring assets that we have. We \nare putting into wilderness area assets that have significant energy. \nWe are ignoring the process under which we said we would make those \ndeterminations. When well over 35 of the 80 were recommended they not \nbe put into wilderness area, what are the American people to think? \nWhere is the common sense to say maybe we ought to plan for the future? \nMaybe we ought to look and say: If we are going to go to a renewable \nportfolio totally of energy in this country, how long is it going to \ntake us to get there and what do we need in between now and then to do \nthat?\n  We are not making good long-term decisions with this bill. We are \nhandicapping ourselves, and we are telling the Middle East: Go ahead \nand jack it up because we are going to limit our options with which we \ncan balance energy needs in this country by what we are doing in this \nbill.\n  Finally, we have said in this bill eminent domain is going to be \nutilized. We say we are not going to do it, but we certainly said: \nAmerican landowner, if we are there and if we decide we want to do \nsomething, we are going to keep it.\n  The fact is, one of the most painful things that occurs to an \nAmerican citizen in this country is your land, without your permission, \neven though you are paid an equitable price for it, is taken from you. \nWe said that is fine. We rejected that. Thirty-five Senators voted to \nnot reject it but 60-some voted to reject it.\n  Let me summarize. We like our earmarks. We don't want to think long \nterm on energy. We reject policies that say we should not put land into \nthe wilderness area, but we do it anyway. We have taken away our \nability to handle the next energy crisis, which is coming. We have told \nthe American people we are going to keep eminent domain and, by the \nway, it doesn't matter if you own property, we will take it if we need \nit.\n  Besides all that, we have now more land area in wilderness in this \ncountry than we have developed land. There is 108 million acres now in \nwilderness in this country and only 106 million acres of developed \nland. When do we have enough? When do we stop tying our arm behind our \nback in terms of energy, whether it is renewable or carbon based? When \ndo we do that? Is it wise and prudent to say we should not leave all \noptions on the table for our energy needs for the future, whether it is \ngreen energy or traditional energy? Why would we send that signal to \nthe rest of the world? And why would we do that to the American \ntaxpayers?\n  What is going to happen on energy prices in this country is natural \ngas is going to double in the next 2 years, and it is going to double \nfor a couple of reasons. One is because they cannot afford to drill for \nit right now at $4. No. 2, we are taking a large swath, 13 million \ncubic feet, one area you have isolated, enough to run this country for \n2\\1/2\\ years. It is proven, we know it is there, it is easy to get out, \nwe don't have to do a whole lot more drilling, but you can't have it. \nWe have taken 300 million barrels of oil in that same area and said: \nAmerica, you can't have it. We know its there, its not hard to get out, \nbut you can't have it. And that is just in one of the ranges we are \nsetting off to the side and not making available to the American public \nto lower their energy costs, to balance the supply-and-demand imbalance \nwe will see in the future.\n\n  It is important that this bill was put together by combining what \nindividuals wanted for their States. I know some of these land and \nwater rights issues are complicated. I know the exchanges are hard, and \nI know protecting things in the right way is important. I know it is to \nthe Senator from Idaho, the Senator from Alaska, and the Senator from \nNew Mexico. But when does the overall best benefit for the American \npeople start trumping things around here instead of what we want \nparochially?\n  I think we have two diseases. I think we have attention deficit \ndisorder in the Senate to what the real problems are, so I think we \nneed to be in a 12-step program to correct that. Then I think we have \nhyperparochialism in the sense that what is most important\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\nis what is important in my State; be danged what happens to the rest of \nthe country.\n  Our country is failing in a lot of areas now, and most of it is our \nfault. But what we will ultimately fail on is when we start thinking \nmore about individual States than the best long-term benefit for the \ncountry. This bill is a classic example where we put parochial \ninterests ahead of the long-term interests of the country.\n  I worry about the grandchildren of this country. This is an $11 \nbillion bill with $900 million in mandatory spending. When we have all \nthese things we need to do that are a much higher priority, we are \ngoing to do this now. I am disappointed in us because we don't think \nlong term, that we think short term. It is beneath the oath we take \nwhen we continue to do this. I want to be proud of what we do, and I \nwant us to be above the influence of any short-term, any parochial, or \nany political decision.\n  The people in this body know me, that I go after Republican projects \nas much as Democrats. I go on the basis of what I think is in the best \nlong-term interest. That is not to say my colleagues don't too, but as \na collective body we have not been doing that. And we are not going to \nfix the real problem in our country, which is the economy. It is \namazing to me that we are spending time on this bill instead of fixing \nthe economic problems of this country; that we are sitting here and we \nhave spent a total of 7 weeks in the last 3 or 4 months on this bill \nrather than working on the real problems and the real needs of this \ncountry.\n  The long-term future of our country is at great risk today, and I am \nnot just talking economically. When we choose to protect home--i.e. \nState or city or earmark--at the expense of the long-term interest of \nour country, we won't last. What has made this country great throughout \nits years is we have had leaders who have said: The heck with my \nposition. What is best for the country should come first.\n  The irony of that--and it is really paradoxical--is, when people see \nthat, we restore confidence. When they see the opposite of that, they \nlose confidence in us. And we ought to be about restoring the American \npeople's confidence. They are rattled today. They are rattled over the \neconomy. They are rattled over their confidence in us, and we ought to \nbe about restoring that. I don't think this bill does that.\n  I appreciate the patience of my colleagues. I have great respect for \nyou. I know your sincere desires. But I truly think we need some \ncoaxing to get our eye back on the ball.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor--I understand we will not vote \nuntil 12:20--and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I am informed the time to vote has \narrived, and I yield back any time that remains on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Under the previous order, all time having expired, the substitute \namendment, as amended, is agreed to.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment, as amended, and \nthird reading of the bill.\n  The amendment, as amended, was ordered to be engrossed and the bill \nto be read a third time.\n  The bill was read a third time.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

In the event that the final cost \n     allocation indicates that the costs properly assignable to \n     the contractor are less than what the contractor has paid, \n     the Secretary is authorized and directed to credit such \n     overpayment as an offset against any outstanding or future \n     obligation of the contractor.\n       (c) Applicability of Certain Provisions.--\n       (1) Notwithstanding any repayment obligation under \n     subsection (a)(3)(B) or subsection (b), upon a contractor's \n     compliance with and discharge of the obligation of repayment \n     of the construction costs as provided in subsection \n     (a)(3)(A), the provisions of section 213(a) and (b) of the \n     Reclamation Reform Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 1269) shall apply to \n     lands in such district.\n       (2) Notwithstanding any repayment obligation under \n     paragraph (3)(B) or (4)(B) of subsection (a), or subsection \n     (b), upon a contractor's compliance with and discharge of the \n     obligation of repayment of the construction costs as provided \n     in paragraphs (3)(A) and (4)(A) of subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall waive the pricing provisions of section \n     3405(d) of the Reclamation Projects Authorization and \n     Adjustment Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-575) for such \n     contractor, provided that such contractor shall continue to \n     pay applicable operation and maintenance costs and other \n     charges applicable to such repayment contracts pursuant to \n     the then-current rate-setting policy and applicable law.\n       (3) Provisions of the Settlement applying to Friant \n     Division, Hidden Unit, and Buchanan Unit long-term water \n     service contracts shall also apply to contracts executed \n     pursuant to this section.\n       (d) Reduction of Charge for Those Contracts Converted \n     Pursuant to Subsection (a)(1).--\n       (1) At the time all payments by the contractor required by \n     subsection (a)(3)(A) have been completed, the Secretary shall \n     reduce the charge mandated in section 10007(1) of this part, \n     from 2020 through 2039, to offset the financing costs as \n     defined in section 10010(d)(3). The reduction shall be \n     calculated at the time all payments by the contractor \n     required by subsection (a)(3)(A) have been completed. The \n     calculation shall remain fixed from 2020 through 2039 and \n     shall be based upon anticipated average annual water \n     deliveries, as mutually agreed upon by the Secretary and the \n     contractor, for the period from 2020 through 2039, and the \n     amounts of such reductions shall be discounted using the \n     Treasury Rate; provided, that such charge shall not be \n     reduced to less than $4.00 per acre foot of project water \n     delivered; provided further, that such reduction shall be \n     implemented annually unless the Secretary determines, based \n     on the availability of other monies, that the charges \n     mandated in section 10007(1) are otherwise needed to cover \n     ongoing federal costs of the Settlement, including any \n     federal operation and maintenance costs of facilities that \n     the Secretary determines are needed to implement the \n     Settlement. If the Secretary determines that such charges are \n     necessary to cover such ongoing federal costs, the Secretary \n     shall, instead of making the reduction in such charges, \n     reduce the contractor's operation and maintenance obligation \n     by an equivalent amount, and such amount shall not be \n     recovered by the United States from any Central Valley \n     Project contractor, provided nothing herein shall affect the \n     obligation of the contractor to make payments pursuant to a \n     transfer agreement with a non-federal operating entity.\n       (2) If the calculated reduction in paragraph (1), taking \n     into consideration the minimum amount required, does not \n     result in the contractor offsetting its financing costs, the \n     Secretary is authorized and directed to reduce, after October \n     1, 2019, any outstanding or future obligations of the \n     contractor to the Bureau of Reclamation, other than the \n     charge assessed and collected under section 3407(d) of Public \n     law 102-575, by the amount of such deficiency, with such \n     amount indexed to 2020 using the Treasury Rate and such \n     amount shall not be recovered by the United States from any \n     Central Valley Project contractor, provided nothing herein \n     shall affect the obligation of the contractor to make \n     payments pursuant to a transfer agreement with a non-Federal \n     operating entity.\n       (3) Financing costs, for the purposes of this subsection, \n     shall be computed as the difference of the net present value \n     of the construction cost identified in subsection (a)(3)(A) \n     using the full Treasury Rate as compared to using one half of \n     the Treasury Rate and applying those rates against a \n     calculated average annual capital repayment through 2030.\n       (4) Effective in 2040, the charge shall revert to the \n     amount called for in section 10007(1) of this part.\n       (5) For purposes of this section, ``Treasury Rate'' shall \n     be defined as the 20 year Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) \n     rate published by the United States Department of the \n     Treasury as of October 1, 2010.\n       (e) Satisfaction of Certain Provisions.--\n       (1) In general.--Upon the first release of Interim Flows or \n     Restoration Flows, pursuant to paragraphs 13 or 15 of the \n     Settlement, any short- or long-term agreement, to which 1 or \n     more long-term Friant Division, Hidden Unit, or Buchanan Unit \n     contractor that converts its contract pursuant to subsection \n     (a) is a party, providing for the transfer or exchange of \n     water not released as Interim Flows or Restoration Flows \n     shall be deemed to satisfy the provisions of subsection \n     3405(a)(1)(A) and (I) of the Reclamation Projects \n     Authorization and Adjustment Act of 1992 (Public Law 102-575) \n     without the further concurrence of the Secretary as to \n     compliance with said subsections if the contractor provides, \n     not later than 90 days before commencement of any such \n     transfer or exchange for a period in excess of 1 year, and \n     not later than 30 days before commencement of any proposed \n     transfer or exchange with duration of less than 1 year, \n     written notice to the Secretary stating how the proposed \n     transfer or exchange is intended to reduce, avoid, or \n     mitigate impacts to water deliveries caused by the Interim \n     Flows or Restoration Flows or is intended to otherwise \n     facilitate the Water Management Goal, as described in the \n     Settlement. The Secretary shall promptly make such notice \n     publicly available.\n       (2) Determination of reductions to water deliveries.--Water \n     transferred or exchanged under an agreement that meets the \n     terms of this subsection shall not be counted as a \n     replacement or an offset for purposes of determining \n     reductions to water deliveries to any Friant Division long-\n     term contractor except as provided in paragraph 16(b) of the \n     Settlement. The Secretary shall, at least annually, make \n     publicly available a compilation of the number of transfer or \n     exchange agreements exercising the provisions of this \n     subsection to reduce, avoid, or mitigate impacts to water \n     deliveries caused by the Interim Flows or Restoration Flows \n     or to facilitate the Water Management Goal, as well as the \n     volume of water transferred or exchanged under such \n     agreements.\n       (3) State law.--Nothing in this subsection alters State law \n     or permit conditions, including any applicable geographical \n     restrictions on the place of use of water transferred or \n     exchanged pursuant to this subsection.\n       (f) Certain Repayment Obligations Not Altered.--\n     Implementation of the provisions of this section shall not \n     alter the repayment obligation of any other long-term water \n     service or repayment contractor receiving water from the\n\n[[Page S3489]]\n\n     Central Valley Project, or shift any costs that would \n     otherwise have been properly assignable to the Friant \n     contractors absent this section, including operations and \n     maintenance costs, construction costs, or other capitalized \n     costs incurred after the date of enactment of this Act, to \n     other such contractors.\n       (g) Statutory Interpretation.--Nothing in this part shall \n     be construed to affect the right of any Friant Division, \n     Hidden Unit, or Buchanan Unit long-term contractor to use a \n     particular type of financing to make the payments required in \n     paragraph (3)(A) or (4)(A) of subsection (a).\n\n     SEC. 10011. CALIFORNIA CENTRAL VALLEY SPRING RUN CHINOOK \n                   SALMON.\n\n       (a) Finding.--Congress finds that the implementation of the \n     Settlement to resolve 18 years of contentious litigation \n     regarding restoration of the San Joaquin River and the \n     reintroduction of the California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon is a unique and unprecedented circumstance \n     that requires clear expressions of Congressional intent \n     regarding how the provisions of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) are utilized to achieve the \n     goals of restoration of the San Joaquin River and the \n     successful reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring \n     Run Chinook salmon.\n       (b) Reintroduction in the San Joaquin River.--California \n     Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon shall be \n     reintroduced in the San Joaquin River below Friant Dam \n     pursuant to section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of \n     1973 (16 U.S.C. 1539(j)) and the Settlement, provided that \n     the Secretary of Commerce finds that a permit for the \n     reintroduction of California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon may be issued pursuant to section 10(a)(1)(A) \n     of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1539(a)(1)(A)).\n       (c) Final Rule.--\n       (1) Definition of third party.--For the purpose of this \n     subsection, the term ``third party'' means persons or \n     entities diverting or receiving water pursuant to applicable \n     State and Federal laws and shall include Central Valley \n     Project contractors outside of the Friant Division of the \n     Central Valley Project and the State Water Project.\n       (2) Issuance.--The Secretary of Commerce shall issue a \n     final rule pursuant to section 4(d) of the Endangered Species \n     Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(d)) governing the incidental take \n     of reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook \n     salmon prior to the reintroduction.\n       (3) Required components.--The rule issued under paragraph \n     (2) shall provide that the reintroduction will not impose \n     more than de minimus: water supply reductions, additional \n     storage releases, or bypass flows on unwilling third parties \n     due to such reintroduction.\n       (4) Applicable law.--Nothing in this section--\n       (A) diminishes the statutory or regulatory protections \n     provided in the Endangered Species Act of 1973 for any \n     species listed pursuant to section 4 of the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533) other than the \n     reintroduced population of California Central Valley Spring \n     Run Chinook salmon, including protections pursuant to \n     existing biological opinions or new biological opinions \n     issued by the Secretary or Secretary of Commerce; or\n       (B) precludes the Secretary or Secretary of Commerce from \n     imposing protections under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.) for other species listed pursuant to \n     section 4 of that Act (16 U.S.C. 1533) because those \n     protections provide incidental benefits to such reintroduced \n     California Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon.\n       (d) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than December 31, 2024, the \n     Secretary of Commerce shall report to Congress on the \n     progress made on the reintroduction set forth in this section \n     and the Secretary's plans for future implementation of this \n     section.\n       (2) Inclusions.--The report under paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) an assessment of the major challenges, if any, to \n     successful reintroduction;\n       (B) an evaluation of the effect, if any, of the \n     reintroduction on the existing population of California \n     Central Valley Spring Run Chinook salmon existing on the \n     Sacramento River or its tributaries; and\n       (C) an assessment regarding the future of the \n     reintroduction.\n       (e) FERC Projects.--\n       (1) In general.--With regard to California Central Valley \n     Spring Run Chinook salmon reintroduced pursuant to the \n     Settlement, the Secretary of Commerce shall exercise its \n     authority under section 18 of the Federal Power Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 811) by reserving its right to file prescriptions in \n     proceedings for projects licensed by the Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission on the Calaveras, Stanislaus, Tuolumne, \n     Merced, and San Joaquin rivers and otherwise consistent with \n     subsection (c) until after the expiration of the term of the \n     Settlement, December 31, 2025, or the expiration of the \n     designation made pursuant to subsection (b), whichever ends \n     first.\n       (2) Effect of subsection.--Nothing in this subsection shall \n     preclude the Secretary of Commerce from imposing \n     prescriptions pursuant to section 18 of the Federal Power Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 811) solely for other anadromous fish species \n     because those prescriptions provide incidental benefits to \n     such reintroduced California Central Valley Spring Run \n     Chinook salmon.\n       (f) Effect of Section.--Nothing in this section is intended \n     or shall be construed--\n       (1) to modify the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et \n     seq.); or\n       (2) to establish a precedent with respect to any other \n     application of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1531 et seq.) or the Federal Power Act (16 U.S.C. 791a et \n     seq.).\n\n              PART II--STUDY TO DEVELOP WATER PLAN;

Madam President, today the Senate has passed H.R. 146, \nthe Omnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009. As I said during the \ndebate, H.R. 146 includes over 160 bills from the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources and reflects many years of hard work.\n  This achievement would not have been possible without the hard work \nof our outstanding staff. Both our ranking member, Senator Murkowski, \nand I are very fortunate to have a very dedicated and experienced \nprofessional staff. They service the committee and the Senate well. \nThey deserve our thanks.\n  On the Democratic staff of the committee, I would like to thank the \ncommittee's staff director, Bob Simon, and chief counsel, Sam Fowler, \nfor all of their work on this legislation, as on all the legislation \nthat comes through our committee. I would also like to thank senior \ncounsel Patty Beneke; counsel Mike Connor, who worked on all of the \nwater issues included in the bill; counsels David Brooks, Kira Finkler, \nand Scott Miller, who coordinated all of the park and public lands \nbills; professional staff members Jorge Silva-Banuelos, who worked very \nhard on many of the New Mexico land bills; and Jonathan Epstein; and \ntwo National Park Service fellows, Karl Cordova, who worked on the \ncommittee last year, and Mike Gauthier, who is on the staff for the \ncurrent year.\n  I would also like to thank the committee's chief clerk, Mia Bennett; \nexecutive assistant Amanda Kelly; communications director Bill Wicker; \npress secretary David Marks; and staff assistants Rachel Pasternack, \nAnna-Kristina Fox, Gina Weinstock, and Rosemarie Calabro.\n  On the Republican side, let me acknowledge Senator Murkowski's new \nstaff director, McKie Campbell, and chief counsel Karen Billups. I \nwould also like to note my thanks to former Senator Domenici's staff \ndirector during the previous Congress, Frank Macchiarola, former \nminority chief counsel, Judy Pensabene, and former professional staff \nmember Tom Lillie. I would also like to recognize counsel Kellie \nDonnelly; as well as professional staff members Frank Gladics, Josh \nJohnson, Chuck Kleeschulte, and Kaleb Froehlich, all of whom made \nsignificant contributions to this bill.\n  In addition, I am very grateful to the committee's nondesignated \nstaff: Allison Seyfurth, Dawson Foard, Nancy Hall, Amber Passmore, \nMonica Chestnut, and Wanda Green.\n  H.R. 146 contains over 1,200 pages of text, and was the subject of \nnumerous revisions. I am grateful to the help of the Senate legislative \ncounsel office, and Gary Endicott, Heather Burnham, and Colin Campbell \nin particular.\n  I would also like to thank Cliff Isenberg from the Senate Budget \nCommittee for his help; as well as Deb Reis from the Congressional \nBudget Office, and Tyler Kruzich, formerly with CBO.\n  Finally, let me acknowledge the great help in bringing the bill to \nthe floor we received from the majority leader and his staff: Neil \nKornze, Chris Miller, Randy DeValk, Gary Myrick, and, as always, the \nsecretary for the majority, Lula Davis, as well as Tim Mitchell, the \nassistant secretary for the majority. I would also like to thank the \ncloakroom staff, Joe Lapia, Meredith Mellody, Brandon Durflinger, and \nEstaban Galvan, for all of their assistance.\n  All of these fine staff members had a hand in putting H.R. 146 \ntogether and moving it through the legislative process. We would not \nhave been able to pass the bill without their hard work and their \nprofessionalism. I wish to thank each and every one of them for their \ngood work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3513-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3513]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we just took a very important vote on a \nvery important bill that is good for our country and good for our \nfamilies. It is good for our heritage. It is good for our economy \nbecause I would argue that when we preserve magnificent places in our \nland, it encourages people to come and see those places and spend time \naround those places and spend money around those places, and that helps \nour economy.\n  I thank the leaders of the Energy Committee on both sides of the \naisle, Senators Bingaman and Murkowski, and others on the committee. I \nalso thank the staff who worked hard, and I want to take exception to a \nremark by Senator Coburn. After the staff was thanked, he got up and \nsaid, ``Well, what staff works for the American people?'' Well, I would \nargue that all the staff here and all of the Senators here work for the \nAmerican people. And\n\n[[Page S3514]]\n\neven though Senator Coburn does not bless every provision in this bill, \nthis bill has huge support because the bills in this package will \nprotect some of the most breathtaking places in the Nation, areas that \nprovide a refuge for birdwatchers, hikers, campers, equestrians, \nfishermen, and other visitors who are looking to escape our Nation's \ncrowded, fast-passed cities to enjoy the tranquility of nature.\n  I am going to show a few pictures. This is in the Eastern Sierra, the \nbighorn sheep. We are protecting this magnificent creature that I know \nSenator Harkin appreciates.\n  The bald eagle, which we know we have been doing a lot to save, will \nbe preserved in the many acres we preserve in my home State of \nCalifornia.\n  In the Riverside bill, this is another magnificent scene of the \nmountains and the beautiful vegetation that grows without any water to \nspeak of.\n  The Eastern Sierra, these White Mountains--imagine the beauty of \nthis. So when people come and say we are not doing right by America to \nsave areas such as this, all I say is, open your eyes and gaze upon \nGod's creation. It is so magnificent.\n  I have one more photo I would like to show you. I know Senator \nSchumer feels the way I do about this. In the Eastern Sierras, this \nbeautiful creek here, a beautiful place to come and enjoy the day, as I \nsaid, get away from our crowded cities, bring your family, and stay in \nthe area.\n  Many bills in this package provide much needed water resources for \nour communities. It provides recycled water to areas suffering from \ndrought, restoring major watersheds. We are experiencing one of the \nworst droughts in our State's history. That is why a coalition of 16 \nwestern water agencies and organizations wrote to Congress about the \nurgency of passing this bill that we happily just passed.\n  You saw some of the magnificent photos of some of the wilderness \nareas in California that have been saved. They are in what is called \nthe California Desert and Mountain Heritage Act, the Sequoia-Kings \nCanyon National Park Wilderness Act, and the Eastern Sierra and \nNorthern San Gabriel Wild Heritage Act.\n  I want to make a point to colleagues. On each of these wilderness \nareas, I worked with colleagues in the House, many of whom are \nRepublicans, and I thank them enormously for their work: Buck McKeon, \nMary Bono Mack, Devin Nunes. I also worked with many Democrats, \nincluding Jim Costa. So we have had a wonderful working relationship \nacross party lines.\n  There are 700,000 acres of wilderness and/or wilderness study areas \nand 105 miles of wild and scenic rivers in this bill in my home State. \nI would say again to Senator Coburn, although I suppose the best thing \nI can say to him is his argument did not win the day, is that it is our \nresponsibility, I would say to him, to protect these magnificent areas \nso future generations can enjoy them exactly as we do. These are \nbreathtaking places in California. They provide critically important \nhabitat, as you saw, for the Peninsular bighorn sheep, the mule deer, \nmountain lions, desert tortoises, and bald eagles.\n  Again, the economics of this are very clear. In a time of recession, \nwe want to look to the future for jobs, and we know that wilderness \nbills, just the three of mine in this bill, will produce an estimated \n420 jobs and $7 million in income to my State. I cannot say enough \nabout the importance of opportunities such as this when you save the \nenvironment and you create jobs and everybody comes away a winner.\n  I would like to respond to some things Senator Coburn has been saying \nabout one of these bills, the California Desert and Mountain Heritage \nAct. He has questioned why we are designating Beauty Mountain and the \nPinto Mountains as wilderness in this bill even though the Bureau of \nLand Management failed to recommend them for wilderness back in 1990. \nWell, the answer is that a lot has changed since then--private lands \nhave since been acquired by the BLM and dozens of mining claims have \nbeen retired. Without these restrictions, the BLM now supports \nwilderness designation for these areas and has testified before \nCongress in support of this bill. Also, Congress has repeatedly \nasserted its right to name wilderness areas--the agencies make \nrecommendations but we make the final decision based on what we are \nhearing from the constituents we represent.\n  These three bills have bipartisan, bicameral, and diverse support. \nThey would not impact the use of private lands, but would simply \nimprove the protection of existing Forest Service, National Park \nService, or Bureau of Land Management lands.\n  While preserving these areas, we have been careful to accommodate \nstakeholders' needs. For example, we worked to clarify that the Eastern \nSierra and Northern San Gabriel Wild Heritage bill's designation of a \nWild and Scenic River on segments of Piru Creek will not affect the \noperations of the United Water Conservation District or Pyramid Dam on \nthe creek, including any rights they may have to modify water releases.\n  I will close by thanking my colleague, Senator Feinstein, for not \nonly supporting my wilderness bills that are in here but for her \nleadership in the San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act, which \nis included in this bill.\n  Senator Coburn tried to remove it from this bill. I do not understand \nhis motivation. The settlement ended 18 years of litigation over the \nimpacts of the Friant Dam on Chinook salmon populations. Why on Earth \nwould anyone try to derail a settlement and drive us back into the \ncourthouse?\n  What is in here is a carefully crafted compromise solution that is \ngood for our environment, for our agricultural economy, and for our \nurban communities.\n  Again, there is more to be said on this matter. I will say again, to \nsee Senator Coburn get up and try to torpedo this important legislation \nwas kind of shocking to me because once in a while I say we should come \ntogether here to preserve our Nation's heritage and to try to avoid \nlitigation.\n  You know, the fact is, the San Joaquin settlement had broad \nbipartisan support, has it in my State, from the Governor. We even have \nthe support of the outgoing Bush administration, bipartisan House \nMembers, water agencies, conservation groups, elected officials.\n  So it is a happy day, frankly, for my State of California, a very \nhappy day--700,000 acres of wilderness, the settlement over the San \nJoaquin River--and for this whole Nation it is a wonderful moment \nbecause we addressed the drought some of our areas are facing.\n  The areas in this bill are truly magnificent places representing \nCalifornia's and the Nation's incredible range of landscapes and \nhabitats. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to enact this bill into law and protect these treasures for \nfuture generations of Americans.\n  I hope this bill will get much attention. I hope the President will \nhave a ceremony when he signs this bill because it deserve far more \nattention than it has been getting. It is good for the environment, it \nis good for the economy, and it shows a spirit of bipartisanship that I \nknow our President and all of us encourage.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3514-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3514-S3515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee for her passionate \ndefense of our natural resources. She is a constant ally of the very \nbest we cull forth from each other as Senators where our most precious \nenvironmental concerns are engaged. It is an honor to follow her.\n  Before I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from New \nHampshire, who has already made an impact here, I wanted to say a few \nwords about the President's new budget.\n  Across the country, families sit at their kitchen tables and talk and \nmake tough choices about their own family budget, about what they can \nafford to spend, about what they have to save. What will they do when \nit is time for the kids to go to college? What will they do if the car \nbreaks down? What will they do if an elderly parent becomes ill? How \nwill they use their finances wisely to plan for the future? This year, \nthose choices are more difficult than ever. We have families in Rhode \nIsland, as I am sure we have\n\n[[Page S3515]]\n\nacross the country, trying to save their homes, to save their jobs, to \nsave their health care. The bills pile up, and all too often there is \nnot enough to pay them. Well, our country is in a deep hole too. But I \nwould like to remind my colleagues that it was not always this way.\n  In January 2001, when George Bush became President, the Congressional \nBudget Office, which is the non-partisan accounting arm of Congress \nthat does our budget outlook on a regular basis, projected that we \nwould see surpluses straight through the decade. These budget \nsurpluses, the product of President Clinton's responsible governing, \nwere projected to be enough to completely wipe out our national debt by \n2009, this very year. Imagine, a debt-free America this year. Well, \nPresident Bush fixed that.\n  Usually when American families have a surplus, they use it \nresponsibly, they pay down credit card debt or make an extra mortgage \npayment. They put it away in retirement savings. They set it aside for \ncollege for the kids. Or they spend it on something they need, such as \na downpayment on a car or a house. Well, President Bush chose tax cuts \nfor the wealthiest Americans, a misguided war he would not pay for--an \nirresponsible economic policy, leaving a mountain of debt to the next \nadministration. He, of course, had the enthusiastic support of a \nRepublican Congress which was with him every step of the way into this \ndebt.\n  Today, the difference between the expected surpluses left by \nPresident Clinton and the actual deficit run up by President Bush is a \nstaggering $8.9 trillion--$8.9 trillion on America from the Bush \nadministration and its Republican allies in Congress.\n  So that is what President Obama inherited--a legacy of reckless \nborrowing, bad decisions, compounded by skyrocketing unemployment and \nnow a deepening recession that only adds to our country's fiscal woes.\n  President Obama is trying to help us dig our way out of this mess by \nfocusing his budget on the policies and programs that will repair our \neconomy and create the foundation for long-term economic growth and \nsuccess. He proposed, and we passed, an economic recovery plan to \ncreate jobs and support struggling families and make badly needed \ninvestments in our infrastructure during this recession. It wasn't \nperfect. It probably will not be enough. But it was a good start.\n  Now, the same Republican Party that thought tax cuts for the rich and \nan unnecessary war in Iraq were good uses of President Clinton's budget \nsurpluses, the same Republican Party that ran up an $8.9 trillion debt \non the country now has its leaders calling President Obama's plans \n``the fleecing of America's children.'' It is hard to imagine that this \nirony eludes them.\n  President Obama wants to cut taxes for working families, invest in \nrenewable energy, help more young people get a college education, and \nreform our broken health care system--key priorities for the future of \nAmerica. But some Republicans who stood by while our country became \nmore and more dependent on foreign oil, while the cost of a college \neducation went through the roof, and while a crisis brewed in our \nhealth care system are calling these investments in our future ``a \nremarkable spending binge.'' Once again, the ``department of irony'' \nappears to be open late on the other side of the aisle.\n  Families in America know we will not get out of this mess with the \nsame failed policies that got us into it--that it is time for new \npriorities. That is what President Obama's budget offers.\n  Perhaps our greatest challenge, certainly one of our greatest \nchallenges and opportunities, is presented by our broken and \ndysfunctional health care system. Unless we take serious remedial \naction and soon, right away, this recession we are living through now \nwill seem like an economic speed bump compared to what will happen when \nthat $35 trillion in unfunded Medicare liabilities, against which we \nhave set not one nickel, comes bearing down on us.\n  We had a lot of fighting in this body about that Recovery and \nReinvestment Act. The Recovery and Reinvestment Act was nearly $800 \nbillion. Compare that to the Bush debt I talked about that they ran up \nof $8.9 trillion. Where was the complaining then? Compare that to the \n$35 trillion in unfunded liabilities we face for Medicare. Where are \nthe serious ideas about how we address this problem?\n  When you put these problems to scale, you will see that wave of cost, \nthat tsunami of health care cost coming at us is something we have to \naddress. We are facing truly the financial ruin of our health care \nsystem and, if nothing is done, the financial ruin of our country. \nEvery one of us should share the goal of making sure health insurance \ncoverage reaches every American. President Obama's budget makes a \ndownpayment on that badly needed reform. But it is not enough just to \ngive coverage to everybody. It is not enough just to get everybody on \nboard, if the boat itself is sinking.\n  We have two toolboxes out of which we can fix our health care mess. \nOne reduces coverage, cuts benefits, pays providers less, and raises \ntaxes. That is the old-fashioned toolbox. It will work, but it will be \nbrutal. It will be wrong, and we should do everything we can to prevent \nit. The other toolbox reforms the health care system itself, making it \nmore intelligent, sensible, helpful, and efficient; with an information \ntechnology infrastructure so every American can count on their own \nsecure electronic health record, with improvements in the quality of \nhealth care so we maximize the effectiveness while reducing the cost; \nand with reform of having paid for health care so the health care we \nwant is the health care we are paying for.\n  The President sees that all of this is doable--and that we need to \nstart now. His economic recovery legislation put nearly $20 billion \ninto health information infrastructure. But the President knows there \nis much more to be done, that these delivery system reforms in health \ncare cannot be flipped on like a light switch. It will require complex \nworkforce, regulatory, and infrastructure changes. Then those changes \nwill have to be implemented and administered. It will take some years, \nand we need to start now. The Obama budget starts us on that course to \nfix our broken health care system.\n  I find it unfortunate that our Republican colleagues don't seem to \nappreciate the seriousness of these problems and have become a chorus \nof naysayers with no solutions. It is time to pass a budget that lives \nup to the expectations of the American people. I hope we will.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I would like to applaud my colleague, \nSenator Whitehouse, for his comments, particularly around health care. \nI know all of us believe that is critical for us to address.\n  I rise to express my outrage that AIG has paid over $165 million in \nbonuses to executives at the company, after they received a $173 \nbillion bailout in taxpayer funds. We all know the economic conditions \nwe are facing are very difficult. Unemployment continues to climb \naround the country and in my home State of New Hampshire. Families are \nstruggling to make ends meet. Existing home sales are at their lowest \nlevels in more than a decade. Small businesses around the country and \nin New Hampshire are working hard just to make payroll, to buy \ninventory, and to keep their businesses viable. In fact, this morning I \nheard from a small businessman in New Hampshire, Mark Lane, who is the \nhead of Coed Sportswear and Printed Matter, talk about the challenges \nhe faces in this recession, trying to get access to credit to keep his \nbusiness going.\n  Yet while small businesses and middle-class families are struggling \nto make it through these difficult times, the very people whose \nreckless decisionmaking helped put us in this precarious economic \nsituation are rewarding themselves with bonuses paid for with taxpayer \ndollars. This is unconscionable.\n  We have been told nothing can be done about the bonuses to AIG \nemployees because they are contractual commitments. Yesterday, we heard \nthe CEO of AIG say he has asked the recipients of the bonuses to give \nthe money back. I believe those employees should do that, and I hope \nthey will. But we should make sure that when taxpayer money is used, we \nhave done\n\n[[Page S3516]]\n\neverything possible to prevent the kind of excesses we have seen with \nAIG.\n  As a condition of providing financing to General Motors and Chrysler, \nthe Treasury Department required the automakers to renegotiate their \ncollective bargaining agreements with their workers. In order for their \nemployers to get loans from the Treasury, autoworkers gave up cost-of-\nliving increases to their wages and bonuses, among other benefits. It \nis our obligation, as we did with General Motors and Chrysler, to \nprotect taxpayer dollars. That is why, in January of this year, I voted \nagainst releasing an additional $350 billion in TARP funding. I opposed \nthe release of this funding because I believed we did not have adequate \naccounting of the money the United States had already spent in the \nbailout. At the time I said: We need legislation to enhance \ntransparency and to enhance taxpayer protections before we release \nadditional money.\n  Earlier this year, Senator Dorgan introduced the Taxpayer Protection \nAct, something I quickly signed on to as a cosponsor. This legislation \nis designed to limit executive compensation, to prohibit the kinds of \nbonuses companies such as AIG, which have received Federal economic \nassistance, can provide to their employees or their executives. Today \nwe are reminded that the use of taxpayer money should be held to the \nhighest standards of transparency and accountability.\n  I am hopeful this administration--and we have heard the President say \nhe is committed to doing something about the situation at AIG, and we \nknow this Senate is committed to doing something about the situation at \nAIG with their executive bonuses--and this body will take the \nappropriate action to recover the taxpayer dollars AIG has so \nrecklessly spent on bonuses. I intend to do everything I can to support \nthose efforts.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I will do so, although after \nlistening to the presentation of the Senator from Rhode Island, I wish \nI had a little bit more time.

Madam President, today is a very significant day. Right \nnow we are actually looking at the sixth anniversary of the Operation \nIraqi Freedom. We sometimes have forgotten about the butcher from Iraq \nand how bad that was. I had personal experience during the first Gulf \nWar of being there and seeing some of the things that went on, the \nhorrible torture and the things that this particular dictator had done \nto that country. When we went in 6 years ago, it was a very difficult \ntime because we went in with a military that had been downgraded during \nthe Clinton administration. If you take a straight line in terms of \nwhat the expenditures were the day he took office, that is how much we \nreduced it in force strength, in our modernization program. In fact, \nthis euphoric attitude people were talking about, saying the Cold War \nis over, we no longer need a strong military, that is the environment \nwe had. I think, under those circumstances, we did an incredible job.\n  I have never been so impressed with an all-volunteer Army. I happen \nto have been a product of the draft. I believed that offered more \ndiscipline. When I went there--and I honestly believe I have made more \ntrips to Iraq and Afghanistan than any other Member as the second-\nranking member of the Armed Services Committee--I was privileged to be \nin places such as Fallujah during all the elections that took place and \nto see our young people, not all that well equipped, take on difficult \nodds. The marines in Fallujah were part of this, and it was incredible \nto watch. It was more than the World War II door-to-door style of \ncombat.\n  Then I was very proud to be a part of the training of the troops over \nin Afghanistan. I say that because it was Oklahoma's 45th Division that \nwas involved in training the Afghans on how to train themselves in the \nA I feel that to have witnessed this, to have been over there in \nBagdad, in Kabal, in that whole theater during this time was so \nimpressive to me.\n  I can remember going into the various mess halls, with our troops \nthere--and at that time, IEDs, at an unprecedented rate, were killing \nand maiming our soldiers--and the bravery they had. One of the \nquestions they used to ask me, in the early stages of this war--6 years \nago and 5 years ago--was: Why is it the American people do not \nunderstand what we are doing here? Why don't they understand if we do \nnot stop the terrorism here, it is going to be back at our borders the \nway it was on 9/11? My response to them was I think they are. We are \nnot getting good reporting out of the media. That started changing as \nimprovements came along.\n  As I witnessed the opportunities that were there, our troops, all of \na sudden, during this surge anyway, were gaining a lot more support, \nand that completely turned it around. GEN David Petraeus did a \nremarkable job. In fact, all our generals over there did.\n  So I think it is incumbent upon us today to remember this is the 6th \nyear. This is something that was absolutely necessary for the safety \nand the freedom we enjoy here in this country. We should be applauding \nall our troops as they come back.\n  To me, it was a little unconscionable, just 3 or 4 days ago, when the \nWhite House was coming out with a program that would have impaired our \nwounded veterans coming back from Iraq and the Middle East from access \nto VA health care. Because of all the people--I am sure the phones are \nringing off the hook at the White House--last night they backed away \nfrom that. But, nonetheless, we are not getting the support we should \nbe getting now for our military at this time.\n  Keep in mind, if we went through an 8-year period of dropping down \nthe support, and then we look at the budget that is in today, it is an \ninflated budget in spending in every possible area except defense. I \nthink it should be our priority now, as we remember what happened 6 \nyears ago today.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3516-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3516-S3518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I come to the floor to discuss for a few \nminutes with my colleague from South Carolina the issue of climate \nchange.\n  We all know the budget will be forthcoming. We already understand \nthere will be some $650 billion included in the budget for general \nrevenues that would go as revenues from climate--here it is: $646 \nbillion over 8 years. According to some aides to the administration, it \ncould be as much as $2 trillion. Remarkable.\n  What we have done is we have gone from an attempt to address the \nissue of climate change through cap and trade to just generating $680 \nbillion or $2 trillion without a trace of bipartisanship, without any \nconsultation, without discussions. What we have done on the issue of \nclimate change, by basically funneling $680-some billion, is we have \ndestroyed any chance of bipartisanship, and the administration is \nproposing a plan which will have a crippling effect in a bad economy \non, particularly, parts of the country and lower income residents in \nthe South and Midwest.\n  First of all, if we are going to do cap and trade, we should have \ngenerous allowances for people who are now operating under certain \ngreenhouse gas emission conditions.\n  Second of all, any money, any revenues that are gained through cap \nand trade clearly should not go to just ``general revenues.'' Any \nfunding\n\n[[Page S3517]]\n\nshould go directly to the development of technologies which will then \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. That has to be a fundamental \nprinciple. So the administration, in this budget, is basically using it \nas just a revenue raiser.\n  By the way, the entire budget contains no references to nuclear \npower, except striking funds for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste \nrepository, for which the utilities--passing it on to the ratepayers--\nhave paid somewhere between $8 billion and $13 billion for Yucca \nMountain to be used as a spent nuclear fuel repository. So it is \nremarkable.\n  The Secretary of Energy told me in a hearing in the Energy Committee: \nYucca Mountain is finished. I said: What about reprocessing? Can't do \nthat either.\n  So here you have nuclear powerplants--there are 120 of them operating \nin the United States of America today--and we cannot reprocess and we \ncannot store. So what do we do? We either keep them in pools or \n``solidification'' outside of nuclear powerplants all over America--\nclearly, a threat to the Nation's security.\n  Let me say to my colleagues, I am proud of my record on climate \nchange. I have been all over the world, and I have seen climate change. \nI know it is real, and I will be glad to continue this debate with my \ncolleagues and people who do not agree with that. I believe climate \nchange is real.\n  I believe with what we did in addressing acid rain, which was through \na cap-and-trade kind of dynamic, we were able to largely eliminate the \nproblem of acid rain in America. So it has been done before, and we can \ndo it again, admittedly on a much smaller scale.\n  In the Antarctic, in Alaska and even in the rain forests of Brazil \nand here in the United States, we are feeling the effect of climate \nchange. So here we are, with a chance to work together in a bipartisan \nfashion on the issue, and what does the administration do? They send \nover a budget which earmarks $600-and-some billion--$646 billion--which \nwould then go to general revenues, with no consultation or discussions \non the issue. I am proud to have worked with Senator Lieberman in years \npast on trying to address the issue of climate change.\n  Of course, there is no mention of nuclear power. I do not wish to \nspend my time on the floor, too much, on nuclear power. But according \nto the Department of Energy--and depending on whom you talk to--solar \nwill contribute something like 5, 10, at most, 15 percent of our \nrenewable energy needs between now and 2050. Wind, tide, all those \nothers may contribute another 10, 15, 20 percent.\n  There is a vast, gaping hole in our demand for renewable energy, and \nnuclear power and hydro can fill those. This administration has turned \nits back completely on nuclear power. So what do we tell the ratepayers \nand the utilities that have been paying billions of dollars? As I \nmentioned, somewhere between $8 billion and $13 billion they have \ninvested in Yucca Mountain. And now we are canceling it? Well, maybe \nthey ought to get their money back since it was Government action that \nmade Yucca Mountain no longer a viable option.\n  We need to debate this issue. We need to address it separately. We \ncertainly do not need to address the issue of climate change and how we \nare going to remedy it through the budget process.\n  By the way, the Obama administration plans to use revenues as a slush \nfund to meet budgetary shortfalls, as I mentioned. Only $120 billion of \nthe $650 billion in new revenues would go to climate policy spending, \n$15 billion a year out of the $650 billion would go for clean energy \ntechnologies. There is no detail in the budget as to what this includes \nor excludes--except for closing Yucca Mountain.\n  Nuclear is not mentioned in the entire budget. Most of the remainder \nof the revenues generated from the present cap-and-trade proposal as \nsent over and part of the budget will be used to pay for the Making \nWork Pay tax credit. I would add that the administration argues that \nthe Making Work Pay tax credit will offset the increase in utility \nbills caused by their cap-and-trade policy. However, the credit is \nphased out for taxpayers earning between $75,000 and $95,000 a year for \nindividuals and $150,000 to $190,000 for married couples.\n  So the administration is insisting on 100 percent auction which, \nobviously, would be an incredible detriment to a very serious approach. \nOur economy is suffering. At times such as these, it is particularly \nimportant we provide for transition assistance that will not result in \nhigher energy costs. Again, I wish to point out 100 percent auction \nwill harm heavy manufacturers, the very ones who need the help the \nmost: automobiles, concrete, et cetera, and the lower income residents \nof the South and Midwest.\n  Every reasonable cap-and-trade bill in the past has been a blend of \nauction and allocations--except for this one. The hybrid approach \nallows heavy manufacturers and coal-fired utilities time to meet \nemissions targets without needing to exponentially raise energy costs \nfor consumers.\n  So the administration has sent us a budget with not a single mention \nof nuclear power and Yucca Mountain no longer an option. No Yucca \nMountain means no waste confidence and, certainly, no new licensing, no \nspent fuel recycling. Secretary Chu is insinuating the French and \nJapanese, who have been recycling for decades, are ``reckless.''\n  So what we need to do is take up separately the issue of climate \nchange legislation. It would have a gradual implementation schedule. It \nwould allow for the economy to adapt while we meet our environmental \ngoals. The policy must aggressively promote nonemitting green energy \ntechnologies, such as nuclear power, hydro, and others. We should \npursue a hybrid approach of auctioning a portion of credits while \nreserving a large portion of the credits that we could allocate to \nthose who need the most help, complying with the emission reductions. \nRevenues should be used to promote new technologies, help low-income \npeople with the increased costs of electricity, and pay down the debt--\nnot expand the Federal Government.\n  So it is with some regret I come to the floor to discuss this \nimportant issue with a total lack of bipartisanship on the part of the \nadministration and, again, express my willingness--in fact, my deep \ndesire--to sit down and try to address, in a bipartisan fashion, this \ncompelling issue, which is endangering the future of this planet and \ncertainly our children's and grandchildren's future, and that is the \nissue of climate change.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, one, I would like to recognize the role \nSenator McCain has played on this issue. It is not something he comes \nto lightly, when the issue of climate change is discussed. He put \ntogether a cap-and-trade system with Senator Lieberman at a time when \nit was not very popular among some Republicans. But I think he \nunderstands the issue as well as any Member I have talked with.\n  The idea that what we put into the environment can affect our \nenvironment--I am not a scientist, but that is common sense to me. Acid \nrain is a reality. It was a reality. You could see it in the Southeast, \nwhere the Presiding Officer lives in North Carolina, and in South \nCarolina. It was a cap-and-trade system, a new technology that solved \nthat problem. So it is not much of a stretch to me that CO2 \ncarbon emissions that we are putting into our environment from \ntransportation and power production is heating up the planet, but we \ncan have that debate. If you are serious about energy independence as a \nnation, it would be good to get away from fossil fuels coming from the \nMideast. Clean coal technology is something worth pursuing. The worst \nthing that could happen to the climate change debate is--you cleaned up \nyour planet and you passed on a better environment to your children \nonly if you did it responsibly.\n\n  Really, the worst thing that could happen to the climate change \ndebate is what this administration is doing. They have destroyed, in my \nopinion, a lot of bipartisanship by coming up with a $646 billion \nbudget number, revenue to be created from a cap-and-trade system they \nnever talked to anybody about who has been involved in the issue. This \nis a radical, reckless departure from the climate change debate that \nexisted before they took office.\n  This 100 percent auction is a bit complicated to explain, but it is a \nmajor\n\n[[Page S3518]]\n\ndeparture from the solutions that have existed in the past. Under the \nMcCain-Warner-Lieberman approach, 22 percent of the credits available \nto industry and energy users would be auctioned and there would be an \nallocation of credits.\n  What do I mean by that? A cap-and-trade system at its very basic \nlevel--concept--is that we are going to put limits on how much carbon \nyou can emit into the air as an industry. We will have one for the \npower sector, the transportation sector, for manufacturing. We are \ngoing to put a cap on these industries, and anything you emit above \nthat cap, you are going to have to go get a credit, purchase a credit.\n  Well, if you have a 100-percent auction of these credits, hedge funds \nare going to come in and buy these credits and bid them up, so it would \nbe very hard for an industry to purchase the credits. People start \nspeculating with these credits.\n  Now, the northeastern compact has a 100-percent auction, but the \nemission standards they have decided upon allow--basically, it is \ngreater than the current emissions that exist, so the credits only \ntrade for $3 because they don't have much of a cap that puts pressure \non anybody. The only way you will solve this problem is to have caps \nthat will push people to get away from using carbon, but our \nmanufacturing sector is hanging by a thread in the global economy. If \nyou put too much of a burden on these industries to move away from \ncarbon and their cost of doing business goes up vis-a-vis their \ncompetitors in China and India, you are going to put them out of \nbusiness.\n  So in some circumstances, you have to allocate to these industries \nsome credits so they can make it through the transition phase. This \nidea of having a 100-percent auction on day one is a radical departure, \nand it does generate more revenue, and I think that is what this whole \nexercise is about--revenue--not solving the climate problem. They have \na budget problem, and they are using the climate change debate to \ngenerate money.\n  I have asked the Secretary of Energy and the OMB Director: Where did \nyou get $646 billion to plug into your budget? What system did you \nevaluate that would generate that much money? What did the credits \ntrade for? Nobody has a clue. I literally think they made up these \nnumbers. Some people are talking about the $646 billion being maybe \nhalf of what the actual cost would be if you went to a 100 percent \nauction. So this is a major departure from the way we have tried to \nsolve the climate change problem in the past, and I think it is going \nto destroy the ability of the Congress to come together to solve a \nproblem that is looming for the world and particularly this country.\n  So I hope our colleagues who are serious about the climate change \nissue will reject this proposal, and let's get together, talk among \nourselves, rather than making up numbers that will increase the cost to \nAmerican consumers by hundreds of dollars a month. This idea of using \nrevenue from a cap-and-trade system to pay for a tax plan of the \nadministration is a complete departure from what we have been doing in \nthe past. I wouldn't expect my Democratic colleagues to allow the \nRepublican Party to come up with a cap-and-trade system to fund one of \nour projects. The money from a cap-and-trade system should go back into \nthe energy economy to help people comply with the cost of a cap-and-\ntrade system and to develop technologies to get us away from using \ncarbon.\n  The make work pay tax program is something I don't agree with. It \ndoesn't apply to everybody who will be using energy, and it is a \ndeparture from how we would envision the use of revenue, and that is a \nproblem that has to be addressed. If the administration is going to \ninsist on a cap-and-trade system that would generate this much money \nfrom our economy at a time when we are weak as a nation economically \nand would dedicate the revenue to controversial programs, they have \ndone more to kill the climate change debate than any group I know of. \nYou have some people who disagree with the idea that climate change is \nreal. I respect them. They are attacking it up front. We are having a \ngenuine debate. But to say you believe in climate change as a result, \nand you devise a program such as this without talking to anybody means \nthat you have put climate change second to the budget problems you have \ncreated by a massive budget. So this is not going to bear fruit. This \nis a very low point, in my opinion, in the bipartisan effort to try to \ncreate a meaningful inclusion to climate change. I hope the \nadministration will reconsider.\n  To my Democratic colleagues, those of you who stood up and said: We \nare not going to let reconciliation--we only need 50 votes to pass \nsomething regarding climate change; we are not going to go that route, \nyou have done the country and the Senate a lot of good because if you \never try that, you have destroyed the position of the minority in the \nSenate on a major piece of legislation, and that is not what we need to \nbe doing. That is certainly not the change that anybody envisioned. \nThat would be a radical departure in terms of how reconciliation has \nbeen used in the past.\n  To take an issue such as climate change, which has a massive economic \nimpact and is politically very difficult with a lot of honestly held \ndifferences, and jam that through reconciliation, well, that would not \nbe the politics of the past, that would be the politics of the past on \nsteroids. That would be taking us to a place where no one has gone \nbefore, and if you wanted to destroy any chance of working together, \nthat would be a good way to do it.\n  Now, as to my colleagues on the Democratic side who see through that, \nGod bless you for standing up and not letting that happen.\n  So I wish to end my discussion with where I began. Senator McCain and \nothers have charted a path that would lead to a bipartisan solution. I \nhope the President will consider nuclear power because it is very \ndisingenuous to say you want to solve the climate change problem and \nyou will not address nuclear power as part of the solution. Seventy \npercent of the energy that is created in America that is not emitting, \nthat has no carbon base, comes from nuclear power. When he campaigned \nfor President, candidate Obama openly talked about offshore drilling \nand nuclear power. When his budget comes out, there is nothing in the \nbudget to enhance nuclear power, and Yucca Mountain is now going to be \nclosed, apparently, and the idea that reprocessing of spent fuel is the \nway to store less spent fuel seems to be resisted by this \nadministration.\n  So I thought we were going to have an administration where science \ntrumped politics. Well, I can assure you when it comes to nuclear \npower, politics is trumping science. Other than that, I have no problem \nwith what they are doing.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3518-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3518-S3520]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, this Nation is in the midst of a serious \nand defining challenge. Every single day we are buried in the news of \nour economic turmoil. Thousands more are being laid off, foreclosures \nare reaching new highs, property values are dipping to new lows, more \nbusinesses are shutting their doors, and Americans are struggling to \npay for life's essentials. Consumer confidence is tragically low, and \nCongress has not acted appropriately to make things better. If this is \nnot another Great Depression, it is surely greatly depressing.\n  Instead of innovative policies that put more money in the hands of \nconsumers and create incentives for small business growth, we are \npassing trillion-dollar and multibillion-dollar spending bills as if we \nare in a race to spend money as quickly and as recklessly as possible. \nIt is time to say hold on. It is time to seriously consider what we are \ndoing, what the impact will have, and how we are quickly driving this \nNation off a financial cliff.\n  For as long as living standards have been recorded, Americans have \nlooked to the next generation as an improvement over the last \ngeneration. Opportunities, living standards, and conditions have \nimproved. Technology and research have advanced. There is hope that our \nchildren will have more, that it will be even better for them. The \noptimism that has been uniquely American has always driven us to want \nmore for the future generations but, unfortunately, that has changed. \nNow we are\n\n[[Page S3519]]\n\nbecoming accustomed to taking more from future generations. We are \ndigging ourselves into greater and greater debt at an alarming and an \nunbelievable rate. We are spending obscene amounts of money today \nwithout thinking about who will pay for it. This keeps falling on deaf \nears, but it is our children and our grandchildren who will be stuck \nwith the bill.\n  I know some of my colleagues like to ask: Where was this concern over \nthe last 8 years as the deficits kept rising higher and higher and \nhigher? Rest assured, there has always been a dedicated group of us \nbeating this drum of fiscal responsibility. My question is, why aren't \nmy Democratic colleagues listening now? They can keep blaming the \npolicies of yesterday while this happens, or they can step up now, as \nmore and more of my colleagues have, to demand an end to this selfish \nspending addiction.\n  Alexis de Tocqueville once observed that America was made great \nbecause of its good and moral people. How good and moral are we if we \nare so committed to this immediate gratification that we are willing to \njeopardize the potential of our children and our grandchildren? If we \ncontinue to spend at the rate we are, our children, and even some of \nus, will be facing tax bills as high as 88 percent. If you think we \nwill still be the land of opportunity with that kind of tax rate, you \nare wrong.\n  When I speak to high school students today and tell them they may be \nfacing tax rates as high as 88 percent when they start working, they \nbecome speechless. You can see the disbelief and the fear on their \nfaces. It takes a lot to really throw off teenagers these days. Forget \ndoing better than their parents. They won't have a fighting chance at \nany level of success while bearing this kind of a tax rate burden.\n  We cannot afford to let selfishness absorb our purpose of life. Once \nthat takes root in our policies, as we are seeing right now, the great \nexperiment of this democracy will be closed and ready for the history \nbooks.\n  Instead, we need to refocus. We need to refocus our efforts on \nanother very American concept--that we are each in control of our own \ndestiny. That means we keep more of our own hard-earned money because \nwe know best how to spend it or save it or invest it. We don't just \nthrow all of our money to the Government and let them choose one cause \nthey believe is better than another cause. That has never been the \nAmerican way.\n  Unfortunately, the Obama administration is taking a huge step away \nfrom this concept with its effort to knock down charitable groups at a \nvery crucial time. Non-profits around the country are feeling the pain \nof this economic recession today, and they are serving more and more \npeople and are having a harder and harder time raising the funds they \nneed to address these increased needs. It is a horrible situation. To \nmake it worse, the Obama budget seeks to reduce the tax deduction that \ndonors can take for their contributions. Studies show that this type of \nchange will discourage almost half of those people from making \ncharitable contributions.\n  The outrage from the non-profit world in Nevada and across the \ncountry has been loud and clear. Groups across the spectrum--education, \nhealth care, food banks, rehab, et cetera--have all been stunned by \nthis attack on their missions.\n  Charitable groups have come face to face with an administration that \nwants to spread the wealth by spending more money on government \nsolutions to education, health care, hunger, and other services.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's budget is saying to these groups, \nwho work tirelessly in the communities to improve the quality of life \nof the citizens, that Government knows better and can do better. I \nbelieve, as many others do, they are wrong on this point.\n  I hope more of my colleagues and more Americans will join me in \nexpressing outrage over the Obama Administration's efforts to decrease \nthe charitable deduction for certain taxpayers.\n  For all the campaigning the President did on transparency in \nGovernment spending, he is going to have an awful lot of trouble \nmasking the intent of his budget. It is full of tax hikes that will \nstifle future growth and knock the wind out of the middle class.\n  Benjamin Franklin once said:\n\n       It is a maxim that those who feel, can best judge.\n\n  Well, the American people are feeling a great deal of pain right now. \nThey are in a perfect position to know what will best improve the \neconomic situation they are facing, and it is not tax increases.\n  While President Obama has promised not to raise taxes on families who \nearn less than $250,000 a year, a proposal called cap and trade will \ncertainly result in people paying more for everything that takes energy \nto produce--obviously including their electricity bills. This is an \nindirect tax on all Americans.\n  This is a quote from last year by then-candidate Barack Obama:\n\n       Under my plan of a cap and trade system, electricity rates \n     would necessarily skyrocket.\n\n  He is admitting electricity rates will skyrocket under his plan of \ncap and trade. Does he really think Americans can afford that right \nnow? This is a violation of a campaign promise, just like the one made \nby the first President Bush when he said, ``Read my lips.''\n  Energy Secretary Steven Chu explained earlier this month that because \nhigher prices are supposed to motivate changes necessary to reduce \ncarbon energy use, climate taxes may drive jobs to countries where \ncosts are cheaper. I didn't realize our country was in a position right \nnow to drive jobs overseas. I know lots of Americans who are looking \nfor jobs right here, right now.\n  People seem to think they have discovered a pot of gold, but that \nmoney comes out of the pockets of American families. This is a tax we \nwill all pay--rich and poor. The average annual household burden will \nbe a little over $3,000--and that is on the low end of the estimate. \nHow many families do you know right now who can handle an additional \n$3,000 a year? And because it is a regressive tax, lower income \nfamilies will actually be hit the hardest.\n  Compare this to a Making Work Pay tax credit that is supposed to help \nworking families by using money from the new climate tax. Individuals, \nunder the President's proposal, will get $400 per year, with a phase-\nout at earnings of individuals earning $75,000 a year.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent for 3 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Families will get $800, with a phase-out of earnings of \n$150,000 a year. I am pretty sure that if we ask most families whether \nthey would like to get $800 in return for paying over $3,000, they \nwould tell us to just skip the whole exercise. In that respect, the \nAmerican public is smarter than many folks in Washington.\n  What will Washington do with the excess money this bill generates? We \nknow what it will do: it will spend it, of course.\n  Not to worry, President Obama's budget provides targeted tax \nincreases as well--targeted at small businesses that are responsible \nfor a significant amount of the job creation in this country. Top tax \nrates on small businesses are going up under President Obama's proposed \nbudget. The lower rate is 33 percent now, and under his proposal it \nwill go to 40 percent. On the highest end, right now, it is 35 percent, \nand that will go to 42 percent.\n  History and research have shown that raising taxes on businesses \ndepresses investment. It is not surprising that lower taxes on \nbusinesses increase employment and wages. It seems like a no-brainer. \nBut in this new area of Government command and control, rather than \npersonal responsibility, President Obama is opting to increase people's \ntaxes--especially on those who creates jobs--in order to pay for a \nlarger and more intrusive Government.\n  This tax, the President has said, only affects 3 to 4 percent of the \nsmall businesses out there. This chart refers to the fact that about \nhalf of the small businesses, with 20 or more employees, are eligible \nfor the top tax rates I just pointed out.\n  This is the important point to make: these small businesses that will \nbe hit by this tax create two-thirds of the jobs in America, and we are \ngoing to raise their taxes. That doesn't seem like a bright thing to \ndo, especially\n\n[[Page S3520]]\n\nwith the economic position we are in today. My home State of Nevada has \nbeen led by small businesses. We have led the country for many years on \nthe percentage of small businesses creating jobs. We really can't \nafford to have small business taxes increased in my State, nor in any \nother State across the country.\n  Going back to the wise words of Benjamin Franklin, the American \npeople are feeling the pain of this economy. They elected President \nObama because he campaigned on a slate of ``change.'' I don't believe \nthis is the change the American people signed up for: reckless and \nendless spending, higher taxes on small businesses, increased energy \ncosts for all families, fundraising hurdles for charitable groups, and \na devastating national debt. The list goes on and on.\n  Madam President, this is the President's budget, and it is a recipe \nfor disaster. We need to come back to the idea of personal \nresponsibility and letting families and businesses have more of their \nown money to make the kinds of decisions and investments that will \ndrive prosperity in America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Elena Kagan, of \nMassachusetts, to be Solicitor General of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is now 6 hours of debate on the \nnomination, equally divided between Senator Leahy, the Senator from \nVermont, and Senator Specter, the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, before we begin, I know that a number of \npeople--I see Senator Grassley, Senator Kohl, and Senator Cardin on the \nfloor--a number of people have asked me--I hope we will not be taking \nthe full 6 hours. I have not discussed this with Senator Specter, so I \ncannot speak for him. A few of us are going to speak briefly. I hope at \nsome point we will be able to yield back the remainder of our time and \ngo to the vote. I know a number of Senators, especially Senators from \nthe west coast of both parties, tell me they want to try to reach \nplanes later today. And with the weather, there is some problem. So I \nhope we might be able to yield back time.\n  Today, the Senate considers the nomination of Elena Kagan to be \nSolicitor General of the United States. It is fitting that we consider \nthis historic nomination this month--and I think of my wife, my \ndaughter, and my three granddaughters--because, of course, this is \nWomen's History Month. When Elena Kagan is confirmed, she is going to \nbecome the first woman to serve as Solicitor General of the United \nStates.\n  Nearly 10 years ago, President Clinton nominated Elena Kagan for a \nseat on the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. At that time, she had \nserved as a clerk for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall and for \nJudge Abner Mikva on the DC Circuit, a law professor at the University \nof Chicago, Special Counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nAssociate Counsel to the President of the United States, Deputy \nAssistant to the President for Domestic Policy, and Deputy Director of \nthe Domestic Policy Council. Her credentials also included two years at \nWilliams and Connolly and a stellar academic career, graduating with \nhonors from Princeton, Oxford, and Harvard Law School, where she was \nSupervising Editor of the Harvard Law Review. Despite her outstanding \nrecord, the then-Republican majority on the Judiciary Committee refused \nto consider her nomination. In a move that was unprecedented, she was \namong the more than 60 highly qualified Clinton nominees that were \npocket-filibustered. No Senate majority--Democratic or Republican--has \never done anything like that before or since. Apparently, they felt she \nwasn't qualified. So she returned to teaching, becoming a professor at \nHarvard Law School and, in 2003, she became the first woman to be dean \nof Harvard Law School.\n  Now, I mention that not just because Elena Kagan reached one of the \npinnacles of the legal profession, but in that position, she earned \npraise from Republicans and Democrats, as well as students and \nprofessors, for her consensus-building and inclusive leadership style. \nShe broke the glass ceiling. Now Dean Kagan is poised to break another \nglass ceiling. Similar to Justice Thurgood Marshall, for whom she \nclerked, she would make history if confirmed to what Justice Marshall \ndescribed as ``the best job he ever had.'' I hope that today the Senate \nwill finally confirm her as President Obama's choice to serve the \nAmerican people as our Solicitor General.\n  Two weeks ago Dean Kagan's nomination was reported out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, 13 Senators voted in favor, only 3 opposed. \nSenator Kyl, the Assistant Republican Leader, and Senator Coburn voted \nin favor of the Kagan nomination, and I commend them. Just as I voted \nfor President Bush's nominations of Paul Clement and Gregory Garre to \nserve as Solicitor General, Senator Kyl and Senator Coburn looked past \nthe differences they might have with Dean Kagan's personal views, and \nrecognized her ability to serve as Solicitor General.\n  I am disappointed that after 2 weeks, with so many critical matters \nbefore the Senate, the Republican Senate minority has insisted on 6 \nhours of debate on a superbly qualified nominee who has bipartisan \nsupport. Democrats did not require floor time to debate the nominations \nof President Bush's last two Solicitors General, Paul Clement and Greg \nGarre, who were both confirmed by voice vote.\n  Even the highly controversial nomination of Ted Olson to be Solicitor \nGeneral, following his role in the Florida recount and years of \npartisan political activity, was limited in early 2001 to less time. He \nwas eventually confirmed by a narrow margin, 51 to 47. That was the \nexception. Other than that controversial nomination, every Solicitor \nGeneral nomination dating back a quarter century has been confirmed by \nunanimous consent or voice vote with little or no debate.\n  Just last week, the Republican Senate minority insisted on 7 hours of \ndebate on the Deputy Attorney General nomination before allowing a \nvote. Of course, after forcing the majority leader to file for cloture \nto head off a filibuster and then insisting on so much time, the \nRepublican opposition to that nomination consumed barely 1 hour with \nfloor statements.\n  I wish instead of these efforts to delay and obstruct consideration \nof the President's nominees, the Republican Senate minority would work \nwith us on matters of critical importance to the American people. I \nwill note just one current example. Two weeks ago the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee reported an antifraud bill to the Senate. The Leahy-Grassley \nFraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, S. 386, needs to be considered \nwithout delay. It is an important initiative to confront the fraud that \nhas contributed to the economic and financial crisis we face, and to \nprotect against the diversion of Federal efforts to recover from this \ndownturn.\n  As last week's front page New York Times story and the public's \noutrage over the AIG bailout remind us, holding those accountable for \nthe mortgage and financial frauds that have contributed to the worst \neconomic crisis since the Great Depression is what the Senate should be \nspending its time considering. We have a bipartisan bill that has the \nsupport of the United States Department of Justice. It can make a \ndifference. In addition to Senator Grassley, Senator Kaufman, Senator \nKlobuchar, Senator Schumer and Senator Shelby have worked with us on \nthat measure. I would much rather be spending these 6 hours debating \nand passing that strong and effective antifraud legislation.\n  Our legislation is designed to reinvigorate our capacity to \ninvestigate and prosecute the kinds of frauds that have\n\n[[Page S3521]]\n\nundermined our economy and hurt so many hardworking Americans. It \nprovides the resources and tools needed for law enforcement to \naggressively enforce and prosecute fraud in connection with bailout and \nrecovery efforts. It authorizes $245 million a year over the next few \nyears for fraud prosecutors and investigators. With this funding, the \nFBI can double the number of mortgage fraud taskforces nationwide and \ntarget the hardest hit areas. The bill includes resources for our U.S. \nattorneys offices as well as the Secret Service, the HUD Inspector \nGeneral's Office and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service. It includes \nimportant improvements to our fraud and money laundering statutes to \nstrengthen prosecutors' ability to confront fraud in mortgage lending \npractices, to protect TARP funds, and to cover fraudulent schemes \ninvolving commodities futures, options and derivatives as well as \nmaking sure the government can recover the ill-gotten proceeds from \ncrime.\n  I have been trying to get a time agreement to consider the measure \never since March 5 when the Judiciary Committee reported it to the \nSenate. We can help make a difference for all Americans. Instead of \nwasting our time in quorum calls when no one is speaking, or demanding \nmultiple hours of debates on nominations that can be discussed in much \nless time before being confirmed, let us work on matters that will help \nget us out of the economic ditch that we have inherited from the \npolicies of the last administration and let us begin to work together \non behalf of the American people.\n  The Kagan nomination is not controversial. Every Solicitor General \nwho served from 1985 to 2009 has endorsed her nomination--Republicans \nand Democrats from across the political spectrum. They include: Charles \nFried, Ken Starr, Drew Days, Walter Dellinger, Seth Waxman, Ted Olson, \nPaul Clement and Greg Garre. In their letter of support, they wrote:\n\n       We who have had the honor of serving as Solicitor General \n     over the past quarter century, from 1985 to 2009, in the \n     administrations of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H..W. \n     Bush, William Clinton, and George W. Bush, write to endorse \n     the nomination of Dean Elena Kagan to be the next Solicitor \n     General of the United States. We are confident that Dean \n     Kagan will bring distinction to the office, continue its \n     highest traditions and be a forceful advocate for the United \n     States before the Supreme Court.\n\n  Prominent lawyers who served in the Office of the Solicitor General \nin Republican and Democratic administrations have written to praise \nDean Kagan's ``great legal and personal skills, intellect, integrity, \nindependence and judgment,'' concluding that ``she has all the \nattributes that are essential to an outstanding Solicitor General.''\n  Deans of 11 of some of the most prominent law schools in the country \ndescribe Dean Kagan as ``a person of unimpeachable integrity'' who \n``has been a superb dean at Harvard where she has managed to forge \ncoalitions, attract excellent faculty, and satisfy demanding \nstudents.'' They call her ``superbly qualified to fulfill the role of \nrepresenting the United States in the Supreme Court.'' If there were an \nequivalent to the ABA rating for judicial nominees, hers would be well-\nqualified.\n  One of the conservative professors Dean Kagan helped bring to Harvard \nLaw School was Professor Jack Goldsmith, who took charge of the Office \nof Legal Counsel after the disastrous tenures of Jay Bybee and John \nYoo. Professor Goldsmith, a conservative, praised Dean Kagan as someone \nwho will ``take to the Solicitor General's Office a better \nunderstanding of the Congress and the Executive branch that she will \nrepresent before the Court than perhaps any prior Solicitor General.''\n  Iraq war veterans wrote a letter to the editor of the Washington \nTimes stating that Dean Kagan ``has created an environment that is \nhighly supportive of students who have served in the military,'' \ndescribing the annual Veterans Day dinner for former service members \nand spouses that she hosts, and the focus she has placed on veterans at \nHarvard Law School and the military experience of students.\n  Dean Kagan has taken every conceivable step to meet with Republican \nSenators and to respond to their supplemental questions to her. Just \nthis week she responded to a letter from the ranking Republican Senator \non the committee with extensive written materials. Her answers during \nher hearing, in her written follow-up questions and then, again, in \nresponse to Senator Specter's letter, were more thorough than any \nSolicitor General nominee in my memory. They are light years better \nthan those provided by Ted Olson or other nominees of Republican \nPresidents. I hope that we will not see Senators applying a double \nstandard to her and her answers. Those who voted for Ted Olson and Paul \nClement and Greg Garre based on their answers can hardly criticize Dean \nKagan.\n  Dean Kagan went above and beyond to provide more information than \nprevious nominees. She did not draw the line as Senator Specter has \npreviously complained, at saying only as much as needed to get \nconfirmed by a majority vote. Instead, she went well beyond that to \ndisclose as much about her personal views as she thought she could \nconsistent with her duties. As she explained in her March 18, 2009, \nletter to Senator Specter:\n\n       [T]he Solicitor General is acting not as policymaker, but \n     as a lawyer representing the long-term interests of the \n     United States. The Solicitor General would make decisions . . \n     . based not on personal views, but on determinate federal \n     interests. And the Solicitor General's office has \n     longstanding and rigorous processes in place, usually \n     involving numerous client agencies and components, to \n     identify and evaluate the nature and extent of these \n     interests.\n\n  Dean Kagan has shown that she has a deep understanding of the role of \nthe Solicitor General and her exemplary record makes her well qualified \nto fulfill those important duties. Last week, when establishing the \nWhite House Council on Women and Girls, President Obama noted: \n``[T]oday, women are serving at the highest levels in all branches of \nour Government.'' Let us not take a step backward to the days when \nwomen were not allowed to be lawyers or hold the top jobs. I think of \nthe history of when Sandra Day O'Connor graduated from Stanford Law \nSchool with a stellar academic record and was told she could only have \na secretarial job because, after all, she was a woman. Some woman. She \nbecame one of the most prominent members of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  It is time for breaking through barriers. It is interesting when you \nlook at the quality of these people. When Sandra Day O'Connor was \nnominated, one of my close friends in the Senate, who was her primary \nsupporter, Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona, brought her to my \noffice. He said:\n\n       You know, sometimes she will probably vote ways I will \n     disagree with; sometimes I will agree with her. I am not \n     asking her how she is going to vote on issues, I am just \n     asking her to be honest and fair and use her great talent. \n     That is all anybody can ask for.\n\n  She was confirmed, of course, unanimously.\n  Barry Goldwater was right. I believe I am, too, when I say it is time \nfor breaking through barriers for this highly qualified person. It is \nalso a time for our daughters and granddaughters to see a woman serving \nas a chief legal advocate on behalf of the United States.\n  I urge all Senators to support President Obama's nomination and vote \nto confirm Elena Kagan to be Solicitor General of the United States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, when President Obama nominated Elena Kagan \nto be the Solicitor General of the United States, I must tell you, I \nwas extremely pleased because I knew of her reputation, I knew of her \nbackground, and I thought she would be an excellent choice to be the \nSolicitor General of the United States.\n  Chairman Leahy allowed me to chair the hearing on her confirmation. \nAt that hearing, there were spirited questions asked by many members of \nthe Judiciary Committee. We had a chance to review the background \nrecord we go through in the confirmation process. Ms. Kagan responded \nto the questions of the committee members.\n  I must tell you, I was even more impressed with this individual to be \nSolicitor General of the United States. I\n\n[[Page S3522]]\n\nthought she did an excellent job in responding to the questions of the \ncommittee and answering them with candor and giving great confidence \nthat she will represent the United States well before the courts of \nthis country.\n  The Solicitor General has to appear before the Supreme Court. The \nSupreme Court Justices can be very difficult in their questioning, as \ncan Members of the Senate during confirmation. I think Elena Kagan \ndemonstrated her ability to represent our Nation well as the Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States.\n  She comes to this position very well qualified, as far as her \nexperience is concerned. I know Chairman Leahy has spoken frequently \nabout the need to continue to restore the morale and integrity of the \nDepartment of Justice which has been battered in recent years. I think \nElena Kagan will help us restore the reputation of the Department of \nJustice and help us because of her dedication--and experience--to \npublic service.\n  She brings a wide range of service, having served as dean of a law \nschool, a law professor, a senior official at the White House, a lawyer \nin private practice, a legal clerk for a Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  A graduate from Princeton University and Harvard Law School, Ms. \nKagan clerked for Justice Thurgood Marshall on the Supreme Court and \nthen worked as an associate at the Washington law firm of Williams & \nConnolly. While teaching law at the University of Chicago, she took on \nanother special assignment as special counsel to Senator Joe Biden who \nwas then chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Ms. Kagan assisted in the \nconfirmation hearings of Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\n  Then in 1995, Ms. Kagan returned to public service to serve as \nPresident Clinton's associate White House counsel, Deputy Assistant to \nthe President for Domestic Policy, and Deputy Director of the Domestic \nPolicy Council. So she has a combined academic background as well as \npublic service.\n  In 1999, Ms. Kagan left Government and began serving as a professor \nat Harvard Law School, teaching administrative law, constitutional law, \ncivil procedures, and a seminar on legal issues and the Presidency.\n  In 2003, she was appointed to serve as the dean of the Harvard Law \nSchool, becoming the first woman ever to be dean in that school's \nhistory.\n  We have a lot of information that we gather during the confirmation \nprocess. One of the most impressive letters was a letter we received \nfrom the deans of 11 major law schools in support of the nomination. \nThese are your colleagues. They know you best. They know your \nqualifications.\n  The letter states in part that the Office of Solicitor General is a \njob that ``requires administrative and negotiation skills as well as \nlegal acumen, and Elena Kagan excels along all relevant dimensions. Her \nskills in legal analysis are first rate. Her writings in constitutional \nand administrative law are highly respected and widely cited. She is an \nincisive and astute analyst of law, with a deep understanding of both \ndoctrine and policy. . . . Ms. Kagan is also an excellent manager. She \nhas been a superb dean at Harvard . . . Finally, Elena Kagan is known \nto us as a person of unimpeachable integrity.''\n  The Solicitor General of the United States holds a unique position in \nour Government. The Solicitor General is charged with conducting all \nlitigation on behalf of the United States in the Supreme Court and is \noften referred to as the ``10th Justice.'' Indeed, the Supreme Court \nexpects the Solicitor General to provide the Court with candid advice \nduring oral argument and the filing of briefs on behalf of the United \nStates. The office participates in about two-thirds of all the cases \nthe Court decides on the merits each year.\n  So it is indeed high praise for Dean Kagan that former Solicitors \nGeneral Walter Dellinger and Ted Olson joined with six other Solicitors \nGeneral from both parties--Democrats and Republicans--to write a letter \nendorsing her nomination. If I might, I would like to quote from the \nletter from the former Solicitors General who endorse Ms. Kagan's \nnomination to be Solicitor General of the United States. The letter \nstates, in part:\n\n       We are confident that Dean Kagan will bring distinction to \n     the office, continue its highest traditions and be a forceful \n     advocate for the United States before the Supreme Court. \n     Elena Kagan would bring to the position of Solicitor General \n     a breadth of experience and a history of great accomplishment \n     in the law. We believe she will excel at this important job \n     of melding the views of various agencies and departments into \n     coherent positions that advance the best interests of our \n     national government. She will be a strong voice for the \n     United States before the Supreme Court. Her brilliant \n     intellect will be respected by the Justices, and her \n     directness, candor and frank analysis will make her an \n     especially effective advocate.\n\n  At the same time, we want the Solicitor General to be independent. \nThat person must exercise independent judgment in representing the best \ninterests of the United States before the Court. Ms. Kagan has shown \nthat independence throughout her career, but she also understands she \nmust follow the law. Let me cite one final letter in support of Ms. \nKagan's nomination. The letter is from former Deputy Attorney General \nJamie Gorelick and former Attorney General Janet Reno. The letter notes \nthat Elena Kagan would be the first woman to hold this office and that \nthe confirmation will:\n\n       . . . represent an important milestone for the Department \n     of Justice and for women in the legal profession. We have no \n     hesitation in concluding that Kagan possesses the skills and \n     character to excel in the position for which she has been \n     nominated.\n\n  Tomorrow will mark President Obama's 60th day in office, and I think \nit is fitting that today we are on the verge of confirming Elena \nKagan's nomination so she can join with the Attorney General in helping \nto restore the competence of the Department of Justice for the American \npeople. I am certain she will make an excellent Solicitor General, and \nI hope we will promptly confirm her nomination.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I wish to thank the distinguished Senator from Maryland, \nwho is a valuable member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, for \nstepping in on such short notice when I had to step off the floor.\n  I have asked my colleagues on the other side--and I know this is \nsomething that is being looked at because we have both Republicans and \nDemocrats, as I said earlier, trying on a rainy day to move around \nairplane schedules--if we might be able to have the vote very soon but \nto reserve the time for Senators who have asked to speak on this \nsubsequent to the vote.\n  There are no Republicans on the floor at the moment, so I am \nobviously not going to make a unanimous consent request, but were I to \nmake a unanimous consent request, it would be after consultation with \nthe Republican side that we go ahead and have the rollcall vote and \nthen continue whatever time is necessary for debate.\n  So I mention that is a request I will make at some point, when there \nis somebody to represent the Republican leader on the floor.\n  Until then, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time be charged to both sides equally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Mortgage Cram-down\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, you are from the State of Ohio; I am from \nthe State of Illinois. We face similar circumstances when it comes to \nmortgage foreclosures. Lots of the best and strongest cities in my \nState, large and small, are being inundated with mortgage foreclosures.\n  Now, this started off with this predatory trap where a lot of people \nwere lured into mortgages they could not afford. But there was a \nmortgage broker telling them: It will all work out. The price of your \nhome is going to go up, and it is going to be a good source for you to \nborrow money in the future. So stretch a little. Trust me. You can make \nthese payments, and a year from now, or when the mortgage readjusts, \neverything is going to be just fine.\n\n[[Page S3523]]\n\n  It did not work that way. Some people went into these mortgage \nagreements and negotiations without the equipment to understand what \nthey were getting into.\n  I am a lawyer by training. I have been through a lot of closings for \nreal estate. We all know what it is about. They sit you in a room, your \nwife by your side, and put a stack of papers in front of you. They \nstart turning the corners, talking faster than any salesman you have \never run into, telling you: Do not worry about this one, sign it. Do \nnot worry about this one, sign it. It is routine, required by Federal \nlaw--on and on and on. Pretty soon, with your hand weary at the end of \nhalf an hour or so, you have signed 30 or 40 documents. They hand you \nthe paper and say: The first payment is due in 60 days. I know you are \ngoing to love this place.\n  That is what most closings are all about. Not many lawyers and very \nfew purchasers stop them and say: I want to read this document. Can you \ntell me what paragraph 6 means? Are you sure I am understanding \neverything this means?\n  Most of the time, the average people in America are at the mercy of \nthe folks sitting around them. They are bankers, they are lawyers, real \nestate agents. They are at their mercy and, unfortunately, under some \ncircumstances, some people were misled into mortgage arrangements which \nwere just plain wrong.\n  For the longest time we went through something called no-doc \nmortgages. Do you know what that means? No documentation.\n  How much money do you make?\n  Oh, I don't know, $50,000.\n  How much debt do you have?\n  Oh, I don't know, maybe $10,000.\n  You qualify.\n  Do you need some documentation?\n  No, we have to move this through fast. We need to capture an interest \nrate.\n  This sort of thing was the height of irresponsibility. At the end of \nthe day, people ended up with these subprime mortgages for homes they, \nfrankly, could not afford, and the day quickly came when this house of \ncards literally collapsed, and mortgages started being foreclosed \nacross America.\n  Well, it is not just your neighbor's problem when a house is \nforeclosed upon. It is your problem too. Even if you are making your \nmortgage payment, that neighbor's misfortune just affected the value of \nthe home you hold near and dear. That neighbor's inability or failure \nto pay the mortgage payment is going to affect the value of your home \nwhere you just made the mortgage payment and continue to. That is the \nreality.\n  The Chicago Sun Times recently reported on the situation of Chris and \nMarcia Parker. They are in the south suburb of Thornton just outside \nChicago. They live in a small brick home that Marcia's father built in \nthe early 1950s. She grew up in the house. The couple moved back home \nto take care of her elderly mother.\n  At the time they took out a mortgage to pay for a new roof and a new \nfurnace. They ran a small business, but the business failed, causing \nthem to file for bankruptcy. They both landed new jobs with the same \ncompany, but were then laid off at the same time last July because of \nthe recession.\n  Chris, the husband, found a new job; Marcia has not. Now they are \nfalling behind on their mortgage. They put up for sale the house \nMarcia's father built. They could not find a buyer. They have now \nreceived a foreclosure notice. The foreclosure could happen as early as \na week from now. They are trying to reach the lender and work out an \narrangement to stay in the home her parents built. Worse, they cannot \nfind a place to rent because their previous bankruptcy, based on the \nfailing small business, they have no idea where they are going to live \nand whether they will lose their home.\n  Does this sound like a deadbeat couple to you? It does not to me. It \nsounds like a couple that has fallen on misfortune, tried their best, \ntried to get back on their feet, and they keep stumbling and falling \nagain despite their best efforts. This family was not reckless. They \nwere not speculators in the market. We are talking about a house her \nparents built. They did not buy too much house.\n  This is a story of a family who has tried to do the right thing and \nis facing the very real possibility of losing their family home and \nhaving nowhere to turn. It is happening over and over again.\n  In Chicago, there were nearly 20,000 homes last year which entered \nthe foreclosure process. This map tells the story. It looks like this \ngreat city of Chicago with the measles. Well, it turns out to be this \ngreat city of Chicago with a reflection on the 2008 foreclosure \nfilings.\n  Get down here around Midway Airport where I travel a lot--I go to \nO'Hare a lot, too, I might add--and take a look at what is going on in \nthese neighborhoods, in these plots. I took a look at one specific Zip \nCode right around Midway Airport, and I looked at it visually closely. \nI could only find five blocks in that Zip Code that did not have at \nleast one home in mortgage foreclosure.\n  Now, if you traveled to these homes, you might notice them when you \nare flying in and out of the city. These are neat little brick bungalow \nhomes, not lavish homes, basic two- and three-bedroom homes where folks \nspend the extra dollars to finish the basement, put in an above-ground \npool in the backyard, or try to put something in the attic where the \nkids can sleep over if they want to. These are basic middle-class \nfamily homes, and folks are losing them right and left.\n  Now, 2 weeks ago I went to Albany Park. That is on the north side of \nthe city of Chicago--again, neighborhood after neighborhood of neat \nlittle family homes where people care, where the homes are well taken \ncare of, little garden plots and flowers and decorative efforts by them \nto make sure their home looks special. Smack dab in the middle of that \narea was a building, a three-story building that had been, I guess, \ndeveloped originally as a condo. When they could not sell the condos, \nthey developed it into apartments, and then mortgage foreclosure. That \nis now boarded up. It has been vandalized by gangs that go in and rip \nout the copper piping and everything they can get their hands on. The \ndrug gangs hang out there.\n\n  I stood around that neighborhood with the neighbors, many of whom \nwere elderly people, folks who have accents because they came to this \ncountry and worked hard and now want to retire. They looked at me and \nsaid: Senator, what are you going to do about this? This mortgage \nforeclosure on our block is changing our lives. We put all of our lives \nin that home, and now this monstrosity of a foreclosure is destroying \nour property value.\n  Well, I have been involved in an effort for 2 years to do something \nabout this, 2 straight years. I am still trying. And here is what it \nis. If you go into bankruptcy, if you have more debts than you have \nassets, the court right now can take a look at your debts. In some \ninstances, they can try to restructure the debt so you can pay it off.\n  If you have a vacation home in Florida, the bankruptcy judge can say: \nWell, rather than foreclose your vacation home in Florida, we think you \nhave enough income coming in that we will work with the lender and try \nto make the mortgage terms work. If you own a farm, we can work with \nthe lender to make the mortgage terms work. If you own a ranch, same \nsituation. Same thing on that boat, on that car, on that motorcycle; we \ncan do it--with one exception.\n  Do you know what the exception is? Your private residence. Your \npersonal home. The bankruptcy court is prohibited by law from looking \nat that mortgage and saving your home. They can save your vacation \ncondo, your ranch, your farm, all of these other things. They cannot \nsave your home.\n  It makes no sense. If your home means as much to you as it does to my \nfamily and most families, you would think that would be a high \npriority. Who resists this? The banks do and the mortgage bankers do. \nThey have given it this nice, negative name: cram-down. We are going to \nlet the bankruptcy court cram down that mortgage on your home.\n  Boy, they sure did not use cram-down when it came to vacation homes \nor farms or ranches, but now they want to stop it. Why? Because many of \nthem do not want to negotiate a new mortgage. It makes no sense.\n  A bank, when a mortgage goes into foreclosure, will lose at least \n$50,000 on\n\n[[Page S3524]]\n\nthat mortgage foreclosure--at least, with legal fees and other \nexpenses. And in 99 percent of the cases in mortgage foreclosure, the \nhouse ends up on the inventory of the bank. That banker who sits behind \nthe desk at your local bank now has to worry about who is going to cut \nthe grass, who is going to drive by to make sure the home is not being \nvandalized, how in the world they are going to sell it.\n  What we are trying to do is set up a process so these homes facing \nforeclosure, thousands and thousands of homes in the city of Chicago \nwhich I am honored to represent, and millions of people across America \nhave a fighting chance.\n  Now, I have made concessions. I have worked on compromises over the 2 \nyears. Some of the financial institutions are finally saying: All \nright, we will talk to you. When I started working on this problem 2 \nyears ago, they predicted as many as 2 million families in America \ncould lose their homes. They predicted 2 million. We were told by the \nlending industry that those estimates were grossly exaggerated: 2 years \nago, 2 million.\n  Goldman Sachs now estimates as many as 13 million homes could be lost \nto foreclosure in the next 5 years. That is one out of every four \nprivate residences in America lost to foreclosure, a foreclosed home on \nevery block in every city in every State in America, on average. That \nis the reality and the truth of this crisis.\n  Last year when I called up this bill, they said: Durbin, there you go \nagain. You are exaggerating it. It is not going to be that bad. We will \ntake care of the problem. Well, we gave them all of the help to take \ncare of it, the voluntary programs, and at the end of the day, where \nare we? We are in a desperate position in this country where we have to \nstep up and finally break this cycle of mortgage foreclosures.\n  Both sides have to give. I have been willing to compromise, some of \nthe banking institutions have been, to make sure people go into the \nbank before they go into bankruptcy court, to give them a chance to \nwork out the terms of a mortgage they can afford so they can stay in \ntheir homes and neighborhoods can be stabilized.\n  That is why I fully support President Obama's plan to help 3 to 4 \nmillion homeowners save their homes by modifying their mortgages to \nmake them more affordable. The plan creates incentives that we need so \nthat banks will finally do what has not been done for 2 years: \naggressively modify loans so foreclosures can be avoided. That is in \nthe best interests of homeowners and banks.\n  But this plan is voluntary. Voluntary plans have successively failed. \nEvery time we have said to the financial institutions: We will leave it \nup to you, you decide whether you want to do something, nothing is done \nof any major consequence. If the lenders don't want to participate in \nthe President's plan or previous plans, they don't have to.\n  The program pays servicers taxpayer money to offer loan modifications \nthat may not be enough. We need to have at the end the possibility--not \nthe probability but the possibility--that the bankruptcy court will \nhave the last word. That is why the administration has included my plan \nin their proposal. The President supports my change in the Bankruptcy \nCode to allow mortgages on primary residences to be modified in \nbankruptcy just as other debts. If banks don't want judges to modify \nmortgages for them, they will be far more likely to do it themselves. \nHow would it work? Only families living in the home would qualify. This \nisn't for speculation. This isn't for that extra condo you bought \nsomewhere in hopes that you could turn a buck. It is your primary \nresidence, the one you live in. Only mortgages for which the \nforeclosure process has started are eligible. No one who can pay their \ncurrent mortgage can have a judge change those terms. Judges would be \nlimited in how they can modify the mortgages. They could never create a \nmortgage that would create a worse result for the bank than \nforeclosure.\n  If this bill passes, taxpayers don't lose a buck, and we could have a \npositive result where many people could win. The mortgages that are \nmodified in bankruptcy will provide far more value to lenders and \ninvestors than foreclosure.\n  Best of all, there is no expense to taxpayers.\n  This is expensive to taxpayers. Why? Because if the home next door to \nyou goes into foreclosure, the value of your home goes down, property \ntax revenues go down, and the local unit of government loses the \nrevenue it could receive from those property taxes, for starters.\n  If you can't buy and sell a home in your neighborhood, do you know \nwhat that means to the realtor, to the people who build homes, to those \nwho sell carpeting for new homes, right on down the line?\n  I will return to the floor next week to talk about this bill. I know \nopponents hate it. I can't persuade some of them no matter what I do, \nno matter what concessions I make. But I will not give up. For 2 years, \nwe have been fighting to pass a strong housing bill to turn away this \ntide of foreclosures in Chicago and across America. I hope that on a \nbipartisan basis we can do that starting very soon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. What is the business pending before the Senate at the \nmoment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nomination of Elena Kagan to be Solicitor \nGeneral.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I came at 2 o'clock, when this nomination \nwas listed for argument, and another Senator was speaking on another \nsubject. We have just heard another Senator speaking on still another \nsubject. Only two Senators have spoken so far in favor of the \nnomination. I say to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, if they \nhave anything to say about the nominee, they ought to come to the floor \nand speak.\n  The chairman has raised a proposal about voting on the nomination and \nspeaking afterward. Part of our deliberative process is to have \nSenators speak with the prospect--maybe unrealistic, maybe foolish--of \ninfluencing some other votes. We are not going to influence any votes \nif we speak after the vote is taken. But it may be that we are not \ngoing to have speakers. I urge my colleagues to come to the floor. This \nis Thursday afternoon. In the Senate, that is a code word. It means we \nare about to leave. There are no votes tomorrow, so there will be some \ninterest in departure not too long from now. I think we ought to \nconclude at a reasonable time.\n  In advance, I had been advised that quite a number of people want to \nspeak for quite a long time. We got an allocation of 3 hours for the \nRepublican side. That means 6 hours equally divided. Now it appears \nthat some who had wanted extensive time will now not be asking for that \nextensive time. We ought to make the determination as soon as we can as \nto who wants to speak and for how long so that we can figure out when \nis a reasonable time to have the vote and conclude the debate so \nSenators may go on their way.\n  Turning to the subject matter at hand, the nomination of Dean Elena \nKagan for Solicitor General of the United States. I begin by noting \nDean Kagan's excellent academic and professional record. I call her \nDean Kagan because she has been the dean of the Harvard Law School \nsince 2003.\n  She has excellent academic credentials: summa cum laude from \nPrinceton in 1981, and magna cum laude from the Harvard Law School in \n1986, where she was on the Harvard Law Review. She clerked for Circuit \nJudge Mikva and Supreme Court Justice Marshall and she has had \ngovernment service.\n  I ask unanimous consent that her resume be printed in the Record at \nthe conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. The office of Solicitor General is a very important \noffice. That is the person who makes arguments to the Supreme Court of \nthe United States on behalf of the United States government. In \naddition to making arguments, the Court frequently asks the Solicitor \nGeneral for the Solicitor General's opinion on whether a writ of \ncertiorari should be granted in pending cases. So the Solicitor General \nis sometimes referred to as the 10th Supreme Court Justice--a pretty \nimportant position.\n  I have gone to substantial length, really great length, to find out \nabout\n\n[[Page S3525]]\n\nDean Kagan's approach to the law and approach to the job of Solicitor \nGeneral and to get some of her ideas on the law because she is \nnominated to a critical public policymaking position. I had the so-\ncalled courtesy visit with her in my office, which was extensive, as \nranking member on the Judiciary Committee. We had an extensive hearing, \nwhere I questioned her at some length. Written questions were \nsubmitted, and she responded. I was not satisfied with the answers that \nwere given, and when her name came before the committee for a vote, I \npassed. That means I didn't say yea or nay. I wanted to have her \nnomination reported to the floor so we could proceed, and I wanted an \nopportunity to talk to her further. I did so earlier this month. I then \nwrote her a letter asking more questions and got some more replies. I \nuse the word ``replies'' carefully because I didn't get too many \nanswers as to where she stood on some critical issues.\n  During the course of the hearing, we discussed extensively some of \nher very deeply held positions. The question was raised by me, given \nthose positions, would she be able to take a contrary position on some \nstatute that she is obligated to uphold in arguments before the Supreme \nCourt. She said she would. But the question remains, when you feel so \nstrongly--and the record will show what she had to say--whether you can \nreally make a forceful argument as an advocate. Theoretically, you can. \nLawyers are not supposed to necessarily believe in their positions; \nthey are supposed to advocate. The clash and clamor of opposing views \nin our adversarial system is supposed to produce truth. Lawyers \nadvocate more so than state their own positions. But there is a degree \nof concern when the views are as strongly held as Dean Kagan's have \nbeen.\n  After the long process I have described, I still don't know very much \nabout Dean Kagan. It is frequently hard, in our separation of powers, \nfor the legislative branch to get much information from the executive \nbranch. We look for information, and frequently we are told it is \nexecutive privilege. We are told it is part of the deliberative process \nor we are simply not told anything, with long delays and no responses.\n  The legislative branch has two critical pressure points. One pressure \npoint is the appropriations process, to withhold appropriations, which, \ncandidly, is not done very often. It is pretty tough to do that. \nAnother point is the confirmation process where nominations are \nsubmitted to us to be confirmed, which the Constitution requires. So \nthere the executive branch has no choice. They can't talk about \nexecutive privilege or deliberative process or anything else. But there \nis a question as to how thorough nominees answers to questions should \nbe.\n  In discussing what answers we can reasonably expect from Dean Kagan, \nthe issue of the questioning of judicial nominees is implicated to the \nextent that the tides have shifted as to how many questions Supreme \nCourt nominees are asked. Not too long ago, there weren't even hearings \nfor Supreme Court nominees. Then the generalized view was that \nnominations were a question of academic and professional \nqualifications. Then the view was to find out a little bit about the \nphilosophy or ideology of a nominee but not to tread close to asking \nhow specific cases would be decided. The President is customarily \nafforded great latitude with nominations. Then Senators look for \nqualifications, with the generalized view that they don't want to \nsubstitute their own philosophy or own approach to the law for the \ndiscretion of the President. Some Senators do. There is no rule on it. \nWe may be in a period of transition where some have said the Senate \nought to do more by way of utilizing Senators' own philosophical \npositions in evaluating the President's nominees, that we have as much \nstanding on that front as the President. That is an open question, but \nI don't propose to suggest the answer to it today or to take a position \non it. But it bears on how far we can go in asking Dean Kagan \nquestions.\n  I don't know very much more about her now than I did when we started \nthe process. From the many questions that I asked her on cases, I have \npicked out a few to illustrate the problem I am having with figuring \nout where she stands and the problem I am having with her confirmation. \nOne case of substance and notoriety is a case involving insurance for \nHolocaust survivors.\n  The Southern District of New York Federal court held that plaintiffs' \nmonetary claims were preempted by executive policy. The Second Circuit \nwrote to the Secretary of State and asked for the administration's \nposition on the adjudication of these suits with respect to U.S. \nforeign policy.\n  Dean Kagan was asked the question of what was her view on this case. \nThis was a pretty highly publicized case, and it is pretty hard to see \nhow an insurance company ought to be preempted or protected by foreign \npolicy considerations. Well, Dean Kagan didn't tell us very much in her \nanswer. The answer takes up two-thirds of a page, and most of it is \nabout the consultative process, which I am, frankly, not much \ninterested in. I want to know what she thinks about the policy.\n  She said:\n\n       At the end of this process, the decision of the Solicitor \n     General on seeking certiorari is likely to reflect in large \n     measure the views of the State Department as to the magnitude \n     of the foreign policy interests involved.\n\n  It does not say very much. I want to know what foreign policy \ninterests she is concerned about.\n  Another case involving the terrorist attacks captioned ``In re \nTerrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001'' where people who were \nvictimized on that day sought damages from Saudi Arabia, Saudi princes, \nand a banker, who were alleged to have funded Muslim charities that had \nprovided material support for al-Qaida. The Southern District of New \nYork Federal Court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims on the grounds that \nthe defendants were immune from suit. The Second Circuit affirmed, and \nthe Supreme Court then asked the Solicitor General's Office for its \nrecommendation as to whether to grant the petition for certiorari. \nThere, you have the ``tenth'' Supreme Court Justice, the Solicitor \nGeneral, coming into the picture.\n  Well, when I questioned Dean Kagan on this case, her response was: \n``I am unfamiliar with this case. . . . A critically important part of \nthis process would be to'' work with the clients, the Department of \nState, and the Department of Justice. And the ``inquiry would involve \nexploration of the purposes, scope, and effect of the Foreign Sovereign \nImmunities Act, as well as consideration of the role private suits \nmight play in combating terrorism and providing support to its \nvictims.''\n  Well, we do not know very much about her views from that answer. \nThere has been a lot of information in the public domain that Saudi \ncharities were involved. Fifteen of the nineteen hijackers were from \nSaudi Arabia. People were murdered. There are claims pending in court. \nThe question is whether the Supreme Court is going to take the case. \nWell, I wish to know what the nominee for the position of Solicitor \nGeneral thinks about it.\n  I had calls from people in high positions--I do not want to identify \nthem--saying: Well, don't ask those kinds of questions. Somebody in the \nexecutive branch. Well, I am not prepared to relinquish the \ninstitutional prerogatives of the Senate to ask questions. The \nexecutive branch nominees want confirmation. Well, Senators want \ninformation to base their opinions on.\n  In the case of Republic of Iraq v. Beaty, the question was whether \nIraq was amenable to suit under the exception to the foreign sovereign \nimmunity clause. American citizens were taken hostage by Saddam Hussein \nin the aftermath of the first gulf war. They got more than $10 million \nin damages. The question, then, is, what would the Solicitor General \ndo? The case is now pending before the Supreme Court. Dean Kagan gives \nan elongated answer saying very little, virtually nothing:\n\n       I have no knowledge of the case and cannot make an \n     evaluation of its merits, even if this evaluation were \n     appropriate (which I do not believe it would be) while the \n     case is pending before the Court with a brief from the \n     Solicitor General supporting reversal.\n\n  Well, Dean Kagan has a point as to how much knowledge she has of the \ncase. But when she says that an evaluation is not appropriate while a \nbrief is pending from the Solicitor General supporting reversal--she is \nnot the Solicitor General. She has not submitted the brief. She is not \na party to the action. She is a nominee. She wants to be\n\n[[Page S3526]]\n\nconfirmed. I wish to know how she would weigh this issue.\n  Americans taken hostage by Saddam Hussein, and the verdict of $10 \nmillion--why not have a judicial determination in a matter of this \nsort? How much do we defer to foreign governments who have murdered and \nabused and kidnapped American citizens? I think those are fair \nquestions.\n  I will discuss one more question because I see my colleague Senator \nSessions is on the floor.\n  That is the Kelo case, Kelo v. London, a very famous, widely \npublicized case on eminent domain. Well, does Dean Kagan have the \nrecord in the case? Has she gone through it line by line? No, that has \nnot happened. But the case is pretty well known. It is pretty hard to \nsay you do not know much about that. This is what she said in response \nto my question regarding the case:\n\n       I have never written about the Takings Clause; nor have I \n     taught the subject. . . .\n\n  Well, if that is relevant--I do not know if we would confirm very \nmany people to the Department of Justice Attorney General position or \nSolicitor General position or to other positions if you had to have \nwritten about it or if you had to have taught a class on the subject. \nHere again, we know very little as to what she thinks about an issue.\n  In essence, it is difficult to cast a negative vote on someone with \nthe qualifications and background of Dean Kagan, but we have a major \nproblem of institutional standing to find out from a nominee what the \nnominee thinks on important questions.\n  The nominee disagrees with what I have said. I have talked to her \nabout it. She thinks she can be an advocate for issues even though she \nfeels very strongly the other way. She feels she does not have to \nanswer questions because it would be inappropriate because the case is \npending and the Solicitor General has rendered an opinion. Well, I \ndisagree with that. I have no illusion the issues I have raised will \nprevail. I think it is pretty plain that Dean Kagan will be confirmed. \nBut I do not articulate this as a protest vote or as a protest \nposition, but one of institutional prerogatives. We ought to know more \nabout these nominees. We ought to take the confirmation process very \nseriously. I believe the scarcity and paucity of Senators who have come \nto the floor to debate this nomination does not, candidly, speak too \nwell for this institution. We are all waiting to vote to go home. But \nthis is an important position. For a Supreme Court Justice nominee, \ntelevision cameras would be present during the hearings, and everybody \nwould be there, and everybody would be on camera.\n  Well, I think we have to pay a little more attention, and I have gone \nto some length to try to find out more about Dean Kagan. In the absence \nof being able to do so and to have a judgment on her qualifications, I \nam constrained to vote no.\n  Before I yield the floor, Mr. President, again, I ask my colleagues \nto come to the floor if they are going to have something to say. I \nwould hope we could wind up our activities. We could go until 8 \no'clock. I do not think we ought to do that. My view is, we ought to \nvote no later than 5. But I am not the leader. That is just my view. \nBut I do think people ought to come if they want to speak. Or maybe we \nwill vote at 5 o'clock, and people can speak afterwards. I do not know \nhow it will work out. But I think it would be very healthy if people \nspoke before the vote on the assumption that we have debate to try to \ninfluence other Senators because we are the world's greatest \ndeliberative body, so it says in all the texts.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                              Elena Kagan\n\n\n                 solicitor general of the united states\n\n       Birth: 1960; New York, New York.\n       Legal Residence: Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n       Education: B.A., summa cum laude, Princeton University, \n     1981; Daniel M.

The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I begin by thanking the Senator from \nAlabama for his courtesy. I appreciate him allowing me to go before him \nto speak.\n  I rise today in support of the nomination of Elena Kagan to be \nSolicitor General of the United States. As we saw from her confirmation \nhearing in the Judiciary Committee more than a month ago, Elena Kagan \nhas the piercing intellect, superb judgment, and wealth of experience \nnecessary to be an outstanding Solicitor General.\n  Dean Kagan's academic credentials could not be any more impressive. \nAfter graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Princeton \nUniversity, she attended the Harvard Law School, served as supervising \neditor of the Harvard Law Review, and graduated magna cum laude. After \nlaw school, she clerked first for Abner Mikva of the District of \nColumbia Circuit, and then Thurgood Marshall on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  That auspicious start to Dean Kagan's legal career was followed by \nprivate practice at one of America's leading law firms, and then \nservice in the Office of the Counsel to the President. She has also \nbeen a policy adviser to the President, and a legal scholar of the \nfirst rank at both the University of Chicago and Harvard.\n  As others have pointed out, her research and writing in the areas of \nadministrative and constitutional law make her a leading expert on many \nof the most important issues that come before the Supreme Court.\n  If that level of experience were not enough, she has spent the last 5 \nyears as the extraordinarily successful dean of the Harvard Law School, \nwhich by all accounts is not an easy place to govern.\n  I note that several of that school's most conservative scholars have \nvoiced their support for this nomination. They praise her vision and \njudgment, her incredible work habits, and her extraordinary management \nskills. Just as important, they point to her ability to bridge \ndisagreement, by listening to all sides of an argument, engaging \nhonestly with everyone concerned, and making decisions openly and with \ngood reasons.\n  No one disputes that Dean Kagan has served Harvard incredibly well. \nShe will do the same for the Office of Solicitor General. Her \naccomplishments as a scholar and teacher are unmatched. Her skill as a \nleader and manager are beyond dispute.\n  In fact, she has the support of every single Solicitor General who \nhas served since 1985, including all three who worked in the previous \nadministration. As they wrote to the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       We are confident that Dean Kagan will bring distinction to \n     the office, continue its highest traditions and be a forceful \n     advocate for the United States before the Supreme Court.\n\n  On a personal note, I want to add that earlier in her career, Dean \nKagan spent some time working as an adviser to then-Senator Biden. I \nhad the good fortune to get to know her in that context. Based on that \nexperience, and everything I have seen since, I am absolutely convinced \nnot only that she possesses enormous intellect and consummate skill, \nbut also that she is a person\n\n[[Page S3527]]\n\nof the highest character and unquestioned integrity.\n  In short, this is an outstanding nominee, and an outstanding \nnomination.\n  On March 5, after thorough consideration, a bipartisan majority of \nthe Judiciary Committee--13 to 3--voted to report Dean Kagan's \nnomination. I urge my colleagues to confirm her without delay, so she \ncan begin the critical task of representing the United States in the \nSupreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Alabama.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to share my thoughts about the \nnomination of Elena Kagan to be Solicitor General.\n  I have strong concerns about her nomination and will not support her \nnomination. I do believe the President, like all Presidents, should be \nentitled to a reasonable degree of deference in selecting executive \nbranch nominees. But for some of the reasons I will set out, and one in \nparticular, I am not able to support this nomination and will not \nsupport it.\n  I believe her record shows a lack of judgment and experience to serve \nas the Nation's chief legal advocate--a position many have referred to \nas the Supreme Court's ``tenth Justice.'' It is also a position that \nhas been called the best lawyer job in the world.\n  Well, so far as I can observe, other than time in the White House \nCounsel's Office, Dean Kagan has only practiced law for 2 years in a \nreal law firm practicing law. She had very limited experience in the \nthings you would look for in a person of this nature.\n  But let me discuss one defining moment in her career that I was sort \nof indirectly involved in because of legislation that was percolating \nin the Congress, in the Senate and in the House, and it means a lot to \nme.\n  During her tenure as dean, Ms. Kagan barred the U.S. military from \ncoming on the Harvard Law School campus to recruit young law graduates \nto be JAG officers in the U.S. military. That was from November of 2004 \nthrough September of 2005. She barred them from coming and recruiting \non campus while 150,000 of our finest men and women in this country \nwere serving in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan and during a time in \nwhich 938 troops died in combat, preserving the rights of people like \nlaw deans, faculty, and students to have all the opinions they want. \nHer decision to bar the military from her campus during a time of armed \nconflict represents exceedingly poor judgment and leadership, \nparticularly for someone who wants to lead the Department of Justice, \nthe executive branch, and support the military of the United States.\n  By refusing to allow military recruiters on the Harvard Law School \ncampus, she placed her own opposition to military policies above the \nneed of our military men and women to receive good legal advice, even \nfrom Harvard lawyers. And she did so at a time when the military, \nserving in conflicts in two foreign countries, was facing a host of \ncomplex legal issues. We are still fighting over them, for that \nmatter. Maybe it would have helped if we had some of those graduates \nparticipating in them.\n\n  I don't believe she ever had a basis to have barred the military from \nher school's campus, and I believe she should have had the judgment to \nrealize the signal and the impact that was being sent to our military \nand to the students who want to support and serve in the military. \nIndeed, President Obama should have realized the signal he was sending \nby nominating her to this position.\n  Flagg Youngblood wrote an op-ed in the Washington Times on January 30 \nand this is what that op-ed stated. I will quote from that article. I \nthink it makes a point. This is a military person:\n\n       Since the Solicitor General serves as the advocate for the \n     interests of the American people to the Supreme Court, we're \n     expected to believe Kagan is the best choice? Her nomination \n     smacks of special interest, aimed at protecting the Ivy \n     League's out-of-touch elitism at the expense of students, \n     taxpayers, and our military alike.\n       And what about the qualified students who desire to serve \n     our country?\n\n  In the military, he is referring to.\n\n       Second-class, back-of-the-bus treatment, that's what they \n     get, typically having to make time-consuming commutes to \n     other schools and, much worse, the ill-deserved disdain of \n     faculty and peers on their own campuses.\n       The military, nobly and selflessly, stands alert at \n     freedom's edge, ready to defend our Nation in times of \n     crisis, and should therefore be honored, and, as most \n     Americans would argue, given preferential treatment, for \n     guarding the liberties that academics such as Kagan profess \n     to protect.\n       That's precisely why Congress intervened more than a decade \n     ago, at the behest of a large majority of Americans who \n     recognize and appreciate what our military does, to fulfill \n     the Constitution's call for a common defense among the few, \n     enumerated Federal powers. And, to stop financing those who \n     undermine that fundamental duty. Yet, leftwing views like \n     Kagan's still disparage the sacrifices our military makes and \n     cause real, quantifiable harm to students and to our Nation \n     at taxpayer expense.\n\n  Well, Mr. Youngblood's editorial--he felt deeply about that--\ndeserves, I think, extra force and credibility because he was affected \nby similar policies when he tried to participate in ROTC while \nattending Yale University during the 1990s. Due to Yale's exclusion of \nthe ROTC from campus, Mr. Youngblood was forced to travel because he \nwanted to serve his country, 70 miles to commute to the University of \nConnecticut to attend the military ROTC classes. His ordeal--and many \nlike it--led to the passage of the Solomon amendment, which is the \nFederal law that requires colleges to allow military recruiters on \ncampus in order to be eligible for Federal funds.\n  Well, let me say, that amendment didn't order any university to admit \nanybody or to allow anybody to come on campus; it simply says when you \nget a bunch of money from the Federal Government, you at least need to \nlet the military come and recruit students if they would like to join \nthe U.S. military and not exclude them.\n  So the Solomon amendment is critically important here because it \nshows that Ms. Kagan's decision to block the military from Harvard Law \nSchool's campus was not just wrong as a matter of public and military \npolicy. It was also clearly wrong as a matter of law. While dean at \nHarvard, Ms. Kagan was a vocal critic of the Solomon amendment. She \ncalled the law immoral. She wrote a series of e-mails to the Harvard \nLaw School community complaining about the Solomon amendment and its \nrequirement--horrors--that federally funded universities, if they \ncontinue to get Federal money, ought to allow military recruiters on \ncampus or lose the Federal money. She thought that was horrible.\n  I should note that Harvard receives hundreds of millions of dollars \nin Federal funding: $473 million in 2003, $511 million in 2004, and \n$517 million in 2005. That is a lot of money. The Federal highway \nbudget that goes to the State of Alabama is about $500 million a year. \nHarvard University gets that much. By opposing the Solomon amendment, \nMs. Kagan wanted Harvard to be able to receive these large amounts of \ntaxpayers' dollars without honoring Congress's and President Clinton's \njudgment that military recruiters were eligible to come on campus. \nUnder the Solomon amendment, Harvard has always had the option of \ndeclining Federal funds and relying on its big endowment--$34 billion--\nand their tuition to fund the university. Much smaller institutions, \nsuch as Hillsdale College, have chosen to decline Federal funds to \ncarry out their full academic independence. Harvard and Dean Kagan were \nnot willing to do so. They wanted both. They wanted money and the right \nto kick out the military.\n  I think she showed her legal judgment regarding the Solomon amendment \nin 2005 when she joined in an amicus brief of Harvard Law School \nprofessors to the U.S. Supreme Court in Rumsfeld v. FAIR, opposing the \nSolomon Amendment's application to Harvard Law School. Unlike the chief \nlitigant--the formal appeal group--in the case, which raised a \nstraightforward first amendment challenge to the Solomon amendment, the \nbrief Ms. Kagan joined with other Harvard Law School professors made a \nnovel argument of statutory interpretation that was too clever for the \nSupreme Court.\n  Her brief argued that Harvard Law School did not run afoul of the \nletter of the Solomon amendment because Harvard law school did not have \na policy of expressly barring the military from campus. Harvard, she \nargued, barred recruiters who discriminate from campus. Her brief \nreasoned that the Solomon amendment shouldn't apply\n\n[[Page S3528]]\n\nwhere the military wasn't singled out, but just ran afoul of a school's \nnondiscrimination policy.\n  Ms. Kagan's argument was considered by the U.S. Supreme Court and the \nU.S. Supreme Court upheld the Solomon amendment. In specifically \naddressing Ms. Kagan's amicus brief with the Harvard professors, Chief \nJustice Roberts, writing for the Court, dismissed Ms. Kagan's novel \nstatutory interpretation theory using these words:\n\n       That is rather clearly not what Congress had in mind in \n     codifying the DOD policy. We refuse to interpret the Solomon \n     amendment in a way that negates its recent revision, and \n     indeed would render it a largely meaningless exercise.\n\n  It is telling also to note that the brief she signed on to was unable \nto convince a single Justice of the Supreme Court to go along with it--\nnot even Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg who was once general counsel to \nthe American Civil Liberties Union.\n  Let me mention one more thing people have mentioned about the Kagan \ndecision to bar the military from recruiting on the Harvard campus. \nSome may have heard that the decision to bar the military was merely \nhonoring a ruling of the Third Circuit, which briefly ruled against the \nSolomon amendment on a split decision in Rumsfeld v. FAIR. It is \ncritical to note that the Third Circuit's ruling never went into effect \nbecause the case was appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court and the Third \nCircuit stayed enforcement of its decision. In other words, the Third \nCircuit said: Yes, we have rendered it. We understand our opinion is \nunder appeal. We are not going to issue a mandate or an injunction that \nour opinion has to be followed. We will allow this case to be decided \nultimately by the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  No injunction was ever entered against enforcement of the Solomon \namendment. Any decision by any dean to reject the Solomon amendment and \nnot enforce it was not required by law. The law stayed in effect. In \nfact, Dean Kagan acknowledged that in an e-mail to the Harvard Law \nSchool community in 2005. There was a lot of controversy about this at \nHarvard. A lot of people weren't happy about it, you can be sure. She \nadmitted in that e-mail that she had barred the military from campus, \neven though no injunction was in place, saying:\n\n       Although the Supreme Court's action meant that no \n     injunction applied against the Department of Defense, I \n     reinstated the application of our anti-discrimination policy \n     to the military . . . ; as a result, the military did not \n     receive assistance during our spring 2005 recruiting season.\n\n  So it is clear that the barring of the military took place while the \nSolomon amendment was, in effect, the law of the land. Her e-mail \nindicates she understood that at the time. As a result, students who \nwanted to consider a military career were not allowed to meet with the \nrecruiters on campus. The military was even forced to threaten Harvard \nUniversity's Federal funding in order to get the military readmitted to \ncampus as time went on. This was all a big deal. The Congress was \ntalking about it. We had debate on it right here on the floor and in \nthe Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member.\n  I think a nominee to be the Department of Justice's chief advocate \nbefore the Supreme Court, to hold the greatest lawyer job in the world, \nshould have a record of following the law and not flouting it. The \nnominee should, if anything, be a defender of the U.S. military and not \none who condemns them. Ms. Kagan's personal political views, I think, \nare what led to this criticism of the military, this blocking of the \nmilitary. She opposed a plain congressional act that was put into place \nafter we went through years of discussion and pleading with some of \nthese universities that were barring the military. They had refused to \ngive in, so we passed a law that said, OK, you don't have to admit the \nmilitary, but we don't have to give you money, and we are not giving \nyou any if you don't admit them. They didn't like that. So Ms. Kagan's \nrefusal of on-campus military recruiters went against a congressional \nact. Her actions were an affront to our men and women then in combat \nand now in combat. The Solicitor General should be a person who is \nanxious and eager and willing to defend these kinds of statutes and to \ndefend our military's full freedom and right to be admitted to any \nuniversity, even if some university doesn't agree with the \nconstitutional and lawfully established policies of the Department of \nDefense.\n  I would also raise another matter, and I think this is important. If \nthere was some other significant showing, I think, of competence or \nclaim on this position, I would be more willing to consider it. If she \nwere among the most proven practitioners of legal skill before Federal \nappellate courts or had great experience in these particular positions, \nmaybe I could overcome them. Maybe if she had lots of other cases in \nher career that could show she had shown wisdom in other areas, but \nthat is not the case. She has zero appellate experience. Dean Kagan has \nnever argued a case before the U.S. Supreme Court, which isn't unusual \nfor most American lawyers, but for somebody who wants to be the \nSolicitor General whose job it is to argue before the Supreme Court, it \nis not normal. But for that matter, she has never argued any appellate \ncase before any State supreme court.\n  In fact, she has never argued a case on appeal before any appellate \ncourt, whether Federal, State, local, tribal or military. That is a \nreal lack of experience. When asked about this lack of experience at \nour hearing, Ms. Kagan tried to compare her record to other nominees \nsaying this:\n\n       And I should say, Senator, that I will, by no means, be the \n     first Solicitor General who has not had extensive or, indeed, \n     any Supreme Court argument experience. So I'll just give you \n     a few names:\n       Robert Bork, Ken Starr, Charles Fried, Wade McCree. None of \n     those people had appeared before the courts prior to becoming \n     solicitor general.\n\n  Well, Ms. Kagan's record hardly compares to the names she cited in \nher own defense.\n  Regarding Charles Fried, Ms. Kagan was wrong in stating that he never \nargued to the Supreme Court. Although Professor Fried did not have much \nin the way of litigation experience before being nominated, he had \nargued to the Supreme Court while serving as Deputy Solicitor General \nin Rex Lee's Solicitor General's Office. Accordingly, Mr. Fried had two \nthings Ms. Kagan lacks--Supreme Court experience and experience within \nthe Solicitor General's Office.\n  Ms. Kagan also compared herself to Ken Starr and Wade McCree, both of \nwhom had a wealth of appellate experience that she lacks. Prior to his \nnomination to be Solicitor General, Ken Starr served as a U.S. Court of \nAppeals judge in the District of Columbia--an appellate court--from \n1983 to 1989, a court before which the best lawyers in the country \nappear and argue cases. He had to control and direct their argument, \nand as a result he got to see and have tremendous experience in that \nregard as an appellate judge. Wade McCree had even more experience \nbefore his nomination. Mr. McCree served as a U.S. Court of Appeals \njudge in the Sixth Circuit, from 1966 to 1977, 11 years.\n  Robert Bork also had a strong litigation background before his \nnomination. He was one of the most recognized, accomplished antitrust \nlawyers in private practice in the country.\n  We should not forget the critically important role the Solicitor \nGeneral plays in our legal system. As Clinton-era Solicitor General \nDrew Days wrote in the Kentucky Law Journal, ``the Solicitor General \nhas the power to decide whether to defend the constitutionality of the \nacts of Congress or even to affirmatively challenge them.'' That is \nquite a power--the power to defend statutes in the Supreme Court, or \neven challenge them in the Supreme Court.\n  This is a very critical job within our Government. I think it \ndeserves a more experienced lawyer, one with a record that shows more \nbalance and good judgment. I think Ms. Kagan's lack of experience is an \nadditional reason I am uncomfortable with the nomination. I think \nnominees have to be careful about expressing opinions on matters that \nmight come before them in the future. But for a nonjudicial position, \nand concerning issues which were commented on today, Senator Specter \nbelieves she has been less than forthcoming. Had she been more \nforthcoming, I might have been a little more comfortable with the \nnominee. Her failure to be responsive to many questions, I think, \ncauses me further concern.\n  To paraphrase a well-known statement of then-Senator Biden--now our\n\n[[Page S3529]]\n\nVice President--the job of the Solicitor General does not lend itself \nto on-the-job training. One time, Rudy Giuliani was arguing about who \nshould be his replacement as U.S. Attorney in Manhattan, and they were \ndiscussing people with very little experience. He said: I think it \nwould be nice if they were able to contribute to the discussion every \nnow and then.\n  I think it is good to have some experience. So I don't see a sense of \nhistory here to overcome what I consider to be bad judgment on a very \nimportant matter. I supported the nomination of Eric Holder. I like him \nand I hope he will be a good Attorney General; I think he will. I \nintend to support most of the other nominees to the Department of \nJustice. I certainly hope to. But I am not able to support Elena \nKagan's nomination in view of her positions concerning the ability of \nthe U.S. military to come on the campus of Harvard and actually recruit \nthe young men and women who might wish to join the military. I think \nthat was wrong. I also believe she has a very significant lack of \nrelevant experience for the position.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I oppose the nomination of Elena Kagan for Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States. I previously spoke against her on the \nfloor and talked about the reason I was opposed to her as well as David \nOgden for his representation of the pornography industry. It is kind of \nhard for me to understand how someone who is the No. 2 position in the \nJustice Department has a history of representing the pornography \nindustry. Then, of course, the nominations of Dawn Johnson and Thomas \nPerrelli I am opposed to because of their strong pro-abortion \npositions.\n  But as far as Elena Kagan, it is important for those who are going to \nvote in favor of her to know some of the things that have happened in \nher background. Because of its great importance, the office of \nSolicitor General is often referred to as the 10th Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  When serving as a dean of Harvard Law School, she demonstrated poor \njudgment on a very important issue to me. Ms. Kagan banned the U.S. \nmilitary from recruiting on campus. She and other law school officials \nsued to overturn the Solomon amendment. The Solomon amendment \noriginated in the House. Congressman Jerry Solomon had an amendment \nthat said no university could preclude the military from trying to \nrecruit on campus. This was a direct violation of the amendment. She \nactually was claiming that the Solomon amendment was immoral. She filed \nan amicus brief with the Supreme Court opposing the amendment. The \nCourt unanimously ruled against her position and affirmed that the \nSolomon amendment was constitutional.\n  The Department of Justice needs people who adhere to the law and not \nto their ideology. While certainly I oppose many of the positions taken \nby these nominees, I am even more concerned that their records of being \nideologically driven will weaken the integrity and neutrality of the \nDepartment of Justice.\n  I oppose the nomination of Elena Kagan.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, today I will vote to confirm the nomination \nof Elena Kagan to be the next Solicitor General of the United States. \nBecause the Constitution gives the appointment power to the President, \nnot to the Senate, I believe the President is owed some deference so \nlong as his nominees are qualified. This standard applies particularly \nto his executive branch appointments. I will vote for the nomination \nbefore us because I believe this standard is satisfied.\n  Dean Kagan would not be the first Solicitor General to have come from \nlegal academia. Walter Dellinger came to the Clinton administration \nfrom Duke, Rex Lee served in the Reagan administration after founding \nBrigham Young University School of Law.\n  Nor would Dean Kagan be the first Solicitor general to have come to \nthe post from Harvard. Archibald Cox came from the Harvard law faculty \nto serve as Solicitor General in the Kennedy administration. Erin \nGriswold became Solicitor General in 1967 after a dozen years as a \nHarvard law professor and another 19 as dean. Charles Fried, who taught \nat Harvard for nearly a quarter century before becoming Solicitor \nGeneral in 1985, went back to teaching and is now a colleague of Dean \nKagan. I was pleased to see him at her confirmation hearing.\n  I would note two other things about Dean Kagan's qualifications. \nFirst, she has no experience arguing before any court. I have long \nbelieved that prior judicial experience is not a prerequisite for \nsuccessful judicial service. Justice Felix Frankfurter taught at \nHarvard Law School from 1921 until President Franklin D. Roosevelt \nappointed him to the Supreme Court in 1939. During that time, by the \nway, he turned down the opportunity to become Solicitor General. But \nJustice Frankfurter famously wrote in 1957 that the correlation between \nprior judicial experience and fitness for the Supreme Court is, as he \nput it, ``precisely zero.''\n  But courtroom argument, especially appellate advocacy, is a more \nspecific skill that is related more directly to the Solicitor General's \njob. As such, Dean Kagan's complete lack of such experience is more \nsignificant. Which leads me to the second point that, despite her lack \nof courtroom experience, every living former Solicitor General has \nendorsed her nomination. They know better than anyone what it takes to \nsucceed in the post and believe she has what it takes.\n  Speaking of endorsements, Dean Kagan is also supported by a number of \nlawyers and former government officials who are well known in \nconservative legal circles. These include Peter Keisler, who served as \nAssistant Attorney General and Acting Attorney General under President \nGeorge W. Bush; Miguel Estrada, prominent Supreme Court practitioner \nand a former nominee to the U.S. Court of Appeals; Jack Goldsmith, who \nheaded the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel under the \nprevious President; and Paul Cappuccio, who served in the Justice \nDepartment during the first Bush administration and is now general \ncounsel at TimeWarner.\n  A few other issues have given me pause during the confirmation \nprocess. When Dean Kagan served as a law clerk for Justice Thurgood \nMarshall, she wrote a memo in a case challenging the constitutionality \nof the Adolescent Family Life Act. That statute provided funds for \ndemonstration projects aimed at reducing teen pregnancy. Dean Kagan \nobjected to including religious groups in such projects, insisting that \n``[i]t would be difficult for any religious organization to participate \nin such projects without injecting some kind of religious teaching.'' \nShe actually argued for excluding all religious organizations from \nprograms or projects that are, in her view, ``so close to the central \nconcerns of religion.'' This is a narrow-minded, I think even ignorant, \nview of religious groups and her recommendation of discrimination \nagainst them comes close, it seems to me, to raising a different kind \nof constitutional problem. Thankfully, the Supreme Court did not follow \nher suggestion and instead upheld the statute. When asked about it at \nher hearing in February, Dean Kagan said that, looking back, she now \nconsiders that to be, as she put it, ``the dumbest thing I ever \nheard.'' With all due respect, I agree.\n  Dean Kagan took a very strong, very public stand against the so-\ncalled Solomon Amendment, which withholds federal funds from schools \nthat deny access to military recruiters. Harvard denied such access in \nprotest of the military's exclusion of openly gay servicemembers. Dena \nKagan chose to allow access only under the threat of the entire \nuniversity losing federal money. But she condemned in the exclusion \npolicy in the strongest terms, calling it repugnant and ``a profound \nwrong--a moral injustice of the first order.'' In her personal \ncapacity, she joined other law professors on a friend of the court \nbrief in the lawsuit challenging the policy. In 2006, the Supreme Court \nupheld the Solomon Amendment, specifically rejecting the position Dean \nKagan had taken, saying: ``We refuse to interpret the Solomon Amendment \nin a way that . . . would render it a largely meaningless exercise.'' \nDean Kagan is entitled to take that or any other position on that or \nany other issue she chooses. But it raises the question whether she \nwould be able, as the Solicitor General must, to put aside even such \nstrongly held personal views and vigorously defend only the legal \ninterests of the United States. She assured the Judiciary Committee \nthat she could do that, even\n\n[[Page S3530]]\n\nsaying that she would have defended this very statute, the Solomon \namendment, in the way that Solicitor General Paul Clement did. I note \nthat Paul Clement is one of the former Solicitors General endorsing \nDean Kagan's nomination.\n  When Dean Kagan's nomination came up for a vote in the Judiciary \nCommittee, I joined the ranking member, Senator Specter, in passing \nbecause of concerns that she had been insufficiently forthcoming in \nanswering questions during her hearing and written questions afterward. \nI applaud Senator Specter for pursuing this, for meeting with Dean \nKagan again, and for pushing her for more information and more thorough \nanswers. She has provided some additional insight into her views, \nthough I respect the fact that her additional effort will not satisfy \neveryone.\n  All in all, I have concluded that I can support Dean Kagan's \nnomination. She is qualified to serve as Solicitor General and I have \nnot seen enough to overcome the basic deference that I believe I must \ngive the President. As such, I will vote to confirm her.\n  Mr. KYL. The nomination of Elena Kagan to be Solicitor General of the \nUnited States is not without controversy. She has a stellar academic \nrecord which has been discussed. Following law school, Ms. Kagan served \nas a judicial clerk for Judge Abner Mikva on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nand for Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall. After her clerkships, \nMs. Kagan joined the DC law firm Williams and Connolly.\n  Ms. Kagan left private practice to join the faculty of the University \nof Chicago Law School. In 1995, Ms. Kagan began her service in the \nClinton administration as associate counsel to the President and later \nas deputy assistant to the President for Domestic Policy. In 1999, she \nleft the White House and returned to legal academia, joining the \nfaculty at Harvard Law School. In 2003, Ms. Kagan was named Dean of \nHarvard Law School, a role in which she was charged with overseeing \nevery aspect of the institution, academic and non-academic alike.\n  She is well regarded by those who have followed her career.\n  I am particularly troubled, however, by two matters. First, Dean \nKagan's nomination has rightfully received criticism because of her \nstance on the Solomon amendment. Dean Kagan joined two briefs \nconcerning the legality of the Solomon amendment, one on an amicus \nbrief to the Third Circuit in support of the appellants, FAIR, in the \ncase FAIR v. Rumsfeld, and the other an amicus brief in support of FAIR \nwhen the case reached the Supreme Court. By a vote of 9 to 0, the \nSupreme Court upheld the Solomon Amendment and rejected the argument \npresented in the brief that Dean Kagan signed. See Rumsfeld v. FAIR, \n547 U.S. 47, 55-57, 2006. Also, I would like to make one comment about \nDean Kagan's actions as dean in this case. As Senator Sessions pointed \nout earlier today, because the case was appealed to the Supreme Court, \nthe Third Circuit stayed enforcement of its decision. Therefore, the \nSolomon amendment stayed in effect. Dean Kagan acknowledged this in a \nSeptember 20, 2005, email to the Harvard Law School community, where \nshe admitted that she had barred the military from campus even though \nno injunction was in place: ``Although the Supreme Court's action \n[granting review] meant that no injunction applied against the \nDepartment of Defense, I reinstated the application of our anti-\ndiscrimination policy to the military . . . . as a result, the military \ndid not receive [Office of Career Services] assistance during our \nspring 2005 recruiting season.'' Thus, Ms. Kagan barred the military \nfrom recruiting on campus even though the Solomon amendment remained \nthe law of the land.\n  Second, I am troubled by Dean Kagan's lack of appellate experience. \nShe has not argued even a single case before the Supreme Court or \nbefore any federal or state appellate court. I am quite concerned about \nher complete lack of appellate advocacy. I am, nevertheless, willing to \ngive her the benefit of the doubt, primarily because of the views of \nseasoned advocates who know her well and who know the Court well.\n  All three Solicitors General appointed by President Bush--Ted Olson, \nPaul Clement, and Greg Garre--signed a letter, January 27, 2009, \nstating that they ``are confident that Dean Kagan will bring \ndistinction to the office, continue its highest traditions and be a \nforceful advocate for the United States before the Supreme Court.'' \nThey added, ``[h]er brilliant intellect will be respected by the \nJustices, and her directness, candor and frank analysis will make her \nan especially effective advocate.''\n  Additionally, among her other supporters are two highly respected \nconservative lawyers who have known Dean Kagan since the beginning of \nher legal career. The first is Peter Keisler, who served as Acting \nAttorney General under President Bush and held a number of other top \npositions in the Bush Justice Department. He clerked on the U.S. \nSupreme Court with Elena Kagan, and wrote the following in support of \nher nomination, January 30, 2009: ``[her] combination of strong \nintellectual capabilities, thoughtful judgment, and her way of dealing \nrespectfully with everybody . . . are . . . among the many reasons she \nwill be a superb Solicitor General, and will represent the government \nso well before the Court.''\n  Second, Miguel Estrada has known Elena Kagan since law school. He \nwrote in support of her nomination, January 23, 2009: ``Having worked \nas an attorney in the Solicitor General's Office under Solicitors \nGeneral of both parties, I am also confident that Elena possesses every \ntalent needed to equal the very best among her predecessors.''\n  I expect a Solicitor General nominated by a President of a different \npolitical party to hold views that diverge from my own; but I also \nexpect that nominee to be qualified for the position, able to \nfaithfully execute the responsibilities of the office, and be \nforthright and honest with members of Congress. She has assured us that \nher ideology will not interfere with her decisions as Solicitor \nGeneral. I will closely follow Dean Kagan's tenure as Solicitor \nGeneral. I will hold her to her commitments.\n  I would like to make clear that my vote for Dean Kagan is only for \nthe position of Solicitor General, and my vote does not indicate how I \nwould vote for her if she were nominated for any other position, \nespecially a position that is a lifetime appointment. Specifically, \naccording to numerous news accounts, Dean Kagan is expected to be \nconsidered for nomination to the Supreme Court if an opening were to \noccur during the Obama administration. If she were nominated, her \nperformance as Solicitor General would be critical in my evaluation of \nher suitability for the Supreme Court. My decision whether to support \nor oppose her would be strongly influenced by the decisions made by her \nas Solicitor General, such as the cases for which she does and does not \nseek review, the positions she argues, and the bases for her arguments. \nIf she approaches her job as Solicitor General ideologically or argues \ninappropriate positions, I will not hesitate to oppose her nomination.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to urge my colleagues to \nsupport the nomination of Elena Kagan to be the Solicitor General. In \ndoing so, I will make four brief points.\n  First, Dean Kagan is extraordinarily qualified as a lawyer with a \nprofound understanding of the issues that dominate the Supreme Court's \ndocket. She has received enormous praise for her leadership of Harvard \nLaw School as dean, in which position she reinvigorated one of the \npremier legal institutions in our country. And of course Dean Kagan is \na scholar of the highest order on questions of administrative and \nconstitutional law. She clearly has the intellectual background and \nsharp intelligence necessary to represent the interests of the United \nStates with the utmost skill and clarity. She testified in her hearing \nand in numerous followup questions that she will put the interests of \nthe United States ahead of any of her own beliefs and defend \ncongressional statutes with the vigor and force we expect of the \noffice. She has worked in private practice, as a clerk to the Supreme \nCourt, and as a counsel in the White House. I applaud her willingness \nto return to Government service. Now, some critics have pointed out \nthat she has not argued before the Supreme Court before. As an attorney \nwho has argued before that Court, I can attest that appearing before \nthe Court indeed is a daunting experience. But Solicitors General Ken \nStarr, Charles Fried, Robert Bork, and Wade McCree similarly had not \nargued before the\n\n[[Page S3531]]\n\nCourt. This fact leaves me with no doubt that Dean Kagan will meet the \nhighest expectations of her and that she will excel as Solicitor \nGeneral.\n  Second, I would point out that a very large number of leading lawyers \nhave joined me in concluding that Dean Kagan will be an excellent \nSolicitor General. Dean Kagan's nomination to be Solicitor General has \nbeen endorsed by every Solicitor General who served from 1985 to 2009--\nCharles Fried, Ken Starr, Drew Days, Walter Dellinger, Seth Waxman, Ted \nOlson, Paul Clement, and Greg Garre. That is not the Solicitors General \nfrom every Democratic administration--that is every Solicitor General \nover the last 24 years, including conservatives Ted Olson and Ken \nStarr. Surely their expert opinions should provide a strong indication \nthat Dean Kagan will be an excellent Solicitor General.\n  Third, it is worth noting the historic nature of this nomination. If \nconfirmed, Dean Kagan would become the first woman confirmed by the \nSenate to hold the Office of Solicitor General of the United States. \nDean Kagan has spent her lifetime breaking glass ceilings, and she is \npoised to break another for the benefit of generations of women to \ncome.\n  Finally, I would like to commend Chairman Leahy for his continuing \ndetermination to confirm as many Department of Justice nominees as \nquickly as possible. The United States deserves the best advocate \npossible before the Supreme Court. We should confirm Dean Kagan and let \nher get to work. And we should swiftly confirm the remaining nominees \nto the Department of Justice. I look forward to continuing to work with \nChairman Leahy in that effort.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination \nof Dean Elena Kagan of the Harvard School of Law to be Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States. It is with regret that I announce that I \nwill not be able to support this nomination.\n  My first reason is that it appears that Dean Kagan's nomination \nprocess is not yet complete. My colleague, the ranking member of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee Senator Arlen Specter, has already spoken on \nthis at some length, but I agree with his thoughts. He asked Dean \nKagan, in writing, to expand upon responses she supplied to the \nJudiciary Committee. In the estimation of several committee members and \nothers, such as myself, she did not provide an adequate response to \nthese requests. I find that it is not possible for me to vote to \nadvance the nomination of someone who has not yet completed the \nnomination process.\n  However, we do know some things about Dean Kagan's beliefs. For one \nthing, she has shown a disdain for the policy contained in the Solomon \namendment. The Solomon amendment bars federal aid to universities that \nprevent military recruitment on campus. This is a good policy and \nfairly supports our military and the men and women that are a part of \nit. Dean Kagan defends her position by saying that she opposes the \nrecruiters because of the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy. Whatever \nher concerns with that policy, it does not seem wise or fair to shut \nout our nation's military recruiters. By denying recruiters access to \nAmerica's colleges and universities, our military is weakened. This is \nthe kind of wrongheaded approach that I thought had died out years ago. \nUnfortunately, it is still alive in the person of the President's \nnominee to head one of the top positions in the Department of Justice.\n  Dean Kagan has also expressed an unsettling attitude towards religion \nand religious organizations. In a memo as a law clerk on the subject of \nwhich organizations should receive funding to counsel teenagers on \npregnancy, she wrote ``It would be difficult for any religious \norganization to participate in such projects without injecting some \nkind of religious teaching.'' She added ``When government funding is to \nbe used for projects so close to the central concerns of religion, all \nreligious organizations should be off limits.'' This seems like an \nincredibly insensitive, insulting, and impractical view to hold. Does \nDean Kagan feel that only atheists are fit to handle government funds? \nWould she support some sort of a ``religious commitment'' litmus test? \nThis seems like an attitude that would be unfit for a high ranking \nmember of our government.\n  It is for these reasons that I cannot support this nomination. I urge \nmy colleagues to join me in opposition.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to share my views on the nomination \nof Elena Kagan, who has been nominated by President Obama to serve as \nSolicitor General of the United States.\n  As my colleagues know, I have supported several of President Obama's \nexecutive nominees and opposed a few others. I believe that it is my \nconstitutional duty to carefully review the record and qualifications \nof each nominee, while giving an appropriate amount of deference to the \nPresident when a nominee is objectively qualified for the position to \nwhich they are nominated, regardless of political orientation.\n  For example, I voted to confirm Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. I \nlikewise voted to confirm Ambassador Ron Kirk to be U.S. Trade \nRepresentative.\n  Unfortunately, I could not reach the same conclusion with Attorney \nGeneral Eric Holder regarding his fitness to serve as the Nation's top \nlaw enforcement official.\n  And, for the reasons outlined below, I cannot support Elena Kagan's \nnomination to be Solicitor General. My primary concern with Ms. Kagan's \nnomination is her continued failure to respond to legitimate and \nrelevant questions posed by me and others.\n  As I explained when the Judiciary Committee approved Ms. Kagan's \nnomination on March 5:\n\n       Ms. Kagan notes how much she respects the Senate and its \n     institutional role in the nominations process. Regrettably, \n     her refusal to answer legitimate and relevant questions posed \n     by me and others belies this claimed respect. For this \n     reason, I will be voting `no' this morning and do not believe \n     that her nomination should be advanced. I hope that Ms. Kagan \n     reconsiders her position because I believe that she is \n     otherwise qualified to serve as Solicitor General.\n\n  In response to Senator Specter's subsequent request to supplement her \nanswers in writing, Ms. Kagan returned a 22-page letter purporting to \ndo just that. But I concur with Senator Specter, the ranking member on \nthe Judiciary Committee, who has determined that too many of Ms. \nKagan's answers to relevant and legitimate questions remain incomplete \nand unresponsive. As Senator Specter correctly notes, this is about the \nSenate's institutional prerogatives.\n  In sum, I do not believe that Ms. Kagan has provided the basic level \nof responsiveness that the Senate's constitutional advice and consent \nfunction demands. And for that reason I am forced to vote against her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I don't know if there are other Members are \ncoming. While the Senator from Alabama is on the floor, let me note \nthat I heard there may be one or two more Members coming over. I hope \nthey will come soon. I am going to be here, as I have a series of \nmeetings until well after 6, but I know a number on both sides have \nflights to catch.\n  Once everybody has spoken, I will suggest that we yield back all time \nand have a vote. I know the Senator from Alabama had specific time set \naside and didn't use all of it. I hope he might join me in calling for \nother Senators who wish to speak to come over. If they are to speak, it \nwould be better to do it sooner rather than later. It would be a great \nhelp to a number of Senators on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. If the Senator will yield, the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee has set up ample time for this to be discussed \ntoday. I thank him for that. Senator Specter, a little while ago, \nindicated that he thought the time should be yielded back and we could \nvote as early as 5. He hoped that would be acceptable, and he urged \npeople to come down if they have comments. I will join him and you in \nurging people to come down if they have remarks to make. It would be \nmore convenient, I think, for people to have an early vote.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Alabama. I urge \nMembers--if there are others--not to wait until 5. And I ask those on \nthe other side of the aisle, if you wish to speak, please do so as soon \nas possible, because at some point--and we will do this only with \nnotice to the Republican\n\n[[Page S3532]]\n\nside--I am going to ask unanimous consent to yield back all time and go \nto a vote.\n  In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask that the \ntime be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, it is a distinct honor for me to rise in \nsupport of Dean Elena Kagan and her nomination to be Solicitor General \nof the United States. As most of my colleagues are aware, she has had \nan illustrious legal career that includes clerking for Judge Abner \nMikva on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia and \nalso Justice Thurgood Marshall on the U.S. Supreme Court. She has \nobtained tenure in two of the most distinguished law schools in the \ncountry: the University of Chicago and Harvard Law School. She served \nas Special Counsel in the Clinton administration, and now she is dean \nof the Harvard Law School.\n  I had the privilege of getting to know Dean Kagan through alumni \nactivities at Harvard Law School. She is much younger than I, obviously \nmuch smarter than I, but we still are alumni of the same law school. \nShe is extraordinarily qualified to be the Solicitor General based on \nher intellectual gifts but also in terms of her temperament, her \nprofessionalism, her experience, and her innate sense of fairness and \ndecency. She will represent the United States well, not only with her \nlegal analysis but with her commitment to the principles that sustain \nthis country based on the Constitution of the United States. There are \nmany qualities that make her ideally suited for this job--her \ntemperament, her maturity, her judgment, her success in leading one of \nthe most complicated faculties in the country.\n  Most lawyers have opinions, so when you put 100 or so of them \ntogether, you have a lot of different viewpoints. She has led Harvard \nLaw School with great skill and with great success. I think it will be \nan indication of her ability to lead the Solicitor General's office and \nto harmonize in principle, reaching substantive agreements, the \ncritical issues that are debated within the this important office and \ngoing forward.\n  In the 5 years she has been dean of the law school, she also received \ngreat acclaim for bridging the differences in approaches and viewpoints \nat the school, with hiring new faculty members with diverse viewpoints, \ndifferent from hers, recognizing that the heart and soul of an academic \ninstitution is debate, vigorous debate, not orthodoxy but vigorous \ndebate, and she has done that.\n  She has been very attentive to the needs of the students there. I was \nparticularly impressed when I visited the law school and had a chance \nto meet some veterans of the U.S. military who had served in Iraq and \nAfghanistan and who were then current law students at Harvard. Their \npraise for the dean, both her personal qualities and her leadership \nqualities, was unstinted. They saw her as someone who deeply \nappreciated their sacrifice as soldiers, marines, sailors, and airmen \nin the service of this Nation. They understood this not just from what \nshe said, but from her attitude, her deep and profound respect for \ntheir service. I thought that was a particularly telling point, \ncommending her to me in a very real and very immediate sense.\n  What is also particularly striking about Dean Kagan is that her \nentire life's work as a legal scholar shows a deep and profound \ncommitment to the Constitution of the United States which governs us \nall. She has committed herself to giving it meaning, to making it a \nforce to advance the ideals of this country. She brings not only great \nrespect for the Constitution, great knowledge of the Constitution, but \nalso the understanding that this is a document that unites us--our \naspirations, our ideals, our hopes, our wishes for the future--it links \nus to the past and it unites us to go forward into the future.\n  She was asked by officials at my other alma mater, West Point, in \nOctober 2007 to speak to the cadets because they recognize that this is \na woman of rare talent as a lawyer and rare judgment, someone who \nunderstands that we live in a government of laws, not of men and women. \nThat is a fundamental lesson that must be imparted to those who take an \noath to protect with their lives the Constitution of the United States, \nto recognize that we are a nation of laws, and soldiers, more than \nanyone else, have to recognize that because it is their lives that give \nus the opportunity to live under this Constitution of laws.\n  She used as a touchstone for this speech a place on campus at West \nPoint called Constitution Corner. It was the gift of the West Point \nclass of 1943. It was to recognize that, in fact, soldiers in this \ngreat country are servants to the Constitution.\n  One of the five plaques at this site is entitled ``Loyalty to the \nConstitution,'' which basically states what all of us who have been in \nthe military are keenly aware, that the United States broke with an \nancient tradition. Instead of swearing loyalty to a military leader, \nAmerican soldiers swear their loyalty to the Constitution of the United \nStates. I had that rare privilege on July 3, 1967, when I took the oath \nas a cadet at West Point.\n  The rest of her speech explored the fundamental rule of law, giving \npurpose and context to what these young men and women, soldiers in our \nNation, will do when they lead other soldiers to defend--not territory, \nnot business enterprises, but the foundation of our country--the \nConstitution of the United States.\n  She mentioned examples of people who have put the Constitution before \ntheir own personal comfort and privilege--President Nixon's Attorney \nGeneral Archibald Cox, who refused to go along with summary firings in \nthe wake of the Watergate scandal, and President George W. Bush's \nAttorney General John Ashcroft, our former colleague, both of whom did \ntheir best to uphold the rule of law in very trying circumstances. \nThese are examples that I think resonated very well with the cadets.\n  I believe the dean is someone who has not just the skill, not just \nthe mind, but the heart to serve with distinction as Solicitor General \nof the United States. She will be a forceful and powerful advocate, not \nfor the administration, not for any small, narrow cause, but for the \nConstitution of the United States. I believe that is the fundamental \nrole of the Solicitor General, one she will perform admirably.\n  I recommend without reservation Dean Kagan to this body. I hope we \nall rise to support her. If confirmed as the first female Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States, we will be extremely fortunate to have \nher representing the people of the United States before the Supreme \nCourt of the United States.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum \nand ask that the time be equally divided between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Gun Violence\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I stand today to discuss a matter of great \nimportance and great sadness to every community across this country. \nFrom our biggest cities to our smallest towns, gun violence is stealing \nthe lives of innocent victims. It is tearing apart families, \ncommunities, and our own sense of security. Gun violence in our \ncommunities must end, and it must end now.\n  In just the last 2 weeks we have had too many grim reminders of what \ncan happen when there are too many weapons on the street. From Chicago \nand Maryville, IL, to Samson, AL, we have seen gun violence mix with \ndevastating results.\n  Friday was a tragic day in Chicago. Last Friday night, 14-year-old \nGregory Robinson was gunned down in a car while driving with his family \nthrough Chicago's far south side. This young man's funeral is today. \nInstead of reaching his dream to become a basketball star at Simeon \nCareer Academy in Chicago, this high school freshman became the 28th \nChicago public\n\n[[Page S3533]]\n\nschool student to be killed just this year. Twenty-eight students, Mr. \nPresident. I repeat, 28 young lives are now snuffed out.\n  Last Tuesday was an equally tragic day in the city. On Tuesday, young \nFranco Avilla, a tenth grader at Roosevelt High School on Chicago's \nwest side, was shot to death. Instead of being the exception, shooting \ndeaths of our school children have now become the rule. Last school \nyear, 26 Chicago public school students were shot during the full 9-\nmonth school year. Well, this year, Chicago public schools have already \nsurpassed this sad milestone, and it is only March.\n  When Franco left his house last Tuesday afternoon, his last words to \nhis father were: ``Dad, I'll be back.'' He never came home. Gun \nviolence took his life.\n  We must take action now to get these weapons off our streets and end \nthe senseless slaughter of our young people.\n  Guns played an equally devastating role in the life of Juan Pitts. \nMr. Pitts' son, Kendrick, was a 17-year-old student at Bowen High \nSchool when he was shot down last month alongside two other Chicago \npublic school students--15-year-old Raheem Washington and 13-year-old \nJohnny Edwards.\n  The deaths of these young men are atrocious. Yet the pain and tragedy \nof the Pitts family has only doubled since then. Two weeks ago, \nKendrick's brother, Carnell, who graduated from Bowen High School last \nyear, was shot to death at a gathering on Chicago's south side.\n  Gangs and gun violence go hand-in-hand. Our youth should be carrying \nschool books instead of firearms. Yet in so many instances, our failure \nto invest in the education of our youth on the front end is at the root \nof the violence and imprisonment, as a result, on the back end. Our \nfailure to enact serious, sensible gun control measures make it much \nmore likely these tragedies are going to occur again and again.\n  We tend to think of gun violence as a problem of large urban areas--a \nsymptom of America's big cities. Well, the truth is, no community is \nimmune to such senseless behavior. I am from a small town. I was born \nand raised in Centralia, IL, which is about 100 miles south of our \nState capital of Springfield. I know how close-knit these small-town \nfamilies and small towns are. I know how safe these towns seem to be.\n  Sadly, two recent events proved otherwise.\n  A recent shooting in Maryville, IL, which is about an hour-and-a-half \ndrive from my hometown of Centralia, reminds us that the dangers \nassociated with guns affect us all, no matter where we live, work, pray \nor go to school.\n  Two weeks ago, on a quiet Sunday morning, a 27-year-old gunman walked \nstraight down the aisle of Maryville's First Baptist Church and shot \nand killed Pastor Winters during the normal weekly service. Just days \nlater, in Samson, AL, we saw the all-too-familiar word flash across our \nTV screens again--``massacre.'' A 28-year-old gunman killed a total of \n10 individuals and injured many more before he finally took his own \nlife during an hour-long rampage.\n  The 10 individuals who died, whose lives ended on that tragic Tuesday \nafternoon, were going about their daily routine without the slightest \nthought that their lives would end that very day. The many more who \nwere wounded by those gunshots surely never thought they, too, would be \nvictims--survivors, nonetheless--of gun violence.\n  The stark truth is, everybody is a victim of gun violence. Every \nSenator in this body has constituents who have been touched by this \nissue, and it is our responsibility as lawmakers and leaders of this \ngreat Nation to ensure assault and semiautomatic weapons do not take \nthe lives of so many innocent victims. We must take action to stop the \nsenseless killing on our Nation's streets, in our communities, at our \nschools, and in our places of worship. We must take action to increase \nour gun control measures and decrease our gun violence. Ultimately, by \ndoing so, we will be taking action to ensure our children, our \nfamilies, and our communities live in a safer place in America.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. I ask unanimous consent the time of the quorum call be \nequally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak up to 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, President Obama's budget is sending mixed \nmessages to the American people. I know he faces a very difficult time, \nas do we all. I know he is trying to get the best counsel he can, and I \napplaud him for that. I do not have a degree in macroeconomics and I \nknow some of the finest macroeconomists in the country are on President \nObama's team. I do not know anybody, however, on President Obama's team \nwho has ever run a small business. So, if I may be so presumptuous, I \nwould like to share some of the realities of running a small business \nwith the President's team and see if we can't understand why many of \nthe things that are in the President's budget, in fact, will have \ndirectly the opposite effect than he wants.\n  It is the goal of the administration to increase job creation and \nspur economic growth. That is a legitimate goal. However, we must \nunderstand this about how you increase job creation: You must be sure \nsmall businesses are properly taken care of because small businesses \nprovide more than half the jobs Americans hold and small businesses \ncreate the new jobs. When large businesses start downsizing, buying \npeople out and laying people off, where do they go? In many instances, \nthose who do not go on unemployment end up in small businesses.\n  If I may offer my own credentials, I have run businesses that were as \nsmall as two people--myself and my secretary. I was recruited to be the \nCEO--a very high-powered title--of a business that had only four \nemployees. I made number five. We grew that business to the point that \nthere were thousands of employees and the business was ultimately \nlisted on the New York Stock Exchange. So I offer that to the \nmacroeconomists on President Obama's team, to say that if you want to \nincrease jobs and if you want to increase economic growth and thereby \nincrease tax revenue to the Federal Government, you should pay \nattention to small business.\n  One of the worst things that can happen to you when you are trying to \ngrow a small business is to make money. That sounds counterintuitive, \nbut it is true. Why? Because you need that money to finance your \ngrowth, but the Government shows up and says we want ours in taxes. So \nyou want the tax rate to be as low as possible. The business that I \ndescribed, that went from four employees to the New York Stock \nExchange, was built during what the New York Times and other critics \ncalled the decade of greed because the top tax rate was 28 percent, and \nthey thought that was terrible. It was only 28 percent, the top \nmarginal tax rate? That is awful. That only goes for the greedy \nAmericans.\n  That meant that for every dollar we earned in that business, we got \nto keep 72 cents of it, which we could use to finance the growth of the \nbusiness. That business was grown with internally generated funds. Yes, \nwe had a bank line and yes we drew on the bank line, but it was the \ninternally generated funds that made it possible for us to create those \nthousands of jobs.\n  Because there were a small number of us in that business, we took the\n\n[[Page S3534]]\n\nbusiness income onto our personal tax returns. That is allowed under \nthe Tax Code, under what is known as Chapter S, under the Tax Code. We \nwere an S corporation. So while my tax return showed the amount I was \npaid while I was the CEO of that company, it also showed my share of \nthe profits of the company. None of that came to me. All of that was \nreinvested in the company. But for tax purposes, it showed up on my tax \nreturn. So I, very quickly, for tax purposes, was an American earning \nmore than $250,000 a year. I was not, but my tax returns showed that I \nwas.\n  Now, the top tax rate was 28 percent. This was while Ronald Reagan \nwas President. If we were to start that business today and the \nPresident's budget were to pass and the President's Tax Code were to be \nenforced, we would now be paying not 28 percent but 42 percent because \nyou would go to 39.5 percent and then you would have the other add-ons \nconnected with Medicare and the other things that have been changed. I \ndo not believe the business would have survived. I think that tax \nburden would have been so heavy that we would not be able to make it.\n  Let me give you the numbers from my own State, to show how important \nthis is. In the State of Utah, we have 68,758 small businesses that \nemploy less than 500 people; we have 65,693 small businesses that \nemploy less than 50 people, and we have 61,057 small businesses that \nemploy less than 20 people.\n  So the number of people employed by small businesses in Utah--this \nrules out the farmers, this is not agriculture--is 760,096 in \nbusinesses with less than 500 people each. That is 61 percent of Utah's \nentire employment population.\n  Now, if you increase the taxes on all of those people on the \nassumption that they are rich, you increase the taxes on every one of \nthose businesses because they are rich. Look, the owners of the \nbusinesses are filing tax returns to show over $250,000 so they must \nall be Wall Street brokers and traders. Right.\n  Now, they are people who are struggling to make the business grow, \nstruggling to provide the jobs. Make no mistake, the tax increases \nproposed by President Obama's budget will hurt Utah's small businesses, \nhundreds of thousands of our employees, our State's economy, and that \nmeans, at large, our national economy. So it is a mixed message. The \ngoal is job creation, but the budget will hurt the greatest engine of \njob creation which is small businesses.\n  Second, the administration's goal is to increase service in America \nand invest in the nonprofit sector. That sounds wonderful. Then they \nturn around and say: If you invest in the nonprofit sector, you, \nAmerican citizens, we are going to take away a portion of your tax \ndeduction for the gift you give to charity. This is a double hit.\n  If I am running my small business I have just described, the tax man \nshows up and gives me less than I can give to charity, and then if I do \ngive some to charity, the tax man shows up and takes more of that away \nfrom me by eliminating part of my tax deduction for charity. That is a \nmixed message. We want you to do this, but we are creating an economic \nincentive that makes it difficult for you and will penalize you.\n  Now, finally, the administration has the goal to protect the majority \nof Americans from tax increases. The President has said over and over \nthat he will not increase taxes for 95 percent of Americans. That \nsounds wonderful until you turn around and recognize that he is \nproposing a new energy tax at the gas pump and on your utility bill \nthat will hit 100 percent of Americans.\n  So on one side: Well, we are not going to hit you on the income tax \nside. But we are going to take it away from you on the gas pump and \nutility side. This is because he wants to create a cap-and-trade \nprogram. Other countries have cap-and-trade programs. I was in the \nUnited Kingdom. I talked to the people about theirs. As they were \noutlining how it works, I said to them: Do your ratepayers understand \nthey are paying this? This is not money that is created in Heaven.\n  The answer I got was: Well, they are beginning to. We all saw the \nreaction of Americans when gas was $4 a gallon at the pump, and we all \nfelt the heat as our constituents came us to and said: You have got to \ndo something about this; this is far too much for us to pay for \ngasoline.\n  Then when the prices came down, that political outrage began to \ndisappear. However, if you do cap and trade in the way the President \nwants, those prices will start to creep up again. It will be at the gas \npump, it will be at the utility. So it is another mixed message.\n  We have three mixed messages. We want to create jobs, but we are \ngoing to tax the greatest engine of creating jobs. We want people to \nget involved in national service, but we are going to tax them and \npenalize them if they do. We want Americans, ordinary Americans, to go \nwithout tax increases, but we are going to increase their taxes on \nenergy and hit them with a fund that will amount to approximately $650 \nbillion, by virtue of the carbon tax that will come through the cap-\nand-trade program.\n  What is the consequence of all of this? My colleagues have talked \nabout the fact that the record spending is going to double the national \ndebt in 5 years, triple it in 10 years. How is the administration going \nto pay for that? In the ways I have described. They are going to do it \nthrough increased taxes.\n  There is one last thought I want to leave everyone. We can determine \nhere in the Congress how much we spend. We cannot determine here in the \nCongress how much we take in. We can pass a tax law that will project a \ncertain amount that will come in, but that projection will not come to \npass if the economy is not strong. Money does not come from the budget. \nMoney comes from the economy. If the economy is weakened, if the \ngenerations of economic growth are weakened in the ways I have \ndescribed, we will not have the money with which to pay the debt.\n  So we come back to that which the distinguished Republican leader has \nsaid at the beginning of this debate: If you take the President's \nbudget all in all, it spends too much, it taxes too much. And when the \ntaxes do not cover what is being spent, it borrows too much.\n  I may not be a macroeconomist, but I have a long history of running a \nbusiness and knowing how devastating the tax man's arrival can be to \nthat business. I have a history of creating jobs, jobs that pay taxes \nas the employees are compensated. I know this aspect of our economy is \none that the Obama administration would be well advised to pay \nattention to.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to vote on confirmation of the nomination of \nElena Kagan, and that all debate time on the nomination be yielded \nback, except that the chairman and ranking member or their designees \nhave 2 minutes each immediately prior to the vote; further, that all \nprovisions of the previous order governing the nomination continue to \nbe effective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have heard a lot of debate here today. I \nremind Senators of one thing: The Kagan nomination is not \ncontroversial. Every Solicitor General who served from 1985 has \nendorsed her nomination. That is every Democratic one, every Republican \none, across the political spectrum.\n  Let me read some of the names who have endorsed this woman Charles \nFried, Ken Starr, Drew Days, Walter Dellinger, Seth Waxman, Ted Olson, \nPaul Clement, Greg Garre. Here is what they wrote in their letter of \nsupport:\n\n       We who have had the honor of serving as Solicitor General \n     over the past quarter century in the administrations of \n     Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush, William Clinton \n     and George W. Bush, write to endorse the nomination of Dean \n     Elena Kagan to be the next Solicitor General of the United \n     States. We are confident that Dean\n\n[[Page S3535]]\n\n     Kagan will bring distinction to the office, continue its \n     highest traditions, and be a forceful advocate for the United \n     States before the Supreme Court.\n\n  One of the conservative professors whom Dean Kagan helped bring to \nHarvard Law School was Professor Jack Goldsmith. You may remember, he \ntook charge of the Office of Legal Counsel after the disastrous tenures \nof Jay Bybee and John Yoo.\n  Professor Goldsmith, a conservative, praised Dean Kagan as someone \nwho takes to the Solicitor General's Office a better understanding of \nthe Congress and the executive branch that she will represent before \nthe Court than perhaps any prior Solicitor General.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of these and the dozens of other \nsupporters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Letters of Support for the Nomination of Elena Kagan To Be Solicitor \n                      General of the United States\n\n\n                  Current and Former Public Officials\n\n       David A.

The President nominated Elena Kagan, currently dean of \nHarvard Law School, for Solicitor-General of the United States. While I \ndo not share many of Dean Kagan's views, I especially disagree with \nDean Kagan on the constitutionality of the Solomon amendment.\n  In 2005, Dean Kagan and 53 other law school faculty members filed an \namicus brief to declare the Solomon amendment unconstitutional. The \nSolomon amendment, named for former Congressman Jerry Solomon, alloys \nmilitary recruiters to meet with students on college campuses and \nallows the Reserve Officers' Training Corps, ROTC, to train on college \ncampuses. The Supreme Court found Dean Kagan's arguments to be \nunpersuasive and declared the Solomon Amendment to be constitutional. I \nbelieve the Supreme Court was absolutely correct in its decision.\n  It is my hope that as Solicitor General, Dean Kagan will not allow \nher personal viewpoint on this important issue to prohibit the \nimplementation of the Solomon amendment and that our military \nrecruiters continue to recruit the best and brightest at our Nation's \ncolleges to serve in our military.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3536-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3536]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 1586, an act to impose an \nadditional tax on bonuses received from certain TARP recipients, just \nreceived from the House and at the desk; that the Baucus-Grassley \namendment, which is the text of S. 651, which was introduced today by \nSenators Baucus, Grassley, and others, be considered and agreed to, the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, the bill, as amended, be \nread three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid on the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I don't \nbelieve Congress should rush to pass yet another piece of hastily \ncrafted legislation in this very toxic atmosphere, at least without \nunderstanding the facts and the potential unintended consequences. \nFrankly, I think that is how we got into the current mess.\n  As the chairman of the Finance Committee said last week:\n\n       Frankly it was such a rush--we're talking about the \n     stimulus bill now--to get it passed, I didn't have time and \n     other conferees didn't have time to address the provisions \n     that were modified significantly.\n\n  I don't know what is in this legislation. Nobody else knows what is \nin this legislation. There have been no hearings. It seems to me the \nBanking Committee should have a hearing. The Finance Committee should \nhave a hearing. Obviously, any tax legislation should be vetted through \nthe Finance Committee. I am a member of that committee. We haven't had \nany meetings to talk about this. Other Senators need time to consider \nthe bill and offer amendments through the regular order through the \ncommittee process. More importantly, because of the public interest, \nthe public ought to have the right to review this legislation to make \nsure it doesn't have any additional loopholes or unintended \nconsequences.\n  The Baucus bill, as I understand it, is retroactive, not something we \nordinarily do with tax policy. It seems to me we ought to have these \nhearings before we let this legislation come to the body. Therefore, I \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before my friend leaves, I appreciate the \nstatement of my friend from Arizona. At least he is willing to look at \nit and study it, and I appreciate that very much. The Republican leader \nin the House, of course, was opposed to it, so we are glad the \nRepublican assistant leader, the Republican whip, as a member of the \nFinance Committee, will look at it.

Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes talking \nabout action that needs to be taken to restore the credibility of the \nfairness of the American financial markets.\n  On Monday, Senators Isakson, Tester, and I introduced S. 605, which \ndirects the Securities and Exchange Commission to write regulations \nthat will deal effectively with abusive short selling.\n  One of the abusive techniques addressed in the bill is so-called \n``naked short selling.'' Naked short selling is when traders sell \nshares they don't own and have no ability to deliver at the time of \nsale--which dilutes the value of a company's shares and can drive \nprices down artificially.\n  Before the ink on our bill was even dry, we received a profoundly \ndisappointing report from the SEC's inspector general entitled \n``Practices Related to Naked Short Selling Complaints and Referrals,'' \na report detailing the results of an audit on the SEC Division of \nEnforcement's policies, procedures and practices for processing \ncomplaints about naked short selling.\n  An astounding 5,000 complaints about abusive short selling were sent \nto the SEC's Enforcement Division between January 1, 2007 and June 1, \n2008. There could be no mistaking the scale of the potential problem \nthat that number of complaints reflected. Incredibly, a mere 123 \ncomplaints were referred for further investigation. Worse, and I quote: \n``none of the forwarded complaints resulted in enforcement actions . . \n.'' five thousand complaints, zero enforcement actions.\n  Not surprisingly, the SEC inspector general has concluded that the \nprocesses for dealing with such complaints need a fundamental overhaul.\n  Accordingly, the IG made 11 suggestions for improvements. And how did \nthe Enforcement Division respond? It agreed to one of the IG's \nrecommendations, and declined to move on the rest.\n  I have been around Washington and the Senate for 36 years, but rarely \nhave\n\n[[Page S3537]]\n\nI seen an inspector general's call for action so summarily dismissed.\n  In its comments to the IG report, the SEC Enforcement Division \nstated:\n\n     there is hardly unanimity in the investment community or the \n     financial media on either the prevalence, or the dangers, of \n     ``naked'' short selling.\n\n  I ask my colleagues: Why would the SEC Enforcement Division want to \nwait until there is unanimity in the investment community and the \nfinancial media to enforce the law? Why would the SEC Enforcement \nDivision in its comments to the IG report want to give a virtual \n``green light'' to continued abusive naked short selling? That is an \nenforcement division that is not worthy of its name.\n  In the IG's response to the Enforcement Division, the IG notes that \nit is ``disappointed'' that the Enforcement Division only concurred \nwith one of the 11 recommendations in the audit report. The IG is \n``particularly concerned'' that the Enforcement Division did not concur \nin its first three recommendations--that the Division should develop a \nwritten in-depth triage analysis for naked short selling complaints.\n  Moreover, the IG notes:\n\n       SEC has repeatedly recognized that naked short selling can \n     depress stock prices and have harmful effects on the market. \n     In adopting a naked short selling antifraud rule, Rule 10b-\n     21, in October 2008, the Commission stated, `We have been \n     concerned about ``naked'' short selling and, in particular, \n     abusive `naked' short selling, for some time.\n\n  Where does this leave us, Mr. President? We have an SEC that is \nostensibly concerned about abusive naked short selling, but we have an \nenforcement division--after receiving literally thousands and thousands \nof complaints about naked short selling--that has brought no \nenforcement actions and doesn't take seriously an IG audit and \nrecommendations.\n  This is an outrage.\n  I want to be clear, this was the record from a review of last year's \nexamination of short selling complaints. This is an issue Mary \nSchapiro, the new SEC chair, has inherited. She just got to the SEC. \nBut this is a strong indication of the need for real leadership at the \nSEC. Unless and until that happens, investors will have reason to worry \nthat markets are not yet free of manipulation and abuse.\n  Of all the challenges confronting our financial system, none is more \nimportant than restoring investors' trust and confidence in the \nmarket--the belief that the game isn't rigged against them. After the \ndisastrous and unprecedented losses of the past year, millions of \nAmericans will refuse to put their resources back into the stock market \nuntil they believe the system is once again sound, fair and adequately \noverseen by the SEC.\n  In the not-so-distant past, a strategy of long-term buying-and-\nholding offered a roadmap for comfortable living in retirement and the \nability to provide to our children and grandchildren that all-important \neconomic head start in life.\n  Then, the market valued companies based on economic fundamentals and \nexpected future profits.\n  Today, too many people view the stock markets as another gambling \ncasino, dominated by volatility and susceptible to predatory short \nsellers who profit from false rumors and bear raids.\n  To restore faith in our securities markets, the Securities and \nExchange Commission urgently needs to reflect a clear commitment to \nmeaningful change.\n  It is time to restore the integrity, efficiency and fairness of our \nsecurities markets by preventing manipulative short selling, ensuring \nthat the market fairly values the actual shares issued by a company, \nand outlawing the creation of ``phantom shares'' by abusive short \nsellers.\n  Let's remember how we got here. The opaque derivatives market allowed \nsome people to play a shell game by leveraging to the hilt and buying \nand selling synthetic instruments that ultimately crashed in value. The \nsame thing happens through abusive short selling, when traders sell \nshares they do not own and have no ability to deliver at the time of \nsale.\n  It is like making copies of your car's title, and then selling the \ntitle to the car three times, while hoping you can find other cars to \ndeliver if the buyer proceeds.\n  In some cases, the short interest in a particular company's stock on \na given day has spiked dramatically after false rumors have circulated \nabout the company. The data further show that ``fails'' to deliver are \nlarge and problematic.\n  That is evidence of manipulation. It distorts the market. It must end \nnow.\n  Let me be clear: the problem isn't short selling itself, which can \nenhance market efficiency and price discovery.\n  The problem is that, under current rules, short sellers can sell \nstocks they haven't actually borrowed in advance of their short sale--\nand with no uptick rule in place as a circuit breaker. The current \nstandard requires only a ``reasonable belief'' that a short seller can \nlocate the necessary shares by the delivery date; that is no standard \nat all and subjects the market to rife abuse.\n  For the market to flourish again, the SEC must issue rules and \nenforce them in a way that convinces investors the system is not rigged \nagainst them.\n  One important step the SEC should take now is to reinstate the \nsubstance of its former ``uptick'' rule.\n  The uptick rule served us well for 70 years until the SEC rescinded \nit in July 2007. It required short sellers to take a breath and wait \nfor a sale at a higher price before continuing to sell short in \ndeclining markets. According to one survey, 85 percent of CEOs, and \nprofessionals at NYSE-listed companies favor reinstating it. Fed \nChairman Bernanke, bipartisan Members of Congress, and former \nregulators favor reinstating it. The SEC should do that now.\n  Restoring the uptick rule is necessary, but not sufficient, to rein \nin abusive short selling. If the SEC is to alter fundamentally the way \nstocks trade today, it must also require--and enforce--short sellers \npossessing at the time of the sale a demonstrable legally enforceable \nright to deliver the shares--a so-called ``pre- borrow'' requirement. \nWe simply can't tolerate a market that permits short sellers to create \nphantom shares that dilute a company's value, erode the value of \ninvestors' holdings and manipulate share prices downward.\n  A recent Bloomberg news report based on SEC data confirmed that so-\ncalled ``naked'' short selling contributed significantly to the demise \nof Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns. Those companies took horrendous \ngambles and their share values had to reflect those serious missteps, \nbut in the absence of ``naked'' short selling both might nevertheless \nhave survived.\n  Abusive short selling is gasoline on the fire for distressed stocks \nand distressed markets. And the knowledge that it is still tolerated \nrattles small investors and shakes confidence in our markets.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this story be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                  [From Bloomberg.com, Mar. 19, 2009]\n\n     Naked Short Sales Hint Fraud in Bringing Down Lehman (Correct)\n\n                          (By Gary Matsumoto)\n\n       (Corrects levels of failed-to-deliver shares in second and \n     18th paragraphs.)\n       The biggest bankruptcy in history might have been avoided \n     if Wall Street had been prevented from practicing one of its \n     darkest arts.\n       As Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. struggled to survive last \n     year, as many as 32.8 million shares in the company were sold \n     and not delivered to buyers on time as of Sept. 11, according \n     to data compiled by the Securities and Exchange Commission \n     and Bloomberg. That was a more than 57-fold increase over the \n     2007 peak of 567,518 failed trades on July 30.\n       The SEC has linked such so-called fails-to-deliver to naked \n     short selling, a strategy that can be used to manipulate \n     markets. A fail-to-deliver is a trade that doesn't settle \n     within three days.\n       ``We had another word for this in Brooklyn,'' said Harvey \n     Pitt, a former SEC chairman. ``The word was `fraud.''\n       While the commission's Enforcement Complaint Center \n     received about 5,000 complaints about naked short-selling \n     from January 2007 to June 2008, none led to enforcement \n     actions, according to a report filed yesterday by David Kotz, \n     the agency's inspector general.\n       The way the SEC processes complaints hinders its ability to \n     respond, the report said.\n       Twice last year, hundreds of thousands of failed trades \n     coincided with widespread rumors about Lehman Brothers. \n     Speculation that the company was being acquired at a discount \n     and later that it was losing two trading partners both proved \n     untrue.\n\n[[Page S3538]]\n\n       After the 158-year-old investment bank collapsed in \n     bankruptcy on Sept. 15, listing $613 billion in debt, former \n     Chief Executive Officer Richard Fuld told a congressional \n     panel on Oct. 6 that naked short sellers had midwifed his \n     firm's demise.\n\n\n                            Gasoline on Fire\n\n       Members of the House Committee on Government Oversight and \n     Reform weren't buying that explanation.\n       ``If you haven't discovered your role, you're the villain \n     today,'' U.S. Representative John Mica, a Florida Republican, \n     told Fuld.\n       Yet the trading pattern that emerges from 2008 SEC data \n     shows naked shorts contributed to the fall of both Lehman \n     Brothers and Bear Stearns Cos., which was acquired by \n     JPMorgan Chase & Co. in May.\n       ``Abusive short selling amounts to gasoline on the fire for \n     distressed stocks and distressed markets,'' said U.S. Senator \n     Ted Kaufman, a Delaware Democrat and one of the sponsors of a \n     bill that would make the SEC restore the uptick rule. The \n     regulation required traders to wait for a price increase in \n     the stock they wanted to bet against; it prevented so-called \n     bear raids, in which successive short sales forced prices \n     down.\n\n\n                          Driving Down Prices\n\n       Reinstating the rule would end the pattern of fails-to-\n     deliver revealed in the SEC data, Kaufman said.\n       ``These stories are deeply disturbing and make a compelling \n     case that the SEC must act now to end abusive short selling--\n     which is exactly what our bill, if enacted, would do,'' the \n     senator said in an e-mailed statement.\n       Short sellers arrange to borrow shares, then dispose of \n     them in anticipation that they will fall. They later buy \n     shares to replace those they borrowed, profiting if the price \n     has dropped. Naked short sellers don't borrow before \n     trading--a practice that becomes evident once the stock isn't \n     delivered. Such trades can generate unlimited sell orders, \n     overwhelming buyers and driving down prices, said Susanne \n     Trimbath, a trade-settlement expert and president of STP \n     Advisory Services, an Omaha, Nebraska-based consulting firm.\n       The SEC last year started a probe into what it called \n     ``possible market manipulation'' and banned short sales in \n     financial stocks as the number of fails-to-deliver climbed.\n\n\n                        `Unsubstantiated Rumors'\n\n       The daily average value of fails-to-deliver surged to $7.4 \n     billion in 2007 from $838.5 million in 1995, according to a \n     study by Trimbath, who examined data from the annual reports \n     of the National Securities Clearing Corp., a subsidiary of \n     the Depository Trust & Clearing Corp.\n       Trade failures rose for Bear Stearns as well last year. \n     They peaked at 1.2 million shares on March 17, the day after \n     JPMorgan announced it would buy the investment bank for $2 a \n     share. That was more than triple the prior-year peak of \n     364,171 on Sept. 25.\n       Fuld said naked short selling--coupled with \n     ``unsubstantiated rumors''--played a role in the demise of \n     both his bank and Bear Stearns.\n       ``The naked shorts and rumor mongers succeeded in bringing \n     down Bear Stearns,'' Fuld said in prepared testimony to \n     Congress in October. ``And I believe that unsubstantiated \n     rumors in the marketplace caused significant harm to Lehman \n     Brothers.''\n\n\n                            Devaluing Stock\n\n       Failed trades correlate with drops in share value--enough \n     to account for 30 to 70 percent of the declines in Bear \n     Stearns, Lehman and other stocks last year, Trimbath said.\n       While the correlation doesn't prove that naked shorting \n     caused the lower prices, it's ``a good first indicator of a \n     statistical relationship between two variables,'' she said.\n       Failing to deliver is like ``issuing new stock in a company \n     without its permission,'' Trimbath said. ``You increase the \n     number of shares circulating in the market, and that devalues \n     a stock. The same thing happens to a currency when a \n     government prints more of it.''\n       Trimbath attributes the almost ninefold growth in the value \n     of failed trades from 1995 to 2007 to a rise in naked short \n     sales.\n       ``You can't have millions of shares fail to deliver and \n     say, `Oops, my dog ate my certificates,' '' she said.\n\n\n                          Explanation Required\n\n       On its Web site, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York lists \n     several reasons for fails-to-deliver in securities trading \n     besides naked shorting. They include misunderstandings \n     between traders over details of transactions; computer \n     glitches; and chain reactions, in which one failure to settle \n     prevents delivery in a second trade.\n       Failed trades in stocks that were easy to borrow, such as \n     Lehman Brothers, constitute a ``red flag,'' said Richard H. \n     Baker, the president and CEO of the Washington-based Managed \n     Funds Association, the hedge fund industry's biggest lobbying \n     group.\n       ``Suffice it to say that in a readily available stock that \n     is traded frequently, there has to be an explanation to the \n     appropriate regulator as to the circumstances surrounding the \n     fail-to-deliver,'' said Baker, who served in the U.S. House \n     of Representatives as a Republican from Louisiana from 1986 \n     to February 2008.\n       ``If it's a pattern and a practice, there are laws and \n     regulations to deal with it,'' he said.\n\n\n                          Fines and Penalties\n\n       Lehman Brothers had 687.5 million shares in its float, the \n     amount available for public trading. In float size, the \n     investment bank ranked 131 out of 6,873 public companies--or \n     in the top 1.9 percent, according to data compiled by \n     Bloomberg.\n       While naked short sales resulting from errors aren't \n     illegal, using them to boost profits or manipulate share \n     prices breaks exchange and SEC rules and violators are \n     subject to penalties. If investigators determine that traders \n     engaged in the practice to try to influence markets, the \n     Department of Justice can file criminal charges.\n       Market makers, who serve as go-betweens for buyers and \n     sellers, are allowed to short stock without borrowing it \n     first to maintain a constant flow of trading.\n       Since July 2006, the regulatory arm of the New York Stock \n     Exchange has fined at least four exchange members for naked \n     shorting and violating other securities regulations. J.P. \n     Morgan Securities Inc. paid the highest penalty, $400,000, as \n     part of an agreement in which the firm neither admitted nor \n     denied guilt, according to NYSE Regulation Inc.\n\n\n                        Enforcement `Reluctant'\n\n       In July 2007, the former American Stock Exchange, now NYSE \n     Alternext, fined members Scott and Brian Arenstein and their \n     companies $3.6 million and $1.2 million, respectively, for \n     naked short selling. Amex ordered them to disgorge a combined \n     $3.2 million in trading profits and suspended both from the \n     exchange for five years. The brothers agreed to the fines and \n     the suspension without admitting or denying liability, \n     according a release from the exchange.\n       Of about 5,000 e-mailed tips related to naked short-selling \n     received by the SEC from January 2007 to June 2008, 123 were \n     forwarded for further investigation, according to the report \n     released yesterday by Kotz, the agency's internal watchdog. \n     None led to enforcement actions, the report said.\n       Kotz, the commission's inspector general, said the \n     enforcement division ``is reluctant to expend additional \n     resources to investigate'' complaints. He recommended in his \n     report yesterday that the division step up analysis of tips, \n     designating an office or person to provide oversight of \n     complaints.\n\n\n                            Schapiro's Plans\n\n       The enforcement division, in a response included in the \n     report, said ``a large number of the complaints provide no \n     support for the allegations'' and concurred with only one of \n     the inspector general's 11 recommendations.\n       SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro, who took office in January, has \n     vowed to reinvigorate the enforcement unit after it drew fire \n     from lawmakers and investors for failing to follow up on tips \n     that New York money manager Bernard Madoff's business was a \n     Ponzi scheme. She has ``initiated a process that will help us \n     more effectively identify valuable leads for potential \n     enforcement action,'' John Nester, a commission spokesman, \n     said in response to the Kotz report.\n       Last September, the agency instituted the temporary ban on \n     short sales of financial stock. It also has announced an \n     investigation into ``possible market manipulation in the \n     securities of certain financial institutions.''\n\n\n                          No Effective Action\n\n       Christopher Cox, who was SEC chairman last year; Erik \n     Sirri, the commission's director for market regulation; and \n     James Brigagliano, its deputy director for trading and \n     markets, didn't respond to requests for interviews. John \n     Heine, a spokesman, said the commission declined to comment \n     for this story.\n       ``It has always puzzled me that the SEC didn't take \n     effective action to eliminate naked shorting and the fails-\n     to-deliver associated with it,'' Pitt, who chaired the \n     commission from August 2001 to February 2003, said in an e-\n     mail. The agency began collecting data on failed trades that \n     exceed 10,000 shares a day in 2004.\n       ``All the SEC need do is state that at the time of the \n     short sale, the short seller must have (and must maintain \n     through settlement) a legally enforceable right to deliver \n     the stock at settlement,'' Pitt wrote. He is now the CEO \n     of Kalorama Partners LLC, a Washington-based consulting \n     firm. In August, he and some partners started RegSHO.com, \n     a Web-based service that locates stock to help sellers \n     comply with short-selling rules.\n\n\n                        Postponed `Indefinitely'\n\n       Pitt began his legal career as an SEC staff attorney in \n     1968, and eventually became the commission's general counsel. \n     In 1978, he joined Fried Frank Harris Shriver & Jacobson LLP, \n     where as a senior corporate partner he represented such \n     clients as Bear Stearns and the New York Stock Exchange. \n     President George W. Bush appointed him SEC chairman in 2001.\n       The flip side of an uncompleted transaction resulting from \n     undelivered stock is called a ``fail-to-receive.'' SEC \n     regulations state that brokers who haven't received stock 13 \n     days after purchase can execute a so-called buy-in. The \n     broker on the selling side of the transaction must buy an \n     equivalent number of shares and deliver them on behalf of the \n     customer who didn't.\n       A 1986 study done by Irving Pollack, the SEC's first \n     director of enforcement in the 1970s, found the buy-in rules \n     ineffective with regard to Nasdaq securities. The rules \n     permit brokers to postpone deliveries ``indefinitely,'' the \n     study found.\n\n[[Page S3539]]\n\n       The effect on the market can be extreme, according to Cox, \n     who left office on Jan. 20. He warned about it in a July \n     article posted on the commission's Web site.\n\n\n                        Turbocharged Distortion\n\n       When coupled with the propagation of rumors about the \n     targeted company, selling shares without borrowing ``can \n     allow manipulators to force prices down far lower than would \n     be possible in legitimate short-selling conditions,'' he said \n     in the article.\n       `` `Naked' short selling can turbocharge these `distort-\n     and- short' schemes,'' Cox wrote.\n       ``When traders spread false rumors and then take advantage \n     of those rumors by short selling, there's no question that \n     it's fraud,'' Pollack said in an interview. ``It doesn't \n     matter whether the short sales are legal.''\n       On at least two occasions in 2008, fails-to-deliver for \n     Lehman Brothers shares spiked just before speculation about \n     the bank began circulating among traders, according to SEC \n     data that Bloomberg analyzed.\n       On June 30, someone started a rumor that Barclays Plc was \n     ready to buy Lehman for 25 percent less than the day's share \n     price. The purchase didn't materialize.\n\n\n                             `Green Cheese'\n\n       On the previous trading day, June 27, the number of shares \n     sold without delivery jumped to 705,103 from 30,690 on June \n     26, a 23-fold increase. The day of the rumor, the amount \n     reached 814,870--more than four times the daily average for \n     2008 to that point. The stock slumped 11 percent and, by the \n     close of trading, was down 70 percent for the calendar year.\n       ``This rumor ranks up there with the moon is made of green \n     cheese in terms of its validity,'' Richard Bove, who was then \n     a Ladenburg Thalmann & Co. analyst, said in a July 1 report.\n       Bove, now vice president and equity research analyst with \n     Rochdale Securities in Lutz, Florida, said in an interview \n     this month that the speculation reflected ``an unrealistic \n     view of Lehman's portfolio value.'' The company's assets had \n     value, he said.\n\n\n                           `Obscene' Leverage\n\n       During the first six days following the Barclays hearsay, \n     the level of failed trades averaged 1.4 million. Then, on \n     July 10, came rumors that SAC Capital Advisors LLC, a \n     Stamford, Connecticut-based hedge fund, and Pacific \n     Investment Management Co. of Newport Beach, California, had \n     stopped trading with Lehman Brothers.\n       Pimco and SAC denied the speculation. The bank's share \n     price dropped 27 percent over July 10-11.\n       Banks and insurers wrote down $969.3 billion last year--and \n     that gave legitimate traders plenty of reason to short their \n     stocks, said William Fleckenstein, founder and president \n     of Seattle-based Fleckenstein Capital, a short-only hedge \n     fund. He closed the fund in December, saying he would open \n     a new one that would buy equities too.\n       ``Financial stocks imploded because of the drunkenness with \n     which executives buying questionable securities levered-up in \n     obscene fashion,'' said Fleckenstein, who said his firm has \n     always borrowed stock before selling it short. ``Short \n     sellers didn't do this. The banks were reckless and they held \n     bad assets. That's the story.\n\n\n                           `Market Distress'\n\n       On May 21, David Einhorn, a hedge fund manager and chairman \n     of New York-based Greenlight Capital Inc., announced he was \n     shorting stock in Lehman Brothers and said he had ``good \n     reason to question the bank's fair value calculations'' for \n     its mortgage securities and other rarely traded assets.\n       Einhorn declined to comment for this story. Monica Everett, \n     a spokeswoman who works for the Abernathy Macgregor Group, \n     said Greenlight properly borrows shares before shorting them.\n       Even when they're legitimate, short sales can depress share \n     values in times of market crisis--in effect turning the \n     traders' negative bets into self-fulfilling prophecies, says \n     Pollack, the former SEC enforcement chief who is now a \n     securities litigator with Fulbright & Jaworski in Washington.\n       The SEC has been concerned about the issue since at least \n     1963, when Pollack and others at the commission wrote a study \n     for Congress that recommended the ``temporary banning of \n     short selling, in all stocks or in a particular stock'' \n     during ``times of general market distress.''\n\n\n                             Airport Runway\n\n       On Sept. 17, two days after Lehman Brothers filed for \n     Chapter 11 bankruptcy, the number of failed trades climbed to \n     49.7 million, 23 percent of overall volume in the stock.\n       The next day, the SEC announced its ban on shorting \n     financial companies in 2008. The number of protected stocks \n     ultimately grew to about 1,000. On Sept. 19, the commission \n     announced ``a sweeping expansion'' of its investigation into \n     possible market manipulation.\n       The ban, which lasted through Oct. 17, didn't eliminate \n     shorting, according to data from the SEC, the NYSE Arca \n     exchange and Bloomberg. Throughout the period, short sales \n     averaged 24.7 percent of the overall trading in Morgan \n     Stanley, Merrill Lynch & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. on \n     NYSE Arca. In 2008, short sales averaged 37.5 percent of the \n     overall trading on the exchange in the three companies.\n       To date, the commission hasn't announced any findings of \n     its investigation.\n       Pollack, the former SEC regulator, wonders why.\n       ``This isn't a trail of breadcrumbs; this audit trail is \n     lit up like an airport runway,'' he said. ``You can see it a \n     mile off. Subpoena e-mails. Find out who spread false rumors \n     and also shorted the stock and you've got your \n     manipulators.''\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. The new SEC leadership has the opportunity to make the \nSEC a ``can do'' agency once more. The SEC is scheduled to meet on \nApril 8 to discuss the uptick rule and abusive short selling. The Chair \nand commissioners should move quickly to adopt the uptick rule and a \npre-borrow requirement.\n  If not, Congress should do its part and direct the SEC to do that \nquickly.\n  After yesterday's IG report and the Enforcement Division's response \nto it, I am even more convinced that SEC Chair Schapiro needs to grab \nthe reins quickly at the SEC, and get back to standing up for investor \ninterests to restore confidence in the markets. If the SEC won't do it, \nCongress should require them to do it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I wish to speak a little bit today about \na subject near and dear to my heart, and that is our American auto \nindustry.\n  Before the global credit crisis happened, our American auto industry \nwas undertaking ambitious restructuring plans. I know there are those \nwho haven't been aware of that up until now but in fact it is true.\n  For the past decade, our American auto industry has been moving \ntoward improved fuel efficiency, improved quality, and advanced \ntechnologies. I am very proud of what the men and women in our country \ndo in terms of building our American automobiles. This was clearly \nshown as the auto industry laid out the plans before Congress last \nDecember. The companies and the workers have been making tremendous \nsacrifices even before they were asked to do so, to level the playing \nfield with foreign competitors. The idea of cutting, restructuring, \nlayoffs, plant closings are not new. They are, unfortunately, a way of \nlife at the moment in Michigan and other manufacturing States where \nthere have had to be major sacrifices, particularly for workers and \ntheir families.\n\n  By the end of the current 2005 and 2007 contracts for workers, the \nlabor cost gap between domestic and foreign automakers would have been \nlargely eliminated. They also eliminated 50 percent of the companies' \nliability for retiree health benefits, and that is before any of the \ncurrent debate. It was also before the global credit crunch happened. \nThe global credit crunch has hit everybody--every business, large and \nsmall, every consumer, every family, every homeowner.\n  Certainly our auto industry has seen the brunt of the inability to \nget capital, the inability of people to get a car loan, our auto \ndealers and the challenges they have had, our auto suppliers, as well \nas the OEMs.\n  The failure of our auto industry, if we allow them to go down because \nof a global credit crisis, would mean a loss of over 400,000 supplier \njobs and over 450,000 jobs in the service sector, national deficits, \nand reductions in personal income. It would be a huge catastrophe if we \nwere to allow the global credit crisis to create a situation in which \nwe would no longer have an American auto industry.\n  It is important for us to understand that this crisis has similarly \naffected\n\n[[Page S3540]]\n\nthe foreign automakers, forcing them to request help from China, \nCanada, Japan, Spain, Great Britain, Brazil, as well as numerous other \ncountries.\n  We find ourselves in a situation where this credit crisis has \nprofoundly affected the backbone of manufacturing in the United States. \nWe have seen firsthand in Michigan the challenges that GM, Ford, and \nChrysler have faced. We now have a White House auto task force that has \nbeen set up to work with General Motors and Chrysler, which have asked \nfor assistance from us in this global credit crisis.\n  Today we had a very important announcement to help the industry as a \nwhole. I thank the White House auto task force for understanding that \nalong with our automakers, it is critically important that our \nsuppliers be able to pay their bills, supply the parts, and continue to \nbe a very important part of this industry as a whole.\n  I very much appreciate the fact that a very positive action was taken \ntoday by the auto task force to help make capital available during this \ncredit crisis for our tier 1 suppliers.\n  Our American auto industry represents about 4 percent of our gross \nnational product and 10 percent of our industrial production value. Our \nauto industry provides health care and pensions to over a million \nretirees and their families who live all over the country, by the way, \nnot just in Michigan, although we certainly would welcome them back. \nBut they live all over the country.\n  Auto parts suppliers provide hundreds of thousands of jobs. They are \nthe leading U.S. manufacturing employer. That, again, is why the \ndecision that was made today to make capital available for our auto \nsuppliers is so important.\n  In turn, those direct jobs contribute to 4.5 million--4.5 million--\nprivate industry jobs across the country. That is an additional 5.7 \njobs for every single direct supplier job. We are talking in general \nabout an industry that touches every State--not just Michigan, not just \nOhio, not just Indiana, but every single State.\n  The domestic auto industry comprises more than 10 percent of the high \nyield bond market and is one of the largest sectors in leverage finance \nfor the banks. They spend over $12 billion a year on research and \ndevelopment. Without this funding, our country would become dependent \non foreign ideas and foreign technology that would threaten our role \nnot only in innovation and in the global economy but in our national \ndefense as well.\n  I come today to say that failure is not an option when it comes to \nthe viability and support for our American auto industry. Right now, if \none or more of the American auto companies is allowed to fail, then we \ncan expect as many as 3.3 million lost jobs in the next year. When we \nthink about what we are doing in the stimulus package, in the recovery \npackage, and we think about 3.3 million jobs that would be lost in the \nauto industry alone, it is stunning.\n  Think about the recovery plan and the fact we are talking about \ncreating or saving 3.5 million jobs--3.5 million jobs lost if one of \nthe companies went down. This is a big deal. This is a huge issue for \nus. That is why I have fought so hard, along with Senator Levin and \nother colleagues, to make sure we are doing everything possible to \ncreate a level playing field for the American auto industry so we can \nmaintain these jobs and the strong role--the vital role--they play in \nthis economy.\n  It is not only about workers--direct workers or indirect workers. The \nfallout, if we were to see a company fail, would hit thousands of \nbusinesses that depend on the auto industry, from parts suppliers to \ndealers to service industries, body shops, consultants, advertisers, \njanitorial services--all kinds of other jobs, not counting the \nrestaurant across the street from the plant. When the plant closes, the \nrestaurant goes or the shoe store down the street goes. The drugstore \ngoes. These are basic jobs, huge parts of the economy of thousands and \nthousands of communities across this country.\n  Also, let me be clear that the foreign automakers would be hurt as \nwell because manufacturers share so many suppliers. Without the \nbusiness from Detroit, those suppliers would fail. Many dealers own \nU.S. and non-U.S. dealerships, and they would not be able to keep \noperating without the American brands in the mix. That is why I am very \npleased that the leadership of Toyota met with the auto task force to \nurge them to support the American auto industry through this global \ncredit crisis because they know better than anyone that they share the \nsame suppliers.\n  Again, that is why the decision today by the auto task force is so \nimportant, to support tier 1 suppliers because this supports the \nautomakers, foreign and domestic, all over America. This is very \nimportant. It would have catastrophic effects on several States already \nsuffering from some of the Nation's highest unemployment rates if, in \nfact, we would see one or more of these companies go down.\n  Let me show some of the numbers when we talk about what happens in \nterms of unemployment and the devastation across the country--people \nare out of work right now--and what would happen if our American \nautomakers were not supported so they can continue. We would see a \nshutdown that would increase unemployment levels to over 10 percent in \nIndiana, Ohio, Rhode Island, Kentucky, South Carolina, Tennessee, \nCalifornia, Oregon, North Carolina, Mississippi, Nevada, Alabama, \nMissouri, Illinois, and Georgia.\n  My home State of Michigan already suffers from 11.6 percent \nunemployment. I understand how painful that is for communities. Rhode \nIsland could lose over 9,000 jobs if we were to see one of our American \nautomakers go under--9,000 jobs. Kentucky could lose 75,000 jobs and go \nto 11.9 percent unemployment. South Carolina could lose over 58,000 \njobs and go to an unemployment rate of 11.9 percent.\n  To continue, Tennessee could lose over 106,000 jobs as a result of \none of our three domestic automakers going under, which would bring \ntheir unemployment rate to 11.8 percent. California could lose over \n300,000 jobs.\n  My point, whether it is Tennessee, California, Oregon, North \nCarolina, Mississippi, or other States is clearly what happens in \nDetroit does not stay in Detroit. That is the point. What happens in \nDetroit affects automakers and Americans all over the country, families \nwho depend on a paycheck from a direct job in the auto industry or a \nsupplier or some other small business. Others would be forced in a \nrecession to find work that is not there. People are barely making it \nas it is.\n  My message overall, again, is that what happens in Detroit doesn't \nstay in Detroit. It goes all over the country. That is why the work of \nthe White House auto task force is so important and why I appreciate so \nmuch their willingness to delve deeply into these issues and look at \nthe facts--not the rhetoric but the facts--and determine what is best \nfor the taxpayers, for American families, and for the economy. We owe \nit to American families. We owe it to the people of Michigan as well.\n  Part of what they are looking at is the fact that the failure of the \nAmerican auto industry would put a disastrous burden on top of job \nloss, a disastrous burden on the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation \nthat already faces massive shortfalls, a burden that could trigger tens \nof billions of dollars in additional pension obligations.\n  The reality is, those who say let GM go bankrupt, let Chrysler go \nbankrupt, the obligation to the American taxpayer from pensions alone \nwould far exceed the relatively small request, certainly compared to \nAIG or Citigroup or any of the other Wall Street requests, a small \nrequest, relatively speaking, to keep over 3.5 million people working \nin this country in good-paying jobs.\n  It would have a debilitating ramification for our industrial base \nwhich would undermine our military challenges, which I mentioned \nbefore. I was at a terrific business on Monday that makes equipment for \nlarge trucks, our big long-haul trucks, a great American business \ncalled ArvinMeritor. When we look at what they make for those big \ntrucks, the same kinds of brakes, the same kinds of axles, the battery \nthey are developing for a hybrid truck, our largest trucks--all of \nthose are technologies that either are used or will be used by the \nmilitary, trucks that are being driven in Iraq, military vehicles \naround the world.\n  If we lose an American capability to manufacture vehicles, we affect \nthe Department of Defense and we affect\n\n[[Page S3541]]\n\nevery single man and woman who is serving us today in protecting our \ncountry by saying to them: We are going to now rely on foreign \ncompanies for our vehicles for the trucks they drive, the cars they \ndrive, the tanks they drive. That doesn't make any sense at all.\n\n  We all have a stake in what happens in Detroit. We all have a stake \nin what happens to our American manufacturers and our American auto \nindustry. We need a 21st century manufacturing strategy that is focused \non American manufacturing, advanced manufacturing, as well as national \nsecurity and energy security. Our automakers are an important part of \nthat, but so are our other suppliers, our other manufacturers.\n  One of the things I so appreciate about President Obama's vision is \nthat he understands we need to manufacture in this country. The budget \nhe has given us focuses on our ability to create jobs through \nmanufacturing, through manufacturing in the new energy economy, and in \nthe traditional areas of manufacturing. In America, we need a \nrevitalized advanced manufacturing base. That will be a major part of \nour economic recovery as a country.\n  Again, none of us can afford for our American automakers to fail. \nThere is not a State represented here that can afford for that to \nhappen. Failure would mean loss of jobs, a loss of capacity for our \nnational defense, and the ability for us to build on an energy \nindependence for the future.\n  Again, what happens in Detroit doesn't stay in Detroit. It affects \nevery State, every American, and I very much appreciate the commitment \nof the White House auto task force and President Obama to work with us \nfor a vital and vibrant auto industry for the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3541-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3541]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REHABILITATION INSTITUTE OF CHICAGO\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. Presdient, researchers at the Rehabilitation \nInstitute of Chicago pursue scientific discoveries that blend the most \nadvanced medicine with technology to create ability where it has been \nlost.\n  Their most recent innovation replaces a lost limb with a robotic one, \nwhich is controlled just as their lost arm was controlled--by thoughts \nand commands transmitted by the brain.\n  It has captured the world's attention. Their research was published \nrecently in the Journal of the American Medical Association and \nhighlighted by the New York Times. It gives us a taste of what might be \npossible as doctors, scientists, and engineers continue to learn more \nabout the human body's nervous system.\n  It also provides new hope for all Americans who have an amputated arm \nor leg, including the hundreds of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans who \nhave lost a limb through their service to our country.\n  You almost need to be a biomedical engineer to even pronounce the \nname of the technique developed at the Rehabilitation Institute of \nChicago: pattern-recognition control with targeted reinnervation.\n  But it is easy to understand the procedure's importance to people \naround the world who have lost a limb.\n  When a person loses a limb, their brain does not know that the limb \nis gone. The brain continues to send signals through the nervous \nsystem, as if that lost arm or leg still existed. So, when a person who \nhas lost an arm thinks about closing her hand or pointing a finger, her \nbrain continues to send signals intended for the missing limb.\n  Dr. Todd Kuiken, a biomedical engineer and physician at the \nRehabilitation Institute of Chicago, has found a way to harness these \nsignals. His technology allows a patient to operate her prosthetic arm \nby thinking of the movement, as if her natural arm still existed.\n  First, Dr. Kuiken takes the good nerves that remain in the shoulder \nafter the loss of an arm. Through surgery, these nerves are redirected \nand implanted into a patient's healthy remaining muscles in the chest.\n  When the patient thinks about closing her hand, the brain sends a \nsignal through those redirected nerves into the reinnervated muscle, \ninstead of in the direction of the missing arm.\n  The next step is to interpret those signals. It is not an easy task. \nOur hands alone can perform hundreds of movements, from the slightest \nfinger wiggle to the clenching of a fist. Each movement is the result \nof a different pattern of signals from the brain. The challenge becomes \ndeciphering which pattern means ``close the hand''? Which pattern means \n``turn the wrist''?\n  Working to unlock the code, Dr. Kuiken and his colleagues now know \nwhich pattern is intended to produce a particular arm or hand movement. \nThey place tiny antennas on the patient's chest to detect the patterns. \nThe antennas convert the patterns into digital signals and send those \nsignals to an advanced artificial arm worn by the patient. The signals \ntell the arm how to move.\n  The results of Dr. Kuiken's research have been promising. Amanda \nKitts was one of the first patients to be fitted with one of the new \nprosthetics developed by the Defense Department's advanced research \nprogram, DARPA.\n  Amanda owns three daycare centers in Tennessee. She started working \nwith the Rehabilitation Institute in 2006 and spent the following years \ntraveling between Chicago and her home in Knoxville.\n  Amanda lost one of her arms in an automobile accident. The years she \nreceived therapy were difficult for her. She credits the therapists at \nthe Rehabilitation Institute for giving her the strength to realize \nthat her injury didn't have to change her outlook on life.\n  Amanda thought she would never be able to hug children again, \nincluding her son. But because of her new arm, she can.\n  She says of her new arm: ``It was wonderful . . . It made me feel \nmore human because I could work it almost like a regular arm. I just \nhad to think and it responded. My new arm made me feel like I could do \nanything again.''\n  Dr. Kuiken and the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago have been \nworking for several years to transfer this technology for the benefit \nof our wounded servicemembers. Through this collaboration, 10 wounded \nwarriors have received this remarkable surgery at the Brooke Army and \nWalter Reed Medical Centers and are having their new prostheses fit at \nthese state-of-the-art medical facilities.\n  Dr. Kuiken and the other researchers on this project deserve our \nthanks for their efforts, as does the Rehabilitation Institute of \nChicago. Every year since 1991, U.S. News and World Report has \nidentified the facility as the best rehabilitation hospital in the \nUnited States.\n  The Rehabilitation Institute is led by the indefatigable Dr. Joanne \nSmith, who did some of her training and subsequently consulted on \npatients at the VA. In addition to having expertise in prosthetics, the \nhospital is a leader in the treatment of traumatic brain injuries, the \nsignature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Dr. Smith has \nworked to make her hospital's expertise and rehabilitation services \navailable to the VA and the military services.\n  More work remains to be done to develop the targeted reinnervation \ntechnique. The researchers at the Rehabilitation Institute tell me that \nthe sensation nerves to and from a hand--which relay touch sensations \nfrom hot to cold and sharp to dull--can also be harnessed. Doctors are \nworking to put sensors into a robotic limb that has the ability to pick \nup these sensations.\n  If successful, the technique would allow patients to feel what they \ntouch, as if they were touching it with their missing hand.\n  Such technology will help someone like Amanda Kitts regain her \nability to sense touch from--feeling the texture of an object to \nknowing how hard she is squeezing her son's hand. The advance in \nsensing touch would help her reconnect to her world.\n  I am proud to have supported a $2 million request in the fiscal year \n2009 Defense appropriations legislation to help advance Dr. Kuiken's \nresearch in Chicago. Those men and women in uniform who have lost a \nlimb in service to our country deserve the best technology we have to \nhelp them regain their full abilities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3541-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3541-S3542]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      PATH TO BIPARTISAN AGREEMENT\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, the spiraling cost of health care \nrepresents a\n\n[[Page S3542]]\n\ngrowing financial crisis for many Americans who either cannot afford \nquality health care coverage or are struggling to keep the insurance \nthey currently have. When combined with the aging of our population, \nhealth care costs are driving the country's long-term fiscal \nchallenges, challenges which we must address in a bipartisan way.\n  Unfortunately, many proposals being offered to achieve universal \nhealth care coverage are pushing us toward a system based on expansive \ngovernment control, which will eventually lead to rationing, a \nreduction in the quality of care, and increased health care spending. \nThat is absolutely the wrong way to go.\n  So, today I join Senator Wyden and Senator Bennett as a co-sponsor of \nthe Healthy Americans Act, bi-partisan legislation to overhaul the \nnation's health care system, in an effort to make quality, affordable \nhealth insurance available to all Americans.\n  I congratulate Senator Wyden on his leadership in advancing this \ncause and pulling together this strong bipartisan blueprint that goes a \nlong way towards empowering consumers and the private market to extend \nhealth care coverage to all Americans.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the co-sponsorship of \nthe Senator from New Hampshire. The only way to produce enduring health \nreform is to work in a bipartisan manner. Unlike past efforts, through \nthe Healthy Americans Act, there is bi-partisan agreement on the \nprincipal issues. Republicans have moved to support covering everyone \nand Democrats have moved to support private choices.\n  Mr. GREGG. In addition to the private market approach to expanding \ncoverage, the bill attempts to reduce the growth in health care \nspending by providing incentives for preventive health care, wellness \nprograms, and disease management, as well as a stronger focus on health \ncare cost containment measures. These measures include lowering \nadministrative costs and focusing on chronic care management, health \ninformation technology and medical malpractice reform as tools to \ncontrol costs.\n  In addition to his commitment to enact comprehensive health care \nreform in a budget-neutral manner, I also would like to commend Senator \nWyden on his willingness to work with me to make improvements on last \nyears' proposal. In particular the removal of the Medicare part D price \nnegotiation language, the enhanced language to ensure stronger state \nflexibility, and the elimination of the non-health related tax \nprovisions are strong improvements to the bill.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I appreciate Senator Gregg's commitment to moving this \nprocess forward and the thoughtfulness in his suggestions. I am happy \nto work with you and all of our other co-sponsors to continue to make \nimprovements to the bill. While there are challenges on the specifics, \nas Senator Gregg has said, there's a lot to work with. Senator Gregg \nand I agree on fiscal responsibility, prevention, wellness, chronic \ncare management, modernizing the tax code, improving the quality of \ncare, containing costs, personal responsibility, and the importance of \ncovering everyone.\n  Mr. GREGG. I look forward to working with the Senator to make further \nimprovements as well. As I have told the Senator from Oregon in the \npast, I have some serious concerns about several elements of this plan, \nincluding the imposition of mandates; subsidies for higher income \nindividuals; the impact on current market competition; the FDA labeling \nlanguage regarding comparative effectiveness studies; and the issue of \nhow to determine the appropriate level of coverage offered as part of a \nhealth care reform regime.\n  As you know, the bill uses the Federal Employee Health Benefit Plan, \nFEHBP, Blue Cross Blue Shield, BCBS, standard plan as he actuarial \nequivalent for the Healthy Americans Private Insurance, HAPI, plans. As \nthe bill moves forward, our goal should be to create a more cost-\neffective benchmark that focuses on preventive care and core health \ncare services to encourage greater individual responsibility on over-\nutilization of care.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I think Senator Gregg's arguments on these points make a \nlot of sense. There's more to be said for reviewing alternative \nproposals such as a default enrollment policy instead of an individual \nmandate and the role of FDA labeling in comparative effectiveness.\n  In light of the reports earlier this week that President Obama's \nhealth reform plan is estimated to cost more than $1.5 trillion over \nthe next 10 years, it is better not to overpromise and undermine cost \ncontainment. It is important that the Congress find an appropriate \nbenefit standard that will ensure quality coverage for all Americans \nthat will not undermine our efforts to contain costs. I want to thank \nSenator Gregg for his thoughtful contributions and his willingness to \nwork with me, Senator Bennett and our bipartisan group. It's our plan \nto work closely with our leaders--Chairman Baucus, Ranking Member \nGrassley, Chairman Kennedy, and Ranking Member Enzi--to end 60 years of \ngridlock.\n  Mr. GREGG. I appreciate Senator Wyden's comments and I am hopeful \nthat by joining forces with colleagues on both sides of the aisle on a \nprivate market approach, we can begin a bi-partisan dialogue, work \nthrough our differences, and find workable solutions that will result \nin a better health care system for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3542-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3542-S3545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUICIDE IN THE ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, on the sixth anniversary of the \ninvasion of Iraq, I want to speak about an epidemic facing the Nation's \nArmed Forces; namely, the alarming rate of suicides in the services. \nYesterday, the Personnel Subcommittee of the Armed Services Committee \nheld an excellent hearing on this topic, and I would like to thank the \nchairman and ranking member for taking on this important issue. I would \nalso like to discuss an issue that we have so far paid far too little \nattention to, and that is the way the strain on the force caused by the \nrate of deployment is compromising our ability to care for \nservicemembers struggling with mental health concerns.\n  We have come a long way in addressing this issue. Only a generation \nago, Vietnam veterans struggled to get care for the long-term \nconsequences of the trauma they survived during the war. They were \ntrailblazers, and thanks to them the VA has revolutionized the way it \ncares for veterans. We now have, among other things, counseling centers \nwhere combat veterans can go to speak with experienced counselors who \nare also combat veterans about their difficulties in readjusting to \ncivilian life. I commend the President for emphasizing the need for \nadditional centers and have been a strong advocate for just that in the \nState of Wisconsin. But more remains to be done.\n  It is not sufficient to wait until a servicemember is discharged from \nthe Services and transitioned to the VA to respond to the crisis. Let's \nbe honest. There is a conflict between the responsibility to both \nmaintain the readiness of the Armed Forces and adequately respond to \nthe needs of servicemembers struggling with mental health issues. \nDuring this time of tremendous strain on the Armed Forces, our \nnoncommissioned officer corps is under incredible pressure to ensure \nthat the servicemembers under their command are ready to meet the \ndemands of combat. We must create the space for them to identify those \nsoldiers who are in need of extra assistance and provide a means for \nthem to provide that assistance.\n  We must begin by asking men and women in uniform about their \nexperiences and what we can do to support them. I was disappointed that \nthe hearing yesterday did not include the testimony of servicemembers \nabout their personal experiences, so I would like to take this \nopportunity to talk about what I have been hearing from servicemembers \nand their family members from my home State of Wisconsin.\n  Over 2 years ago, I was approached by a family whose son had taken \nhis own life while serving in Afghanistan. After an investigation of \nthe situation, I learned that the soldier was struggling to meet the \ngrueling demands of his duties and had, perhaps as a result, become \nisolated from his unit. It was a tragedy for all involved.\n  Last year, my office was contacted by a soldier who immediately \nthereafter took his own life. A subsequent investigation revealed that \nhe, too, had become isolated from his own unit. Due\n\n[[Page S3543]]\n\nto his ongoing struggle with mental illness, his leadership became \nunderstandably frustrated with him and repeatedly disciplined him. His \ndoctors decided he was not fit to deploy with his unit which was headed \nto Iraq. This was a major blow for him. He desperately wanted to deploy \nwith his unit. He became angry and isolated. He sought to be \ntransferred to a wounded warrior transition unit where he could focus \non his recovery. Unfortunately, his leadership failed to get him \ntransferred in a timely manner. If they had, he might still be with us \ntoday.\n  I was recently approached by a Wisconsin veteran who lost three of \nhis peers to suicide during his time in the Army. He has informed me \nthat in all three instances one of the main problems was a breakdown in \nleadership. He has given me a list of recommendations for the Armed \nForces to train our noncommissioned officers in suicide prevention. I \nwill ask to have these recommendations printed in the Record.\n  Listening to the voices of these men and women serving in uniform, a \nconsistent pattern has emerged. Our Armed Forces, which are under \ntremendous pressure due to two ongoing major contingency operations, \nare struggling to meet the needs of their members while completing \ntheir mission.\n  I suspect that the single most important thing our country can due to \naddress this epidemic is to redeploy from Iraq so that we can take the \ntime to care for the psychologically wounded without putting additional \nstrain on those who have already completed multiple tours. Redeploying \nwould also serve our national security needs by allowing us to better \nfocus on the global threat posed by al-Qaida and its affiliates.\n  Secondly, we must review the strategy we embraced which has led us to \nrely so much on the continued sacrifice of so few. We must not make the \nsame mistake again of engaging in a mistaken war of choice. We should \nnot ask those who volunteer to serve their country to bear the burden \nof a 6-year war absent a compelling need. We, the civilian leadership \nof this country, owe it to the men and women in uniform to be more \nresponsible stewards of our Armed Forces.\n  It is far past time to redeploy U.S. troops from Iraq. I am pleased \nthat the President has set a course for such a redeployment. Now, we \ncan turn to the task of rebuilding our Armed Forces.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have recommendations to \nwhich I referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 U.S. Army Suicide Prevention Proposal\n\n\n                                Abstract\n\n       The following correspondence is a proposal consisting of \n     recommendations members of Congress should consider regarding \n     the high numbers of suicides occurring within the Army. Even \n     though this proposal is emphasized towards the structure of \n     the Army, other branches should be able to utilize this \n     proposal in order to improve suicide prevention tactics as \n     well. If measures within this proposal are already being \n     taken, I apologize for the redundancy. This proposal is also \n     not intended to interfere with other preventive measures \n     being considered by the Army. Its sole purpose is to \n     implement ideas, based on my experiences, that should improve \n     the health and welfare of soldiers, increase education for \n     leaders at all levels to utilize while counseling \n     subordinates, and to develop measures commanders should take \n     should leaders abuse their authority, or commit any other \n     acts of misconduct that may hinder health, morale, and \n     welfare of soldiers within the United States Army.\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       The high numbers of suicides within the United States Army \n     are extremely disturbing. Ever since combat operations \n     commenced in Afghanistan in October of 2001, the suicide \n     rates have been increasing. However, statistics from 2007 and \n     2008 reveal numbers of suicides that are the highest since \n     the Army began recording numbers of suicides in its history. \n     In January of 2009, 24 soldiers took their own lives. The \n     number of soldiers killed in action was lower than those who \n     committed suicide. In February of 2009, another 18 soldiers \n     committed suicide. Even though the Army has a very serious \n     problem pertaining to suicides by soldiers deployed overseas, \n     a high abundance of soldiers stationed within the United \n     States are committing suicide as well.\n       I commend the Army's initial and recent efforts intended to \n     handle this serious problem. Increasing the numbers of mental \n     health experts, operating a suicide-prevention hotline, and \n     encouraging soldiers to seek help if symptomatic are steps in \n     the right direction. However, as a 13-year veteran who has \n     dealt with a significant number of soldier suicides in the \n     past, I am aware of other problems that require immediate \n     attention. If these problems are not assessed and corrected, \n     the aforementioned measures will make little difference in \n     the pursuit of suicide prevention. Based on my observations \n     and experiences, the primary core of problems involving \n     suicides by soldiers involve breakdowns of leadership at the \n     lower levels. Therefore, the following proposal will detail \n     recommended improvements of leadership training for younger \n     leaders.\n\n\n                        Army Recruiting Command\n\n       Army recruiters have perhaps the most arduous duty within \n     the enlisted ranks. They are required to meet specific \n     standards in regards to attracting individuals to contemplate \n     enlisting into the Army. They work very long hours each day, \n     and often work six days a week. They are under constant \n     pressure to secure enlistments so that the entire Army meets \n     recruit quotas and goals. Overall, the duties they perform \n     are extremely stressful. Recruiters either volunteer to \n     perform recruit duty, or are selected to do so by the \n     Department of the Army. Even though recruiters are \n     noncommissioned officers who are normally more responsible \n     and mature, they too are human beings who are subject to \n     mental health problems due to the nature of their duties. \n     Weeks ago, four recruiters in Houston committed suicide, most \n     likely from extreme pressure from their chains of command. \n     Recruiters normally have no one to turn to in times of \n     stress. Their leaders want them to produce, not complain. \n     Therefore, if they are experiencing any types of mental \n     health problems, most are likely to keep it within \n     themselves. Fellow recruiters must look out for each other, \n     and pay attention to stress that appears beyond the normal \n     stresses associated with recruiting duty. Like others, they \n     should not be ridiculed or chastised should they request \n     treatment. Also, even though it would probably be a difficult \n     task, the Army needs to expand the recruiting command. The \n     more recruiters, the less stress will be placed on recruiters \n     performing their duties today. Also, stigmatization shall not \n     be tolerated if a recruiter feels the need to seek mental \n     health treatment. The fear of stigmatization is a very \n     potential reason for the four suicides that occurred in \n     Houston.\n\n\n                         Drill Sergeant School\n\n       Drill Sergeants are perhaps the ``elite'' of the \n     noncommissioned officers throughout the Army. Like \n     recruiters, they either volunteer to perform this duty, or \n     are selected to do so by the Department of the Army. They are \n     responsible for turning civilians into soldiers. Molding a \n     typical individual into a motivated, highly-disciplined \n     warrior is no walk in the park. Being a drill sergeant \n     requires high levels of dedication and commitment to their \n     duties. Drill Sergeant training is simply the same as going \n     through basic training all over again. They learn what they \n     are going to teach. Since they are the first true soldiers \n     recruits are going to follow, drill sergeants must set an \n     extremely high example at all times. Like recruiting, drill \n     sergeants work long hours. They receive a limited number of \n     days off. Drill sergeants are required to pay extra attention \n     to detail due to the ``culture shock'' new recruits receive \n     once entering initial-entry or one-station unit training. \n     Basic training is normally a recruit's true separation from \n     family and friends from home. Therefore, they are typically \n     prone to suffering home sickness while being pushed to their \n     limits. Drill sergeants must be adequately trained in \n     recognizing changes in behaviors of their recruits. They must \n     be proficient counselors, especially when recruits appear \n     more stressed than normal. In 1995, a recruit at Fort \n     Benning, Georgia shot himself to death after rifle training. \n     The recruit had apparently hid a round after the training, \n     and went to an isolated area with his weapon after cleaning \n     it. He then used the live round in his possession to commit \n     suicide. The incident was an example of dereliction that can \n     occur if drill sergeants do not perform their duties with \n     high levels of attention to detail.\n\n\n     initial entry training (iet)/one-station unit training (osut)\n\n       As mentioned earlier, entry into the Army is normally a \n     level of ``culture shock'' for a new Army recruit. Even \n     though they expect initial, or basic training to be a true \n     test, they do not know what to truly expect until they \n     initially experience the high levels of stress at the \n     commencement of training. Drill sergeants are tasked to mold \n     civilians into soldiers in a short period. Therefore, the \n     operational tempo is very high. The stress can be so high \n     that certain recruits may act out of normal character. \n     However, one positive aspect of this level of training is \n     that new recruits are treated the same way. They often turn \n     to each other for support and encouragement. However, \n     separation from loved ones is very difficult. If something \n     negative happens within a recruit's family while he or she is \n     in training, his or her behavior or mental state will most \n     likely change. One of the first blocks of instruction \n     recruits receive should involve the importance of the ``buddy \n     system.'' Drill sergeants must inform their recruits that it \n     is alright to report signs of problems. Even though drill \n     sergeants are hard on their recruits, the last thing they \n     want is for a recruit to feel alienated in any sort of way. \n     If a recruit is suffering from mental distress, immediate \n     intervention is a necessity. It is alright for\n\n[[Page S3544]]\n\n     drill sergeants to demonstrate compassion towards the men and \n     women they are training. Recruits are taught how to pay \n     attention to detail just as much as drill sergeants are. \n     Therefore, unusual behavior, or warning signs of potential \n     suicide must be reported immediately. In the Army, all \n     soldiers, regardless of rank, are safety officers. Recruits \n     must be properly counseled by their cadre. If initial entry \n     trainers cannot solve problems, recruits demonstrating signs \n     of mental distress must be command-referred to mental health \n     services upon immediate signs of problems in order to prevent \n     a catastrophic event from happening.\n\n\n       the army noncommissioned officer education system (ncoes)\n\n       The initial phase of the NCOES involves the Warrior \n     Leadership Course (WLC), which is designed to prepare Army \n     specialists and corporals to become sergeants. Sergeants are \n     normally ``team leaders,'' who have a span of control \n     consisting of two or three subordinate soldiers. This four-\n     week course is military occupation specialty (MOS) non-\n     specific, and covers basic leadership skills. Students \n     receive enhanced proficiency on physical fitness training, \n     teaching skills, drill and ceremony, land navigation, field \n     and garrison leadership, and a written examination. It also \n     involves a situational training exercise (STX) designed to \n     teach hands-on leadership in a battlefield environment. My \n     recommendation is that a thorough block of instruction be \n     implemented that focuses on overall suicide prevention. \n     Students need to be taught what warning signs to look for, \n     and how to properly counsel troubled soldiers, as well as \n     carrying concerns up the NCO support channel and chain of \n     command in order to prevent a crisis from occurring. The \n     block of instruction should consist of classroom instruction \n     and role-playing activities. The role-playing training would \n     be the most beneficial part of the training. It must be as \n     realistic as possible and should give students hands-on \n     experience on listening to soldiers, demonstrating \n     compassion and caring towards a subordinate's problem(s), \n     and providing reassurances that problems can be resolved.\n       The next phase of the NCOES is the Basic Noncommissioned \n     Officer Course (BNCOC), which is specific to a sergeant's \n     MOS. The course is mandated for current or future staff \n     sergeants. The length of BNCOC varies by MOS, and is a live-\n     in learning environment conducted in two phases: Phase I, \n     which is a review of blocks of instruction learned in the \n     WLC, and Phase II, which is MOS-specific. This course \n     provides opportunities to acquire the leader, technical, \n     tactical, values, attributes, skills, actions, and knowledge \n     required to lead a squad-sized element of nine soldiers. Like \n     the WLC, a thorough block of instruction should be \n     implemented regarding mental health and suicide prevention. \n     It should involve the same classroom instruction and role-\n     playing activities learned in the WLC. Once again, proactive \n     and realistic role-playing would provide enhanced skills \n     designed to identify warning signs of suicide, tactics to \n     provide compassion towards the troubled soldier, and \n     necessary measures to immediately inform the squad leader's \n     NCO support channel and chain of command.\n       Promotable staff sergeants or newly-promoted sergeants \n     first class must complete the Advanced Noncommissioned \n     Officer Course (ANCOC) in order to lead a platoon-sized \n     element. The course builds on the experiences gained in \n     previous operational assignments and training. It emphasizes \n     skills complementing commissioned officer counterparts. By \n     the time NCOs reach this level of education, they should have \n     adequate knowledge of mental health, soldier human nature, \n     warning signs of suicide, and tactics required to ensure \n     prevention measures are taken.\n       The final phase of the NCOES is the Sergeants Major Academy \n     (USASMA). Noncommissioned officers (normally master \n     sergeants) attending the academy, are instructed on how to \n     implement policies, procedures, and training techniques and \n     tactics. They are the primary NCOs who would be responsible \n     for the oversight of suicide prevention training within the \n     NCOES. Sergeants major are instructed to oversee operations \n     within a battalion, brigade, division, or other element. \n     Command sergeants major oversee the training and operations \n     of all companies, battalions, brigades, divisions or other \n     higher elements, and serve as the enlisted advisor to \n     commanders of the aforementioned elements. Command sergeants \n     major are the NCOs most responsible for ensuring NCOs are \n     performing their duties properly and professionally. They \n     should mandate suicide prevention training be a part of \n     subordinate unit's training schedules. Suicide prevention \n     training should be conducted by chaplains, and/or \n     installation psychiatrists or psychologists. The same blocks \n     of instruction should be utilized during these training \n     sessions. My recommendation is that command sergeants major \n     mandate one day of training be conducted by each unit \n     quarterly during a fiscal year.\n\n\n                west point and officer candidate school\n\n       Specific curriculums pertaining to mental health and \n     suicide prevention must be implemented if they do not already \n     exist. Suicide prevention training for officers is extremely \n     important since they make final decisions as to how to handle \n     soldiers who are demonstrating warning signs of committing \n     suicide. More importantly, they must be prepared to initiate \n     investigations within their units that should reveal why a \n     soldier is contemplating suicide. Every unit has a safety \n     officer designated by the unit commander. Safety officers \n     must conduct thorough investigations as to why potential \n     crises arise, who may be responsible for misconduct, and what \n     measures must be taken in order to rectify the situation \n     without any harm done to anyone.\n\n\n              the medic school at fort sam houston, texas\n\n       On average, most Army companies have one medic per platoon. \n     Medics, MOS 91W, are enlisted soldiers normally supervised by \n     a medic NCO. Medics can be excellent counselors because many \n     soldiers potentially having a crisis situation often do not \n     feel comfortable talking about their problem(s) with their \n     leadership for fear of stigma. Therefore, any suicide \n     prevention training conducted at the Medical School at Fort \n     Sam Houston must be very thorough and specific. It should \n     involve the same blocks of instruction recommended within the \n     NCOES. It would be of great surprise to me if a thorough \n     block of instruction pertaining to crisis counseling and \n     suicide prevention did not exist at the Army Medical School. \n     Therefore, the United States Army Training and Doctrine \n     Command (TRADOC) should take any potential immediate action \n     to implement more crisis and suicide prevention training if \n     necessary.\n\n\n              the uniform code of military justice (ucmj)\n\n       I am very aware of some of the potential reasons as to why \n     soldiers resort to suicide. Whether they are experiencing \n     personal problems, are unable to tolerate military stress and \n     operational tempos, or are suffering from depression or any \n     other type of mental illness, soldiers caring for each other \n     are the best preventive measures. Based on my own personal \n     experiences while serving in the Army, I have seen several \n     young NCOs abuse their authority for their own personal \n     satisfaction. I have seen newly-promoted sergeants embarrass \n     subordinates in front of other soldiers just to demonstrate \n     they are in charge, and that any defiance will result in \n     repercussions. In my opinion, the failure to control \n     ``rogue,'' or immature and inexperienced leaders is a \n     significant and contributing factor in soldier suicides. \n     Therefore, more senior NCOs must closely supervise newly-\n     promoted NCOs to ensure soldiers are being cared for and not \n     humiliated. As mentioned earlier, commanders should order \n     investigations be conducted if soldiers are being mistreated. \n     Not only can mistreatment of soldiers increase likelihoods of \n     suicides, they will most likely affect the overall morale and \n     cohesion of an entire unit. Therefore, I recommend commanders \n     adopt and enforce ``no tolerance policies'' for acts of \n     cruelty or maltreatment of subordinate soldiers by superior \n     NCOs. Such actions violate Article 93 of the UCMJ (Appendix \n     A). If complaints are made, and investigations reveal \n     misconduct has occurred, commanders should either exercise \n     their authority to discipline under Article 15 of the UCMJ \n     (non-judicial punishment), or to order discipline under \n     Article 32 for more serious offenses. However, soldiers must \n     also know and understand their right to file a complaint \n     against their commanding officer if he or she is performing \n     wrongful actions against a soldier. Article 138 of the UCMJ \n     (Appendix B) protects soldiers from wrongful disciplinary \n     action being exercised by a commanding officer. If a soldier \n     believes his or her commander is in violation of Article 138, \n     a soldier should have full right to consult with the next \n     highest commander within his or her chain of command. If no \n     action is taken by that individual, the soldier should seek \n     assistance from the post Inspector General (IG), or the post \n     Staff Judge Advocate. For example, many soldiers are being \n     separated under Chapter 14 of Army Regulation 635-200 \n     (Appendix C) for acts of misconduct. However, these acts of \n     misconduct may stem from mental health problems such as PTSD. \n     Therefore, soldiers should exercise their rights under \n     Article 138 to request medical separations. Chapter 14 \n     separations normally result in ``other than honorable \n     discharges.'' Such discharges often hinder a veteran's VA \n     health benefits upon separation. Soldiers who served in a \n     combat zone do not deserve such an act of injustice. Appendix \n     D outlines examples of service members separated for \n     misconduct. Another problem involves service members \n     separated for personality disorders. According to Army \n     Regulation 635-200, only a psychiatrist, or any other mental \n     health professional may make such a diagnosis. Based on my \n     experiences, commanders take such action to simply separate a \n     soldier as soon as possible. Separations under Army \n     Regulation 635-200 are performed much quicker than medical \n     evaluation board (MEB) proceedings. While stationed at Fort \n     Stewart, Georgia, I observed an NCO harass a subordinate on \n     several occasions. However, even though the NCO was not \n     properly performing his duties and abusing his authority, the \n     commander declared the soldier as ``substandard,'' and had \n     him transferred to another unit, alienating him from his \n     friends and his overall support network. He eventually \n     committed suicide shortly after the transfer. Such \n     aforementioned abuses by NCOs are examples of abuses of \n     authority. They cannot be tolerated. Even though an \n     individual committing suicide is committing a selfish act \n     that cannot be rectified, improper treatment of soldiers does \n     nothing to help the situation. A new clause must be\n\n[[Page S3545]]\n\n     added to Article 93 of the UCMJ. Since females do not deserve \n     to be harassed sexually, or in any other manner, soldiers, \n     regardless of sex, do not deserve to be harassed or chastised \n     for being mentally ill. They deserve treatment. Therefore, I \n     recommend Article 93 be amended to emphasize that any forms \n     of stigma towards soldiers, regardless of rank, be a \n     violation of the article.\n\n\n                    medical evaluation boards (meb)\n\n       Medical evaluation board (MEB) proceedings should be \n     commenced for all soldiers demonstrating symptoms of mental \n     illness, regardless of the symptoms or the illness. An MEB \n     establishes a disability rating, and the soldier is separated \n     under honorably. Subsequently, he or she is able to obtain VA \n     medical care for a service-connected disability, and may \n     request disability percentage increases if his or her \n     condition worsens. If a psychiatrist diagnoses a soldier with \n     a ``personality disorder,'' the soldier should not be \n     separated under the provisions of Army Regulation 635-200 \n     governing personality disorders. He or she shall be medically \n     separated with a disability rating.\n\n\n                               conclusion\n\n       As mentioned in the abstract, this correspondence involves \n     recommendations and proposals that may already have been \n     taken into consideration, or implemented within the Army. \n     This correspondence is not intended in any way to insult the \n     Army in any way. Its primary purpose is to attempt to assist \n     with the prevention of suicides within the Army, regardless \n     of whether soldiers are deployed or not. Too many soldiers \n     have taken their lives over the past few years for unknown \n     reasons. However, I have seen first hand soldiers take their \n     own lives due to failed leadership. It is time to be \n     proactive, and ensure more preventive measures are taken. \n     Soldiers are human beings, not super heroes. Hence, missions \n     cannot be completed without healthy soldiers on the front \n     lines.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3545-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, our next big objective is health care \nreform.\n  We have a unique opportunity to move forward on health reform this \nyear. Now we must act. We simply cannot afford to wait any longer to \nfix our Nation's health care system.\n  We must work together to reduce health care costs, improve quality, \nand make coverage affordable for all Americans.\n  In the Finance Committee, we have held 13 hearings to prepare for \nhealth reform. Last week, we held a hearing on our Nation's health care \nworkforce. The hearing examined ways to address our current workforce \nneeds. The hearing considered ways to prepare our medical providers for \nhealth care reform.\n  At our hearing, four experts in the field testified about current \nhealth care workforce shortages, especially in primary care and \nnursing, and the witnesses told us that we must address these health \nworkforce needs to meaningfully reform our health system.\n  Dr. David Goodman, the director of the Center for Health Policy \nResearch, said: ``The workforce we train today will shape, for good or \nbad, tomorrow's health system.''\n  Dr. Goodman continued, ``It will be hard to improve access, achieve \nbetter health outcomes and decrease health care expenditure growth \nrates unless we get workforce policy right.''\n  I could not agree more.\n  Our efforts on health care reform are only as strong as our Nation's \nhealth care providers--the nurses, doctors, and other professionals--\nwho are on the front lines caring for patients.\n  Investing in our health care workforce is critical as we work to \nexpand health insurance coverage to millions of currently uninsured \nAmericans.\n  During our hearing, Dr. Allan Goroll, a primary care doctor and \nprofessor at Harvard University, told us about the Massachusetts \nexperience following the enactment of State health reform. Dr. Goroll \nsaid that some newly insured people in Massachusetts are waiting up to \n2 months to get a doctor's appointment. That is simply unacceptable.\n  For our health care reform efforts to succeed, we must directly \naddress these health workforce challenges.\n  It starts with primary care. Our current system greatly undervalues \nprimary care. As a result, fewer students are going into the field. A \nrecent study found that only 1 in 50 medical students plans a career in \nprimary care internal medicine. That is down from more than one in five \nin the early 1990s. This trend is especially troubling, because it is \nclear that a strong primary care system is a key determinant of high \nquality, efficient medical care.\n  During our hearing, we learned that areas of the country with a high \nproportion of primary care doctors spend less money on health care. And \npatients there have the same or better outcomes.\n  We need to invest in our Nation's primary care providers to help \nimprove the quality of our medical care and to bring down health care \ncosts.\n  Our workforce challenges extend beyond primary care. Our Nation's \nhospitals continue to face a nursing shortage. Recent news reports tell \nof shortages of general surgeons and dentists in rural areas. Many \nparts of the country need more mental health practitioners. And the \nlist could go on.\n  We need to tackle these challenges head-on. We need to place our \nNation's health care workforce on sound footing. And we need to meet \nthe medical needs of all Americans.\n  This is going to require a renewed focus on the way that we pay for \nand deliver health care. We must ensure our payment systems reward high \nquality medical care and encourage medical students to go into critical \nfields like primary care.\n  And we are going to need to take a hard look at our national \nworkforce policies to make sure that our health care providers have the \nright training and skills to deliver excellent care.\n  This effort is vital for our health reform efforts to succeed. So \nlet's get to work now.\n  Let's work together to strengthen our Nation's health care workforce. \nLet's build a health care system that delivers high-quality medical \ncare for everyone. And let's act now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3545-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3545-S3547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Read below and explain why you or anyone would vote to stop \n     drilling when the country is in such turmoil. Please [tell me \n     why so many people have plenty while] I struggle with student \n     loans that I just paid a company to try and get eliminated. \n     If you want to help me, call the Department of Education and \n     tell them to forgive my student loans. I paid [a company] \n     $399 to get my loans discharged, so make a call and tell \n     Department of Education to just do it without me suing them. \n     It is said you get a denial letter, then you go to a lawyer \n     just like for disability. Well, here is your chance to help \n     an Idaho teacher that just lost her job due to mismanaged \n     funds with [a local school district]. They are $2 million in \n     debt so they [laid off several teachers and para-educators]. \n     So I am asking for help.\n     Blocked in D.C.\n                                  ____\n\n       Investors Business Daily estimates there are 1 trillion \n     barrels of oil trapped in shale in the U.S. and Canada. \n     Retrieving just a 10th of it would quadruple our current oil \n     reserves. There is a pool of oil in the Gulf of Mexico that \n     is estimated to be as large as any in the Middle East. There \n     is an equally large pool believed to be in Alaska.\n       The Chinese are attempting to tap into the Gulf oil supply \n     by drilling diagonally from Cuba. I wonder what environmental \n     safeguards they are using?\n       The fact is that there are environmentally safe methods of \n     extracting oil from shale and drilling in both the Gulf and \n     Alaska. Congress, however, continues to block these efforts. \n     Just last week, the Senate voted to block any extraction from \n     shale in Colorado. In essence, they voted to make your trips \n     to the gas station more expensive, to make air travel more \n     expensive, and to make heating your home more expensive. That \n     is something to think about in an election year.\n       Another topic: Social Security\n       Another issue that concerns many Americans these days is \n     the sustainability of\n\n[[Page S3546]]\n\n     major entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. \n     With all of Congress' talk about ``saving and preserving'' \n     these programs, consider these facts about Social Security:\n       When Social Security (FICA) was introduced it was promised:\n       Participation in the program would be completely voluntary.\n       Participants would only have to pay 1% of the first $1,400 \n     of their annual incomes into the program.\n       The money the participants elected to put into the program \n     would be deductible from their income for tax purposes each \n     year.\n     Mary.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to share my feelings about \n     national energy policy. I cannot understand the thinking of \n     most of the politicians I hear about. If I want to maintain \n     my freedom personally, I make sure I am as self reliant as \n     possible. I make sure I live within my income. I make sure I \n     own the things I will need to sustain my lifestyle so I have \n     control over them such as homes, cars, tools, computers, \n     supplies, etc. especially if I need them on a long term \n     basis. I rent them only when they are needed temporarily or I \n     am not in a situation to purchase at the time. If I do not \n     produce my own perishables or consumables such as food, \n     water, fuel, etc., I try to make sure I have a good supply in \n     case my sources get interrupted. The comparison I am trying \n     to make is if we in the USA have the energy available why do \n     not we develop it and use it. It is like we are renting our \n     energy from someone else and they just raised the rent real \n     high.\n       I am surprised we have not had more problems already with \n     most of our energy coming from other countries. I realize \n     some countries do not have access to large resources of \n     energy and have to rely on other countries to supply it and \n     their ability to decide their future is in great jeopardy. I \n     realize too that some groups of people do not want us to be \n     independent from the rest of the world and therefore try to \n     keep us dependent on other countries as much as possible.\n       The USA has the technology and resources to become \n     completely independent energywise from the rest of the world. \n     Nuclear energy is a proven and very safe energy source of \n     which we have abundant supplies of fuel material, especially \n     if we reprocess our own spent fuel waste. We have vast \n     amounts of coal that can be used in a clean way and converted \n     to petroleum like fuels (synthetic gas and diesel) with the \n     help of nuclear reactors to produce the hydrogen and heat \n     needed. I think there is plenty of room for renewable energy \n     too. We should use all our resources and have a diverse \n     source of energy recovery methods from wind turbines to \n     nuclear energy and yes even coal, oil, and oil shale. \n     Electric cars are the best solution in some cases but not \n     most. Mass transit works in some places but again not all. \n     Strict pollution controls may be needed in Los Angeles but \n     not in most places in Idaho. I guess the beauty of the \n     ``anthropogenic global warming'' crisis (at least for the \n     control-oriented groups) is it says everyone no matter where \n     they live are polluters and need to be regulated and \n     controlled. If you can control someone's resources you can \n     control them and access to energy is needed to develop \n     resources and have freedom.\n       If we can get to the moon and send probes to other planets, \n     we can certainly solve our own energy needs if that were our \n     goal. The problem I see is that that is not the goal of most \n     politicians. Their goal seems to be to breed dependence on \n     the government (and themselves so they can get reelected) and \n     other countries and restrict our freedoms. We go from one \n     crisis to another until they claim they need to have complete \n     control over everything to keep us safe and happy.\n       I believe we have the technology to extract this energy in \n     clean environmentally-friendly ways. I believe we should be \n     drilling offshore and in ANWR. I realize this is not going to \n     do much to the price of gas right now but it is a medium term \n     solution that will influence energy prices in 10-30 years. A \n     long-term solution is to start using more nuclear energy and \n     developing ways to produce transportation fuels from \n     additional resources such as coal or better electric storage \n     devices or hydrogen etc. Suing OPEC sounds like a bullying \n     technique. Why bite the hand that is currently feeding us? If \n     we demonstrated we were serious about becoming more energy \n     independent, I would bet the price of oil would drop fast in \n     hopes that it would discourage us from doing so. What part of \n     the simple economic principle of supply and demand do most \n     politicians not get?\n     Bill, Rexburg.\n                                  ____\n\n       This country has been on a gas-guzzling binge for fifty \n     years. I am sick and tired of hearing people complain about \n     the cost of gas, driving solo in their inefficient cars, and \n     unwilling to carpool or contribute towards mass transit \n     options.\n       We do not need to expand domestic petroleum production. We \n     need to learn conservation and seek alternative energy \n     sources. The ``God given right'' to tear up the landscape for \n     oil and selfish use is at the heart of what is wrong with \n     people and their mind-set on a global scale.\n       Wake up and smell the coffee.\n       Love and light,\n     Pamela.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the invitation to share my views on the \n     energy situation. Although gas prices have increased \n     significantly lately, I do not think times are as tough as \n     the media portrays. My grandparents have experienced far \n     worse times than this current period.\n       Nonetheless, this issue still requires action. I think the \n     best thing Congress can do in the short term is to increase \n     domestic production. This involves several things, \n     specifically getting more refineries built and allowing for \n     drilling in ANWR. I am also a supporter of getting shale oil \n     production started in the US.\n       In the long term, Congress should provide tax credits for \n     those willing to pursue alternative fuels. Nuclear and \n     hydrogen seem like excellent options. I am not in favor of \n     corn-based ethanol and believe it is an inefficient use of \n     our resources.\n       Further, Congress has no basis for establishing a windfall \n     profit tax on oil companies. This is inappropriate government \n     intervention. The consequences would be felt and mostly paid \n     for by consumers. This tax would not be a remedy but a \n     hindrance in solving our situation. Please always oppose any \n     legislation of this form.\n       Thank you for your time. And please act promptly!\n     Jeff.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for taking time to read our story. First, with \n     gas prices on the rise, my husband gets grumpy and grumpier. \n     That means less happiness in our home and our marriage. That \n     is a very personal effect. Our children live in Logan, Utah; \n     Nampa, Idaho; Kirksville, Missouri; and Cleveland, Ohio. High \n     fuel costs mean seeing our family less often, which makes me \n     grumpy. My husband and I miss our grandchildren and children \n     quite a bit. Since we have a business and have to pay for \n     delivery trucks, marketing vehicles and other business costs, \n     such as continuing education, utilities, merchandise, etc.--\n     higher fuel costs means lower profit margins. It would be \n     nice to be able to drive tiny vehicles but the winters are so \n     severe here in Southeastern Idaho, we feel safer in a four-\n     wheel drive unit which, of course, costs more to run. Fuel \n     prices affect the cost of everything we buy, such as food, \n     clothing and shelter. I do believe they are necessary. I am \n     working on my college degree so higher fuel costs make my \n     education costs increase, such as delivery costs for books, \n     teaching materials, etc. We do try to conserve by walking, \n     running errands all at one time but if there is an emergency \n     with any of our family or a business problem it means a \n     greater expense to take care of an emergency.\n       I believe it is time to use what resources are available \n     within the US. I know that conservationists would have us all \n     using horse and buggies again but that is not practical. I \n     believe that there is technology available that would allow \n     us to coexist with wildlife and their habitats and still make \n     use of the petroleum and natural gas deposits that are tied \n     up by conservation laws. Since the ``gas embargo'' of the \n     1970s, I have been uncomfortable that our government has not \n     moved forward to make this great land of ours energy \n     independent.\n       I do worry about nuclear power since I lived through the \n     Three Island Nuclear incident and Chernobyl. If the nuclear \n     industry has improved, I would consider it. I believe in \n     clean-burning coal, biofuel (as long as it does not raise \n     food prices). I would like to see more refineries, more \n     energy efficiency in all sectors of this nation. That would \n     include business, government, homes, etc. There is so much \n     that could be done; recycling (which in Southeastern Idaho is \n     a joke), conservation, technical advances and so much more. \n     It would be wonderful to truly see the government of this \n     nation stop politicking and start working to address the \n     energy problems of this nation. I am not sure I have all the \n     answers but I do realize that human nature makes change hard. \n     It would be great to see our government setting an example \n     for the rest of the nation.\n       Again, thank you for reading this and asking our opinion.\n     Liisa, Rexburg.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not want anecdotes about how we are suffering, I want \n     us to drill everywhere we have oil. Allow the development of \n     the coal oil industry and tell the environmentalists and the \n     democrats to stop trying to destroy this country. I do not \n     want to live in a socialist or communist society and that is \n     where we are heading.\n       Thanks for your time.\n     Mike, Naples.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for asking for input:\n       My father is in an assisted living facility located 120 \n     miles from where I live. 240 total miles / 15 miles per \n     gallon = 16 gallons of gas $4 = $64.

We are \n     not in bad health but still have a lot of doctor's \n     appointments to keep us healthy. We have one car and buy one \n     tank of gas every two weeks. We use our car mainly to do \n     three things: go to church, buy\n\n[[Page S3547]]\n\n     groceries once a week, and go to our doctors--all things to \n     keep us spiritually and physically healthy. Now, with \n     exploding gas prices, caused we feel mainly by the \n     government's lack of action in the past and present, we are \n     having to curtail. Let us see, now we can cut back on church \n     to our spiritual detriment, and we can shop for groceries \n     every other week and extend doctor's appointments to our \n     physical detriment. What will we do in three months, six \n     months, and beyond as gas prices continue to explode, driving \n     up the cost of everything, while the government continues to \n     talk with no action?\n       Okay, what should be done about the oil crisis? Release \n     U.S. oil reserves immediately to both give relief and to \n     sting those in the futures market that are reaping huge \n     profits. With due consideration for the environment, lift the \n     restrictions on drilling off our coasts and drilling in \n     Alaska and other states. Start processing oil shale. As \n     reparations, take half the oil produced in Iraq or at least \n     get a price break on Iraqi oil. Open up the nuclear power \n     industry. Put some sanity behind the development of alternate \n     fuels. Give more than lip service to hybrid and electrical \n     cars. Convince us that government cares about us once again.\n     Jon, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are a retired couple living on less than we use to make. \n     Not only is gas costing us more than we can afford but now we \n     are told that propane will not go down in price as it usually \n     does in the summer. We only have propane for heating and, as \n     you know, it gets cold in Eastern Idaho. To fill our tank, it \n     takes more than $1000 for 500 gallons. Our car takes $50 each \n     time we fill it with gasoline. We have a car that gets about \n     30 miles to the gallon. The price of bread milk and groceries \n     are also getting higher.\n       I know you support the drill here, drill now, spend less \n     and I thank you for that. But unless something is done to \n     help the Americans, someone will have killed their golden \n     goose--the American consumer in the lower and middle class. \n     We are definitely driving less and conserving where we can \n     but I hear how the liberals want to do away with the tax cuts \n     instead of making them permanent. I am a conservative and I \n     have had enough\n     Darrel.\n                                  ____\n\n       First of all I want to thank you for making this forum \n     available. I have lots to say but will try to be brief; you \n     and your staff are busy. I am a flight attendant for Delta \n     Air Lines based in NYC. I live in Horseshoe Bend area and fly \n     to JFK to cross the pond to Europe, working the JFK-Europe \n     flight. Last summer I was able to commute to JFK on the same \n     day I reported to work. Delta is cutting back on flights out \n     of Boise and, since I am an employee, I get on last. This \n     summer it will be harder and harder for me to get to work \n     because Delta is using a lot of regional jets with only 50 \n     and 70 seats to save fuel/Delta flights have 144 seats. Delta \n     is cutting SkyWest (carrier operating the regional jets) \n     flights 15% nationwide. Like most people, I do not get paid \n     until I get to work. I am giving up more of my days off to \n     commute to my job in New York. I certainly hope we can \n     resolve this crisis. I am hoping not only for USA sources for \n     energy but hopeful research and development will be more \n     successful in finding better sources than corn, a low cost \n     food sorely needed in less prosperous countries. Thanks to \n     you and your staff for a great job!\n     Cheri, Horseshoe Bend.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would just like to state that as a result of the higher \n     gas prices, I had to withdraw from the university I was \n     attending, as I commuted half an hour 3 times a week for \n     class. I am no longer enrolled in that college because I \n     could not make the drive. I am a young college student, \n     married and my husband and I just bought our first home. I \n     had to quit attending school because we simply could not \n     afford to put the gas in even my fuel-efficient Toyota \n     Corolla.\n     Tiffany, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       You inquired as to the effect oil prices are having on \n     residents of Idaho. The ones on fixed incomes are having \n     their savings and way of live vanishing. I recently received \n     an e-mail suggesting that our food supply should be geared to \n     a barrel of oil and the profits returned to the American \n     people and farmers. It mentioned that gasoline is eight cents \n     a gallon in Saudi Arabia?\n     Frank, Caldwell.\n                                  ____\n\n       High fuel and food costs are hurting both young and old. \n     While gas prices in Idaho are at or above the national \n     average, our hourly wage remains low. Idahoans can no longer \n     afford to travel more than a few miles to work as the daily \n     cost of gasoline to commute from any rural area to the city \n     (e.g. Nampa/Caldwell to Boise) makes the trip prohibitive. \n     Consequently, I would like to make the following \n     recommendations:\n       1. Immediately end the corn ethanol federal subsidy program \n     that has increased the cost of our food. There is absolutely \n     no merit to this program. It benefits farmers, but the \n     majority of Idaho's citizens and businesses are not farm-\n     related!\n       2. Prohibit refineries from exporting diesel fuel out of \n     U.S. as they are doing now because they can make more money \n     exporting it! Refineries are shifting production from \n     gasoline to diesel fuel, but not for the benefit of the \n     people of the United States.\n     Ralph, Eagle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3547-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO JENNIFER ROTHSCHILD\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish today to honor Jennifer \nRothschild, a fellow Missourian, who recently received the Foundation \nFighting Blindness' Hope and Spirit Award. This award recognizes the \npeople who inspire all of us because of their ability to see literally \nbeyond their vision loss. The award honors the uniquely human qualities \nthat advance the mission of the foundation, and ultimately, the \nbetterment of society.\n  Jennifer Rothschild is a remarkable individual who inspires people to \nrise above their challenges, aspire for the extraordinary, and live \nlife to the fullest just as she has done.\n  Jennifer lost her slight after being diagnosed with a rare, \ndegenerative eye disease. Retinal degenerative diseases affect more \nthan 10 million people in the United States alone, and millions more \nworldwide. This loss of vision was more than a turning point for \nJennifer who had dreams of becoming a commercial artist and cartoonist. \nHowever, she soared above that challenge and found a new path.\n  Jennifer is now a mother, author, speaker, pianist and role model for \nall those who face challenges. She carries her story and message of \nencouragement across the country. In a ``Good Morning America'' \ninterview for her latest of six books, Jennifer said ``If I chose to \nlet blindness be my enemy I would be fighting it my whole life. Maybe \nthis was God's way of giving me a really great gift in a really \ndifficult package.'' It is that optimism and her amazing talent that \ninspired me the evening she received her Hope and Spirit Award.\n  I congratulate Jennifer on this latest achievement and look forward \nto her great work in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3547-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING MARY ELLEN ROZZELL\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I honor Mary Ellen Rozzell, \nformer President of the National Association of Professional Surplus \nLines Offices, NAPSLO, who passed away unexpectedly on March 3, 2009, \nwhile attending a NAPSLO conference in Palm Springs, CA.\n  Mary Ellen was a respected, beloved leader. The president of \nContinental/Marmorstein & Malone Insurance Agency in Paramus, NJ, she \nbegan working in the insurance business with the Marmorstein Agency \nsome 40 years ago. Mary Ellen served as president of New Jersey Surplus \nLines Association, NJSLA, from 1989-1990, and was named as NJSLA \nhonoree of the year in 1992 due to her outstanding contribution to the \nNew Jersey Surplus Lines Industry. She also served on the New Jersey \nInsurance Commissioner's Producer Advisory Council, and with the \nJuvenile Diabetes Foundation.\n  Her warmth, openness, honesty, and good nature made everyone who met \nher feel immediately comfortable. These qualities served her very well \nin life, with family and friends, and in her remarkable career where \nshe rose through the ranks with hard work and honesty. She was always \nprepared for the trials of life and business and the often difficult \ndecisions required by both. She embraced responsibility, expected \naccountability and never failed those who depended on her. All who knew \nher benefited by her example.\n  Her family has established the Mary Ellen Rozzell Foundation for AVM \nResearch so that friends and colleagues might contribute to \narteriovenous malformation research in Mary Ellen's name.\n  I extend my sympathy to her family and those close to her. She will \nbe missed greatly by everyone she touched.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3547-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3547-4", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3547-S3548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages\n\n[[Page S3548]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations \nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3548-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  At 10:14 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 1541.

A resolution approved by the Westchester County, \n     New York Board of Legislators urging Congress to establish a \n     National Clean and Safe Water Trust fund to provide regular \n     infrastructure funding; to the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources.\n\n                           Resolution No. 11\n\n       Whereas, many of our nation's water pipes and sewers were \n     installed in the early part of the 20th century, some as far \n     back as the Civil War; and\n       Whereas, as water systems age and population grows, more \n     and more leaks develop and sewage overflows into our streams, \n     rivers, lakes and ocean, creating serious public health \n     hazards; and\n       Whereas, many communities do not even have sanitary sewer \n     systems and are forced to rely on failing individual septic \n     systems; and\n       Whereas, public health agencies issued more than 20,000 \n     warnings against swimming at beaches on U.S. coasts in 2005, \n     and a majority of beach closings are due to sewage overflows \n     and malfunctioning sewage plants; and\n       Whereas, the Environmental Protection Agency's 2000 \n     Progress in Water Quality Report finds that America could \n     experience stream impairments that predate achievement of \n     secondary treatment standards by 2016 if improvements are not \n     made; and\n       Whereas, the Water Infrastructure Network, the \n     Environmental Protection Agency, and other government \n     agencies report that the cost of presently known wastewater \n     infrastructure construction needs total between $300 billion \n     and $450 billion; and\n       Whereas, the federal government has cut the main source of \n     funding for clean water year after year; and\n       Whereas, the National Research Council recently warned that \n     more water-borne disease outbreaks will occur if substantial \n     investments are not made to improve our water pipes and \n     systems; and\n       Whereas, the President has called for a comprehensive \n     economic recovery package to assist state and local \n     governments in meeting infrastructure needs while stimulating \n     the economy and creating jobs; and\n       Whereas, there are federal trust funds for other major \n     national investment needs like highways and airports, yet the \n     federal government has yet to establish a trust fund to \n     protect something all people need to survive: water; Now \n     therefore be it.\n       Resolved, That the Westchester County Board of Legislators, \n     requests that the incoming Administration prioritize funding \n     for water filtration and distribution and wastewater and \n     stormwater infrastructure in any economic stimulus package; \n     and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Westchester County Board of Legislators, \n     urges Congress to establish a National Clean and Safe Water \n     Trust Fund to provide regular infrastructure funding; and be \n     it further\n       Resolved, That the Clerk of the Board forward a copy of \n     this Resolution to President Barack Obama, Vice President \n     Joseph Biden, New York State Governor David Paterson, United \n     States Senators Charles Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton, \n     and United States Representatives Eliot Engel, Nita Lowey, \n     and John Hall, so that the intent of this Honorable Board be \n     widely known.\n                                  ____\n\n       POM-l2. A resolution adopted by the City of Pembroke Pines, \n     Florida supporting the passage and adoption of an amendment \n     to the Federal regulations allowing for the issuance of tax-\n     exempt bonds to help cities fund their pension obligations; \n     to the Committee on Finance.\n\n                          Resolution No. 3214\n\n       Whereas, in recent years the City of Pembroke Pines, \n     Florida (hereinafter referred to as the ``City'') has issued \n     bonds to help fund its pension obligations; and\n       Whereas, under the current federal regulatory scheme, such \n     bonds are taxable, which results in a higher cost to the City \n     than if they were tax exempt; and\n       Whereas, the City incurs an additional cost of \n     approximately twenty-five percent (25%) as a result of \n     issuing taxable bonds rather than tax-exempt bonds; and\n       Whereas, allowing for a tax-exemption for the issuance of \n     bonds to fund its pension obligations will result in \n     significant savings to the City, and its taxpayers, \n     particularly at a time when the financial stability of cities \n     and counties throughout the State of Florida, as well as the \n     U.S. economy as a whole, is in a period of uncertainty; and\n       Whereas, the City Commission deems it to be in the best \n     interests of the citizens and residents of the City to \n     support an amendment to the federal regulations, as well as \n     any other regulations on the State level, allowing for the \n     issuance of tax-exempt bonds to help cities fund their \n     pension obligations. Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the City Commission of the city of Pembroke \n     Pines, Florida, That:\n       Section 1. The foregoing ``Whereas'' clauses are hereby \n     ratified and confirmed as being true and correct and are \n     hereby made a specific part of this Resolution.\n       Section 2. The City Commission of the City of Pembroke \n     Pines, Florida hereby supports an amendment to the federal \n     regulations allowing for the issuance of tax-exempt bonds to \n     help cities fund their pension obligations.\n       Section 3. All resolutions or parts of resolutions on in \n     conflict herewith be, and the same are hereby repealed to the \n     extent of such conflict.\n       Section 4. If any clause, section, other part or \n     application of this Resolution is held by any court of \n     competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, in \n     part or application, it shall not affect the validity of the \n     remaining portions or applications of this Resolution.\n       Section 5. This Resolution shall become effective \n     immediately upon its passage and adoption.\n\n[[Page S3550]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3550-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3550]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following executive reports of nominations were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. ROCKEFELLER for the Committee on Commerce, Science, \n     and Transportation.\n       * Gary Locke, of Washington, to be Secretary of Commerce.\n       By Mr. LEAHY for the Committee on the Judiciary.\n       Dawn Elizabeth Johnsen, of Indiana, to be an Assistant \n     Attorney General.\n\n  * Nomination was reported with recommendation that it be confirmed \nsubject to the nominee's commitment to respond to requests to appear \nand testify before any duly constituted committee of the Senate.\n  (Nominations without an asterisk were reported with the \nrecommendation that they be confirmed.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3550-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3550-S3551]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mrs. MURRAY (for herself, Mr. Cochran, and Mr. \n             Kaufman):\n       S. 638.

A bill to provide grants to promote financial and economic \nliteracy; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, there are a number of factors that caused \nthe economic recession we are faced with today. All of us know that.\n  We can blame executives on Wall Street, who made reckless choices and \nignored long-term consequences to make a quick profit.\n  We can blame the financial industry regulators, whose lax oversight \nfailed to see the potential risks posed by the new, complex financial \nproducts that Wall Street was selling, and we can point a finger at \nthose in the mortgage industry, who ignored that all bubbles eventually \nburst and that--in the case of housing bubble--the American taxpayers \nwould be left to clean up the mess.\n  But we also need to look a little closer to home as well. The reality \nis that one of the contributing causes of this recession is the fact \nthat too many Americans made poor and very often uninformed financial \nchoices when they bought homes in the last several years.\n  Too many overestimated their own resources, didn't read the fine \nprint, and didn't grasp the terms of their mortgages before signing on \nthe dotted line.\n  In fact, we need to recognize that too many Americans, from college \nstudents to senior citizens, are financially illiterate.\n  The problem is not limited to mortgage holders. Too many Americans \ndon't know how to budget their household expenses, manage their credit \ncard debt, or even pay their bills on time.\n  We need to ensure that we don't get into this situation again, by \ngiving all Americans the skills to make sound financial decisions.\n  We used to say the 3 R's of school are reading, writing, and \narithmetic. Well, I think we need to add a fourth R--resource \nmanagement.\n  That is why today I am introducing legislation that will help ensure \nthat all Americans get the skills they need to make financial decisions \nthat will protect them and their families.\n  The Financial and Economic Literacy Improvement Act of 2009 will \nrequire the Federal Government to step to the plate and become a real \npartner in helping Americans manage their finances and make good \ndecisions about housing, employment, and education.\n  This bipartisan bill, which is cosponsored by Senator Cochran, is \naimed at helping people of all ages. Our goal is to ensure that high \nschool and college students know the pitfalls of signing up for credit \ncards and can make informed decisions about student loans.\n  All young people understand the importance of saving and making smart \ndecisions to ensure a comfortable and dignified retirement and, most \nimportant, that we are taking steps to ensure we do not repeat the \nmisguided and uninformed decisions that have contributed to the \nrecession that we find ourselves in today.\n  Under our bill, the Federal Government will become a strong supporter \nof making financial literacy education a core part of K-12 education.\n  I believe that focusing this effort on young people is critical for \ntwo reasons:\n  One, if we are going to avoid another crisis such as this one, we \nmust begin by teaching the next generation to make smart financial \ndecisions; two, because all signs point to another generation that is \ncoming of age already saddled with debt, and we need to help them \nbefore it is too late.\n  This past Sunday, this article ran on the front page of the Olympian \nnewspaper from my State of Washington. I ask unanimous consent to have \nthis article printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  [From the Olympian, Mar. 15, 2009]\n\n                    Teens Awash in Credit Card Debt\n\n                          (By Les Blumenthal)\n\n       The numbers are startling. More than half of all high \n     school seniors have debit cards and nearly one-third have \n     credit cards.\n       One-third of college students have four credit cards apiece \n     when they graduate, and more than half of graduates have \n     piled up $5,000 each in high-interest debt. The number of 18- \n     to 24-year-olds who have declared bankruptcy has increased 96 \n     percent in 10 years.\n       Surveys show that many of these young people also are \n     financially illiterate: They don't understand such things as \n     interest, minimum payments, credit reports, identity theft or \n     that they might be paying off their school loans for years.\n       The problem isn't just with the young, however. One in five \n     Americans thinks that the most practical way to become rich \n     is to win the lottery.\n\n[[Page S3553]]\n\n       Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., remembers that her kids started \n     receiving credit card applications when they were 16. She \n     said that she repeatedly heard from people, young and old, \n     who wished they knew more about financial matters.\n       Murray will introduce legislation this week that would \n     authorize $1.2 billion in grants over five years to promote \n     financial-literacy education beginning in grade school and \n     stretching into adulthood.\n       ``It's a perfect time to be doing this,'' Murray said.\n       Ben Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, agrees.\n       ``In light of the problems that have arisen in the subprime \n     mortgage market, we are reminded how critically important it \n     is for individuals to become financially literate at an early \n     age so they are better prepared to make decisions and \n     navigate an increasingly complex financial marketplace,'' he \n     said nearly a year ago.\n       Kerry Eickmeyer, 17, a senior at Richland High School in \n     Richland gave up her debit card after about a year when she \n     kept overdrawing her account.\n       ``My mother was getting frustrated,'' she said.\n       She and other students at Richland High must take a class \n     in consumer economics before they can graduate. Eickmeyer \n     said she received credit card offers all the time and \n     shredded them.\n       ``I don't need 10 credit cards,'' she said.\n       Jesus Pedraza, 19, wished he'd been prepared to handle his \n     personal finances when he entered Washington's Tacoma \n     Community College, even though he doesn't have a credit card.\n       ``I thought I was ready, but money is running out faster \n     than I thought,'' Pedraza said.\n       As part of its Human Development 101 class for freshman, \n     Tacoma Community College devotes a section to personal \n     finance. Students track their weekly spending and learn about \n     credit cards, minimum payments, savings plans and \n     investments. James Mendoza, who teaches the class, said he \n     focused on the nuts and bolts of finance.\n       ``We don't expect them to be Warren Buffett, George Soros \n     or any of the big dogs,'' Mendoza said. ``But they need to \n     understand whether a venti mocha is a need or a want.''\n       In the past five years, 17 states added personal finance \n     requirements to their curricula. Last year, former President \n     George W. Bush appointed an Advisory Council on Financial \n     Literacy to work with the private and public sectors to \n     promote financial education. The council is part of the \n     Treasury Department. Its members range from the chairman of \n     Charles Schwab to the leader of Junior Achievement USA.\n       Murray's bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., \n     would provide grants to state education agencies that agreed \n     to establish financial literacy standards and assess how well \n     students were doing in elementary, middle and high school. \n     Nonprofit organizations also would be eligible for grants. In \n     addition, grants would be available to community and four-\n     year colleges to offer financial literacy classes for their \n     students and for older adults.\n       In addition to financial literacy classes offered by school \n     districts, Junior Achievement operates programs in many \n     districts. About 4.5 million young people participate in \n     Junior Achievement programs nationwide.\n       Other programs also are operating in the schools. Founded \n     by a bankruptcy judge in New York, the Credit Abuse \n     Resistance Education program sends bankruptcy judges around \n     the country to high schools to talk about personal finances.\n       Pat Williams, a bankruptcy Judge in Spokane, said that when \n     she walked into a class of 25 or so 10th- or 11th-graders, it \n     wasn't hard for her to spot the five that would end up in \n     bankruptcy in three years.\n       ``They are dealing with so much--cell phones, car \n     insurance, credit cards, debit cards,'' she said. ``It was \n     stunning to them to learn there were late charges on a credit \n     card bill.''\n       High school and college students can end up paying for \n     their lack of financial knowledge, said Pam Whalley, the \n     director of the Center for Economic Education at Western \n     Washington University. One survey of high school students \n     found that they expected to earn an average of $143,000 a \n     year and were confident they could handle the money but that \n     few knew how to do a budget. College students know little \n     about savings, insurance and retirement, and are lured to \n     credit card deals too easily, she said.\n       ``College kids will do anything for a T-shirt,'' Whalley \n     said.\n       In the middle of a recession, she said, educating students \n     about financial matters is crucial.\n       ``If you make a mistake during a recession, you have less \n     to fall back on,'' she said. ``If you make a mistake when \n     your job isn't safe, you could lose your house or your car. \n     When you have financial literacy, you have more control over \n     your life.''\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the article discusses the legislation I \nam introducing today. It also talks about the financial path that the \nnext generation is currently on. The article pointed out that, right \nnow, one-third of our college students have four credit cards when they \ngraduate. More than half of our graduates have piled up $5,000 each in \nhigh interest debt. The number of 18 to 24-year-olds who have declared \nbankruptcy has almost doubled in 10 years.\n  That article also points out that many of our young people are \nfinancially illiterate. They understand very little about concepts such \nas interest or minimum payments or credit reports and the financial \nreality of having to pay off their student loans for years to come.\n  Today, with many of our schools struggling to pay teachers and \nmaintain their current programs, a lot of our State and local \ngovernments cannot afford to ramp up financial literacy education right \nnow. That is exactly where I believe the Federal Government needs to \nstep up. We cannot afford for our young people to not understand their \nown finances.\n  Our bill will authorize $125 million annually to go to State and \nlocal education agencies and their partnerships with organizations \nexperienced in providing high-quality financial literacy and economic \ninstruction.\n  This funding we will provide will help make financial and economic \nliteracy a part of core academic classes, develop financial literacy \nstandards and testing benchmarks, and provide critical teacher \ntraining.\n  This bill will also help schools weave financial concepts into basic \nclasses, such as math and social studies.\n  Importantly, this training will not end in high school. Our bill \nmakes the same $125 million investment in teaching financial literacy \nin our 2- and 4-year colleges.\n  That is critical. My constituents often write or tell me about the \nfinancial trouble they are struggling with. A lot of them are very \ndesperate for help. They got into situations they didn't understand, \nand they don't have the resources to fix.\n  For example, one woman from Olympia, who put off credit card bills to \npay her mortgage, wrote to me and said:\n\n       I am educated, but was unaware that by being late on a \n     payment or by skipping a payment and trying to make it up, my \n     interest rate could skyrocket to over 26 percent, and late \n     fees could be exponential.\n\n  Whether it is skyrocketing interest rates or credit cards or an \nadjustable rate mortgage that somebody can no longer afford or a \nretirement plan that they don't understand, I often hear the same thing \nfrom people: I wish someone had taught this to me in high school.\n  This bill we are introducing ensures that we are teaching it in our \nschools, and it will help people learn the basic skills that will give \nthem a leg up when they are dealing with their bankers.\n  This crisis we are in cost us dearly. Every weekend when I go home I \nhear about another business that is closing or another family who \ncannot pay their bills. But we know if we make changes and smart \ninvestments, we can move our country forward. I believe this is one of \nthose smart investments. In January, after President Obama took office, \nhe called for an era of personal responsibility. I believe our bill \nhelps Americans to usher in that era.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a look at the bill and cosponsor it \nand help us move it forward so we can make sure that we have a \nfinancially literate country.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. GRASSLEY:\n  S. 641. A bill to amend the Controlled Substances Act to prevent the \nabuse of dehydroepiandrosterone, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I remain very concerned about the \ncontinuing prevalence of performance-enhancing drugs in sports. The \nongoing reports of the vast use of performance-enhancing drugs in \nprofessional sports, especially Major League Baseball, illustrate the \npresence of a disturbing culture throughout all sports. It is becoming \nall too common to read not only about professional athletes using \nperformance-enhancing drugs, but also college and high school athletes \nturning to these substances to gain a competitive edge. Although \nCongress passed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act to disrupt this cycle \nof abuse in 2004, we cannot relent in our efforts to keep performance-\nenhancing drugs out of our society and away from our children.\n  The dietary supplement, Dehydroepiandrosterone, DHEA, is readily\n\n[[Page S3554]]\n\navailable online and on the shelves of nutritional stores, but can be \nused as a performance-enhancing substance. In response to the growing \nuse of performance-enhancing drugs in professional sports, Congress \npassed the Anabolic Steroid Control Act in 2004. When this bill was \nbeing considered, DHEA was among 23 anabolic steroids that are now \nschedule III controlled substances. Some of my colleagues objected to \nDHEA being included on this list, because they believed DHEA was \nharmless and did not have the same anabolic effects as the other \nsteroids on the list. DHEA was subsequently removed from the bill, but \nthe facts do not back up the claims that DHEA is not a performance-\nenhancing drug or harmless.\n  According to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, DHEA is a pre-cursor \nhormone to androstenedione and testosterone. These substances became \nillegal anabolic steroids as a result of the Anabolic Steroid Control \nAct of 2004. Although the body naturally produces DHEA, the natural \nproduction of the hormone ceases around the age of 35. Many people over \nthis age use DHEA, in low doses, as part of an ``anti-aging'' regimen. \nHowever, when taken in high doses over time, DHEA, like its other \nrelatives in the steroid family, may cause liver damage and cancer. In \nfact, one study conducted by scientists at Oxford University revealed \nDHEA use to be strongly associated with breast cancer development. The \ntruth is there are few studies about the long term effects DHEA has on \nthe body. According to Dr. F. Clark Holmes, Director of Sports Medicine \nat Georgetown University, many proposed studies involving high doses of \nDHEA are denied approval out of concern that the product may cause \nirreversible harm to human subjects. Because DHEA is marketed as a \ndietary supplement, companies are not required to prove their safety to \nthe Food and Drug Administration. However, nearly all the professional \nsports leagues, the Olympics and the NCAA have banned their athletes \nfrom using it for good reason.\n  What is even more disturbing is the fact that DHEA is being marketed \nonline to younger athletes. One bodybuilding website, directed towards \nteenagers, features a teen bodybuilder of the week to promote \nperformance-enhancing supplements. A 19-year-old Junior National \nChampion bodybuilder is one of the bodybuilders on this website. When \nasked what supplement gave him the greatest gains for his competition \nthis teenager replied, ``DHEA.'' In another website, DHEA is advertized \nas follows, ``If you're a bodybuilder, and want to increase lean body \nmass at the expense of body fat, actual studies show this supplement \nmay significantly alter body composition, favoring lean mass accrual.'' \nAnother example on another website describes DHEA in this way, ``DHEA \nis HOT, and you will see why. As a pre-cursor hormone, it leads to the \nproduction of other hormones. When this compound is supplemented, it \nhas shown to have awesome effects.'' These advertisements are geared to \nthe younger crowd, even though DHEA has no legitimate use for \nteenagers.\n  These DHEA advertisements, and others like it, are having some impact \non young athletes, especially in my state of Iowa. The Iowa Orthopaedic \nJournal published a study on nutritional supplement use in 20 Northwest \nIowa high schools. In this study, 495 male football players and 407 \nfemale volleyball players were asked if they used nutritional \nsupplements. The results of this anonymous survey revealed that 8 \npercent of football players and 2 percent of Volleyball players used \nsupplements. These students identified DHEA as one of the supplements \nthat they used. The students were then asked to give the reason why \nthey used DHEA and the general response was ``for performance \nenhancement.''\n  We have to find a way to keep young people from using a substance \nthat can do them harm. Three states currently prohibit the sale of DHEA \nto minors. There are also various supplement stores like GNC and \nWalgreens that have policies in place that prohibit the sale of DHEA to \nanyone under 18. If we cannot place DHEA behind the counter, then we \nshould at least make it difficult for teens to walk out of a store with \na potentially harmful substance in hand. This is why I'm pleased to \nintroduce the DHEA Abuse Reduction Act of 2009. This bill will place a \nnationwide restriction on the sale of DHEA for those under 18 years of \nage. It will also allow those who use DHEA, legitimately, to not have \nto obtain a prescription to do so. The Coalition for Anabolic Steroid \nPrecursor and Ephedra Regulation, which is comprised of the Nation's \nleading medical, public health and sports organizations support this \nlegislation. The U.S. Anti-Doping Agency also supports this legislation \nto keep DHEA away from our children. I urge my colleagues to pass this \nlegislation.\n  In the highly competitive world of sports, the pressure to use \nperformance-enhancing drugs can be overwhelming. Even though we, as a \nsociety, demand excellence from our favorite teams and athletes, we \ncannot accept this excellence to be falsely aided by a drug. \nFurthermore, we cannot allow harmful drugs to destroy the health of so \nmany young and promising athletes. We have to continue to curb the use \nof performance-enhancing drugs for the health of our country and \nchildren.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 647. A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to improve the transparency of information on skilled nursing \nfacilities and nursing facilities and to clarify and improve the \ntargeting of the enforcement of requirements with respect to such \nfacilities; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Nursing Home \nTransparency and Improvement Act of 2009.\n  My colleague, Senator Grassley, and I have worked on this legislation \ntogether. He is on the floor now and will speak of the bill when I \nfinish my comments.\n  As chairman of the Special Committee on Aging, the quality of care \nthat is provided to nursing home residents is of great concern to me, \nand I am proud to introduce this bill with Senator Grassley today.\n  I have worked with Senator Grassley on nursing home policy for \nseveral years. We have commissioned GAO reports, sought input from both \nindustry and reform advocates, and collaborated with the executive \nbranch on various initiatives. This work has generated some positive \nresults, such as the government's new five-star nursing home rating \nsystem.\n  But we must do more. We believe the bill we introduce today will \nraise the bar for nursing home quality and oversight nationwide, by \nstrengthening the Federal Government's ability to monitor and advance \nthe level of care provided in nursing domes. for up to five minutes.\n  First, our bill would give the Government better tools for enforcing \nhigh quality standards. For instance, nursing homes would be required \nto disclose information about all the principal business partners who \nplay a role in the financing and management of the facility, so that \nthe Government can hold them accountable in the case of poor care or \nneglect. It would also create a national independent monitor pilot \nprogram to tackle tough quality and safety issues that must be \naddressed at the level of corporate management.\n  Second, our bill would give consumers more information about \nindividual nursing homes and their track record of care. Our bill would \ngrant consumers access to a facility's most recent health and safety \nreport online, and would develop a simple, standardized online \ncomplaint form for residents and their families to ensure that their \nconcerns are addressed swiftly. And it would require the Government to \ncollect staffing information from nursing homes on a real-time basis, \nand make this information available to the public.\n  Finally, our bill would encourage homes to improve on their own. \nUnder this legislation, facilities would develop compliance and ethics \nprograms to decrease the risk of financial fraud, and quality assurance \nstandards to internally monitor the quality of care provided to \nresidents. We also authorize funds for a national demonstration project \non ``culture change,'' a new management style in nursing home care that \nrethinks relationships between management and frontline workers by \nempowering nursing aides to take charge of the personalized care of\n\n[[Page S3555]]\n\nresidents. Finally, our bill makes an investment in nursing home staff \nby offering training on how to handle residents with dementia.\n  Twenty-two years have passed since Congress last addressed the safety \nand quality of America's nursing homes in a comprehensive way. As we \nprepare to debate reforms across our health care system, there has \nnever been a better time to implement these critical improvements to \nour nation's system of nursing homes. We ask our colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  Madam President, I turn now to Senator Grassley, with whom I worked \ndiligently with a great effort and with tremendous results. He is a man \nI have enjoyed working with across the aisle now for many years. He is \na high-quality guy. It is in that respect and with that regard that I \nturn to him now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I thank the Senator for his kind \nwords. I have had an opportunity to work with him not only on \nlegislation of this type but a lot of other pieces of legislation, and \nI enjoy working with him because he is a person of great common sense. \nI thank him for his leadership in this area, and, more importantly, I \nthank him for serving in the outstanding position as chairman of the \nSpecial Committee on Aging, with a lot of responsibilities in the area \nof making sure aging problems are brought to the forefront.\n  This legislation we are introducing is called the Nursing Home \nTransparency and Improvement Act. It brings to the surface some very \nimportant issues he is watching as chairman of the Aging Committee. I \nhave some interaction with it because I am a member of the Finance \nCommittee.\n  This is a critical piece of legislation that brings overdue \ntransparency to consumers regarding nursing home quality and \noperations. It also provides long needed improvements to our \nenforcement system.\n  In America today, there are well over 1.7 million elderly and \ndisabled individuals in over 17,000 nursing home facilities. As the \nbaby boom generation enters retirement, this number is going to rise \ndramatically. While many people are using alternatives, such as \ncommunity-based care, nursing homes are going to remain a critical \noption for elderly and disabled populations.\n  As the ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, I have a \nlongstanding commitment to ensuring that nursing home residents receive \nthe safe and quality care we expect for our loved ones. Why? Because \nthe taxpayers put in tens of billions of dollars--I would imagine over \n$47 billion or $48 billion now, and maybe that figure is higher than \nthe last time I looked, but it is billions of dollars. Our Aging \nCommittee and all of Congress have a special responsibility to make \nsure that money is spent well, and one way of spending it well is to \nmake sure it delivers quality care to these people who are in need.\n  Unfortunately, as in many areas, with nursing homes, a few bad apples \noften spoil the barrel. Too many Americans receive poor care, often in \na subset of nursing homes. Unfortunately, this subset of chronic \noffenders stays in business, often keeping their poor track records \nhidden from the public at large and often facing little or no oversight \nor enforcement from the Federal Government, based on laws that were \npassed in 1986 and 1987.\n  There is a lack of transparency, a lack of accountability, and \nsometimes in our approach to nursing homes, quite simply, a lack of \ncommon sense--the sort of common sense the Senator from Wisconsin \nalways exhibits in the legislative approach. These are things this \nlegislation seeks to bring to nursing homes and their residents--\ntransparency, accountability, and common sense.\n  Let's look at transparency. In the market for nursing home care, as \nin all markets, consumers must often have adequate information to make \ninformed choices. For years, people looking at a nursing home for \nthemselves or their loved ones had no way of knowing a nursing home \nfacility's record of care, inspection history, or which individuals \nwere ultimately responsible for caring for their loved ones.\n  This bill is intended to change that and to emphasize this point \nabout why we have to be concerned about the type of facility in which a \nperson is placed.\n  I have never once in my life run into a single elderly or disabled \nperson who said to me: I am dying to get into a nursing home. This is \non the continuum care, the stop where people cannot be taken care of \nbeforehand. We need to make sure that is right.\n  This legislation requires nursing facilities to make available \nownership information, including the individuals and entities that are \nultimately responsible for a home's operation and management.\n  Today when I am discussing this bill with people in the industry, I \ndon't have anybody objecting who actually owns a nursing home. But \nearly on, that seemed to be something that, for some reason or another, \ndid not seem to be anybody's business. Tell me it isn't anybody's \nbusiness who owns a nursing home if they are receiving $45 billion to \n$50 billion of taxpayer money going to that industry. That ownership is \nvery important.\n  How nursing homes are staffed can greatly affect the care they \nprovide, especially when dealing with complex conditions, such as \nnursing homes. So you go behind who owns a nursing home, who is working \nthere, and that is pretty important. If you do not have all this \ninformation, it leaves residents and their families without clear \ninformation about who is ultimately responsible for ensuring that a \nresident is consistently provided with high-quality care.\n  This provides transparency, as well, concerning nursing home staffing \nand surveys. Homes differ widely in terms of the number of specialized \nstaff available to residents, as well as the number of registered \nnurses and certified nursing assistants who provide much hands-on care.\n  Let me say it a second time. How a nursing home is staffed can \ngreatly affect the care it provides, especially when dealing with \ncomplex cases. This legislation requires better tracking of this \ninformation and requires that this information is available to \nprospective residents and their families.\n  In addition, this legislation will help families have a better idea \nof a nursing home's track record in that it requires better \ntransparency for nursing home inspection reports that are completed on \na routine basis.\n  The Secretary will also now be required to provide consumers with a \nsummary of information on enforcement actions taken against a facility \nduring the previous 3 years.\n  This same transparency will also provide additional market incentives \nfor poor homes to improve. If customers know about problems, that home \nis incentivized to improve or face going out of business.\n  This effort also requires a strong, effective enforcement and \nmonitoring system to ensure safe and quality care at facilities that \nwill not take the necessary steps voluntarily. But even with improved \ntransparency, there are some nursing homes that will not improve on \ntheir own.\n  In the nursing home industry, most homes provide quality care on a \nvery consistent basis. So we need to give inspectors better enforcement \ntools.\n  The current system provides incentives to correct problems only \ntemporarily and allows homes to avoid regulatory sanctions while \ncontinuing to deliver substandard care to residents. This system must \nbe fixed.\n  Last year, CMS requested two things: one, statutory authority to \ncollect civil monetary penalties sooner, and, two, the ability to hold \nthose penalties in escrow pending appeal.\n  To that end, this bill requires nursing homes that have been found in \nviolation of law be given the opportunity to participate in an \nindependent, informal dispute resolution process within 30 days. After \nthat point, depending on the outcome of the appeal, the penalties are \ncollected and held in escrow pending the exhaustion of the appeals \nprocess. This will ensure that nursing homes found to be violating the \nrules actually pay the penalties assessed if it is determined those \npenalties are appropriate. But we should not have to resort to \nenforcement. Problems resulting in penalties should be avoided or \ndetected and fixed immediately by the nursing home in the first place. \nThat is why this bill now requires all nursing homes to have compliance \nand ethics programs, as well as quality assurance and performance \nimprovement programs.\n\n[[Page S3556]]\n\n  In addition to increased transparency and improved enforcement, this \nbill provides commonsense solutions to a number of other problems.\n  This legislation requires the Secretary of HHS to establish a \nnational independent monitoring program to tackle problems specific to \ninterstate and large intrastate nursing chains.\n  In the case of nursing homes being closed due to poor safety or \nquality of care, this bill requires that residents and their \nrepresentatives be given sufficient notice so they can adequately plan \na transfer to an appropriate setting.\n  We need to be very sensitive--and I am very sensitive--to the fact \nthat nursing home residents are often elderly and fragile. Moving them \ninto a new facility is traumatic. So we have to make sure these \nresidents are transferred appropriately and with adequate time and \ncare.\n  This bill also aims to help nursing homes that self-report their \nconcerns and remedy certain deficiencies, giving those homes that are \ntrying to do their best and find things wrong on their own to get \ncredit for that. By doing so, nursing homes then may have any penalties \nreduced by 50 percent. This will encourage facilities to take the lead \nin finding, flagging, and fixing violations.\n  This bill is also intended to strengthen training requirements for \nnursing staff by including dementia and abuse prevention training as \npart of pre-employment.\n  I am proud to introduce this bill along with my friend Senator Kohl. \nThe Committee on Aging and I have a long history of working together on \nelderly care issues, and I am happy to continue that work.\n  I also note today the Government Accountability Office is releasing a \nreport critical of CMS's funding of State oversight entities, such as \nnursing homes. This report notes that survey activity is sometimes so \nunreliable that certain homes have not even been inspected in more than \n6 years. The report makes a number of recommendations to CMS, and I \nwill be looking very carefully at how CMS follows those \nrecommendations. In the meantime, it is important that we improve \ntransparency and accountability for the inspections that are taking \nplace.\n  We will continue to do everything we can to make sure that American \nnursing home residents receive the safe and quality care they deserve. \nIncreasing transparency, improving enforcement tools, strengthening \ntraining requirements will go a long way toward achieving that goal. I \nthank, once again, Senator Kohl.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 648. a bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nestablish a prospective payment system instead of the reasonable cost-\nbased reimbursement method for Medicare-covered services provided by \nFederally qualified health centers and to expand the scope of such \ncovered services to account for expansions in the scope of services \nprovided by Federally qualified health centers since the inclusion of \nsuch services for coverage under the Medicare program; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. president, I rise today with Senators Snowe and \nSanders to introduce the Medicare Access to Community Health Centers, \nMATCH, Act of 2009.\n  This legislation addresses a long standing payment issue experienced \nby a key component of our Nation's health care safety net, community \nhealth centers. These centers provide high quality, comprehensive care \nand serve as the medical home to 18 millions individuals. Over one \nmillion of those patients are medicare beneficiaries.\n  Over 15 years ago, Congress created the Federally Qualified Health \nCenter, FQHC, Medicare benefit to ensure that health centers were not \nforced to subsidize Medicare payments with Federal grant dollars. \nCongress required that centers be paid their reasonable costs for \nproviding care to their Medicare patients. The centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS, later established a per visit payment cap in \nregulations based on a payment cap applicable to Rural Health Clinics. \nCMS applied the cap to FQHCs without much data support and with the \npromise of future reviews to guarantee that Health Centers were \nadequately reimbursed. However, these reviews have not taken place. \nCurrently, over 75 percent of health centers are losing money serving \nMedicare beneficiaries, with losses totaling over $50 million annually \naccording to an analysis done by the National Association of Community \nHealth Centers, NACHC. In my home State of New Mexico, NACHC estimates \nthat health centers lose more than a million dollars annually.\n  I have repeatedly asked CMS to review this antiquated cap but I have \nhad little success. So I rise today to introduce legislation to improve \nthe medicare payment mechanism for FQHCs. The MATCH Act will establish \na Prospective Payment System for FQHCs, based on the actual cost of \nproviding care to health center patients. This new mechanism mirrors \nthe successful Medicaid FQHC Prospective Payment System. By reforming \nthe payment structure at FQHCs, we will ensure health centers are able \nto dedicate their Federal grant dollars for their original intent--\nproviding care to the uninsured. This new mechanism will also increase \nefficiency and stability in the Medicare program for health centers.\n  This legislation is long overdue. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nstrengthening the medicare FQHC program to ensure that health centers \ncan continue to provide high quality, affordable primary and preventive \ncare to our Nation's seniors and people with disabilities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 648\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Medicare Access to Community \n     Health Centers (MATCH) Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that:\n       (1) National importance.--Community health centers serve as \n     the medical home and family physician to over 16,000,000 \n     people nationally. Patients of community health centers \n     represent 1 in 7 low-income persons, 1 in 8 uninsured \n     Americans, 1 in 9 Medicaid beneficiaries, 1 in 10 minorities, \n     and 1 in 10 rural residents.\n       (2) Health care safety net.--Because Federally qualified \n     health centers (FQHCs) are generally located in medically \n     underserved areas, the patients of Federally qualified health \n     centers are disproportionately low income, uninsured or \n     publicly insured, and minorities, and they frequently have \n     poorer health and more complicated, costly medical needs than \n     patients nationally. As a chief component of the health care \n     safety net, Federally qualified health centers are required \n     by regulation to serve all patients, regardless of insurance \n     status or ability to pay.\n       (3) Medicare beneficiaries.--Medicare beneficiaries are \n     typically less healthy and, therefore, costlier to treat than \n     other patients of Federally qualified health centers. \n     Medicare beneficiaries tend to have more complex health care \n     needs as--\n       (A) more than half of Medicare patients have at least 2 \n     chronic conditions;\n       (B) 45 percent take 5 or more medications; and\n       (C) over half of Medicare beneficiaries have more than 1 \n     prescribing physician.\n       (4) Need to improve fqhc payment.--While the Centers for \n     Medicare & Medicaid Services have nearly 15 years' worth of \n     cost report data from Federally qualified health centers, \n     which would equip the agency to develop a new Medicare \n     reimbursement system, the agency has failed to update and \n     improve the Medicare FQHC payment system.\n\n     SEC. 3. EXPANSION OF MEDICARE-COVERED PRIMARY AND PREVENTIVE \n                   SERVICES AT FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTERS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1861(aa)(3) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(aa)(3)) is amended to read as follows:\n       ``(3) The term `Federally qualified health center services' \n     means--\n       ``(A) services of the type described in subparagraphs (A) \n     through (C) of paragraph (1), and such other ambulatory \n     services furnished by a Federally qualified health center for \n     which payment may otherwise be made under this title if such \n     services were furnished by a health care provider or health \n     care professional other than a Federally qualified health \n     center; and\n       ``(B) preventive primary health services that a center is \n     required to provide under section 330 of the Public Health \n     Service Act,\n\n     when furnished to an individual as a patient of a Federally \n     qualified health center and such services when provided by a \n     health care provider or health care professional employed by \n     or under contract with a Federally qualified health center \n     and for this purpose, any reference to a rural health clinic \n     or a\n\n[[Page S3557]]\n\n     physician described in paragraph (2)(B) is deemed a reference \n     to a Federally qualified health center or a physician at the \n     center, respectively.

Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Bingaman to \nintroduce legislation to rectify a long standing problem for community \nhealth centers and the millions of Americans who depend on them for \nprimary care access. Health centers serve as the medical home for over \n18 million underserved patients. Annually, over 1.2 million of those \npatients are Medicare beneficiaries and 8.5 million patients are living \nbelow the Federal poverty level. Health centers are known for providing \nhigh quality, comprehensive care to some of our nation's most \nvulnerable populations.\n  Over 17 years ago, Congress created the Federally Qualified Health \nCenter, FQHC, Medicare benefit to ensure that health centers were not \nforced to subsidize Medicare payments with Federal grant dollars. \nTherefore, Congress required that centers be paid their reasonable \ncosts for providing care to their Medicare patients. The Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, later established a per visit \npayment cap in regulations based on a payment cap applicable to rural \nhealth clinics. CMS applied the cap to FQHCs with the promise of future \nreviews to guarantee that health centers were adequately reimbursed. \nHowever, CMS has failed to update payments.\n  Today, the majority of health centers are losing money serving \nMedicare beneficiaries, causing them to use their Federal grant \ndollars, intended for care for the uninsured, to supplement Medicare \npayments. These losses exceed $50 million annually according to an \nanalysis completed by the National Association of Community Health \nCenters.\n  We have repeatedly requested that CMS review this antiquated payment \nstructure with little success. So I rise today again with Senator \nBingaman to see that FQHCs receive payment for services they provide. \nThis bill will establish a prospective payment system for FQHCs, based \non the actual cost of providing care to health center patients. This \nnew mechanism mirrors the successful Medicaid FQHC prospective payment \nsystem. By reforming the payment structure at FQHCs, we will ensure \nthat health centers are able to dedicate their Federal grant dollars \nfor their originally intended purpose--providing care to the uninsured.\n  This legislation is long overdue. I ask my colleagues to join me in \nstrengthening the Medicare FQHC program to make certain that health \ncenters can continue to provide high quality, affordable primary and \npreventive care to our Nation's seniors and people with disabilities.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Nelson of Florida, and \n        Mr. Wicker):\n  S. 649. A bill to require an inventory of radio spectrum bands \nmanaged by the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration and the Federal Communications Commission; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senator Kerry, to \nintroduce legislation that initiates the first step toward \ncomprehensive spectrum policy reform, which is long overdue and \nparamount to achieving the long-term telecommunications needs of this \nnation. In addressing comprehensive spectrum reform, the first thing we \nmust do is to have a clear understanding of how the spectrum is \ncurrently being utilized, which is called for by the Radio Spectrum \nInventory Act.\n\n[[Page S3558]]\n\n  Specifically, the Radio Spectrum Inventory Act directs the National \nTelecommunications and Information Administration and the Federal \nCommunications Commission, with assistance from the Office of Science \nand Technology, to create a comprehensive and accurate inventory of \neach spectrum band between 300 Megahertz to 3.5 Gigahertz. The \ninformation collected would include the licenses assigned in that band, \nthe number and type of end-user devices deployed, the amount of \ndeployed infrastructure, as well as any relevant unlicensed end user \ndevices operating in the band. This information is fundamental to \nconstructing a comprehensive framework for spectrum policy.\n  The Radio Spectrum Inventory Act also provides more transparency \nrelated to spectrum use by creating a centralized website or portal \nthat would include relevant spectrum and license information accessible \nby the public. Given that radio spectrum is a public good, we are \nobligated to provide the public more clarity and accountability on how \nit is being utilized by both federal and non-federal licensees. It \nshould be noted that this bill does make certain disclosure exceptions \nfor spectrum being used or reserved for national security.\n  The ultimate goals this legislation sets the path towards achieving \nare to implement more efficient use of spectrum and to locate \nadditional spectrum that could be auctioned and used for advanced \ncommunications and data services in order to meet the growing demand.\n  Currently, there are more than 270 million wireless subscribers in \nthe US, and consumers used more than 2.2 trillion minutes of use from \nJuly 2007 to June 2008--that is more than 6 billion minutes of use a \nday! While voice communications is the foundation for wireless \nservices, more and more subscribers are utilizing it for broadband due \nto new emerging wireless technologies.\n  More specifically, the FCC reported that from December 2005 to \nDecember 2007, mobile wireless high-speed subscribership grew \nnationwide by more than 1,500 percent, and added 15.6 million \nsubscribers in the second half of 2007 alone. The report also shows \nthat new wireless broadband subscribers accounted for 78 percent of the \ntotal growth in broadband during that same time.\n  So it is clear this once nascent service, which was initially thought \nof as a luxury, has blossomed into a tool that millions of consumers \nand countless businesses use on a daily basis. Increased mobility, \naccess, and productivity are all tangible results of wireless \ntechnology. It is estimated that the productivity value of all mobile \nwireless services was worth $185 billion in 2005.\n  But with all this growth, we are seeing constraints--spectrum is \nalready a scarce resource--there is no new spectrum to allocate, only \nredistribute. This problem is also compounded by issues such as \nShannon's Law, which defines the maximum possible data speed that can \nbe obtained in a data channel of a communications network. So with \nwireless, in order to achieve greater bandwidth speeds and capacity, \nmore channels have to be assigned, which means more spectrum has to be \nallocated. Therefore, finding additional spectrum is essential to \nmeeting the growing demands and needs of consumers and businesses \nalike.\n  Just as with the Internet, we have only scratched the surface on what \nthe future of wireless will bring to all areas of life. That is why we \nmust be proactive in advancing supportive spectrum policy and spectrum \navailability. And this begins with the first step--complete an accurate \ninventory of what is out there and how it is being used. Once we have \nthat information, we can then perform the necessary analysis of where \nadditional spectrum could be found and allocated toward broadband and \nadvanced communications services. That is why I sincerely hope that my \ncolleagues join Senators Kerry, Nelson, Wicker, and me in supporting \nthis critical legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 650. A bill to abolish the death penalty under Federal law; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Federal Death \nPenalty Abolition Act of 2009. This bill would abolish the death \npenalty at the Federal level. It would put an immediate halt to Federal \nexecutions and forbid the imposition of the death penalty as a sentence \nfor violations of Federal law.\n  Since 1976, when the death penalty was reinstated by the Supreme \nCourt, there have been 1,130 executions across the country, including \nthree at the Federal level. During that same time period, 130 people on \ndeath row have been exonerated and released from death row. Consider \nthose numbers: 1,130 executions and 130 exonerations in the modern \ndeath penalty era. Had those exonerations not taken place, had those \n130 people been executed, those executions would have represented an \nerror rate of nearly eleven percent. That is more than an embarrassing \nstatistic; it is a horrifying one, one that should have us all \nquestioning the use of capital punishment in this country. In fact, \nsince 1999 when I first introduced this bill, 54 death row inmates have \nbeen exonerated throughout the country.\n  In the face of these numbers, the national debate on the death \npenalty has intensified. The country experienced a nationwide \nmoratorium on executions from September 2007 to May 2008 while the U.S. \nSupreme Court considered whether the lethal injection method of \nexecution complied with the Constitution. From 2004 to 2007 the number \nof executions and the number of death sentences imposed decreased as \nmore and more voices joined to express doubt about the use of capital \npunishment in America. The voices of those questioning the fairness of \nthe death penalty have been heard from college campuses and courtrooms \nand podiums across the Nation, to the Senate Judiciary Committee \nhearing room, to the United States Supreme Court. The American public \nunderstands that the death penalty raises serious and complex issues. \nIn fact, for the first time, a May 2006 Gallup poll reported that more \nAmericans prefer a sentence of life without parole over the death \npenalty when given a choice. The same poll indicates that 63 percent of \nAmericans think that within the past 5 years an innocent person has \nbeen executed. And a 2008 Gallop shows a 5 percent drop in support for \nthe death penalty from October 2007 to October 2008. If anything, the \nconsensus is that it is time for a change. We must not ignore these \nvoices.\n  The United States Supreme Court also has limited the constitutionally \npermissible scope of the death penalty in recent years. In 2008 the \nCourt held in Kennedy vs. Louisiana that with respect to ``crimes \nagainst individuals the death penalty should not be expanded to \ninstances where the victim's life was not taken.'' This decision is \nconsistent with other recent cases in which the U.S. Supreme Court has \nheld that the execution of juvenile offenders and the mentally retarded \nis unconstitutional.\n  On the state level, there have been some encouraging developments. \nMost significantly, just last night, Governor Bill Richardson of New \nMexico signed legislation into law that repeals the death penalty in \nhis state. I commend Governor Richardson for his leadership and courage \nin signing this bill. Governor Richardson issued a statement after he \nsigned the bill that gets to the heart of this issue. His statement \nread, in part:\n\n       The sad truth is the wrong person can still be convicted in \n     this day and age, and in cases where that conviction carries \n     with it the ultimate sanction, we must have ultimate \n     confidence I would say certitude that the system is without \n     flaw or prejudice. Unfortunately, this is demonstrably not \n     the case . . .\n\n  Last year New Jersey to legislatively repealed its death penalty \nstatute after a state commission reported that the death penalty ``is \ninconsistent with evolving standards of decency'' and recommended \nabolition. In New York, the death penalty was overturned by a court \ndecision in 2004 and has not been reinstated by the legislature. While \nKansas and New Hampshire still technically have the death penalty on \ntheir books, they have not executed anyone since 1976.\n  Other States have created commissions that have identified serious \nproblems with their capital punishment systems. In Maryland, a 23-\nmember commission tasked with studying all\n\n[[Page S3559]]\n\naspects of the State's capital punishment system voted on November 12, \n2008, to recommend abolition of the State's death penalty. The \nCommission cited as reasons the possibility that an innocent person \ncould be mistakenly executed, as well as geographical and racial \ndisparities in its application. The chair of the commission, a former \nUnited States Attorney General, stated simply, ``It's haphazard in how \nit's applied, and that's terribly unfair.''\n  This past June, the California Commission on the Fair Administration \nof Justice completed its review of the California capital punishment \nsystem. It found, unanimously and not surprisingly, that the death \npenalty system in California is broken and in need of repair. North \nCarolina and Tennessee are also in the midst of studies of their \nrespective death penalty systems.\n  Of course the state that started it all was Illinois, where on \nJanuary 31, 2000, then-Governor George Ryan took the historic step of \nplacing a moratorium on executions and creating an independent, blue \nribbon commission to review the State's death penalty system. That \ncommission conducted an extensive study of the death penalty in \nIllinois and released a report with 85 recommendations for reform. The \ncommission concluded that the death penalty system is not fair, and \nthat the risk of executing the innocent is alarmingly real. Governor \nRyan later pardoned four death row inmates and commuted the sentences \nof all remaining Illinois death row inmates to life in prison before he \nleft office in January 2003. Illinois has not executed anyone since.\n  In addition, in 2007, the American Bar Association issued a series of \nreports on the fairness and accuracy of capital punishment systems in \neight states, and concluded there were serious problems in every state \nit reviewed.\n  So while detailed reviews have not been conducted in every state, the \nstudies that have been done have revealed major problems. And these \nproblems whether they be racial disparities, inconsistent application \nof the death penalty, inadequate indigent defense, or other \nshortcomings cannot be brushed aside as atypical or as revealing state-\nspecific anomalies in an otherwise perfect system. Years of study have \nshown that the death penalty does little to deter crime, and that \ndefendants' likelihood of being sentenced to death depends heavily on \nillegitimate factors such as whether they are rich or poor.\n  Racial disparities also have been documented again and again. Since \nreinstatement of the modern death penalty, 80 percent of murder victims \nin cases where death sentences were handed down were white, even though \nonly 50 percent of murder victims are white. Nationwide, more than half \nof death row inmates nationwide are African Americans or Hispanic \nAmericans. Since 1976, cases that had a white defendant and a black \nvictim have resulted in 15 executions; in cases involving a black \ndefendant and a white victim, there have been 229 executions.\n  There is also evidence that seeking capital punishment comes at great \nmonetary cost to taxpayers. The Urban Institute in Maryland examined \n162 capital cases that were prosecuted between 1978 and 1999. It found \nthat seeking the death penalty in those cases cost $186 million more \nthan what those cases would have cost had the death penalty not been \nsought. In California, according to the California Commission on the \nFair Administration of Justice, ``the additional cost of confining an \ninmate to death row, as compared to the maximum security prisons where \nthose sentenced to life without possibility of parole ordinarily serve \ntheir sentences, is $90,000 per year per inmate. With California's \ncurrent death row population of 670, that accounts for $63.3 million \nannually.'' A report in Washington state indicates that ``at the trial \nlevel, death penalty cases are estimated to generate roughly $470,000 \nin additional costs to the prosecution and defense over the cost of \ntrying the same case as an aggravated murder without the death penalty \nand costs of $47,000 to $70,000 for court personnel.'' Similar reports \ndetailing the extraordinary financial costs of the death penalty have \nbeen generated for States across the Nation.\n  There are also enormous problems with the right to counsel in death \npenalty cases. I held a hearing in the Constitution Subcommittee of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee last year to examine the State of capital \ndefense in this country, and the results were shocking. The witnesses \nprovided sobering testimony about over-worked and under-paid court-\nappointed lawyers in capital cases, and the lack of investigative and \nother resources available to them. Just to take a couple of specific \nexamples, Bryan Stevenson of the Equal Justice Initiative testified \nthat in Alabama, 60 percent of people on death row were defended by \nlawyers appointed by courts who, by statute, could not be paid more \nthan $1,000 for their out of court time to prepare the case for trial. \nIn Texas, hundreds of death row inmates are awaiting execution after \nbeing represented by lawyers who could not receive more then $500 for \nexperts or mitigation evidence. Across the country there are hundreds \nof death row inmates whose lawyers had their compensation capped at \nlevels that make effective assistance impossible.\n  We also heard more about the American Bar Association State \nAssessment Project, which found that ineffective defense representation \nwas a serious problem in each of the eight states that the ABA \nreviewed--and is a major reason why the ABA continues to advocate for a \nmoratorium on capital punishment.\n  The Federal death penalty, too, has had its share of problems. \nCapital punishment at the Federal level was reinstated in 1988 in a \nFederal law that provided for the death penalty for murder in the \ncourse of a drug-kingpin conspiracy. It was then expanded significantly \nin 1994, when an omnibus crime bill expanded its use to a total of some \n60 Federal offenses. Despite my best efforts to halt the expansion of \nthe Federal death penalty, more and more provisions have been added \nover the years. Three individuals have now been executed under the \nFederal system, and there are 55 inmates on Federal death row.\n  In 2007, I held a hearing on oversight of the Federal death penalty \nthe first such oversight hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee in 6 \nyears. Once again, the results were disturbing. The hearing focused on \na range of issues, including the lack of information the Justice \nDepartment maintains about the application and cost of the death \npenalty, the lack of transparency in the DOJ decision-making process, \nconcerns about the politicization of the federal death penalty, and the \ncontinuing problem of racial disparities in the Federal system.\n  I was alarmed to learn at the hearing that the Department of Justice \nfrom 2001 to 2006 kept virtually no statistics about its implementation \nof the Federal death penalty. Prior to the hearing, I requested basic \nstatistics for that time period, such as the rate at which the Attorney \nGeneral overruled U.S. Attorney recommendations not to seek the death \npenalty, and the race of defendants and victims in Federal capital \ncases. Before I asked for this information, the Department had not \ntracked it. Further, the DOJ does not track the monetary costs of the \nFederal death penalty in any way at all.\n  We are still lacking basic information about racial disparities in \nthe application of the Federal death penalty. After putting off for \nyears a National Institute of Justice study report ordered by Attorney \nGeneral Reno at the end of the Clinton Administration to examine this \nquestion, DOJ finally released a RAND study in 2006. But the long \nanticipated report did not address the root question about the \napplication of the Federal death penalty; it did not study the \ndecision-making process for bringing defendants into the Federal system \nin the first place. Of course, this study only covers 1995-2000. So we \nstill have very little information about racial disparities from 2001 \nforward.\n  I was particularly concerned about information the hearing uncovered \nabout the Attorney General overrule rates. In the Federal system, the \nAttorney General makes the final decision whether to seek the death \npenalty in federal cases. Between 2001 and 2006, the Attorney General \noverruled local U.S. Attorney recommendations not to seek the death \npenalty in one out of every three Federal capital cases. This number is \nsubstantially higher than the 16 percent of recommendations not to seek \ndeath that were overruled by\n\n[[Page S3560]]\n\nAttorney General Reno from 1995 to 2000. Not only was the Bush \nadministration far more willing to overrule local U.S. Attorney \nrecommendations, but when it did so, the Government was less likely to \nactually obtain a death sentence in the case. The Government secured a \ndeath sentence in 33 percent of cases where the Attorney General \napproved a U.S. Attorney recommendation to seek death, but in only 20 \npercent of cases where the Attorney General overruled the U.S. Attorney \nrecommendation not to seek death.\n  And at least one U.S. Attorney who objected when his recommendation \nnot to seek death was overruled by Main Justice learned the hard way \nthat dissent was not acceptable. Former U.S. Attorney Paul Charlton, \nwho testified at the hearing I chaired, was fired at least in part \nbecause he had the audacity to ask to speak with the Attorney General \ndirectly after the Attorney General ordered him to pursue the death \npenalty in a case where he had recommended against seeking the death \npenalty.\n  There is every reason to be optimistic that the new administration \nwill take the significant problems in our federal death penalty system \nmuch more seriously. But while we examine the flaws in our death \npenalty system at both the State and Federal level, we cannot help but \nnote that any use of the death penalty in the United States stands in \nstark contrast to the majority of nations, which have abolished the \ndeath penalty in law or practice. There are now 123 countries that have \ndone so. In 2007, only China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Pakistan executed \nmore people than we did in the United States. These countries, and \nothers on the list of nations that actively use capital punishment, are \ncountries that we often criticize for human rights abuses. The European \nUnion denies membership to nations that use the death penalty. In fact, \nit passed a resolution calling for the immediate and unconditional \nglobal abolition of the death penalty, and it specifically called on \nall states within the United States to abolish the death penalty. \nMoreover, the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution on \nDecember 18, 2007, calling for a worldwide moratorium on the death \npenalty.\n  We are a Nation that prides itself on the fundamental principles of \njustice, liberty, equality and due process. We are a Nation that \nscrutinizes the human rights records of other nations. We should hold \nour own system of justice to the highest standard.\n  As a matter of justice, this is an issue that transcends political \nallegiances. A range of prominent voices in our country is raising \nserious questions about the death penalty, and these are not just \nvoices of liberals, or of the faith community. They are the voices of \nformer FBI Director William Sessions, former Supreme Court Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor, Reverend Pat Robertson, commentator George Will, \nformer Mississippi warden Donald Cabana, and former Baltimore City \npolice officer Michael May. And notably, the editorial boards of the \nChicago Tribune and the Dallas Morning News each finally came out in \nopposition to the death penalty in 2007. The voices of those \nquestioning our application of the death penalty are growing in number, \nand they are growing louder.\n  As we begin a new year and a new Congress, I believe the continued \nuse of the death penalty in the United States is beneath us. The death \npenalty is at odds with our best traditions. It is wrong and it is \nineffective. The adage ``two wrongs do not make a right'' applies here \nin the most fundamental way. It is time to abolish the death penalty as \nwe seek to spread peace and justice both here and overseas. And it is \nnot just a matter of morality. The continued viability of our criminal \njustice system as a truly just system that deserves the respect of our \nown people and the world requires that we take this step. Our Nation's \ngoal to remain the world's leading defender of freedom, liberty and \nequality demands that we do so.\n  Abolishing the death penalty will not be an easy task. It will take \npatience, persistence, and courage. As we work to move forward in a \nrapidly changing world, let us leave this archaic practice behind.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in taking the first step in abolishing \nthe death penalty in our great Nation by enacting this legislation to \ndo away with the Federal death penalty. I also call on each State that \nauthorizes the use of the death penalty to cease this practice. Let us \ntogether reject violence and restore fairness and integrity to our \ncriminal justice system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 650\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose \nan excise tax on excessive bonuses paid by, and received from, \ncompanies receiving Federal emergency economic assistance, to limit the \namount of nonqualified deferred compensation that employees of such \ncompanies may defer from taxation, and for other purposes; read the \nfirst time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, over the past week, we have heard a lot \nabout AIG paying out $165 million in bonuses to employees of its \nfinancial products unit. This is the same company that took $170 \nbillion in taxpayer money just to stay afloat.\n  The Government owns 80 percent of AIG. Yet some people in the \nGovernment say that they were not able to do anything to stop these \nbonuses from being paid.\n  The country is angry, and I am angry.\n  President Obama ordered Secretary Geithner to use all available legal \nmeans to recover these bonuses. But that may not be enough. We may \nnever be able to recover these payments.\n  The truth is we should not have to be in this position in the first \nplace. When\n\n[[Page S3564]]\n\nwe first passed the TARP funding, Senator Grassley and I fought hard to \ninclude strong provisions in the bill on executive compensation. \nUnfortunately, the TARP program was not run as originally intended.\n  Even as we discuss this issue, reports are coming out that Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac are planning on paying retention bonuses to their \nexecutives.\n  This type of behavior has to stop, and it has to stop now.\n  Companies should not be taking taxpayer money for a bailout with one \nhand, and then paying out big bonuses with the other. Across the \ncountry, Americans are losing their jobs. They are stretching every \ndollar to cover the basic costs of living. Meanwhile, executives and \nemployees at financial institutions are receiving big bonuses--bonuses \nthat are being paid with taxpayer dollars.\n  I think that almost all of us can agree that companies receiving \ntaxpayer money should not be paying these big bonuses. Unfortunately, \nit seems that this type of behavior is not going stop, unless we take \naction. Using Congress's power to tax appears to be the best option \navailable to us to address these excessive bonuses.\n  So today, I join with my colleagues Senators Grassley, Wyden, and \nSnowe, as well as others, to introduce a bill to do just that.\n  This bill makes sure that if a large institution receives government \nfunds, and it then wants to pay out big bonuses, then it is going to \nface significant tax consequences. This bill would impose a 35 percent \nexcise tax on each of the employer and the employee. It would apply to \nbonuses earned or paid after January 1 of this year.\n  For retention bonuses, the excise tax would be imposed on the full \namount of the bonus. For all other bonuses, the excise tax would be \nimposed on all amounts over $50,000. The bill includes regulatory \nsafeguards that would help to prevent companies from characterizing \nbonus payments as salaries to avoid the taxes.\n  This bill would also prevent companies from just deferring these \nbonuses to avoid paying this excise tax. This bill would prevent \ntaxpayers from deferring more than $1 million in a 12 month period. If \na taxpayer deferred more than $1 million, then the bill would impose a \n20 percent penalty and interest.\n  Some have concerns about the small banks that want to take Federal \nmoney through the new SBA program that the President announced. Others \nhave concerns about the larger banks that did not take much in TARP \nfunds. The restrictions in this bill would not apply to small banks as \ndefined in the tax code. And the restrictions would not apply to banks \nthat receive less than $100 million of TARP funds or other Government \nassistance. And if those institutions wanted to pay back their TARP \nfunds, they would no longer be subject to these restrictions.\n  The way that these companies are doing business must stop. This bill \nwould change the way that TARP recipients and recipients of other \nsimilar Government aid operate. These companies would no longer be able \nto pay out big bonuses or give out huge amounts of deferred \ncompensation without facing significant tax consequences.\n  The country is going through difficult times. Americans are scrimping \nand saving just to get by. We owe it to the American taxpayer to do all \nthat we can to ensure that banks do not use taxpayer dollars to pay out \nbig bonuses. I urge all of my Colleagues to join me in cosponsoring \nthis important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN (for himself and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 653. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins \nin commemoration of the bicentennial of the writing of the Star-\nSpangled Banner, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Star-\nSpangled Banner Commemorative Coin Act. I am pleased that my colleague, \nthe senior Senator from Maryland, is a co-sponsor. This legislation \nwill honor our National Anthem and the Battle for Baltimore, which was \na key turning point of the War of 1812, by creating two commemorative \nU.S. Mint coins.\n  The War of 1812 confirmed American independence from Great Britain in \nthe eyes of the world. Before the war, the British had been routinely \nimposing on American sovereignty. They had impressed American merchant \nseamen into the British Royal Navy, enforced illegal and unfair trade \nrules with the United States, and allegedly offered assistance to \nAmerican Indian tribes which were attacking frontier settlements. In \nresponse, the United States declared war on Great Britain on June 18, \n1812, to protest these violations of ``free trade and sailors rights''.\n  After 2 \\1/2\\ years of conflict, the British Royal Navy sailed up the \nChesapeake Bay with combined military and naval forces, and in August \n1814 attacked Washington, DC, burning to the ground the U.S. Capitol, \nthe White House, and much of the rest of the capital city. After \nfinishing with Washington, DC, the British moved to capture Baltimore, \nwhich in 1814 was a larger city.\n  As the British Royal Navy sailed up the Patapsco River on its way to \nBaltimore, American forces held the British fleet at Fort McHenry, \nlocated just outside of the city. After 25 hours of bombardment, the \nBritish failed to take the Fort and were forced to depart. American \nlawyer Francis Scott Key, who was being held on board an American flag-\nof-truce vessel, beheld at dawn's early light an American flag still \nflying atop Fort McHenry. He immortalized the event in a song which \nlater became known as the Star-Spangled Banner.\n  The flag to which Key referred was a 30' x 42' foot flag made \nspecifically for Fort McHenry. The commanding officer desired a flag so \nlarge that the British would have no trouble seeing it from a distance. \nThis proved to be the case as Key visited the British fleet on \nSeptember 7, 1814, to secure the release of Dr. William Beanes. Dr. \nBeanes was released, but Key and Beanes were detained on an American \nflag-of-truce vessel until the end of the bombardment. It was on \nSeptember 14, 1814, that Key saw the great banner that inspired him to \nwrite the song that ultimately became our National Anthem.\n  The Star-Spangled Banner Commemorative Coins will honor this symbol \nof our nation and our National Anthem. Under this Act, the U.S. \nTreasury would mint up to 100,000 $5 gold coins and 500,000 $1 silver \ncoins in 2012, in coordination with the 200th Anniversary of the War of \n1812. Proceeds from surcharges for the coins will be paid to the \nMaryland War of 1812 Bicentennial Commission, for bicentennial \nactivities, educational outreach, and preservation and improvement \nactivities pertaining to the sites and structures relating to the War \nof 1812. I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this measure \nin a fitting tribute to a seminal chapter in American history.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 653\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Star-Spangled Banner \n     Commemorative Coin Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) During the Battle for Baltimore of the War of 1812, \n     Francis Scott Key visited the British fleet in the Chesapeake \n     Bay on September 7, 1814, to secure the release of Dr. \n     William Beanes, who had been captured after the British \n     burned Washington, D.C.\n       (2) The release of Dr. Beanes was secured, but Key and \n     Beanes were held by the British during the shelling of Fort \n     McHenry, one of the forts defending Baltimore.\n       (3) On the morning of September 14, 1814, after the 25-hour \n     British bombardment of Fort McHenry, Key peered through the \n     clearing smoke to see a 42-foot by 30-foot American flag \n     flying proudly atop the Fort.\n       (4) He was so inspired to see the enormous flag still \n     flying over the Fort that he began penning a song, which he \n     named The Defence of Fort McHenry, to commemorate the \n     occasion and he included a note that it should be sung to the \n     tune of the popular British melody To Anacreon in Heaven.\n       (5) In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson ordered that the \n     anthem, which had been popularly renamed the Star-Spangled \n     Banner, be played at military and naval occasions.\n       (6) On March 3, 1931, President Herbert Hoover signed a \n     resolution of Congress that officially designated the Star-\n     Spangled Banner as the National Anthem of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to cover \nphysician services delivered by podiatric physicians to ensure access \nby Medicaid beneficiaries to appropriate quality foot and ankle care; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing an important \npiece of legislation that I have worked on for several years with \nSenator Mikulski from Maryland. I am pleased that she is joining me in \nintroducing this bill today, and I look forward to working with her to \nget it passed.\n  The bill we are introducing today, the Equity and Access for \nPodiatric Physicians Under Medicaid Act, will ensure that Medicaid \nbeneficiaries in all States have access to the services of top-quality \npodiatric physicians.\n  Having healthy feet and ankles is critical to keeping individuals \nmobile, productive and in good long-term health. This is particularly \ntrue for individuals with diabetes.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, \nover 23 million Americans have diabetes, which amounts to over seven \npercent of the total population. Diabetes is the seventh leading cause \nof death in this country.\n  If not managed properly, diabetes can cause several severe health \nproblems, including eye disease or blindness, kidney disease and heart \ndisease. Too often, diabetes can lead to foot complications, including \nfoot ulcers and even amputations. In fact, the CDC estimates that in \n2004, about 71,000 people underwent an amputation of a leg, foot or toe \nbecause of complications with diabetes.\n  Proper care of the feet could prevent many of these amputations.\n  The bill we are introducing today recognizes the important role \npodiatrists can play identifying and correcting foot problems among \ndiabetics. The bill amends Medicaid's definition of ``physicians'' to \ninclude podiatric physicians. This will ensure that Medicaid \nbeneficiaries have access to foot care from those most qualified to \nprovide it.\n  Under Medicaid, podiatry is considered an optional benefit. However, \njust because it is optional, does not mean that podiatric services are \nnot needed, or that beneficiaries will not seek out other providers to \nperform these services. Instead, Medicaid beneficiaries will have to \nreceive foot care from other providers who may not be as well trained \nas a podiatrist in treating lower extremities.\n  Also, it is important to note that podiatrists are considered \nphysicians under the Medicare program, which allows seniors and \ndisabled individuals to receive appropriate care.\n  I urge my colleagues to give careful consideration to this important \nbill. It will help many Medicaid beneficiaries across the country have \naccess to podiatrists that they need.\n  Finally, I want to thank the Senator from Maryland for helping me \nreintroduce this legislation today. I hope that by working together we \ncan see this important change made.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to join Senator Bunning to \nintroduce the Equity and Access for Podiatric Physicians Under Medicaid \nAct. I am proud to introduce this legislation that will ensure Medicaid \npatients have access to care provided by podiatric physicians.\n  This bill adds podiatric physicians to Medicaid's definition of \nphysicians. Currently, podiatric physicians are defined as physicians \nunder Medicare but not under Medicaid. Medicaid treats podiatric \nphysicians as optional providers. This is a simple, commonsense bill \nthat will treat podiatric physicians the same in Medicare and Medicaid. \nIn this economic tsunami, with shrinking budgets and less to go around \nfor Medicaid with more people in need, states are looking for ways to \ntrim budgets and cut costs--one way to do that could be ending \nreimbursements to providers on Medicaid's ``optional list.'' That means \ndiabetics who need foot and ankle care but cannot afford to pay out of \npocket will not get preventive care from a podiatrist that literally \ncan save life and limb.\n  In fact, covering podiatric physicians may be a cost-effective \nmeasure. Ensuring Medicaid patients access to podiatric physicians will \nsave Medicaid funds in the long term. Seventy-five percent of Americans \nwill experience some type of foot health problem during their lives and \nfoot disease is the most common complication of diabetes leading to \nhospitalization. Foot care programs with regular examinations could \nprevent up to 85 percent of these amputations. We must focus more on \nprevention on our health care system, and podiatrists are important \nproviders of this preventive care.\n\n[[Page S3566]]\n\n  Podiatric physicians are the only health professionals specially \ntrained to prevent wounds and amputations in the lower limbs in people \nwith chronic conditions like diabetes. Conditions that can devastate \nfeet and ankles. With obesity and diabetes reaching epidemic \nproportions in the U.S., the work of podiatrists is more important now \nthan ever before. Over 23 million people in this country have diabetes, \nthat is 8 percent of the U.S. populations. Approximately 82,000 people \nhave diabetes-related Leg-,foot or toe amputations each year. Both the \nCDC and American Diabetes Association recommend that podiatric \nphysicians are a part of the care plan for people with diabetes. \nMedicaid covers necessary foot and ankle services, so the program \nshould allow podiatric physicians who provide these services to get \nreimbursed for them. I want Medicaid patients around the country, and \nthe over 600,000 Medicaid patients in Maryland, to have access to these \nservices.\n  I know how important the care provided by podiatric physicians can be \nfrom my own personal experience. Dr. Vince Martorana, a podiatrist \npracticing in Baltimore did great things for my mother. He handled \neverything from health maintenance to unique challenges facing my \nmother, who lived for many years with adult onset diabetes. My severely \ndiabetic mother could walk on her own two feet until she passed away \nbecause of Dr. Martorana. My Uncle Tony was also a podiatric physician \nwho practiced in Baltimore for more than 40 years. He was there helping \nRosie the Riveters stay on the job during World War II. These were \nhardworking people who had to stand on their own two feet to make a \nliving and Uncle Tony was going to make sure it happened.\n  Podiatric physicians need to be recognized for the important role \nthey play in health care and be reimbursed for their services. This \nbill makes sure that happens and ensures Medicaid patients have access \nto essential medical and surgical foot and ankle care. The bill is \nstrongly supported by the American Podiatric Medical Association and I \nurge my colleagues to cosponsor this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. JOHNSON (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Tester, and Mr. \n        Thune):\n  S. 655. A bill to amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration \nAct to ensure adequate funding for conservation and restoration of \nwildlife, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I introduced legislation, along \nwith Senators Stabenow and Tester, that establishes a first-of-its-kind \nprogram to dedicate funds to advance important state wildlife recovery \nand restoration programs.\n  For many years, Congress has authorized a portion of the fees hunters \nand anglers pay on fishing and hunting gear to go to the States to \nsupport hunting and fishing. This program is a success and is part of \nthe reason why we continue to have such a strong sportsman tradition in \nour country.\n  However, a critical need has gone unmet; a need that this bill will \nfill. The Teaming With Wildlife Act of 2009 leverages a share of the \nfees that oil and gas companies pay to the Federal government for the \nright to drill for oil and gas on federal land, to fund programs \nadministrated by the States to conserve the habitats of nongame \nspecies. This bill is a partnership between the States and Federal \nGovernment. Each State and territory developed a wildlife action plan \nthat guides how the funds authorized under this act will be spent. The \nplans ensure that State wildlife agencies take a comprehensive approach \nto conservation, focusing on efforts to support nongame species that \nare not threatened or endangered. States will match the Federal funds, \nleveraging the success of these on-the-ground conservation projects.\n  A rich and diverse environment is important to support our strong \noutdoor and sportsman tradition. All species are linked together. A \nsuccessful pheasant hunt or landing a trophy walleye is connected to \nhow we enhance the habitat of many other species. Enacting the Teaming \nWith Wildlife Act will build on the tremendously successful programs of \nthe 20th century and move us forward in broadening how we enhance all \nwildlife resources.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Kerry, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Ms. Klobuchar, and Mr. Kennedy):\n  S. 656.

and\n       (2) aliens subject to removal proceedings under section 240 \n     of such Act (8 U.S.C. 1229a).\n       (f) Limitation on Judicial Review.--A determination by the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security regarding the adjustment of \n     status of any alien under this section is final and shall not \n     be subject to review by any court.\n       (g) No Offset in Number of Visas Available.--If an alien is \n     granted the status of having been lawfully admitted for \n     permanent residence pursuant to this section, the Secretary \n     of State shall not be required to reduce the number of \n     immigrant visas authorized to be issued under any provision \n     of the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et \n     seq.).\n       (h) Application of Immigration and Nationality Act \n     Provisions.--\n       (1) Definitions.--Except as otherwise specifically provided \n     in this Act, the definitions contained in the Immigration and \n     Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1101 et seq.) shall apply in this \n     section.\n       (2) Savings provision.--Nothing in this Act may be \n     construed to repeal, amend, alter, modify, effect, or \n     restrict the powers, duties, function, or authority of the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security in the administration and \n     enforcement of the Immigration and Nationality Act or any \n     other law relating to immigration, nationality, or \n     naturalization.\n       (3) Effect of eligibility for adjustment of status.--\n     Eligibility to be granted the status of having been lawfully \n     admitted for permanent residence under this section shall not \n     preclude an alien from seeking any status under any other \n     provision of law for which the alien may otherwise be \n     eligible.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Leahy, Mr. \n        Specter, Mr. Graham, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Cornyn, and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 657. A bill to provide for media coverage of Federal court \nproceedings; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this week, the Nation celebrates the fifth \nannual Sunshine Week--a time when open Government advocates raise their \nvoices to renew the call for open and transparent Government. Our \ndemocracy works best when citizens know what their Government is doing. \nThere is no more appropriate time to recommit ourselves to defending \nthe public's right to know.\n  Today, I am pleased to join Senators Grassley and Schumer to \nreintroduce the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act of 2009. This bipartisan \nbill will improve access to Federal court proceedings for members of \nthe public who are unable to travel to the courthouse. In the \ninformation age, providing the American people access to Federal courts \nis possible like never before. Not all Americans are able to invest the \ntime and money in travelling to witness public courtroom proceedings.\n  I commend Senator Grassley for his leadership over the last decade to \nexpand access to the courts. A bipartisan majority of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee voted to report this legislation in the last \nCongress, but further consideration stalled on the Senate floor. I hope \nour efforts to pass this legislation will be successful this year.\n  The Federal courts serve as a bulwark for the protection of \nindividual rights and liberties, and the Supreme Court is often the \nfinal arbiter of Constitutional questions that have a profound effect \non all Americans. Allowing the public greater access to Federal courts \nwill deepen Americans' understanding of the work that goes on in the \ncourts. As a result, Americans can be better informed about how \nimportant judicial decisions are made.\n  I have continually supported efforts in Congress to make our \nGovernment more transparent and accessible. During my more than 3 \ndecades in the Senate, I have worked to make Federal agencies more open \nand accountable to the public through a reinvigorated Freedom of \nInformation Act, FOIA, and last year, the first major reforms to FOIA \nwere enacted with the passage of the Leahy-Cornyn OPEN Government Act. \nI have also supported efforts to make the work of Congress more open to \nthe American people. Just this week, I introduced the OPEN FOIA Act, \nwhich would require Congress to openly and clearly state its intention \nto provide for statutory exemptions to FOIA in proposed legislation. \nThe freedom of information is one of the cornerstones of our democracy. \nFor more than 4 decades, FOIA has been among the most important Federal \nlaws that protect the public's right to know.\n  The work of the Federal judiciary is also open to the public. \nProceedings in Federal courtrooms around this country are open to the \npublic, and jurists publish extensive opinions explaining the reasons \nfor their judgments and decisions. Nevertheless, more can and must be \ndone to increase access to the Federal courts. All 50 States currently \nallow some form of audio or video coverage of court proceedings, but \nthe Federal courts lag behind. The legislation we introduce today \nsimply extends this tradition of openness to the Federal level.\n  Although this bill permits presiding appellate and district court \njudges to allow cameras in most public Federal court proceedings, it \ndoes not require that they do so. An exception is carved out for \ninstances where a camera would violate the due process rights of an \ninvolved party. At the same time, the bill protects non-party witnesses \nby giving them the right to have their voices and images obscured \nduring their testimony. I believe these protections strike the proper \nbalance between security needs and the protection of personal privacy, \nwhile at the same time ensuring the public will always have a right to \nknow what their Government is doing.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes the Judicial conference of the U.S. to \nissue advisory guidelines for use by presiding judges in determining \nthe management and administration of photographing, recording, \nbroadcasting, or televising the proceedings.\n  In 1994, the Judicial conference concluded that it was not the right \ntime to permit cameras in the Federal courts, and rejected a \nrecommendation of the Court Administration and Case Management \nCommittee to authorize the use of cameras in Federal civil trial and \nappellate courts. A majority of the Conference was concerned about the \nintimidating effect of cameras on some witnesses and jurors.\n  I understand that the Judicial conference remains opposed to cameras \nin the Federal courts, and I am sensitive to the conference's concerns. \nBut this legislation grants the presiding judge the authority to \nevaluate the effect of a camera on particular proceedings and \nwitnesses, and decide accordingly on whether to permit the camera into \nthe courtroom. A blanket prohibition on cameras is an unnecessary \nlimitation on the discretion of the presiding judge.\n  This legislation is an important step towards making the work of the \nFederal judiciary more widely available for public scrutiny. I hope all \nSenators will join us in bringing more transparency to the Federal \ncourts.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. ALEXANDER:\n  S. 659. A bill to improve the teaching and learning of American \nhistroy and civics; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on a day in a week when there is a lot \nof news where people are hurting in a serious economy, I have some good \nnews to report, and it will just take me a few minutes to do it. Our \nsenior Senator, Mr. Byrd, Senator Ted Kennedy, who is chairman of the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and I introduced \nlegislation today that will help push the teaching of U.S. history in \nour classrooms. The way I like to describe it is by saying this: that \nit will help to put the teaching of American history and civics back in \nits rightful place, in our classrooms, so our children can grow up \nlearning what it means to be an American.\n  The legislation which we have introduced would expand summer \nacademies for outstanding teachers, authorize new teacher programs, \nrequire States to set standards for the teaching and learning of U.S. \nHistory, and create new opportunities to compare the tests that \nstudents take on U.S. history.\n\n[[Page S3568]]\n\n  Specifically, the legislation would, No. 1, authorize 100 new summer \nacademies for outstanding students and teachers of U.S. history and \nalign those academies with locations in our national park system, such \nas the John Adams' House in Massachusetts or the Independence Hall in \nPhiladelphia. I see the pages sitting here today. They are real \nstudents of U.S. history because they live it and learn it each day \nthey are here. I don't know what their scores are on the advanced \nplacement tests for U.S. history, but I know one fact, which the Chair \nmay be interested in learning: The highest scores in any high school in \nAmerica on the advanced placement test for U.S. history is not from a \nNew England prep school or a Tennessee prep school or an elite school \nin some rich part of America; it is from the page school of the House \nof Representatives. They had better scores on U.S. history than any \nother high school. I don't know what the Senate page scores were, so I \nwon't compare them.\n\n  The point is--and this is an idea David McCullough, a well-known \nauthor, had: We would expand the number of presidential and \ncongressional academies for outstanding students and teachers and have \nthem placed in the National Park Service initiative.\n  Second, the bill we've introduced today would double the \nauthorization of funding for the teaching of American history programs \nin local school districts, which today involve 20,000 students as a \npart of the No Child Left Behind Act.\n  Third, it would require States to develop and implement standards for \nstudent assessments in U.S. history, although there would be no Federal \nreporting requirement, as there is now for reading and mathematics.\n  Finally, it would allow States to compare history and civics student \ntest scores in the 8th and 12th grades by establishing a 10-State pilot \nprogram expanding the National Assessment of Education Progress (NAEP), \nwhich is also called the ``Nation's Report Card.'' We have a tradition \nin the Senate where each of us, when we first arrive, make a maiden \nspeech. We still call it that. Most of us pick a subject that is \nimportant to us. I made mine almost exactly 6 years ago, on March 4, \n2003. The subject was something I cared about then and care about today \nand on which we have made some progress.\n  I argued, as I mentioned earlier, it was time to put the teaching of \nAmerican history and civics back in its rightful place in our schools \nso as our children grow, they can learn what it means to be an \nAmerican. On the ``Nation's Report Card,'' our worst scores for our \nseniors in high school are not in math or science but in U.S. history. \nIt will be very difficult for us as a country to succeed if we don't \nlearn where we came from.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the speech I made 6 years ago be printed \nin the Record immediately following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that if Senator \nByrd and Senator Kennedy make statements today on this legislation, as \nI believe they will, that our statements be put in the Record in about \nthe same place, with Senator Byrd's first, then Senator Kennedy's, and \nmine third.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in the speech I made 6 years ago, I \ncalled it the American History and Civics Education Act. I suggested we \ncreate summer academies for outstanding students and teachers of \nAmerican history. The idea was to create one of those academies focused \non American history and civics for teachers and one for students and to \nsee how they worked and to gradually expand them.\n  These presidential academies for students and teachers were modeled \nafter the Tennessee Governors School, which I began when I was Governor \nof Tennessee, which still continue today, after 20 years. They are \nrelatively inexpensive. They are 2-, 3-, or 4-week schools for \nstudents, and one for teachers. They held students in a variety of \nsubjects, such as mathematics, science, the arts, international \nstudies. They come together for a while and inspire one another, and \nthen they go back to their schools and inspire their fellow students. \nThey have been a great success in Tennessee and in other States.\n  Senator Reid, the majority leader, was the whip at that time. He was \non the floor when I made my remarks and he asked to be the prime \ncosponsor of the legislation, and he was. Senator Kennedy, who has had \na long interest in U.S. history, takes his family once a year to some \nan historical part of the United States. A couple years ago, they went \ninto Virginia and saw where Patrick Henry made his famous speech. I kid \nhim and say he cares so much about history because he is a part of it \nin such a big way. Senator Kennedy heard about the proposal, and he \nwent along the Democratic side and rounded up 20 cosponsors of the \nlegislation. So, Senator Kennedy, Senator Reid and I and several \nRepublican Senators introduced a bill. We had a hearing during which \nSenator Byrd testified on behalf of my proposal for summer academies. \nIt passed the Senate and the House, and we have had those summer \nacademies now for three summers. One of those is at the Ashland \nUniversity in Ashland, OH, which has been a great success. I see the \nstudents and teachers every summer. I bring them on the Senate floor, \nand it has been proven that it is good for teachers and good for our \ncountry. So that is the reason we want to expand those programs. We \nalso felt we would meet as a group--those of us who have something to \ndo with U.S. history here--and we met with the Library of Congress and \nwith other parts of the Federal Government and many of us are involved \nin helping Americans learn more about our country's history, especially \nyoung people. As part of that, we thought it would be wise to try to \nconsolidate in one section of the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct--which we call No Child Left Behind--the various programs we \nalready have for U.S. history and then to expand those that seemed \nworthwhile.\n  That is what this legislation does. There is a great need for it. I \nmentioned earlier that it is our worst subject for high school, even \nthough some of our pages seem to do pretty well. Very few students \nscore at or above the proficient level on the American history exam \nconducted by the National Assessment for Education Progress. Twenty \npercent of fourth graders were proficient in U.S. history, 17 percent \nof eighth graders were proficient in U.S. history, and 12 percent of \nhigh school seniors were proficient in U.S. history.\n  In addition, the No Child Left Behind Act may have had the \nunintentional effect of reducing the focus on U.S. history, as some \nschool districts have concentrated their efforts on reading and \nmathematics. Therefore, it is appropriate and necessary to improve and \nexpand State and local efforts to increase the understanding and \nawareness of American history and to do it, of course, in a way that \ndoesn't preempt State and local responsibility and authority for \nelementary and secondary education.\n  Therefore, what the legislation we are doing today will do is expand \nthe summer academies. We call them presidential academies for teachers \nand congressional academies for students. Those academies were created \nin 2004 to the number of 100 in the summer gradually over the years. \nThe priority would be to place those academies in the National Park \nService's national centennial parks initiative so the Library of \nCongress, the Smithsonian, and other museums that have innovative \nprograms in U.S. history can be aligned with these academies. David \nMcCullough, for example, suggested we have the academies at locations \nsuch as Andrew Jackson's home in Heritage. I think an even better idea \nwould be to have a week for U.S. teachers at John Adams' home in \nMassachusetts, with Mr. McCullough as the teacher. That is the idea.\n  Secondly, we would expand the Nation's report card--we call that \nNAEP--so there could be a 10-State pilot program for American history \nand civics student assessment in grades 8 and 12. Today, our Nation's \nreport card doesn't measure State performance in American history. It \ngives us a picture of how 8th to 12th graders do nationally. This would \npermit Colorado, Tennessee, Alaska, and California to compare the \nseniors and, in doing so, call attention to improvements that might \nneed to be made.\n\n[[Page S3569]]\n\n  The third thing would be to require all States to develop and \nimplement standards and assessments in American history under the No \nChild Left Behind Act. But it doesn't require any Federal reporting, as \nwe do in other subjects.\n  Finally, it would take Senator Byrd's program--called Teaching \nAmerican History, which he put into the No Child Left Behind Act 6 \nyears ago--and it would double the authorization for that program from \n$100 million to $200 million, so it can serve even more than the 20,000 \nteachers it serves today.\n  I thank David Cleary and Sarah Rittling of my staff, who have worked \nhard with the staffs of Senators Byrd and Kennedy to prepare this \nlegislation. We intend to invite all Members of the Senate, and we hope \nthe House will join us in cosponsoring this.\n  Finally, I wish to tell one short story to conclude my remarks about \nsome of the teachers who have participated. One of the things a Senator \ncan do is to bring someone on the Senate floor who is not a Senator. It \nhas to be done when the Senate is not in session and I have found it is \na great privilege for most Americans. Early one morning last summer, I \nbrought onto the Senate floor the 50 teachers who had been selected--\none from each State--for the presidential academy for outstanding \nteachers of American history. I showed them Daniel Webster's desk right \nhere, and I showed them Jefferson Davis's desk, which is back there, \nand where the sword mark is where when the Union soldier came in and \nstarted chopping the desk, and the soldier who was stopped by a \ncommander who said, ``We came to save the Union, not destroy it.'' I \nshowed them where the majority and minority leaders speak. They saw ``E \nPluribus Unum'' up there, and ``In God We Trust'' back there. They \nlearned that we operate by unanimous consent, and we talked about what \nit would be like to actually try to operate a classroom by unanimous \nconsent, much less the Senate.\n  As you might expect, they asked a lot of good questions, being \noutstanding history teachers. I especially remember the final question. \nI believe it was from the teacher from Oregon who asked: Senator, what \nwould you like for us to take back to our students? I said that what I \nhope you will take back is that I get up every day, and I believe most \nof us on either side get up hoping that by the end of the day, we will \nhave done something to make our country look better. It may not look \nthat way on television or read that way in the newspaper because we are \nsent here to debate great issues. That produces conflict and \ndisagreement a lot of the time. I feel, and I believe all of us feel, \nwe are in a very special place, in a very special country, with a very \nspecial tradition. We would like for the students to know that and to \nknow that is how we feel about the job we have.\n  I am delighted today that Senators Byrd and Kennedy, who have \ncontributed so much to U.S. history over the years, both in their own \npersonalities and by legislation they have introduced, have joined me \nin this effort to expand the Federal programs that focus on putting \nU.S. history and civics in a little higher place in the classroom so \nthat our students learn what it means to be an American.\n  I invite my colleagues to join us, and I invite all Americans to join \nus in their communities, in their schools and in their States, to make \nthat a priority.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n Remarks of Sen. Alexander--American History and Civics Education Act \n                              Introduction\n\n       Mr. President, from the Senate's earliest days, new members \n     have observed as we just heard a ritual of remaining silent \n     during floor debates for a period of time that ranged from \n     several weeks to two years. By waiting a respectful amount of \n     time before giving their so-called ``maiden speeches,'' \n     freshman senators hoped their senior colleagues would respect \n     them for their humility.\n       This information comes from the Senate historian, Richard \n     Baker, who told me that in 1906, the former Governor of \n     Wisconsin, Robert LaFollette, arrived here ``anything but \n     humble'' (and I'm sensitive to this as a former governor). He \n     waited just three months, a brief period by the standards of \n     those days, before launching his first major address. He \n     spoke for eight hours over three days; his remarks in the \n     Congressional Record consumed 148 pages. As he began to \n     speak, most of the senators present in the chamber pointedly \n     rose from their desks and departed. LaFollete's wife, \n     observing from the gallery, wrote, ``There was no mistaking \n     that this was a polite form of hazing.''\n       From our first day here, as the majority leader said, we \n     new members of this 108th Congress have been encouraged to \n     speak up, and most of us have. But, with the encouragement of \n     the majority leader, several of us intend also to revive the \n     tradition of the maiden address by making a signature speech \n     on an issue that is important both to the country and to each \n     of us. I want to thank my colleagues who are here, and I want \n     to assure all of you that I will not speak for three days--as \n     former Governor LaFollette did.\n       Mr. President, I rise to address the intersection of two \n     urgent concerns that will determine our country's future. \n     These are also the two topics I care about the most: the \n     education of our children and the principles that unite us as \n     Americans.\n       It is time that we put the teaching of American history and \n     civics back in its rightful place in our schools so our \n     children can grow up learning what it means to be an \n     American.\n       Especially during such serious times when our values and \n     way of life are being attacked, we need to understand clearly \n     just what those values are.\n       In this, most Americans would agree. For example, in \n     Thanksgiving remarks in 2001, President Bush praised our \n     nation's response to September 11. ``I call it,'' he said, \n     ``the American character.'' At about the same time, while \n     speaking at Harvard, former Vice-President Al Gore said, ``We \n     should [fight] for the values that bind us together as a \n     country.''\n       Both men were invoking a creed of ideas and values in which \n     most Americans believe. ``It has been our fate as a nation,'' \n     the historian Richard Hofstadter wrote, ``not to have \n     ideologies but to be one.'' This value based identity has \n     inspired both patriotism and division at home, as well as \n     emulation and hatred abroad. For terrorists, as well as for \n     those who admire America, at issue is the United States \n     itself--not what we do, but who we are.\n       Yet our children do not know what makes America \n     exceptional. National exams show that three-quarters of the \n     nation's 4th, 8th and 12th graders are not proficient in \n     civics knowledge and one-third does not even have basic \n     knowledge, making them ``civic illiterates.''\n       Children are not learning about American history and civics \n     because they are not being taught it. American history has \n     been watered down, and civics is too often dropped from the \n     curriculum entirely.\n       Until the 1960s, civics education, which teaches the duties \n     of citizenship, was a regular part of the high school \n     curriculum, but today's college graduates probably have less \n     civics knowledge than high school graduates of 50 years ago. \n     Reforms, so-called, in the '60s and '70s resulted in the \n     widespread elimination of required classes and curriculum in \n     civics education. Today, more than half the states have no \n     requirement for students to take a course--even for one \n     semester--in American government.\n       To help put the teaching of American history and civics in \n     its rightful place, today I introduce legislation along with \n     several distinguished co-sponsors including: Senators Reid, \n     Gregg, Santorum, Inhofe and Nickles. We call it the \n     ``American History and Civics Act.'' This act creates \n     Presidential Academies for Teachers of American History and \n     Civics and Congressional Academies for Students of American \n     History and Civics. These residential academies would operate \n     for two weeks (in the case of teachers) and four weeks (for \n     students) during the summer.\n       Their purpose would be to inspire better teaching and more \n     learning of the key events, persons and ideas that shape the \n     institutions and democratic heritage of the United States.\n       I have had some experience with such residential summer \n     academies, when I was Governor of Tennessee. In 1984, we \n     began creating Governor's schools for students and teachers. \n     For example, there was the Governor's School for the Arts at \n     Middle Tennessee State University and the Governor's School \n     of International Studies at the University of Memphis as well \n     as the Governor's School for Teachers of Writing at the \n     University of Tennessee at Knoxville, which was especially \n     successful. Eventually there were eight Governor's Schools \n     helping thousands of Tennessee teachers improve their skills \n     and inspiring outstanding students to learn more about core \n     curriculum subjects. When these teachers and students \n     returned to their schools for the next school year, they \n     brought with them a new enthusiasm for teaching and learning \n     that infected their peers. Dollar for dollar, the Governor's \n     Schools were one of the most effective and popular \n     educational initiatives in our state's history.\n       States other than Tennessee have had similar success with \n     summer residential academies. The first Governor's school was \n     started in North Carolina in 1963 when Governor Terry Sanford \n     established it at Salem College in Winston-Salem. Upon the \n     establishment of the first school, several states, including \n     Georgia, South Carolina, Arkansas, Kentucky, and Tennessee \n     established similar schools.\n       For example, in 1973 Pennsylvania established Governor's \n     Schools of Excellence, which has 14 different programs of \n     study. As in Tennessee, students participating in the \n     Pennsylvania Governor's School program attend academies at 8 \n     different colleges to\n\n[[Page S3570]]\n\n     study everything from international studies, to health care \n     and teaching. Also established in 1973, Virginia's Governor's \n     School is a summer residential program for 7500 of the \n     Commonwealth's most gifted students. Mississippi established \n     its Governor's School in 1981. The Mississippi University for \n     Women hosts the program, which is designed to give students \n     academic, creative, and leadership experiences. Every year \n     West Virginia brings 80 of its most talented high school \n     performing and visual arts students to West Liberty State \n     College for a three-week residential program.\n       These are just a few of the more than 100 Governors' \n     schools in 28 states--clearly the model is a good one. The \n     legislation I propose today applies that successful model to \n     American history and civics education at the national level \n     by establishing Presidential and Congressional academies for \n     students and teachers of those subjects.\n       Additionally, this proposed legislation authorizes the \n     creation of a national alliance of American history and \n     civics teachers who would be connected by the internet. The \n     alliance would facilitate sharing of best practices in the \n     teaching of American history and civics. It is modeled after \n     an alliance I helped the National Geographic Society begin \n     during the 1980's to put geography back into the American \n     school curriculum. Tennessee and the University of Tennessee \n     were among the first sponsors of the alliance.\n       This legislation creates a pilot program. Up to 12 \n     Presidential academies for teachers and 12 Congressional \n     Academies for students would be sponsored by educational \n     institutions. The National Endowment for the Humanities would \n     award 2-year renewable grants to those institutions after a \n     peer review process. Each grant would be subject to rigorous \n     review after three years to determine whether the overall \n     program should continue, expand or end. The legislation \n     authorizes $25 million annually for the four year pilot \n     program.\n       There is a broad basis of renewed support for and interest \n     in American history and civics in our country.\n       David Gordon noted in a recent issue of the Harvard \n     Education Letter: ``A 1998 survey by the nonpartisan research \n     organization Public Agenda showed that 84 percent of parents \n     with school-aged children said they believe that the United \n     States is a special country and they want schools to convey \n     that belief to their children by teaching about its heroes \n     and traditions. Similar numbers identified the American ideal \n     as including equal opportunity, individual freedom, and \n     tolerance and respect for others. Those findings were \n     consistent across racial and ethnic groups.''\n       Our national leadership has responded to this renewed \n     interest. In 2000, at the initiative of my distinguished \n     colleague Senator Byrd, Congress created grants for schools \n     that teach American history as a separate subject within \n     school curricula. We appropriated $100 million for those \n     grants in the recent Omnibus appropriations bill, and \n     rightfully so. They encourage schools and teachers to focus \n     on the teaching of traditional American history, and provide \n     important financial support.\n       Last September, with historian David McCullough at his \n     side, President Bush announced a new initiative to encourage \n     the teaching of American history and civics. He established \n     the ``We the People'' program at the NEH, which will develop \n     curricula and sponsor lectures on American history and \n     civics. He announced the ``Our Documents'' project, run by \n     the National Archives. This would take one hundred of \n     America's most important documents from the National Archives \n     to classrooms and communities across the country. This year, \n     he will convene a White House forum on American history, \n     civics, and service. There, we will discuss new policies to \n     improve the teaching of history and civics in elementary and \n     secondary schools.\n       This proposed legislation takes the next step by training \n     teachers and encouraging outstanding students. We need to \n     foster a love of this subject and arm teachers with the \n     skills to impart that love to their students.\n       I am pleased that today one of the leading members of the \n     House of Representatives, Roger Wicker of Mississippi, along \n     with a number of his colleagues, are introducing the same \n     legislation in the House.\n       I want to thank Senator Gregg, Chairman of the Committee on \n     Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, who has agreed that \n     the committee will hold hearings on this legislation so that \n     we can determine how it might supplement and work with \n     recently enacted legislation and the President's various \n     initiatives.\n       Mr. President, in 1988, at a meeting of educators in \n     Rochester, the President of Notre Dame University, Monk \n     Malloy, asked this question: ``What is the rationale for the \n     public school?'' There was an unexpected silence around the \n     room until Al Shanker, the president of the American \n     Federation of Teachers, answered in this way: ``The public \n     school was created to teach immigrant children the three R's \n     and what it means to be an American with the hope that they \n     would then go home and teach their parents.''\n       From the founding of America, we have always understood how \n     important it is for citizens to understand the principles \n     that unite us as a country. Other countries are united by \n     their ethnicity. If you move to Japan for example, you can't \n     become Japanese. Americans, on the other hand, are united by \n     a few things in which we believe. To become an American \n     citizen, you subscribe to those principles. If there were no \n     agreement on those principles, as Samuel Huntington has \n     noted, we would be the United Nations instead of the United \n     States of America.\n       There has therefore been a continuous education process to \n     remind Americans just what those principles are. Thomas \n     Jefferson, in his retirement at Monticello, would spend \n     evenings explaining to overnight guests what he had in mind \n     when he helped create what we call America. By the mid-19th \n     century it was just assumed that everybody knew what it meant \n     to be an American. In his letter from the Alamo, Col. William \n     Barrett Travis pleaded for help simply ``in the name of \n     liberty, patriotism and everything dear to the American \n     character.''\n       There were new waves of immigration in the late 19th \n     century that brought to our country a record number of new \n     people from other lands whose view of what it means to be an \n     American was indistinct--and Americans responded by teaching \n     them. In Wisconsin, for example, the Kohler Company actually \n     housed German immigrants together so that they might be \n     ``Americanized'' during non-working hours.\n       But the most important Americanizing institution, as Mr. \n     Shanker reminded us in Rochester in 1988, was the new common \n     school. McGuffey's Reader, which was used in many classrooms, \n     sold more than 120 million copies introducing a common \n     culture of literature, patriotic speeches and historical \n     references.\n       In the 20th century it was war that made Americans stop and \n     think about what we were defending. President Roosevelt made \n     certain that those who charged the beaches of Normandy knew \n     they were defending for freedoms.\n       But after World War II, the emphasis on teaching and \n     defining the principles that unite us has waned. Unpleasant \n     experiences with McCarthyism in the 1950's, discouragement \n     after the Vietnam War, and history books that left out or \n     distorted the history of African-Americans made some skittish \n     about discussing ``Americanism.'' The end of the Cold War \n     removed a preoccupation with who we were not, making it less \n     important to consider who we are. The Immigration law changes \n     in 1965 brought to our shores many new Americans and many \n     cultural changes. As a result, the American Way became much \n     more often praised than defined.\n       Changes in community attitudes, as they always are, were \n     reflected in our schools. According to historian Diane \n     Ravitch, the public school virtually abandoned its role as \n     the chief Americanizing Institution. We have gone, she \n     explains, from one extreme (simplistic patriotism and \n     incomplete history) to the other--``public schools with an \n     adversary culture that emphasize the nation's warts and \n     diminish its genuine accomplishments. There is no literary \n     canon. There are no common readings, no agreed upon lists of \n     books, poems and stories from which students and parents \n     might be taught a common culture and be reminded of what it \n     means to be an American.''\n       During this time many of our national leaders contributed \n     to this drift toward agnostic Americanism. These leaders \n     celebrated multiculturalism and bilingualism and diversity at \n     a time when there should have been more emphasis on a common \n     culture and learning English and unity.\n       America's variety and diversity is a great strength, but it \n     is not our greatest strength. Jerusalem is diverse. The \n     Balkans are diverse. America's greatest accomplishment is not \n     its variety and diversity but that we have found a way to \n     take all that variety and diversity and unite ourselves as \n     one country. E pluribus unum: out of many, one. That is what \n     makes America truly exceptional.\n       Since 9/11 the national conversation about what it means to \n     be an American has been different. The terrorists focused \n     their cross-hairs on the creed that unites Americans as \n     one country--forcing us to remind ourselves of those \n     principles, to examine and define them, and to celebrate \n     them. The President himself has been the lead teacher. \n     President Bush has literally taken us back to school on \n     what it means to be an American. When he took the country \n     to church on television after the attacks he reminded us \n     that no country is more religious than we are. When he \n     walked across the street to the mosque he reminded the \n     world that we separate church and state and that there is \n     freedom here to believe in whatever one wants to believe. \n     When he attacked and defeated the Taliban, he honored \n     life. When we put planes back in the air and opened \n     financial markets and began going to football games again \n     we celebrated liberty. The President called on us to make \n     those magnificent images of courage and charity and \n     leadership and selflessness more permanent in our every \n     day lives through Freedom Corps. And with his optimism, he \n     warded off doomsayers who tried to diminish the real gift \n     of Americans to civilization, our cockeyed optimism that \n     anything is possible.\n       Just after 9/11, I proposed an idea I called ``Pledge Plus \n     Three.'' Why not start each school day with the Pledge of \n     Allegiance--as we do here in the Senate--followed by a \n     faculty member or student sharing for three minutes ``what it \n     means to be an American.'' The Pledge embodies many of the \n     ideals of our National Creed: ``one nation, under God, \n     indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.'' It speaks to \n     our unity, to our faith, to our\n\n[[Page S3571]]\n\n     value of freedom, and to our belief in the fair treatment of \n     all Americans. If more future federal judges took more \n     classes in American history and civics and learned more about \n     those values, we might have fewer mind-boggling decisions \n     like the one issued recently by the Ninth Circuit.\n       Before I was elected to the Senate, I taught some of our \n     future judges and legislators a course at Harvard's John F. \n     Kennedy School of Government entitled ``The American \n     Character and America's Government.'' The purpose of the \n     course was to help policy makers, civil servants and \n     journalists analyze the American creed and character and \n     apply it in the solving of public policy problems. We tried \n     to figure out, if you will, what would be ``the American \n     way'' to solve a given problem.\n       The students and I did not have much trouble deciding that \n     America is truly exceptional (not always better, but truly \n     exceptional) or in identifying the major principles of the \n     American Creed or the distinct characteristics of our \n     country. Such principles as: liberty, equal opportunity, rule \n     of law, laissez faire, individualism, e pluribus unum, the \n     separation of church and state.\n       But what we also found as we find in this body was that \n     applying those principles to today's issues was hard work. \n     This was because the principles of the creed often \n     conflicted. For example, when discussing President Bush's \n     faith-based charity legislation, we know that ``In God We \n     Trust'' but we also know that we don't trust government with \n     God.\n       When considering whether the federal government should pay \n     for scholarships which middle and low income families might \n     use at any accredited school--public, private or religious--\n     we find that the principle of equal opportunity conflicted \n     with the separation of church and state.\n       And we find there are great disappointments when we try to \n     live up to our greatest dreams, for example, President \n     Kennedy's pledge that we will ``pay any price or bear any \n     burden'' to defend freedom, or Thomas Jefferson's assertion \n     that ``all men are created equal,'' or the American dream \n     that for anyone who works hard, tomorrow will always be \n     better than today. We are often disappointed when we try to \n     live up to those dreams.\n       We learned that, as Samuel Huntington has written, \n     balancing these conflicts and disappointments is what most of \n     American politics and government is about.\n       Mr. President, if most of our politics and government is \n     about applying to our most urgent problems the principles and \n     characteristics that make us the exceptional United States of \n     America, then we had better get about the teaching and \n     learning of those principles and characteristics.\n       The legislation I propose today with several co-sponsors \n     will help our schools do what they were established to do in \n     the first place. At a time when there are record numbers of \n     new Americans, and at a time when our values are under \n     attack, at a time when we are considering going to war to \n     defend those values, there can be no more urgent task than \n     putting the teaching of American history and civics back in \n     its rightful place in our schools so our children can grow up \n     learning what it means to be an American.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HATCH (for himself and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 660. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act with respect to \npain care; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the National Pain \nCare Policy Act of 2009. I am pleased to have worked with my good \nfriend, Senator Chris Dodd, on this legislation that will create a \ncomprehensive framework for addressing coordinated research, public \neducation and training in pain and pain management. I also want to \nacknowledge the work of my colleagues in the House, Representatives \nLois Capps and Mike Rogers, for their efforts in that body to highlight \nthis important health issue.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, \nmore than 25 percent of Americans over age 20 report having suffered \npain. Of the older people reporting pain, more than half say their pain \nlasted for an entire year or longer. But many older people do not \nreport their pain because they believe nothing can be done or they are \nunaware that effective treatments may exist.\n  Health care professionals are often not adequately trained to manage \ntheir patients' pain. They may be unfamiliar with the latest research \nand guidelines, or they might hesitate to prescribe medication for pain \nmanagement due to concerns about dosing or dependency. A widely \nacknowledged barrier to patient care includes misconceptions and \nconcerns by health care providers regarding laws and policies on the \nuse of controlled substances. Some patients do not tell their doctors \nthey are experiencing pain because they do not want to bother them or \nappear to be a complainer.\n  The National Pain Care Act of 2009 will help researchers, patients \nand health care providers better understand and manage pain care. It \nwill coordinate federal research activities by establishing an \nInteragency Pain Coordinating Committee. The legislation also \nauthorizes funds for pain research at the National Institutes of \nHealth, NIH, and requires a report to Congress on the progress made in \nthis area. The Coordinating Committee will summarize in their report \nthe advances in pain care research supported or conducted by federal \nagencies and identify the research gaps that, if filled, could shed \nlight on the symptoms and causes of pain.\n  The bill will establish a public awareness campaign highlighting pain \nas a serious public health issue. The campaign will provide messages to \nthe public on the need to appropriately assess, diagnose, treat and \nmanage pain, and will alert the public to available treatments options \nfor pain care management. It will also help patients weigh the risks \nand benefits of these options so that they may make better informed \ndecisions with their health care providers.\n  The National Pain Care Policy Act of 2009 also creates greater \ntraining capacity in health-professions schools, hospices and other \nhealth care professional training facilities. This training will ensure \nthat more health professionals have the capacity to manage their \npatients' pain using the most recent findings and improvements in the \nprovision of pain care. Health professionals in a variety of settings \nwill learn better means for assessing, diagnosing, treating and \nmanaging pain signs and symptoms and, as a result, will become more \nknowledgeable about applicable policies on the use of controlled \nsubstances.\n  This bill contains provisions that will help the many Americans who \nsuffer from joint pain, one of the most common types of pain reported. \nOne-third of adults reported joint pain, aching or stiffness, according \nto a CDC report on the nation's health. It will also reduce \nhospitalization costs that are associated with hip and knee \nreplacements that may be unnecessary if the underlying pain can be \nadequately controlled.\n  Finally, the National Pain Care Act of 2009 will also help migraine \nsufferers, cancer patients and those experiencing lower back pain. \nCancer patients should not have to spend their final days in pain. \nLower back pain is the most common cause of job-related disability and \nrelieving that complaint could increase worker productivity and \nalleviate many lost days of work.\n  This is an important piece of legislation; it is one that, if passed, \nwill improve the lives of many. Quite frankly, I believe it is long \noverdue. Similar legislation was introduced last year in both chambers \nof Congress--the House passed its legislation late in the year, but, \nunfortunately, the Senate did not consider the bill before the 110th \nCongress adjourned. The legislation we introduce today is identical to \nthat which the House passed last year. I thank Senator Dodd for his \nleadership on this important issue and I urge my colleagues to support \nthe prompt passage of our bill.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from Utah, \nSenator Orrin Hatch, in introducing the National Pain Care Policy Act \nof 2009. This important legislation would make significant strides in \nthe understanding and treatment of pain as a medical condition. Pain is \nthe most common symptom leading to medical care and a leading health \nissue. Yet people suffering through pain often struggle to get relief \nbecause of a variety of issues. This is why we are introducing this \nimportant legislation.\n  Each year pain results in more than 50 million lost workdays \nestimated to cost the United States $100 billion. Beyond the economic \nimpact, pain is a leading cause of disability, with back pain alone \ncausing chronic disability in 1 percent of the population of this \ncountry. In the U.S. 40 million people suffer from arthritis, more than \n26 million, ages 20 to 64, experience frequent back pain, more than 25 \nmillion experience migraine headaches, and 20 million have jaw and \nlower facial pain each year. It is estimated that 70 percent of cancer \npatients have significant pain as they fight the disease. Half of all \npatients in hospitals suffer through\n\n[[Page S3572]]\n\nmoderate to severe pain in their last days. As with many medical \nconditions, this is a problem that is likely to become worse as the \nbaby boom generation approaches retirement and the population ages.\n  Sadly, though most pain can be relieved, it often is not. Many \nsuffering patients are reluctant to tell their medical provider about \nthe pain they are experiencing, for fear of being identified as a ``bad \npatient,'' and concern about addiction often leads patients to avoid \nseeking or using medications to treat their pain. But even if patients \nwere more forthcoming about their condition, few medical providers are \nequipped to do something about it. Often they have not been trained in \nassessment techniques or pain management, and are unaware of the latest \nresearch, guidelines, and standards for treatment. There is also \nconcern among most providers that prescribing treatment for pain will \nlead to greater scrutiny by regulatory agencies and insurers.\n  But we can do something about these barriers and help individuals \nsuffering from pain. The National Pain Care Policy Act would lead to \nimprovements in pain care across the country. The legislation would \ncall for an Institute of Medicine conference on pain care to increase \nawareness of this issue as a public health problem, identify barriers \nto pain care and determine action for overcoming those barriers. A \nnumber of years ago, my good friend Sen. Hatch helped establish a Pain \nConsortium at the National Institutes of Health to establish a \ncoordinated pain research agenda. This legislation will codify that \nconsortium and update its mission. The bill addresses the training and \neducation of health care professionals through new grant programs at \nthe Agency for Health Research and Quality, AHRQ, and the Health \nResources and Services Administration, HRSA. And finally this \nlegislation creates a national outreach and awareness campaign at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to educate patients, families, \nand caregivers about the significance of pain and the importance of \ntreatment.\n  I want to thank Senator Hatch for his leadership on this issue and \nurge my colleagues to join us on this important effort to help the \nmillions of Americans suffering from severe pain.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. \n        Snowe, Mr. Bayh, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 661. A bill to strengthen American manufacturing through improved \nindustrial energy efficiency, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing a bill, with \nSenators Susan Collins, Debbie Stabenow, Olympia Snowe, Evan Bayh, \nSherrod Brown, and Mark Pryor that would enable the retooling and \ntransformation of our industrial sector by using less energy, reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and producing the technologies that will help \nthe U.S. and the world break its dependence on fossil fuel.\n  Today our country is facing some of the toughest economic hurdles \nthat many of us have ever seen. In our manufacturing sector, we have \nlost nearly a million, high quality jobs in the last year, with over \n200,000 jobs lost in just the last month. These are not just jobs that \nwe are losing--the industrial foundation upon which our Nation's wealth \nhas been built is eroding. We are losing technical expertise and the \nskilled and inventive workforce that go with these jobs. We are losing \nthe opportunity to grow our economy and the ability to compete on a \nglobal scale.\n  With this current economic downturn, and the energy, climate, and \nglobal competitiveness challenges lying before us, we have come to a \ncritical juncture in our Nation's industrial history--we must make a \nchoice as to what the future of manufacturing will be for this country. \nAt this moment, while the rest of the world is at a pause, this nation \nhas the opportunity to re-invent and transform our industrial base to \ncompete globally through technical innovation and product superiority, \nall while, reducing our dependence on carbon-based fuels, reducing \ngreenhouse gas emissions, and increasing productivity.\n  The Restoring America's Manufacturing Leadership through Energy \nEfficiency Act of 2009 establishes the financing mechanisms for both \nsmall and large manufactures to adopt the advanced energy efficient \nproduction technologies and processes that will allow them to be more \nproductive and less fuel dependent, cutting costs, not jobs.\n  Second, this bill provides for public/private partnerships with \nindustry to map out the future of advanced American manufacturing and \nto develop and deploy the breakthrough technologies that will take us \nthere. By spurring innovation in our manufacturing sector to decrease \nenergy intensity and environmental impacts, while increasing \nproductivity, we can create the high tech, high-value manufacturing \nprocesses and jobs for the 21st century that will allow the U.S. to \ncompete against anyone, anywhere.\n  Third, this legislation supports the domestic production of advanced \nenergy technologies to fuel the growth of renewables and efficiency and \ncapture the clean energy market, creating millions of American jobs.\n  These steps, combined with the manufacturing tax credit that I \nincluded in the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act, a national \nrenewable portfolio standard, and the President's commitment to \ndoubling renewable energy production in just 3 years will serve as a \nstrong base and commitment on which to build the New American \nManufacturing. I look forward to the impact that this legislation will \nhave on increasing our industrial competitiveness and hope that we can \nincorporate additional ideas as the legislative process proceeds.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 661\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Restoring America's \n     Manufacturing Leadership through Energy Efficiency Act of \n     2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for reimbursement of certified midwife services and to provide \nfor more equitable reimbursement rates for certified nurse-midwife \nservices; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Midwifery Care \nAccess and Reimbursement Equity, M-CARE, Act of 2009 with my colleague, \nSenator Collins. For too many years, certified nurse midwives, CNMs, \nhave not received adequate reimbursement under the Medicare program. \nOur legislation takes steps to improve reimbursement and ensure access \nto these important providers.\n  There are approximately three million disabled women of child-bearing \nage on Medicare, and since 1988, midwives have been providing high-\nquality, low cost maternity services to these women. However, given \noutdated payment policies, CNMs are only reimbursed at 65 percent of \nthe physician fee schedule. This makes it impossible to make a practice \nsustainable and is threatening access to CNMs across the country.\n  The Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, MedPAC, agrees. In a 2002 \nreport, MedPAC recommended that CNMs' reimbursement be increased and \nacknowledged that the care provided by these individuals is comparable \nto similar providers.\n  That is why we are introducing legislation that would provide payment \nequity for CNMs by reimbursing them at 100 percent of the physician fee \nschedule. CNMs provide the same care as physicians; therefore, it is \nonly fair to reimburse CNMs at the same level. In fact, a majority of \nthe states reimburse CNMs at 100 percent of the physician fee schedule \nfor out-of-hospital services provided to Medicaid beneficiaries. The \ntime has come to extend this policy to Medicare.\n  In addition, the M-CARE Act would establish recognition for a \ncertified midwife to provide services under Medicare. Despite the fact \nthat CNMs and CMs provide the same services, Medicare has yet to \nrecognize CMs as eligible providers.

Res. 79\n\n       Whereas Paul M.

Con. Res. 11\n\n       Whereas the United States Government has consistently \n     supported efforts to address the rise in anti-Semitism \n     through its bilateral relationships and through engagement in \n     international organizations such as the United Nations, the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), \n     and the Organization of American States;\n       Whereas, in 2004, Congress passed the Global Anti-Semitism \n     Review Act (Public Law 108-332), which established an Office \n     to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism, headed by a Special \n     Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism;\n       Whereas the Department of State, the Office for Democratic \n     Institutions and Human Rights of the OSCE, and others have \n     reported that periods of Arab-Israeli tension have sparked an \n     increase in attacks against Jewish communities around the \n     world and comparisons of policies of the Government of Israel \n     to those of the Nazis and that, despite growing efforts by \n     governments to promote Holocaust remembrance, the Holocaust \n     is frequently invoked as part of anti-Semitic harassment to \n     threaten and offend Jews;\n       Whereas, since the commencement of Israel's military \n     operation in Gaza on December 27, 2008, a substantial \n     increase in anti-Semitic violence, including physical and \n     verbal attacks, arson, and vandalism against synagogues, \n     cemeteries, and Holocaust memorial sites, has been reported;\n       Whereas, among many other examples of the dramatic rise of \n     anti-Semitism around the world, over 220 anti-Semitic \n     incidents have been reported to the Community Security Trust \n     in London since December 27, 2008, approximately eight times \n     the number recorded during the same period last year, and the \n     main Jewish association in France, Counsel Representatif des \n     Institutions Juives de France, recorded more than 100 attacks \n     in January, including car bombs launched at synagogues, a \n     difference from 20 to 25 a month for the previous year;\n       Whereas, interspersed with expressions of legitimate \n     criticism of Israeli policy and actions, anti-Semitic imagery \n     and comparisons of Jews and Israel to Nazis have been \n     widespread at demonstrations in the United States, Europe, \n     and Latin America against Israel's actions, and placards held \n     at many demonstrations across the globe have compared Israeli \n     leaders to Nazis, accused Israel of carrying out a \n     ``Holocaust'' against Palestinians, and equated the Jewish \n     Star of David with the Nazi swastika;\n       Whereas, in some countries, demonstrations have included \n     chants of ``death to Israel,'' expressions of support for \n     suicide terrorism against Israeli or Jewish civilians, and \n     have been followed by violence and vandalism against \n     synagogues and Jewish institutions;\n       Whereas some government leaders have exemplified courage \n     and resolve against this trend, including President Nicolas \n     Sarkozy of France, who said he ``utterly condemned the \n     unacceptable violence, under the pretext of this conflict, \n     against individuals, private property, and religious \n     buildings,'' and assured ``that these acts would not go \n     unpunished,'' Justice Minister of the Netherlands Ernst \n     Hirsch Ballin, who announced on January 14, 2009, that he \n     would investigate allegations of anti-Semitism and incitement \n     to hatred and violence at anti-Israel demonstrations, and \n     parliamentarians who have voiced concern, such as the British \n     Parliament's All-Party Group Against Anti-Semitism, which \n     expressed its ``horror as a wave of anti-Semitic incidents \n     has affected the Jewish community'';\n       Whereas, despite these actions, too few government leaders \n     in Europe, the Middle\n\n[[Page S3576]]\n\n     East, and Latin America have taken action against the anti-\n     Semitic environments in their countries and in some cases \n     have even promoted violence;\n       Whereas other leaders have made hostile pronouncements \n     against Israel and Jews, including the President of \n     Venezuela, Hugo Chavez, who called Israel's actions a \n     ``Holocaust against the Palestinian people'' and singled out \n     Venezuela's Jewish community, demanding that they publicly \n     renounce Israel's ``barbaric acts'' and in so doing implying \n     that the Jewish community is co-responsible for any actions \n     by the Government of Israel and thus a legitimate target, the \n     leader of Hamas, Mahmoud al-Zahar, who recently called for \n     Jewish children to be attacked around the world, and the \n     Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khameini, who vowed to \n     confer the status of ``martyr'' on ``anyone who dies in this \n     holy struggle against World Zionism'';\n       Whereas incitement to violence against Jews also continues \n     in state-run media, particularly in the Middle East, where \n     government-owned, government-sanctioned, or government-\n     controlled publishing houses publish newspapers which \n     promulgate anti-Jewish stereotypes and the myth of the Jewish \n     blood libels in editorial cartoons and articles, produce and \n     broadcast anti-Semitic dramatic and documentary series, and \n     produce Arabic translations of anti-Semitic tracts such as \n     ``The Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' and ``Mein Kampf'';\n       Whereas Jewish communities face an environment in which the \n     convergence of anti-Semitic sentiment and demonization of \n     Israel in the public debate have fostered a hostile \n     environment and a sense of global insecurity, especially in \n     places such as Belgium, Argentina, Venezuela, Spain, and \n     South Africa;\n       Whereas, in response, the United States Government and \n     other governments and multilateral institutions have \n     supported international government and civil society efforts \n     to monitor and report on anti-Semitic activities and \n     introduce preventive initiatives such as tolerance education \n     and Holocaust Remembrance; and\n       Whereas challenges still remain, with the governments of \n     many countries failing to implement and fund preventive \n     efforts, accurately track and report anti-Semitic crimes, and \n     prosecute offenders: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress--\n       (1) unequivocally condemns all forms of anti-Semitism and \n     rejects attempts to rationalize anti-Jewish hatred or attacks \n     as a justifiable expression of disaffection or frustration \n     over political events in the Middle East or elsewhere;\n       (2) decries the comparison of Jews to Nazis perpetrating a \n     Holocaust or genocide as a pernicious form of anti-Semitism, \n     an insult to the memory of those who perished in the \n     Holocaust, and an affront both to those who survived and the \n     righteous gentiles who saved Jewish lives at peril to their \n     own and who fought to defeat the Nazis;\n       (3) calls on leaders to speak out against manifestations of \n     anti-Semitism that have entered the public debate about the \n     Middle East;\n       (4) applauds those foreign leaders who have condemned anti-\n     Semitic acts and calls on those who have yet to take firm \n     action against anti-Semitism in their countries to do so;\n       (5) reaffirms its support for the mandate of the Special \n     Envoy to Monitor and Combat Anti-Semitism; and\n       (6) urges the Secretary of State--\n       (A) to maintain the fight against anti-Semitism as a \n     foreign policy priority of the Untied States and to convey \n     the concerns of the United States Government in bilateral \n     meetings;\n       (B) to continue to raise with United States allies in the \n     Middle East their failure to halt incitement to violence \n     against Jews, including through the use of government-run \n     media;\n       (C) to urge governments to promote tolerance education and \n     establish mechanisms to monitor, investigate, and punish \n     anti-Semitic crimes, including through utilization of the \n     education, law enforcement training, and civil society \n     capacity building initiatives of the Tolerance and Non-\n     discrimination Department of the Organization for Security \n     and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE);\n       (D) to swiftly appoint the Special Envoy to Monitor and \n     Combat Anti-Semitism of the Department of State;\n       (E) to ensure that Department of State Annual Country \n     Reports on Human Rights and International Religious Freedom \n     Reports continue to report on incidents of anti-Semitism and \n     the efforts of foreign governments to address the problem;\n       (F) to provide necessary training and tools for United \n     States embassies and missions to recognize these trends; and\n       (G) to ensure that initiatives of the United States \n     Government to train law enforcement abroad incorporate tools \n     to address anti-Semitism.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bipartisan \nresolution condemning the recent, troubling rise in anti-Semitism \nacross the globe. The resolution also calls upon world leaders to speak \nout against anti-Semitic acts and reaffirms that the United States is \ncommitted to making the fight against anti-Semitism a top foreign \npolicy priority.\n  I am very pleased that Senator Cardin and 40 other Senate colleagues \nhave joined me in saying to the world that we stand tall with the \nJewish community against these acts of violence and crimes of hate.\n  In recent months, there has been a substantial rise in anti-Semitic \nviolence around the globe. We are deeply concerned about the safety and \nwell- being of Jews in Europe, the Middle East, and Latin America, \nwhere they have faced a significant increase in anti-Semitic attacks, \noften very violent. These criminal acts include physical and verbal \nattacks, arson, and vandalism against synagogues, cemeteries, and \nHolocaust memorials. In some nations, demonstrations have included \nchants of ``death to Israel'' and expressions of support for suicide \nterrorism against Israeli or Jewish civilians.\n  Also distressing are the blatantly anti-Semitic Nazi imagery and \nHolocaust comparisons. Our resolution rejects attempts to rationalize \nJewish hatred or attacks as justifiable expression of disaffection or \nfrustration over Israeli policy and political events in the Middle East \nor elsewhere. The Nazi imagery and Holocaust comparisons have been \nprevalent at demonstrations throughout the world. Placards held at many \ndemonstrations have compared Israeli leaders to Nazis, accused Israel \nof carrying out a ``Holocaust'' against the Palestinians, and equated \nthe Jewish Star of David to the Nazi swastika. This is intolerable. We \nmust speak out against these unacceptable acts of hatred and bigotry.\n  While we applaud those world leaders who have shown courage by \ncondemning these acts, we call on those who have yet to do so to \nexpressly reject anti-Semitism in their own countries. We must continue \nto impress upon our allies the critical importance of opposing these \ndisturbing trends, all the while ensuring that our own initiatives to \naddress these forms of hate violence are bolstered.\n  I urge our colleagues to join our effort to raise awareness of this \nimportant issue.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am deeply troubled by the rise in anti-\nSemitic acts around the globe, which is why I am joining the junior \nSenator from Maine in introducing a bipartisan resolution that condemns \nanti-Semitism and calls upon world leaders to speak out against it. The \nconcurrent resolution reaffirms that the U.S. is committed to making \nthe fight against anti-Semitism a top foreign policy priority.\n  Senator Collins, the other co-sponsors of this resolution, and I are \nextremely concerned about the safety and well-being of Jewish \ncommunities worldwide. In recent weeks and months, Jewish communities \naround the world have been subjected to vicious anti-Semitic attacks. \nThese attacks include acts of violence and hatred against members of \nthe Jewish community. The criminal acts include physical attacks, \narson, and vandalism against synagogues, cemeteries, and Holocaust \nmemorials.\n  In some nations, demonstrations have included chants of ``death to \nIsrael'' and expressions of support for suicide terrorism against \nIsraeli or Jewish civilians. Placards held at many demonstrations have \ncompared Israeli leaders to Nazis, accused Israel of carrying out a \n``Holocaust'' against Palestinians, and equated the Jewish Star of \nDavid to the Nazi swastika. Anti-Semitism is not a legitimate form of \npolicy or public protest. We cannot, in good conscience, allow these \nacts of hatred to continue without swift and strong action from world \nleaders. We must speak out against these atrocities.\n  We applaud those world leaders who have spoken out against these \nacts, but call on those who have yet to do so to take firm action \nagainst anti-Semitism in their own countries. We must continue to \nimpress upon our allies and other nations the critical importance of \ncombating anti-Semitism. At the same time, the United States must \nbolster its own initiatives to address anti-Semitism as a foreign \npolicy priority. The resolution we are introducing today helps to do \nthat so I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3576-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3576-S3577]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 686.

Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the budget \nas proposed by President Obama and, to put it very bluntly, I am \nworried. While several aspects of the budget concern me, the one I find \nmost troubling is the direction in which it will take this Nation's \ndeficit. The budget's cost has been pointed out many times on this \nfloor during the past week--$3.5 trillion is, indeed, a lot of money. \nBut what I would also emphasize is that the President's budget will \nspawn a deficit of $1.17 trillion next year.\n\n[[Page S3579]]\n\n  There are many items on the President's wish list. Some are \nworthwhile, but many, such as his health care plan, tax increases, and \nclimate change, deserve a long and lively debate in front of the \nAmerican people before we have any vote on any of those measures. I \nhave four grandchildren--John, Parker, Kimbro, and Anderson--and I am \nvery proud of all four of them. This budget will spend more money than \nmy four grandchildren's generation will ever have a hope of paying back \nin their lifetimes.\n  This is not a temporary spike in the deficit. Despite the President's \nstated intention to reduce the deficit, the smallest deficit envisioned \nby this budget--$533 billion in the year 2013--would still be larger \nthan any of the annual budget deficits of the last 8 years. The last 8 \nyears have received a lot of criticism from folks on the other side of \nthe aisle, including our President, but the fact is that the last 8 \nyears are going to pale in comparison, from a deficit standpoint, in \nthe event this budget should pass.\n  Further, the debt held by the public doubles, from $5.8 trillion, 41 \npercent of our GDP, in 2008, to $11.5 trillion, or 66 percent of GDP, \nin 2013. If that were not astounding enough, by 2019 debt will have \ntripled from the 2008 to $15.4 trillion, or an astonishing 67 percent \nof our GDP.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the worst of it. The CBO is expected to \nrelease its numbers for this budget tomorrow. Early reports suggest \nthat its deficit forecast will be some 20 percent higher than the White \nHouse has expected with the numbers to which I just alluded.\n  I am also worried about this budget's $1.4 trillion tax increase, \nwhich will hit our small businesses, the engines of our economy, \nparticularly hard. More than half of small business, with 20 or more \nemployees, will get hit with tax hikes proposed in this budget. That \nwill have a dampening effect on the ability of the small business \ncommunity to maintain the jobs it has today, much less to think about \nhiring additional employees.\n  In my home State of Georgia, fully 98 percent of the State's \nemployers in 2006 were small businesses, according to the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration Office of Advocacy. With a record statewide \nunemployment rate of 9 percent today, to say that many of them are \nhaving a hard time is an understatement. These are small businesses, \nsuch as Dixie Industrial Finishing Company in Tucker, GA, which does \nelectroplating. Dixie's vice president, Jim Jones, is also worried. His \ncompany has been in business for nearly 50 years and has about 10 \nemployees. Just in the past 2 weeks, because of the very difficult \neconomic times we are in, Jim has had to lay off almost 10 percent of \nhis workforce. Some of these employees have been with the company for \n20 to 25 years and were getting close to retirement. I am afraid that, \ncoming during a recession, such tax increases will only add to the \nfinancial strain at Dixie as well as other small businesses and further \nfeed the growing job losses in Georgia and elsewhere.\n  I am a firm believer in the optimism that birthed this great Nation. \nBut no matter how hard we try, we cannot wish the deficit away. We \ncannot let ourselves throw caution to the wind and act with such fiscal \nirresponsibility. We are leaving our children and grandchildren in hock \nforever to pay for the wants of today. Now, not in 5 years or 10 years, \nis the time for us to exercise responsibility and enact some spending \nrestraint to get this deficit under control. Nothing less than our \ncountry's future depends on it.\n  The American people understand our fiscal problem. The phone calls \ninto my office are overwhelmingly asking the question: Where in the \nworld is this administration taking our country? What is happening to \nour country from a fiscally responsible standpoint? In what direction \nis this country really going?\n  We have to be much more fiscally responsible than the President has \nproposed in his budget. Very simply stated, his budget spends too much, \nit taxes too much, and it borrows too much. That is the wrong direction \nin which this country needs to be going in difficult times or in good \ntimes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/19/senate-section/article/S3579-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3579-S3582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  AIG\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank Senator Chambliss from Georgia for his very \nfine summary. I think one of the more dramatic situations in which this \nCongress has found itself, in the face of a projected positive \nturnaround in the economy, a predicted unprecedented debt for years and \nyears to come.\n  This cannot go quietly. It is a big deal. We have never seen anything \nlike this before. I hope our Senate colleagues will focus on it. I \nwanted to first return again to the AIG bonus issue and expand a little \nbit on the remarks I made earlier in the week.\n  The simple fact is, we are investing a very large amount of not only \nmoney but time, energy, and bombast in how to deal with the one one-\nthousandth of the AIG bailout money that has gone to bonuses. I think \nthey are utterly unacceptable. They are going to the very division of \nAIG that got them into trouble. They were the last people who ought to \nget bonuses.\n  Now, normally politicians who have a nation to run, Cabinet \nSecretaries who have an economy to manage, should not be spending a \nwhole lot of time on a private company's bonus plan. But it has become \nnecessary, unavoidable really, because our Government owns 80 percent \nof this company. We own 80 percent of the stock in AIG after investing \n$173 billion to buy that stock. So no wonder people are furious.\n  If you are running a company, Secretary Geithner, how come we are \nhaving bonuses given to people who ought not to be receiving bonuses?\n  Well, it is a difficult thing with the CEO. Why didn't he do \nsomething about it? The CEO, Chairman Liddy of AIG, was put in place by \nus--first, by Secretary Paulson back when he first started this \nmisguided attempt last fall to take over this company, and he has been \nkept in place by Secretary Geithner, our new Secretary of the Treasury.\n  I would also note that Secretary Geithner was walking hand in hand \nwith Secretary Paulson last fall when they conjured up this scheme that \nsought to alter the financial problems on Wall Street. In reality, \nSecretary Geithner is the ultimate chairman of the board of AIG. He \nultimately is responsible for bonuses, pay scales, office space, \nwhether or not they have airplanes, and all of that stuff. So, oh, what \na tangled web we create when we first start to regulate, to take over a \nprivate company.\n  Mr. Geithner needs to get AIG and these banks--in addition to AIG--we \nhave invested in, of which we now own large stock shares, off his \nportfolio, his list of things to be dealing with. He needs to be \nfocused on the policies necessary to revive this economy.\n  Did anybody see Coach K from Duke? He was asked about the President \nsaying they were going to make it to the Final Four. And Coach K did \nnot miss a beat. He just looked up and said: Well, that is nice. But I \nwould really feel better if he were focusing on the economy.\n  So would I. Distracted by these noteworthy and transient issues over \nbonuses, Mr. Geithner, who stands at the center of our people's concern \nover the economy, has not even begun assembling his staff. It is really \ntroubling. I understand there are about 17 vacancies in his top staff. \nPeople are basically saying he is running the office himself with very \nlittle help.\n  But he did find time to call Mr. Liddy, the hand-picked CEO at AIG, \nto demand that he not give bonus payments. He found time to go over to \nEurope to present--a mortifying spectacle to me, of the once-proud U.S. \nSecretary of Treasury now urging the big-spending, quasi-socialist \nGovernment of Europe to increase their spending, to increase their \nstimulus package, to increase their debt, and assuring them we are \ngoing to do more and we are leading, big government, big taxes, big \nspending, big debt.\n  That does not make me proud. Some people may think that is \nleadership. I am not in that range. That is not my mindset today. \nBasically, it appeared the Europeans said no. They already thought they \nhad spent enough. They are well below what we are spending as a \npercentage of their gross domestic product. They are not spending any \nmore.\n  I remember when I first came here as a young Senator. It came my time \nto question the Chairman of the Federal\n\n[[Page S3580]]\n\nReserve, Mr. Alan Greenspan. I was nervous about it. I am not an \neconomist. So I read to him from an article. I asked him if he agreed \nwith it. It basically said the reason our economy was growing more than \nEurope, the reason we had quite substantially less unemployment was \nbecause we had less taxes, less spending, and less regulation.\n  So I asked him: Is it less taxes, less spending, and a greater \ncommitment to the free market the reason we are doing better than \nEurope?\n  He looked up at me and he said: I absolutely agree with that.\n  So I have taken that as sort of my marching orders. I still think \nthat is a sound philosophy: to keep our regulations low, keep our taxes \nlow, keep our spending as low as possible. Do not waste money, and we \nwill get through a lot of these difficult issues.\n  I would also note that I assume that Secretary Geithner at least had \nsome role in this phenomenal, gargantuan proposal the President has \njust sent over here to us that proposes--get this--budget deficits \nhigher than anything we have ever seen before.\n  Last year, President Bush, his budget deficit was a record $455 \nbillion, and he was criticized for that. He was criticized for a $412 \nbillion budget deficit back on 9/11, the time when that recession hit \nus. He reduced it to $161 billion in 2007, and it jumped to $455 \nbillion last year.\n  This year, with the stimulus package and other things we are doing, \nthe projected deficit--as of September 30--will be $1.8 trillion. Next \nyear, it will be $1.1 trillion. It is projected to reach its lowest \npoint in 4 years, according to the President's own plan. The lowest \npoint is at $533 billion, well above the highest amount in the history \nof the Republic.\n  In year 10, it would be over $700 billion. As Senator Chambliss just \nnoted to us, those figures are not accurate. Our own Congressional \nBudget Office is going to calculate the assumptions given to us by the \nWhite House, and everybody is pretty firmly convinced the numbers are \ngoing to come in higher and worse than that.\n  It cannot be so that we will pass a budget that assumes a $700 \nbillion deficit 10 years from now, when they are also assuming a nice \ngrowth, not a recession or anything, but a nice growth at that time. \nWell, that is a general situation. It is not good. I just cannot \nbelieve this Congress would pass such a budget. I believe we will have \nto push back.\n  I know a lot of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nuneasy about it. The more they learn about it, I am confident the more \nuneasy they are going to be. It is just fact. I mean, you can talk and \ntestify and you can spend, but when you send out a budget in a slick \nbinder, with a blue cover on it, and it is the official projection for \nthe next 10 years from the President of the United States, when they \nproject these kind of numbers, I think the Congress and the American \npeople will rally and do something about it and not accept it.\n  I just wanted to say that. Now, with regard to AIG, this is a matter \nof great importance. In addition to teaching us a lesson about the \ndanger of taking over private companies in general, there are some \nspecific special problems with this bailout that I believe are worthy \nof discussion, and in some points, real investigation.\n  It was highlighted by the Wall Street Journal in their lead editorial \n2 days ago. They pointed out that the bonus flap we have been talking \nabout is a deflection from--a neat deflection--they say, from the \n``larger outrage, which is the 5-month Beltway cover-up of who \nbenefitted the most from the AIG bailout.''\n  First, they note that the Federal takeover of this once proud \ninsurance company, AIG, was never approved by the AIG shareholders.\n  Normally a company that merges or sells or changes its corporate \nmakeup goes through some sort of vote by stockholders. They have proxy \nvotes, solicitations. They attempt to get approval of the stockholders. \nWe just took it over.\n  The Wall Street Journal notes that, in effect, AIG was used as a \nconduit, a funnel to bail out others not mentioned. Since September 16, \n2008, AIG has sent $120 billion of their $173 billion of taxpayer money \nto banks, municipal governments, and ``other derivative \ncounterparties'' around the world, not only in the United States.\n  The Journal goes on to say that this includes at least $20 billion to \nEuropean banks and, they wryly note, ``charity cases like Goldman Sachs \nwhich received at least $13 billion.''\n  They further note:\n\n       This comes after months of claims by Goldman that all of \n     its AIG bets were adequately hedged and that it needed no \n     ``bailout.'' Why take the 13 billion then?\n\n  Then the Wall Street Journal, not one to needlessly dump unfairly on \nthe Wall Street business crowd they often speak up for when they \nbelieve they are abused, declares importantly:\n\n       This needless cover-up is one reason Americans are getting \n     angrier as they wonder if Washington is lying to them about \n     these bailouts.\n\n  Then they ask the most critical question. Remember, Congress was told \nlast fall that we had to bail out the banks because they were too large \nto fail and that their failure would pose a systemic risk to our \neconomy. They said they were going to buy toxic assets. They never said \nthey were going to buy stock. They never hinted they would buy stock in \nan insurance company.\n  This is what the Wall Street Journal said about the systemic risk \nquestion:\n\n       Given the government has never defined ``systemic risk,'' \n     we're also starting to wonder exactly which system American \n     taxpayers are paying to protect. It's not capitalism, in \n     which risk-takers suffer the consequences of bad decisions \n     and in some cases it's not even Americans. The U.S. \n     government is now in the business of distributing foreign aid \n     to offshore financiers, laundered through a once-great \n     American company.\n\n  That is fundamentally true. It is not good. I don't think we ever \nshould have started down that road.\n  The Wall Street Journal concludes:\n\n       Whether or not these funds ever come back to the Treasury, \n     regulators should now focus on getting AIG back into private \n     hands as soon as possible, and if Treasury and the Fed want \n     to continue bailing out foreign banks, let them make that \n     case honestly and directly, to the American people.\n\n  I thank the Wall Street Journal for writing the truth on this complex \nissue. I don't like the way it was done. These decisions to hand out \nbillions of dollars were not made in public. Until a few days ago, we \ndidn't even know who got this money. These banks, these foreign banks, \nGoldman Sachs, the ones that have been listed as getting money, we \ndidn't know their names. Our Secretaries of the Treasury, the two of \nthem, have been passing out this money to these banks through AIG and \nnot even saying where the money went. That is no good. And how do they \ndecide how much to give them? Was there a hearing somewhere where \npeople came, such as in the Senate--poor as we are at it--raised their \nhands under oath or, much preferred, was there something like a \nbankruptcy proceeding where a Federal judge calls all the people in, \ncollects the data, figures out what the income is and the debts are, \nand makes people testify under oath and lawyers cross-examine them and \nthey get down to what the real facts are and then decisions are made \nabout how to handle a company like this?\n  No, apparently they went in and got down on Mr. Geithner's rug and \nMr. Paulson's carpet and asked for $20 billion. And he said: How about \n10?\n  No, I need more.\n  OK, you get 13.\n  Of course, they knew one another. That is just a fact. I am not \nmaking it up. Where did Secretary Paulson come from? He came from \nGoldman Sachs. I wonder what it would have looked like if he had given \nGoldman Sachs $13 billion publicly.\n  I am not happy about it. I don't think the previous administration \nhandled it well. I am disappointed that this administration has taken \nMr. Paulson's right-hand adviser--some say the architect of his plan--\nand put him in charge of it. He is continuing this indefensible \nprocess. I opposed it at the time. I said we are giving too much power \nto one man. In the history of the Republic, we have never given this \nkind of power to one man to pass out this kind of money. This is the \nSenate. It is taxpayers' money. We threw him $700 billion and said: Do \nwhatever you think is right. He told us he was going to buy toxic \nmortgages. Remember that? Within a week, he decided he wasn't going to \nbuy toxic mortgages. He bought stock; not only in banks, he bought \nstock in insurance companies.\n\n[[Page S3581]]\n\nIt is a dangerous thing. When you get into owning these companies, \npeople start wanting to know about what kind of bonuses they have, what \nkind of car the CEO drives, whether they should have a jet plane. The \nSecretary of the Treasury ought to be involved in other things besides \nmanaging corporate affairs. He needs to get us out of these companies \nas soon as possible.\n  I talked to some people from a very solid Main Street bank, big Main \nStreet bank, who were pressured to take money at the time they came up \nwith this scheme. They want to pay the money back and get out from \nunder the Federal boot. They are not agreeing yet to do that. I am not \nhappy about that.\n  I understand another bank may be the same. Others are worried about \nwhether they will be allowed to pay this money back and get out. This \nbank told us, the people I was talking to: We are ready to get out. We \nthink we will do better. Our stock will go up, if the people know we \nare not indebted to the government. We are strong enough. We are not \nhappy about this.\n  They are getting the impression and the fear they have--along with \nother banks in a similar situation--is that there is a resistance from \nthe Treasury Department to have them do that, which would be \nunthinkable to me.\n  I hope we will find out more about it. If there is wrongdoing of a \nmore serious nature than incompetence and bad judgment, I hope it will \nbe pursued. Hopefully not; I hope there is no more than bad judgment. I \nhope as Americans we learn a lesson that it is not easy and there are \nall kinds of unanticipated ramifications from the act of taking over \nprivate companies.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe text of this Wall Street Journal editorial, as well as the list of \ncompanies benefitting from AIG's bailout.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 17, 2009]\n\n                          The Real AIG Outrage\n\n       President Obama joined yesterday in the clamor of outrage \n     at AIG for paying some $165 million in contractually \n     obligated employee bonuses. He and the rest of the political \n     class thus neatly deflected attention from the larger \n     outrage, which is the five-month Beltway cover-up over who \n     benefited most from the AIG bailout.\n       Taxpayers have already put up $173 billion, or more than a \n     thousand times the amount of those bonuses, to fund the \n     government's AIG ``rescue.'' This federal takeover, never \n     approved by AIG shareholders, uses the firm as a conduit to \n     bail out other institutions. After months of government \n     stonewalling, on Sunday night AIG officially acknowledged \n     where most of the taxpayer funds have been going.\n       Since September 16, AIG has sent $120 billion in cash, \n     collateral and other payouts to banks, municipal governments \n     and other derivative counterparties around the world. This \n     includes at least $20 billion to European banks. The list \n     also includes American charity cases like Goldman Sachs, \n     which received at least $13 billion. This comes after months \n     of claims by Goldman that all of its AIG bets were adequately \n     hedged and that it needed no ``bailout.'' Why take $13 \n     billion then? This needless cover-up is one reason Americans \n     are getting angrier as they wonder if Washington is lying to \n     them about these bailouts.\n       Given that the government has never defined ``systemic \n     risk,'' we're also starting to wonder exactly which system \n     American taxpayers are paying to protect. It's not \n     capitalism, in which risk-takers suffer the consequences of \n     bad decisions. And in some cases it's not even American. The \n     U.S. government is now in the business of distributing \n     foreign aid to offshore financiers, laundered through a once-\n     great American company.\n       The politicians also prefer to talk about AIG's latest \n     bonus payments because they deflect attention from \n     Washington's failure to supervise AIG. The Beltway crowd has \n     been selling the story that AIG failed because it operated in \n     a shadowy unregulated world and cleverly exploited gaps among \n     Washington overseers. Said President Obama yesterday, ``This \n     is a corporation that finds itself in financial distress due \n     to recklessness and greed.'' That's true, but Washington \n     doesn't want you to know that various arms of government \n     approved, enabled and encouraged AIG's disastrous bet on the \n     U.S. housing market.\n       Scott Polakoff, acting director of the Office of Thrift \n     Supervision, told the Senate Banking Committee this month \n     that, contrary to media myth, AIG's infamous Financial \n     Products unit did not slip through the regulatory cracks. Mr. \n     Polakoff said that the whole of AIG, including this unit, was \n     regulated by his agency and by a ``college'' of global \n     bureaucrats.\n       But what about that supposedly rogue AIG operation in \n     London? Wasn't that outside the reach of federal regulators? \n     Mr. Polakoff called it ``a false statement'' to say that his \n     agency couldn't regulate the London office.\n       And his agency wasn't the only federal regulator. AIG's \n     Financial Products unit has been overseen for years by an \n     SEC-approved monitor. And AIG didn't just make disastrous \n     bets on housing using those infamous credit default swaps. \n     AIG made the same stupid bets on housing using money in its \n     securities lending program, which was heavily regulated at \n     the state level. State, foreign and various U.S. federal \n     regulators were all looking over AIG's shoulder and approving \n     the bad housing bets. Americans always pay their mortgages, \n     right? Mr. Polakoff said his agency ``should have taken an \n     entirely different approach'' in regulating the contracts \n     written by AIG's Financial Products unit.\n       That's for sure, especially after March of 2005. The \n     housing trouble began--as most of AIG's troubles did--when \n     the company's board buckled under pressure from then New York \n     Attorney General Eliot Spitzer when it fired longtime CEO \n     Hank Greenberg. Almost immediately, Fitch took away the \n     company's triple-A credit rating, which allowed it to borrow \n     at cheaper rates. AIG subsequently announced an earnings \n     restatement. The restatement addressed alleged accounting \n     sins that Mr. Spitzer trumpeted initially but later dropped \n     from his civil complaint.\n       Other elements of the restatement were later reversed by \n     AIG itself. But the damage had been done. The restatement \n     triggered more credit ratings downgrades. Mr. Greenberg's \n     successors seemed to understand that the game had changed, \n     warning in a 2005 SEC filing that a lower credit rating meant \n     the firm would likely have to post more collateral to trading \n     counterparties. But rather than managing risks even more \n     carefully, they went in the opposite direction. Tragically, \n     they did what Mr. Greenberg's AIG never did--bet big on \n     housing.\n       Current AIG CEO Ed Liddy was picked by the government in \n     2008 and didn't create the mess, and he shouldn't be blamed \n     for honoring the firm's lawful bonus contracts. However, it \n     is on Mr. Liddy's watch that AIG has lately been conducting a \n     campaign to stoke fears of ``systemic risk.'' To mute \n     Congressional objections to taxpayer cash infusions, AIG's \n     lobbying materials suggest that taxpayers need to continue \n     subsidizing the insurance giant to avoid economic ruin.\n       Among the more dubious claims is that AIG policyholders \n     won't be able to purchase the coverage they need. The \n     sweeteners AIG has been offering to retain customers tell a \n     different story. Moreover, getting back to those infamous \n     bonuses, AIG can argue that it needs to pay top dollar to \n     survive in an ultra-competitive business, or it can argue \n     that it offers services not otherwise available in the \n     market, but not both.\n       The Washington crowd wants to focus on bonuses because it \n     aims public anger on private actors, not the political class. \n     But our politicians and regulators should direct some of \n     their anger back on themselves--for kicking off AIG's demise \n     by ousting Mr. Greenberg, for failing to supervise its bets, \n     and then for blowing a mountain of taxpayer cash on their AIG \n     nationalization.\n       Whether or not these funds ever come back to the Treasury, \n     regulators should now focus on getting AIG back into private \n     hands as soon as possible. And if Treasury and the Fed want \n     to continue bailing out foreign banks, let them make that \n     case, honestly and directly, to American taxpayers.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n         ATTACHMENT A--COLLATERAL POSTINGS UNDER AIGFP CDS \\1\\\n\n                              [$ billion]\n\n        Counterparty                                      Amount Posted\nSoiete Generale....................................................$4.1\nDeutsche Bank.......................................................2.6\nGoldman Sachs.......................................................2.5\nMerrill Lynch.......................................................1.8\nCalyon..............................................................1.1\nBarclays............................................................0.9\nUBS.................................................................0.8\nDZ Bank.............................................................0.7\nWachovia............................................................0.7\nRabobank............................................................0.5\nKFW.................................................................0.5\nJPMorgan............................................................0.4\nBanco Santander.....................................................0.3\nDanske..............................................................0.2\nReconstruction Finance Corp.........................................0.2\nHSBC Bank...........................................................0.2\nMorgan Stanley......................................................0.2\nBank of America.....................................................0.2\nBank of Montreal....................................................0.2\nRoyal Bank of Scotland..............................................0.2\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n    Top 20 CDS Total..............................................$18.3\nOther...............................................................4.1\n                                                               ________\n                                                               \n      Total Collateral Postings...................................$22.4\n\n\\1\\ The collateral amounts reflected in Schedule A represent funds \nprovided by AIG to the counterparties indicated after September 16, \n2008, the date on which AIG began receiving government assistance.
