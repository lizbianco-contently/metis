Mr. President, throughout the debate on health care \nreform, the administration has made a point of asking various \nstakeholders to come together and do their part: Doctors and hospitals \nare being asked to find significant savings, seniors are being asked to \nmake major sacrifices, and so are the States. Every week, it seems, the \nWhite House hosts an event aimed at showcasing some sacrifice being \nmade by one group or another--every group, that is, except personal \ninjury lawyers.\n  It is a glaring omission, since everyone knows that the constant \nthreat of lawsuits is one of the reasons health care premiums for \nfamilies have skyrocketed more than 100 percent over the past decade \nand the primary reason many doctors today spend a literal fortune on \nmalpractice insurance even before they open their doors for business. \nTo take just one example, neurosurgeons in Miami can expect to spend \nmore on malpractice insurance every single year than many families in \nMiami can expect to spend on a new home.\n  This is a very serious problem, and everyone knows it. Yet we do not \nhear a word about it--not a word--from any of the Democratic-led \ncommittees in Congress that are working on reform. It is not because \nthe administration has not raised the issue. Last month, the President \nhimself acknowledged the widespread use of so-called defensive medicine \nor the practice of prescribing drugs or tests that are not really \nneeded just to protect oneself from the threat of a lawsuit. During the \nsame speech, the President said we need to explore a whole range of \nideas about how to scale back defensive medicine. Well, Democrats in \nCongress must not have been paying much attention to that part of the \nspeech because I have not heard a single word on this issue from any \nDemocrat since--not one. One exception was the recent suggestion by \nsome in the administration that doctors are performing unnecessary \nsurgeries just to make an extra buck. I think a better explanation is \nthe one the President gave last month when he said doctors often\n\n[[Page S8216]]\n\nperform certain procedures just to protect themselves from frivolous \nlawsuits.\n  The costs associated with ever-increasing malpractice insurance and \ndefensive medicine are indeed substantial, and both are simply, of \ncourse, passed along to consumers in the form of higher costs for even \nbasic treatments and procedures. Many Americans pay an even higher \nprice when doctors decide the threat of lawsuits and the cost of \ninsurance just is not worth it and decide to close down their practices \naltogether. Every State feels the effect of out-of-control malpractice \nsuits. One study suggests that Kentucky alone is 2,300 doctors short of \nthe national average--a shortage that could be reduced, in part, by \ngetting a handle on malpractice suits.\n  I have spoken before about the effects a culture of jackpot lawsuits \nhas on everyday Americans, on people such as Rashelle Perryman of \nCrittenden County, KY. According to an article in the Louisville \nCourier Journal, Rashelle's first two babies were born at Crittenden \nCounty Hospital, which is about a 10-minute ride from her home. But her \nthird child had to be delivered about 40 miles away. Why? Well, the \nrising malpractice rates had forced doctors at Crittenden County \nHospital to stop delivering babies altogether. They just could not \nafford the malpractice insurance.\n\n  When the threat of lawsuits drives insurance premiums so high that \nmany doctors are forced to go out of business, that mothers across the \ncountry cannot find a local obstetrician, and that health insurance \ncosts for everyone continue to go up, we have a problem that needs to \nbe addressed. Yet every single one of the so-called comprehensive \nhealth care reform proposals Democrats are currently putting together \nin Congress completely and totally ignores this issue.\n  The only people who benefit from the current system are the personal \ninjury lawyers who can end up taking up to a third of every settlement \nand, frankly, if it is appealed, an even greater percentage, and \nprotecting them is not what health care reform was supposed to be \nabout. Yet it is hard to escape the conclusion that this is precisely \nwhat is going on here. If the administration wants to be comprehensive \nin its approach, it should ask the personal injury lawyers to make a \nsacrifice, just as they have asked America's seniors, doctors, \nGovernors, and small business owners to make a sacrifice.\n  Americans do not want a government takeover of health care. They want \nreforms that everyone can understand and that all of us can agree on. \nAnd nothing could be simpler or more straightforward than putting an \nend to the junk lawsuits that drive up costs and put doctors out of \nbusiness. Americans do not want grand schemes, they want commonsense \nproposals. Medical liability reform would be a very good place to \nstart.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/29/senate-section/article/S8216-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8216]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are waiting to proceed on the \nlegislation that has come from the Appropriations Subcommittee on \nEnergy and Water, which I chair. We are on the bill, but we are waiting \nfor amendments and discussion.\n  But I want to make a point. We have had people coming to the floor of \nthe Senate yesterday, now this morning, incessantly over a long period \nof time, talking about health care. Health care is, obviously, very \nimportant; no question about that. The relentless increase in the cost \nof health care hurts families. It hurts business. It hurts government \nprograms that provide for health care. So we need to do something about \nthat.\n  But it is interesting. What I hear on the floor of the Senate from \nthe critics of these issues is: What is wrong? What is wrong? Well, it \ndoes not take a lot of energy or a lot of time to determine what is \nwrong and be a critic. I understand that.\n  I have often told the story of Mark Twain, who was asked to debate \nonce, and he said: Of course I will be engaged in that debate, as long \nas I can take the negative side.\n  They said: Well, we have not even told you the subject of the debate.\n  He said: Oh, it doesn't matter. The negative side will take no \npreparation.\n  So it is with these discussions on the floor that I have just heard a \nmoment ago and heard all day yesterday as I sat here on the floor, \ntalking about what is wrong. Well, do you know what, we know what is \nwrong. What is wrong is that we have this relentless rise of health \ncare costs. We spend more on health care than anybody else in the \nworld, by far, and we rank somewhere around 41st in life expectancy. We \nspend twice as much per person than almost everybody else in the world \nspends on health care.\n  I notice that all those critics who come out here talking about what \nis wrong with this plan or that plan never talk about prescription \ndrugs because most of those who have been out here criticizing the \nvarious plans are people who vote against legislation to put downward \npressure on prescription drugs. Yet one of the fastest rising areas of \nhealth care costs is prescription drugs.\n  Let me, if I might, ask unanimous consent to show on the floor of the \nSenate two bottles that would contain prescription drugs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. These two bottles I hold in my hand, which I have shown \nmany times, contain Lipitor. It is medicine produced in Ireland and \nthen shipped all around the world. This Lipitor, as you can see, comes \nfrom identical bottles. The same tablet, the same medicine, produced in \nthe same plant by the same company, FDA-approved by our Food and Drug \nadministration in our country, is put in two different bottles. One is \nshipped to the United States, this one, and the other is shipped to \nCanada. What is the difference? Well, there is no difference in the \nmedicine. It came from the same place, produced by the same company. \nThe difference is price. The Canadians get to pay half the price the \nAmericans pay.\n  It is not just Lipitor, the most popular cholesterol-lowering drug \nthat exists out there. It is not just Lipitor. It is prescription drug \nafter prescription drug. The American people get to pay the highest \nprices in the world. You want to talk about how you cut health care \ncosts? How about taking a whack at this and saying it is not fair that \nthe American people should pay the highest prices in the world for \nprescription drugs. Why are they required to pay the highest price in \nthe world? Because there is kind of a sweetheart deal in law that says \nthe only entity that can reimport prescription drugs is the drug \nmanufacturer itself.\n  Much of the ingredients in these drugs come from all around the \nworld--China, just as an example. The manufacturers can produce these \ndrugs in Ireland, using ingredients from all around the world, and then \nbring them in to sell to the American consumer. But the American \nconsumer cannot access the same FDA-approved drug sold in virtually \nevery other industrial country at a fraction of the price the American \nconsumer is charged.\n\n[[Page S8217]]\n\n  Why, when we hear these critics come to the floor on health care \nissues, do we not hear them suggest: Here is an area where we could \nsubstantially cut costs and give the American consumer the opportunity \neverybody else has; that is, to shop for these FDA-approved drugs in \nareas where you see much lower prices?\n  The pharmaceutical industry will say: Well, if you allow the American \npeople to do that and if we can't charge the highest prices to the \nAmerican people for prescription drugs, we will not have the money to \ndo our research to find new drugs. Well, that is not true. The fact is, \nthe pharmaceutical industry spends more money on research in Europe \nthan they do in the United States and in virtually every European \ncountry, the European consumers get to pay less money for the same \ndrugs that American consumers are now charged.\n  A bipartisan group of us has offered legislation to give the American \nconsumer the right to access these lower cost prescription drugs from \nareas where you can pay a fraction of the price for the identical drug \nthe American consumer pays the highest price in the world for. But we \nhave a staunch bunch of folks in this Chamber who support the \npharmaceutical industry and who decide that the American people \nshouldn't have this right. I would say to those who are the critics of \nvirtually anything anybody talks about in health care: Maybe you ought \nto decide to support those of us who have introduced bipartisan \nlegislation to deal with the issue of the prescription drug prices in \nwhich the American people are charged the highest prices in the world. \nIt is not fair; it has gone on too long; and it needs to be changed.\n  With respect to health care, generally, this issue is one of those \nissues that is very important. We are in the middle of a very deep \nrecession. I think job one in this country, by far, is to put the \ncountry back on track so people can get back on payrolls, get back to \nwork, and have jobs. That makes almost everything else possible. This \nis the deepest recession since the Great Depression, and we have a lot \nof work to do. This President inherited a mess, no question about that. \nHe inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit this year. It is now going to be \n$1.9 trillion because the President advanced and the Congress passed an \neconomic recovery program to try to stimulate the economy. But we need \nto get this economy back on track and then we need to begin trimming \nback these budget deficits. We cannot, for any length of time, continue \nto provide a level of government the American people are either unable \nor unwilling to pay for. That is not a path that is sustainable. It is \nnot a path that works. But the President, when he took office, said \nthere are a number of other things we need to do--one of which is to \ntry to get some control over these escalating health care costs.\n  I don't know exactly how this is going to end up. I don't know what \nplan might or might not exist at the end of the day, but I think \nCongress is going to find a way through this. I think it is useful and \nimportant and productive for us to be working and working hard to see: \nWhat are the solutions? How do we put downward pressure on prices? How \ndo we try to provide broader coverage for those who don't now have \nhealth care coverage? I think we can do this. It might well be it has \nto be done in a couple phases, the first of which is to put downward \npressure on the pricing and the second of which is to extend coverage. \nHowever we do it, we need to decide that health care costs are rising \nfar more rapidly than is sustainable. They blow a hole in the federal \nbudget deficit because the Federal Government, through Medicare and \nthrough Medicaid, is the largest consumer of health care, so we don't \nhave much choice but to find a way to do this.\n  I understand there is a lot in this health care system that wants to \nprotect what is, one of which is prescription drugs. I mentioned this \nprescription drug called Lipitor. Most people would know the name of \nthis. Why? Because when they leaf through Newsweek or Time magazine, \nthey will see a full-page ad for Lipitor. When they shave in the \nmorning or brush their teeth in the morning, if they have a television \nnear their bathroom, they will understand about Lipitor. They will \nunderstand about the purple pill. They will understand about \nprescription drugs because relentless advertising is driven toward the \nconsumer to say: Go ask your doctor if you shouldn't be taking this \ndrug. Go check with your doctor. Isn't the purple pill right for you? \nThere is relentless consumer advertising for something you can't buy \nunless a doctor believes you need it and a doctor prescribes it for \nyou. Is that something we ought to take care of maybe? I think so.\n  There are a whole range of areas that I think are very important in \nhealth care that we need to try to do something about. I think we can. \nIt is horribly complicated, very difficult, a very heavy lift, and we \nneed to do it in a way that first and foremost puts downward pressure \non health care pricing. The fact is we cannot and should not be \nspending twice as much as anybody else in the world per capita on \nhealth care only to find out that we rank 41st in life expectancy. That \nmeans we are spending much more than anybody else and not getting the \noutcome or the results.\n  So I would say to the people--including this morning, the first thing \nout of the box is the critics of health care, once again, relentlessly \non the floor telling us what is wrong. As I have said, Mark Twain knew \nthe negative side requires no preparation. So I am not sure these are \nwell-prepared arguments, but they are certainly relentless. It is nice \nto hear what is wrong. Maybe as 100 Senators who dress up in suits in \nthe morning, we could come and spend the entire day talking about what \nis right. This is a great country, one of which we have the privilege \nto live in freedom, we have the privilege to be engaged in public \ndebate. Maybe let's spend a little more time trying to figure out what \nis right about this country and find out what kinds of solutions can \nunite us rather than divide us and find out how we get the best of each \nrather than the worst of both when we talk about the political parties.\n  If we can do that, maybe we will advance this country's interests.\n  The fact is we all stand in the same hole. It is a very deep economic \nhole, the deepest since the Great Depression, and we will all be well \nadvised, it seems to me, to find ways to begin working together to \naddress these issues.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment, in no way to disrupt the order--to come back to \nthat.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, let me further ask unanimous consent that following the \npresentation of this amendment, we have a unanimous consent agreement \nto set aside this amendment for a Democratic amendment that is about to \nbe offered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1865 to Amendment No. 1813\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for \nhis agreeing to let me do this.\n  I wish to call up amendment No. 1865.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Tennessee [Mr. Corker] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1865 to Amendment No. 1813.\n\n  Mr. CORKER.

AUTHORITY OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY TO \n                   DELEGATE TARP ASSET MANAGEMENT; CREATION OF \n                   MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY FOR AUTOMOBILE \n                   MANUFACTURERS ASSISTED UNDER TARP.\n\n       (a) Authority to Designate Management.--Section 106(b) of \n     the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (12 U.S.C. \n     5216(b)) is amended by inserting before the period at the end \n     the following: ``, and the Secretary may delegate such \n     management authority to a private entity, as the Secretary \n     determines appropriate, with respect to any entity assisted \n     under this Act''.\n       (b) Federal Assistance Limited.--Notwithstanding any \n     provision of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n     2008, or any other provision of law, no funds may be expended \n     under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 \n     (Public Law 110-343) or to carry out the Advanced Technology \n     Vehicles Manufacturing Incentive Program established under \n     section 136 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of \n     2007 (42 U.S.C. 17013) on or after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, until the Secretary of the Treasury transfers all \n     voting, nonvoting, and common equity in any designated \n     automobile manufacturer to a limited liability company \n     established by the Secretary for such purpose, to be held and \n     managed in trust on behalf of the United States taxpayers.\n       (c) Appointment of Trustees.--\n       (1) In general.--The President shall appoint 3 independent \n     trustees to manage the equity held in the trust, separate and \n     apart from the United States Government.\n       (2) Criteria.--Trustees appointed under this subsection--\n       (A) may not be elected or appointed Government officials;\n       (B) shall serve at the pleasure of the President, and may \n     be removed for just cause in violation of their fiduciary \n     responsibilities only; and\n       (C) shall serve without compensation for their services \n     under this section.\n       (d) Duties of Trust.--Pursuant to protecting the interests \n     and investment of the United States taxpayer, the trust \n     established under this section shall, with the purpose of \n     maximizing the profitability of the designated automobile \n     manufacturers--\n       (1) exercise the voting rights of the shares of the \n     taxpayer on all core governance issues;\n       (2) select the representation on the boards of directors of \n     any designated automobile manufacturer; and\n       (3) have a fiduciary duty to the American taxpayer for the \n     maximization of the return on the investment of the taxpayer \n     made under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, \n     in the same manner and to the same extent that any director \n     of an issuer of securities has with respect to its \n     shareholders under the securities laws and all applications \n     of State law.\n       (e) Liquidation.--The trustees shall liquidate the trust \n     established under this section, including the assets held by \n     such trust, not later than December 24, 2011.\n       (f) Definitions.--As used in this section--\n       (1) the term ``designated automobile manufacturer'' means \n     an entity organized under the laws of a State, the primary \n     business of which is the manufacture of automobiles, and any \n     affiliate thereof, if such automobile manufacturer--\n       (A) has received funds under the Emergency Economic \n     Stabilization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-343), or funds were \n     obligated under that Act, before the date of enactment of \n     this Act; and\n       (B) has filed for bankruptcy protection under chapter 11 of \n     title 11, United States Code, during the 90-day period \n     preceding the date of enactment of this Act;\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n     Treasury or the designee of the Secretary; and\n       (3) the terms ``director'', ``issuer'', ``securities'', and \n     ``securities laws'' have the same meanings as in section 3 of \n     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78e).\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, this is an amendment to deal with the \nownership that I think many Americans have concerns about in private \ncompanies. What this amendment would do is for any company that the \nU.S. Government owns more than 20 percent of, it would place--such as, \nby the way, General Motors--what it would do is place those companies \ninto a trust and that trust would be managed by three very professional \nindividuals known to be leaders; people such as, I would hope, Jack \nWelch and others who have shown--Warren Buffett--people who have shown \nthe ability to actually look at assets of this nature and they would \nmanage this particular stock ownership through December 24 of 2011. \nThey would dispense these assets in a way that benefits the U.S. \ntaxpayers. In the event that at that time they were able to come to \nCongress and let us know it was not in the taxpayers' interests for \nthis to be done, then we could certainly grant an extension.\n  The point is to make sure the taxpayers benefit from what has \nhappened but at the same time keep all of us--as the Senator from North \nCarolina alluded to the other day, 100 people in suits--from actually \nbeing involved and keeping the administration from being involved, in \nany way, from managing these companies. I think all of us are very \nconcerned about governmental ownership. This amendment, again, would \nallow the taxpayers who were sold TARP on the basis that they would get \na return on their investment--and, in essence, this company--for \ninstance, General Motors has over $50 billion in taxpayer money in it \ntoday. What this amendment would do is it would separate the line \nbetween government and these companies but at the same time allow the \ntaxpayers of this country and our U.S. Government to recoup those \nmoneys to pay down this ever-building debt that our country has.\n  Other companies would come into this category once we got to the 20-\npercent level: Citigroup, AIG, obviously, would fall into this \ncategory. This amendment solves the issue for the long haul because as \ncompanies such as General Motors and others come into ownership by U.S. \ntaxpayers--again, we are uncomfortable with that--it separates that \nownership and puts it into a trust. It would be something the \nadministration and this Congress can have nothing to do with. Yet the \ntaxpayers' assets, these companies that we put lots of money in, are \nmanaged to the best interest of the U.S. taxpayer.\n  With that, I thank my colleague for letting me call up this \namendment. I realize this will be set aside, and we will be moving to \nother business. I hope, at some point during this debate, we will have \na vote on this amendment.\n  I thank you very much for the time and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order that a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1865, As Modified\n\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I ask that amendment No. 1865, which I \ncalled up earlier, be modified as presented at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is so modified.\n  The amendment (No. 1865), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION I. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``TARP Recipient Ownership \n     Trust Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORITY OF THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY TO \n                   DELEGATE TARP ASSET MANAGEMENT.\n\n       Section 106(b) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act \n     of 2008 (12 U.S.C. 5216(b)) is amended by inserting before \n     the period at the end the following: ``, and the Secretary \n     may delegate such management authority to a private entity, \n     as the Secretary determines appropriate, with respect to any \n     entity assisted under this Act''.\n\n     SEC. 3. CREATION OF MANAGEMENT AUTHORITY FOR DESIGNATED TARP \n                   RECIPIENTS.\n\n       (a) Federal Assistance Limited.--Notwithstanding any \n     provision of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n     2008, or any other provision of law, no funds may be expended \n     under the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or any other \n     provision of that Act, on or after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, until the Secretary of the Treasury transfers all \n     voting, nonvoting, and common equity in any designated TARP \n     recipient to a limited liability company established by the \n     Secretary for such purpose, to be held and managed in trust \n     on behalf of the United States taxpayers.\n       (b) Appointment of Trustees.--\n       (1) In general.--The President shall appoint 3 independent \n     trustees to manage the equity held in the trust, separate and \n     apart from the United States Government.\n       (2) Criteria.--Trustees appointed under this subsection--\n       (A) may not be elected or appointed Government officials;\n       (B) shall serve at the pleasure of the President, and may \n     be removed for just cause in violation of their fiduciary \n     responsibilities only; and\n\n[[Page S8219]]\n\n       (C) shall serve without compensation for their services \n     under this section.\n       (c) Duties of Trust.--Pursuant to protecting the interests \n     and investment of the United States taxpayer, the trust \n     established under this section shall, with the purpose of \n     maximizing the profitability of the designated TARP \n     recipient--\n       (1) exercise the voting rights of the shares of the \n     taxpayer on all core governance issues;\n       (2) select the representation on the boards of directors of \n     any designated TARP recipient; and\n       (3) have a fiduciary duty to the American taxpayer for the \n     maximization of the return on the investment of the taxpayer \n     made under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, \n     in the same manner and to the same extent that any director \n     of an issuer of securities has with respect to its \n     shareholders under the securities laws and all applications \n     of State law.\n       (d) Liquidation.--The trustees shall liquidate the trust \n     established under this section, including the assets held by \n     such trust, not later than December 24, 2011, unless the \n     trustees submit a report to Congress that liquidation would \n     not maximize the profitability of the company and the return \n     on investment to the taxpayer.\n\n     SEC. 4. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       As used in this Act--\n       (1) the term ``designated TARP recipient'' means any entity \n     that has received financial assistance under the Troubled \n     Asset Relief Program or any other provision of the Emergency \n     Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-343), such \n     that the Federal Government holds or controls not less than a \n     20 percent ownership stake in the company as a result of such \n     assistance;\n       (2) the term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of the \n     Treasury or the designee of the Secretary; and\n       (3) the terms ``director'', ``issuer'', ``securities'', and \n     ``securities laws'' have the same meanings as in section 3 of \n     the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78c).\n\n  Mr. CORKER. I thank the Chair.\n  If there is no objection from the managers, I might expand on the \namendment one more time, since there is no activity on the floor.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield, let me say that I happen to be \na cosponsor of the amendment. It is being offered to the Energy and \nWater appropriations bill. There may well be a rule XVI against it. It \nappears to be legislating on an appropriations bill.\n  Before the Senator expands on his remarks, I think he and Senator \nWarner have offered a constructive idea, one that I support and have \ncosponsored prior to it being on the floor. I think it is useful for \nSenators to hear a complete description of the proposal. If it is not \nresolved on this bill--and it probably will not be--my hope is it will \nbe resolved on another piece of legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his comments. What \nI have tried to do in this amendment with Senator Warner--both of us \nserving on the Banking Committee--is to create a solution that solves \nthe issue of us having U.S. Government ownership in companies, which I \nthink makes most everybody in this body very uncomfortable.\n  At the same time, we can deal with the issue of this massive Federal \ndeficit. I mentioned earlier that the taxpayers of this country were \nsold the TARP package, and we voted it into activity last fall on the \nfact that this $700 billion that was being invested in financial \ninstitutions at the time--as we know, it evolved to General Motors and \nother companies--that money was going to be invested in these \ncompanies, and 100 percent of the repayment was going to be used to pay \ndown the Federal deficit. That is what we all thought we were doing at \nthat time. That bill passed out of this body with 74 or 75 votes, with \nall of us present in the Chamber.\n  Again, the American people and all of us in this body have become \nconcerned about what types of political activities can take place when \nthe U.S. Government owns a bank or automobile company. I have seen it \nup close and personal, and I understand that political decisions can be \nmade that are not in the best interests of the company and certainly \nnot in the best interests of the taxpayers.\n  How do you solve that, create a scenario where these companies are \nseparate from us, where Representatives and Senators are not calling up \ntrying to help the companies decide what transactions they are going to \nbe involved in but at the same time make sure the proceeds of sales \nfrom these companies or the securities we own in them actually end up \nreducing the deficit?\n  This is a balanced approach. Senator Warner has joined me in this, a \nbipartisan effort to, again, move away from this body, move away from \nthe administration and the House of Representatives any ability to \naffect these companies politically but at the same time to ensure that \nany proceeds coming from the sale of these securities ends up going to \npay down the Federal deficit, which I think all of us are concerned \nabout.\n  We are all aware that under the 10-year budget that is proposed, our \ndeficit doubles from what it has been the entire history of our \ncountry--doubles over 5 years and triples over 10 years. I think people \naround this country, rightly so, are worried. I got a townhall phone \ncall last night, and people are concerned about the deficit. We are all \nconcerned. This bill will help solve that, not make it worse, and at \nthe same time remove us from any kind of politicization of these \ncompanies.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes this morning \ntalking about some of the positive developments that are taking place \nright now on this issue of health care reform. For example, this \nmorning, the President is out talking to workers who already have \ninsurance about how health care reform will work for them. He is \nspending his political capital. He is using the bully pulpit that is \nthe White House. It is clear that this is a priority for the President \nof the United States.\n  A second positive development is in the Senate Finance Committee. We \nhave a bipartisan group of six Senators. They are putting in killer \nhours at this point. I have been kidding them that I suspect they are \nbeing fed intravenously, but they are trying to put together a \nbipartisan health reform effort, and I appreciate what they are doing.\n  Third, I note my good friend from Utah on the floor of the Senate \nthis morning. He and I have made it clear that the sponsors of the \nHealthy Americans Act, a bipartisan group of 15 of senators, are very \nopen to working with Chairman Baucus, Chairman Dodd, and the President \nof the United States in a bipartisan fashion to fix health care.\n  So the question that is front and center in all of these discussions \nwith the President, with the bipartisan group in the Finance Committee, \nwith the bipartisan group of Healthy Americans Act sponsors that \nSenator Bennett and I are part of, is how we control costs in health \ncare. What are we going to do to make health care more affordable?\n  It is our judgment that the key to making health care more affordable \nis to make sure people have bargaining power and people have choice--\nthe same choice that Members of Congress have. The distinguished \nSenator from New Mexico, the Senator from Utah, and myself actually \nbelong to something that is pretty much an exchange, which is like a \nfarmers market for health insurance. But essentially what we in the \nSenate have is the opportunity to choose from a menu of private health \npolicies. We get rewarded for making an economical selection to save on \nour premiums, and we get rewarded when we choose a program that puts \nmore emphasis on prevention and health. So when Senators shop wisely, \nthey end up being wealthier and healthier as a result of being able to \nparticipate in a big exchange.\n  What Senator Bennett and I wish to do today is extend that kind of \nbargaining power to everybody in our country. After a period of time, a \nphase-in over a few years, everybody in our country ought to have a \nchance to have the kind of bargaining power and the kind of clout that \nMembers of Congress have. Everybody in our country ought to be in a \nposition to choose a policy that works for them. And when they make a \ngood choice, when they\n\n[[Page S8220]]\n\nshop wisely, the extra money should go into their own pockets. That is \nthe kind of approach Senator Bennett and I have advocated. It is a way \nto focus on these exchanges, these farmers markets which, in my view, \nare the key to getting health reform right.\n  What these exchanges do, if we set it up right, is they give all the \nmiddle-class people who are insured today in New Mexico, Utah, and \nOregon a chance to come out winners under health reform at the get-go. \nAnd if you are already insured, the President has said he is going to \nlet you keep the coverage you have. Now that makes a lot of sense. We \nsenators hear that at every meeting back in our states.\n  But if, for example, in Utah, Oregon, or New Mexico, you don't like \nthe coverage you have and you can get a better deal at the exchange, \nsomething that puts more money in your pocket, something that helps you \nand your family, let's let people do that under Free Choice.\n  Under the Free Choice proposal Senator Bennett and I have advocated, \nthat we have presented to Chairman Baucus, Chairman Dodd, and the \nPresident of the United States, this is something we can do for the \ninsured that helps them save money right at the get-go.\n  Regrettably, a number of the bills that have been considered in the \nCongress do not give people those kinds of choices. And when we look at \nhow these bills are set up, there are what are called ``firewalls'' \nthat restrict people from getting these choices. A lot of the people \nwho are advocating for a public option are not even going to get the \nchoice to enroll in one.\n  The key to helping people who already have insurance, the 160 million \nwho get coverage through their employer today, is to get these \nexchanges right and to make sure that everybody has bargaining power \nwithin these exchanges as part of a big group.\n  I have a private policy as a Member of Congress. The people in \nOregon, in effect, are my employer. They pay a portion of it. We have a \nmillion people in our group. That is the way to spread a lot of cost \nand risk through a group so you can get real value. Let's set these \nexchanges up at least so they contain big groups through a regional \napproach. Senator Bennett and I said we are open to a variety of ways \nof doing this. But let's make sure that everybody has some clout in the \nmarketplace. If you are a small business in New Mexico today, you get \nstrangled by the administrative costs of health care. You don't have \nmuch clout in the marketplace. As a small employer, you may be paying \n30 percent of your health care dollar for administration. It should not \nbe that way. We should be giving those small businesses relief.\n  What Senator Bennett and I have said with our free choice proposal is \nif you are an employer in New Mexico or elsewhere in this country, you \nmay want to take your workers to the exchange. This is employer-\nsponsored insurance. This is an employer taking their workers to the \nexchange. As an employer, you can go to the exchange in New Mexico and \nsay you want a discount because you are taking your group of workers to \nthe exchange. That is playing hard ball with the private insurance \nbusiness. That is saying to the insurers in New Mexico you are not \ndoing good enough; you are not giving me a good enough deal, so I am \ngoing to have a chance to go to the insurance exchange and get a better \none. We call it Free Choice: more options for employers and more \noptions for workers. Options that look like what Members of Congress \nhave.\n  I fear if we do not set up a system that gets this exchange right so \nthat people have bargaining power--employers and employees--we are not \ngoing to be able to get the kind of cost containment the President of \nthe United States has identified correctly as the heart of health care \nreform. It is about holding down costs. It is about making coverage \nmore affordable.\n  I urge colleagues to look at the article that was written in this \nmorning's Washington Post by Ezra Klein talking about the importance of \nthe exchange and what it can mean for the bargaining power of middle-\nclass people and businesses if it is set up right.\n  We know how to set it up right because it resembles the system that \nall of us enjoy in the Senate. At the beginning of the year, senators \nhave a choice, a menu of options. If you make a good one, the money \ngoes right into your pocket.\n  One last point with respect to Free Choice. Sometimes the best \nchoices are not the most expensive choices. Senator Bennett knows a lot \nabout this because in Utah they have a system, intermountain, that has \nillustrated that the best choices are not always the expensive choices. \nLet's make it easier for people to choose an Intermountain program or a \nMayo program or any of the other integrated systems that are regarded \nas the gold standard in terms of quality.\n  One of the concerns I have about all of these firewalls in the \nlegislation that is being considered is that Americans around this \ncountry, after a big push in the Congress to choose quality, are not \neven going to have the opportunity to choose a program like Mayo or \nIntermountain that gets more value for the health care dollar.\n  There are some positive developments in the health care debate going \non today. To highlight some of these developments, the President is out \ntalking to workers; negotiations are going on in the Senate Finance \nCommittee; and there is the very gracious approach that Senator Bennett \nand a number of Republicans are taking in terms of saying: Look, we \nwant this to be bipartisan, we want to meet the President halfway.\n  Each of those developments, it seems to me, is very positive. Fixing \nhealth care is absolutely key to fixing the economy.\n  As Ezra Klein pointed out this morning in the Washington Post, the \nreason people's take-home pay isn't going up is because medical costs \nare gobbling up everything in sight. So the key to fixing health care \nis promoting free choice; getting these exchanges right so employers \nand employees have more opportunities to hold costs down.\n  I think, in view of these positive developments I have highlighted, \nthere is reason for Senators to stay at it and keep working in a \nbipartisan way, and real progress is going to be made before this body \nleaves for the August break.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have listened with interest to my \nfriend from Oregon outline his relentless determination to get a \nsolution to this problem, and I pay tribute to him for his willingness \nto do that. I am happy to follow his leadership, as we do our best to \nsupport what has been known colloquially around the country as the \nWyden-Bennett bill, although in Utah we refer to it as the Bennett-\nWyden bill.\n  We have heard a lot of debate during the time when we should have \nbeen dealing with energy and water. Senator after Senator comes down \nand asks for permission to speak as in morning business, and they \nalways speak about health care. Since we haven't anybody else to speak \nabout the bill on the floor, Chairman Dorgan has indulged them in that \nbit of morning business.\n  The one thread that has run through much of the statements about \nhealth care has been that we must get rid of the present system, as if \nthat were a debatable issue. Everybody recognizes we must get rid of \nthe present system. The proposal Senator Wyden and I have been behind \ngets rid of the present system. And coming to the floor and giving \nexample after example of how the present system has failed Americans is \nnot the same as putting forward a legitimate proposal as to how to deal \nwith the present system. We discussed that a little yesterday, so I \nwill not go into it again.\n  I wish to make one slight addition to the comments Senator Wyden made \nwith respect to choice. When I first got here, and the First Lady of \nthe United States, Hillary Clinton, was proposing a health care \nprogram, one of the mantras we heard on the street from people who \nwould demonstrate was: We want what Members of Congress have. We want \nthe plan you have.\n  And I said--half facetiously but half seriously--I want the plan I \nhad before I came here. Because the plan I had was better than the one \nwe got as Members of Congress.\n  I point out the reason I wanted that plan is that I got to pick what \nthat plan would be. How did I get to pick what that plan would be? I \ngot to pick because I was the CEO of the company\n\n[[Page S8221]]\n\nthat made the choice. I was the only person in that company who got to \npick, because once I made the decision that this is what we will have \nin the company, everybody else in the company was dependent upon my \nwisdom.\n  Senator Wyden has pointed out we do have a wide range of choices in \nthe plan that are available to us as Federal employees. I underscore, \nwhen I discuss this with people in Utah, that because I am a Senator, I \nhave the same plan people at Hill Air Force Base have. This is the plan \nof all Federal employees. Yes, there are a number of choices and, yes, \nI am satisfied with it and I like it. But it is still true it is my \nemployer--in this case the Federal Government--who designed the plan.\n  I am glad it is a good plan. I don't think I would want to change it. \nI think I would take advantage of the promises that have been made in \nthis debate; that if you like what you have, you can keep it. But the \npoint is that someone who is an employer, who has not made that \navailable, is frozen out of the opportunity for choice by virtue of the \ndecision that the CEO of his company made. The one sure-fire question I \ncan ask and know the answer I will get at every town meeting I hold on \nthis is to say: How many of you--in the group gathered--either know \nsomebody or are somebody trapped in a job he or she hates because they \nare afraid to lose their health care benefits? Every time I ask that \nquestion, hands go up all over the room.\n  That is the kind of thing Senator Wyden and I are trying to change. \nThese people are locked in a job they hate because they are afraid they \nwill lose their health care. They are not allowed the choice of \ndeciding what their health care dollars will be spent for. It is \ndetermined for them by their employer. If we go the direction in which \nSenator Wyden and I want to go, employers that continue to offer plans \nthe employees like will find that their employees will exercise their \nright of choice to stay with that plan. But employers that say: No, we \nare going to cut corners a little and cut back on things, just because \nwe think it would be better for our bottom line if we do this, will \ndiscover that if our legislation passes, their employees will be \nempowered to say we are taking our health care dollars and going \nsomeplace else and making another choice.\n  That is the fundamental reason why we have been scored as having the \nbill that will turn the cost curve down rather than up. We change the \npresent system in a way that will allow market forces to get into the \nmix and allow people to exercise their free choice and start to save \nmoney as a consequence; whereas, all the other plans that are being \nscored as turning the cost curve up do so because they eliminate any \npower of individuals in the marketplace to exercise their choice.\n  I wish we were discussing energy and water. We seem to have turned \nthis into a discussion of health care because the other folks will not \ncome down. I won't intrude upon that any further. But having heard my \ncolleague, I felt it appropriate for me to make these additional \ncomments.\n  With that I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me make a point because we have heard \na lot of discussion about health care. My colleague from Oregon and my \ncolleague from Utah talked about this yesterday and today and I think \nit is important to point out.\n  When people talk about the choices Members of Congress have, I think \nit is giving the impression that somehow Members of Congress have some \ngold-plated health care system that other Federal employees do not \nhave. In fact, I believe the choices available to Members of Congress \nare the choices available in the Federal Employees Health Benefit \nsystem for millions of other Federal employees.\n  The reason I make that point is we have had a lot of people talk \nabout the choices Members of Congress have with their health plan. This \nFederal Employees Health Benefit Plan is available to all Federal \nemployees. All Federal employees have the same choices, by and large, \nand those are the choices Members of Congress have.\n  Last weekend, I had several people talk to me about the extraordinary \nhealth insurance Members of Congress have, and I think part of that \ncomes from this discussion about Members of Congress have all these \nchoices. It is very important for people to understand that we have the \nsame health care plan other Federal employees have--millions of them--\nand the same choices they have. I just wanted to make sure the Record \nshows that because I think it is important.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, let me pick up on the point made by the \nSenator from North Dakota because he is very accurate in his \nassessment.\n  One of the reasons they like so much this idea of trying to set up a \nmodel as we have in the Congress, with our exchanges, is because, for \nexample, somebody who is working for the Forest Service in the State of \nOregon has essentially the same kinds of choices I have for the Wyden \nfamily.\n  I think Senator Dorgan's point about trying to make clear to the \nAmerican people that these choices Members of Congress have, somebody, \nfor example, who works for the Forest Service in Oregon, has \nessentially the same choices, which involve basic health care--what we \nthink of as preventive care, primary care, being able to go see a \ndoctor, being able to get hospital coverage, and a reasonable \ncatastrophic benefit. That is what Members of Congress can essentially \nchoose from, and that is what somebody has an opportunity to get if \nthey work at the Forest Service.\n  I think Senator Dorgan's point is very valid. The reason I have come \nback to this is because, under our free choice proposal, people in this \ncountry would, in effect, be able to go to one of these exchanges, \nwhich is similar to a farmer's market, and choose from a menu of \nprivate policies, not unlike what a Member of Congress has and somebody \nwho works for the Forest Service. So I think the Senator from North \nDakota has made a good point.\n  We, of course, have a lot of bargaining power because we go into \nthese big groups, and that bargaining power can hold down \nadministrative costs and get a better deal for somebody who has \ninsurance. I would like to see, as we go forward with this legislation, \nthat these exchanges are set up around a lot of the same principles \nMembers of Congress have. Because if you do that, that is going to hold \ncosts down for people who have insurance, and it is going to make their \ncoverage more affordable. For example, the workers the President is \ngoing to see today would have additional choices in the future and save \nmoney when they are purchasing quality health care.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from North Dakota for making an \nimportant point.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1846 to Amendment No. 1813\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are ready to clear several cleared \namendments, so I ask unanimous consent to immediately consider \namendment No. 1846, which is already pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  Mr. DORGAN. My understanding is the amendment is cleared on both \nsides. I believe there is no further debate, and I ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1846) was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendments Nos. 1844 and 1845, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendments Nos. 1844 and 1845, en bloc; further, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading of the amendments.\n  I believe there is no further debate. These are technical amendments \nthat have been cleared by both sides, and I ask for their immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 1844 and 1845) were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1844\n\n   (Purpose: Provides a technical correction to a Corps of Engineers \n                                project)\n\n       Provided further, That the Chief of Engineers is directed \n     to use $1,500,000 of funds available for the Greenbrier \n     Basin, Marlinton, West Virginia, Local Protection Project to \n     continue engineering and design efforts, execute a project \n     partnership agreement, and initiate construction of the\n\n[[Page S8222]]\n\n     project substantially in accordance with Alternative 1 as \n     described in the Corps of Engineers Final Detailed Project \n     Report and Environmental Impact Statement for Marlinton, West \n     Virginia Local Protection Project dated September 2008:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1845\n\n (Purpose: Provides transfer authority for the Corps of Engineers and \n                       the Bureau of Reclamation)\n\n       Sec. __. Title IV of division A of the American Recovery \n     and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5) is amended by \n     adding at the end of the Title, the following new section \n     411:\n       `Section 411.-- Up to 0.5 percent of each amount \n     appropriated to the Department of the Army and the Bureau of \n     Reclamation in this title may be used for the expenses of \n     management and oversight of the programs, grants, and \n     activities funded by such appropriation, and may be \n     transferred by the Head of the Federal Agency involved to any \n     other appropriate account within the department for that \n     purpose: Provided, That the Secretary will provide a report \n     to the Committees on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate 30 days prior to the transfer: \n     Provided further, That funds set aside under this section \n     shall remain available for obligation until September 30, \n     2012.'\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe we will have an amendment by the \nSenator from Nebraska in a few minutes. But let me say, with the \nSenator from Utah, we need to have Senators come over and offer \namendments. If you have amendments you want to add to this bill, offer, \nand debate, we expect you to be here. Ultimately, those who have \namendments and don't come to offer them are probably going to be \nprecluded at some point because we will move to complete this bill.\n  We have sat here the day before yesterday, yesterday, and now today. \nThis is a very important piece of legislation that deals with the \nenergy and water projects across the country, and we want to complete \nthis bill, preferably this evening, if we can. In order to do that, we \nneed to at least have some semblance of cooperation, which has been \nlittle evident, at least in the past couple days.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would ask the chairman, since cloture \nhas been filed, doesn't there arise a time at which there is a cutoff \nby which amendments can be offered?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I would say to the Senator from Utah there is a 1 p.m. \nfiling deadline today. But the fact is we already have amendments filed \nbut aren't offered. So I expect we will get additional amendments \nfiled. The key is to get people down here to offer their amendments, \nbut there is a 1 p.m. filing deadline.\n  The cloture motion was filed last evening, and I understand why the \nSenator from Nevada, the majority leader, filed it. I don't think he \nhad much choice. We bring an appropriations bill to the floor that has \nvery widespread support and then it largely comes to a standstill. It \nwould not make much sense for us to be here in this position all week.\n\n  I think Senator Reid had very little choice but to file a cloture \nmotion. My hope is we would not need it. If people will come and offer \ntheir amendments, we will work with them. Senator Bennett and I will \nwork to accept the amendments we can and get the votes and perhaps this \nevening get this bill completed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask to set aside the pending \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1874 to Amendment No. 1813\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Nelson] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1874 to amendment No. 1813.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the investment by the \n Federal Government in the automotive industry of the United States is \n                               temporary)\n\n       In the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States is facing a deep economic crisis that \n     has caused millions of workers in the United States to lose \n     their jobs;\n       (2) the collapse of the automotive industry in the United \n     States would have dealt a devastating blow to an already \n     perilous economy;\n       (3) on December 19, 2008, President George W. Bush stated: \n     ``The actions I'm announcing today represent a step that we \n     wish were not necessary. But given the situation, it is the \n     most effective and responsible way to address this challenge \n     facing our nation. By giving the auto companies a chance to \n     restructure, we will shield the American people from a harsh \n     economic blow at a vulnerable time and we will give American \n     workers an opportunity to show the world, once again, they \n     can meet challenges with ingenuity and determination and \n     bounce back from tough times and emerge stronger than \n     before.'';\n       (4) on March 30, 2009, President Barack Obama stated: ``We \n     cannot, and must not, and we will not let our auto industry \n     simply vanish. This industry is like no other--it's an emblem \n     of the American spirit; a once and future symbol of America's \n     success. It's what helped build the middle class and \n     sustained it throughout the 20th century. It's a source of \n     deep pride for the generations of American workers whose hard \n     work and imagination led to some of the finest cars the world \n     has ever known. It's a pillar of our economy that has held up \n     the dreams of millions of our people. . . . These companies--\n     and this industry--must ultimately stand on their own, not as \n     wards of the state.'';\n       (5) the Federal Government is a reluctant shareholder in \n     General Motors Corporation and Chrysler Motors LLC in order \n     to provide economic stability to the United States;\n       (6) the Federal Government should work to protect the \n     investment of the taxpayers of the United States;\n       (7) the Federal Government should not intervene in the day-\n     to-day management of General Motors or Chrysler; and\n       (8) the Federal Government should closely monitor General \n     Motors and Chrysler to ensure that they are being responsible \n     stewards of taxpayer dollars and are taking all practicable \n     steps to expeditiously return to viability.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Federal government is only a temporary stakeholder \n     in the automotive industry of the United States and should \n     take all practicable steps to protect the taxpayer dollars of \n     the United States and to divest the ownership interests of \n     the Federal Government in automotive companies as \n     expeditiously as practicable; and\n       (2) the Comptroller General of the United States, the \n     Congressional Oversight Panel, and the Special Inspector \n     General for the Troubled Assets Relief Program should \n     continue to oversee and report to Congress on automotive \n     companies receiving financial assistance so that the Federal \n     Government may complete divestiture without delay.\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, the amendment I propose serves \nto address the government's significant ownership and puts the Senate \non record and makes absolutely clear that the Federal Government is a \ntemporary shareholder in General Motors and Chrysler and should divest \nits shareholder position as expeditiously as possible.\n  It is pretty clear no one ever wanted the government to be in the car \nbusiness, but the alternative was worse and the turmoil in the auto \nindustry extends far beyond Detroit, as most Americans know.\n  Dealerships across my State of Nebraska, and I am assuming across \nyour State as well, are feeling the impacts of decisions made by \nautomakers following their bankruptcies. Chrysler has terminated \nfranchise agreements with 9 dealerships in Nebraska, and GM is \nterminating franchise agreements with 21 dealerships in Nebraska. These \ndecisions are affecting dealerships, their employees, and communities \nacross my State.\n  However, now that investment has been made, we owe it to the American \ntaxpayer to be clear about what will happen with their money. My \namendment states that the Federal Government is only a temporary \nstakeholder in the American automotive industry and should take all \npossible steps to protect American taxpayer dollars and divest its \nownership interests in such companies as expeditiously as possible.\n  The government should not be involved in day-to-day operations, and \nas soon as the auto companies have regained their financial footing, \nthe government must divest.\n  Further, this resolution calls on the Government Accountability \nOffice and inspector general for the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or \nTARP, to continue to provide oversight and report to Congress on the \nautomakers' progress so the Federal Government may complete divestiture \nwithout delay.\n  This is not a partisan issue. We have had Presidents of both \npolitical parties recognize the need to address the current downfall of \nthe auto industry and recognize the need to remove government \ninvolvement as quickly as possible.\n\n[[Page S8223]]\n\n  Our sense-of-the-Senate resolution affirms what the President has \nalready made clear. Taxpayers should be protected and the government \nshould get out of the auto business as soon as possible. Through this \namendment, the Senate leaves no question about the government's future \nrole in the U.S. auto industry. In the event there has been an \nuncertainty about that ownership, this resolution will clear that up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are awaiting some word from Senator \nAlexander. He was here earlier this morning to offer an amendment. We \nindicated we would very much like to have a vote at 11:30 this morning. \nWe are trying to contact Senator Alexander and his staff. There will be \na budget point of order against the amendment offered by Senator \nAlexander, so the vote would be on the point of order that will be made \nwith respect to the budget.\n  Senator Bennett and I hope we can get this vote so we can get people \nto the floor and determine which amendments are going to be offered and \nwhen. The majority leader has been extraordinarily patient. He is \ntrying to schedule bills to the floor of the Senate. We bring an Energy \nand Water appropriations bill to the floor of the Senate, people say \nthey have amendments but they do not come to the floor to offer them, \nso the majority leader filed cloture last evening, a cloture motion \nthat will ripen tomorrow.\n  He did not have much choice but to do that, and I think what is \nhappening today demonstrates the requirement that the majority leader \nhad to file a cloture motion. It would be far better for everybody if \nwe can dispose of the amendments.\n  I think we have three amendments dealing with TARP funds. I think we \ncan dispose of the three of them. If we can have Senator Alexander come \nand reach an agreement on time and have a vote at 11:30, at least we \nwould at that point get Senators to the floor, dispose of that \namendment on a budget point of order. There will be points of order \nagainst the other two TARP amendments as well--different points of \norder, I might add.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have just spoken with Senator \nAlexander. He is on his way over and is amenable to having a rapid \nvote. So he would come over and discuss with us the unanimous consent \nagreement with respect to time.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we appreciate the cooperation of Senator \nAlexander. I know he cares a lot about his amendment. As I indicated, \nthere will be a budget point of order that lies against the amendment. \nI will make that point of order, but then we will have a recorded vote \non that point of order. My hope would be that we can do that at 11:30 \nthis morning, for the information of other Senators and their staffs, \nand we will determine that when Senator Alexander arrives on the floor \nmomentarily.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1862\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nnow resume consideration of the Alexander amendment No. 1862 and that \nSenator Dorgan be recognized to raise a Budget Act 302(f) point of \norder against the amendment; that once Senator Alexander has moved to \nwaive the relevant point of order, debate on the waiver extend to 11:25 \na.m., with the time equally divided and controlled between Senators \nDorgan and Alexander or their designees; that at 11:25 a.m., the Senate \nproceed to vote on the motion to waive, with no amendments in order to \nthe amendment during its pendency.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 302(f) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable section \nof the Budget Act with respect to my amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be. The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we have the time equally divided \nbetween now and 11:25; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would like to reserve the last minute of my time, if \nI may, for use before the vote. But I will go ahead now.\n  I thank the managers of the bill for creating the opportunity for \nthis vote. The American people want the government, the Federal \nGovernment, out of the auto business. I believe Democrats and \nRepublicans in the Senate would like to have the government out of the \nauto business. President Obama has said he would like to have the \ngovernment out of the auto business. Yet we are in the auto business in \na big way for the foreseeable future unless we take some action.\n  The taxpayers have paid almost $70 billion for 60 percent of the \nstock in General Motors and about 8 percent of the stock in Chrysler. \nMy amendment is identical to legislation which is cosponsored by the \ndistinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Bennett, and Senator McConnell, \nSenator Kyl, and others. What this amendment would do, most \nimportantly, is have the Treasury, within a year, to declare a stock \ndividend, which means to give the stock the government owns in General \nMotors and Chrysler to the 120 million Americans who pay taxes on April \n15.\n  They paid for it. They should own it. Why is that a good idea? Polls \nshow that 95 percent of Americans disagreed ``that the government is a \ngood overseer of corporations such as General Motors and Chrysler.'' We \nknow that. We have seen the incestuous relationship that develops. We \nown the company, so we call up the managers and say: Change your dealer \ncontracts. Don't close a warehouse in my district. Put your plant in my \nState. Why are you buying a battery from South Korea when you could be \nbuying one from my congressional district?\n  We can, and are, summoning the executives of General Motors and \nChrysler to the more than 60 committees and subcommittees in Congress \nthat have some say-so over these companies we own, one of which we own \na big majority of. So the executives have to drive in their \ncongressionally approved methods of transportation to Washington, DC, \nand spend time talking to us, who know nothing about building cars, but \nthat doesn't stop us from giving them a lot of advice. Then these \nexecutives go back. During that day they have talked to us, they \nhaven't designed or built or sold a car.\n  We need to get the stock out of the hands of the government and into \nthe hands of the taxpayers. Several Senators have suggested a way to do \nthat. The simplest way is the corporate spinoff or spinout. A spinoff \nis a new organization or entity formed by a split from a larger one. It \ntypically happens when we have a corporation that has a subsidiary \nwhich increasingly doesn't have any relevance to the major \ncorporation's business, so we simply give the ownership to the owners \nof the major corporation. That is what Procter & Gamble did with Clorox \nin 1969. Procter & Gamble decided Clorox didn't have anything to do \nwith Procter & Gamble anymore, so they gave all the stock in Clorox to \nthe owners of Procter & Gamble. In March 2009, Time Warner gave all the \nstock in Time Warner Cable to the people who paid for the stock in Time \nWarner. In 1997, PepsiCo gave all the stock in KFC and Pizza Hut and \nTaco Bell to the people who own stock in PepsiCo. Why should we not do \nthat with General Motors and Chrysler? The taxpayers paid for it. They \nown it. We should give the stock back to all the taxpayers who paid for \nit on April 15. We should stop this incestuous political meddling with\n\n[[Page S8224]]\n\nmajor American corporations. The only alternative, other than this, is \nto slowly sell down the stock over a period of years. Over that time, \nwe will meddle so much, General Motors will never survive.\n  This is the best thing for General Motors. It is the best thing for \nthe country. If we want to reverse this trend of Washington takeovers \nof banks, insurance companies, and car companies, this is the simplest \nthing to do.\n  I urge colleagues to vote yes on the motion to waive the budget point \nof order.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I commend my colleague from Tennessee for \nhis ingenuity, creativity, but not necessarily for his wisdom. I don't \nagree with this amendment, and I am going to oppose it and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  The U.S. Government never wanted to get in the automobile business. \nPresident Obama has said that. He said he will not run these companies. \nThat is not why he ran for President. What he tried to do is to save \nsome major companies in America and, more importantly, save jobs as \nwell. What he tried to do was create incentives for the companies to \nmake some decisions they needed to make: Chrysler to ally with Fiat for \nthe future; General Motors to basically gear down the number of cars \nthey are going to make and the number of brands, try to be a leaner \ncompany that is going to be more responsive to American consumers. That \nis why we are in the automobile business. The President, nor any member \nof his Cabinet, is not sitting down on a day-to-day basis making \ndecisions when it comes to the future of the automobile companies.\n  The Senator from Tennessee wants to take the taxpayers' investment in \nGeneral Motors and other companies and basically turn it into a couple \nshares of stock, maybe 10, 20--I am not sure--for every American. That \nmay be an approach, but I don't think it is one that is well thought \nout. What happens then at the next General Motors shareholders meeting, \nafter Senator Alexander's wish comes true? Who stands up to the \nmanagement of the company? Does each of us give up a day of work and go \nto the meeting to sit down and help make these decisions? Not likely. \nWhat is more likely to occur is that the ownership of General Motors \nwill feel no obligation. This stock ownership being distributed across \nAmerica is going to dilute the impact of shareholder rights and the \nimpact of shareholder power. I would rather have at least the prospect \nand the possibility that if the administration and management of \nGeneral Motors goes too far in one direction, they know that TARP, the \nmoney being spent there, is going to be a factor they have to take into \nconsideration.\n  What could they possibly do that would enrage the taxpayers of \nAmerica who have saved their company? They could do what some of the \nbanks did: They could declare multimillion-dollar bonuses for the \npeople who work for them. What is holding them back? Their largest \nlender, the U.S. Government, which doesn't exactly like that idea, as \nmost Americans do not. This is going to end up liberating General \nMotors in many respects--maybe some positive but also some negative, \nterrible decisions which they could make with impunity after the \namendment passes.\n  There is a reason this was defeated in the Appropriations Committee. \nThere is a reason it should be defeated on the floor of the Senate. \nBefore we embark on this idea of providing a couple shares of stock to \nevery citizen, we ought to step back and ask ourselves: Is this the \nbest outcome to make sure this company and its workers' and retirees' \nrights survive or is this kind of an ingenuous, creative idea that \nought to be thought through? This needs to be kept in the pot, boiling \non the stove a little bit longer, before we decide we are going to \nembark on what is a first of its kind in America. Every example Senator \nAlexander gave involved shareholders receiving shares in companies. \nThey weren't given to the public at large, which is what he is \nproposing here. That is a dramatic difference. We are diluting the \nimpact on the shareholders with the Alexander amendment. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in opposing it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Illinois made an eloquent argument \nabout why he believes it is better for the government to run the auto \ncompanies. I believe it is better to put it in the hands of the \nstockholders. Those are the people who pay taxes on April 15.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A minute and a half remains under the control \nof the Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I understand what Senator Alexander wants to do. I have \nsome of the same instincts. The President does as well. I don't want \nthe Federal Government running America's corporations. We want to \ndivest as quickly as we can. We want the companies to recover. But \nwhatever we do here, we need to do it in a way that protects the \ninterests of the taxpayers. Theirs are the interests that are at risk. \nTo set a date within 1 year does not protect the interests of the \ntaxpayers.\n  I happen to support a Corker amendment. I was a cosponsor of the \nCorker amendment that talks about the establishment of trustees, three \ntrustees to actually be engaged in running these companies so the \ngovernment is not running them. It talks about liquidating that trust \nby December 2011. But they would submit a report to Congress. That \nliquidation would not happen unless it maximizes the profitability of \nthe company and the return to the shareholder. That is one thing \nmissing in the Alexander amendment, the question of what maximizes the \nreturn to the American taxpayer. They are the ones who are at risk. \nWhat do we do to maximize the return, or are we going to leave tens of \nbillions of dollars on the table because somebody simply wants to pass \na piece of legislation with an artificial end date?\n  I don't disagree with the intent of wanting to get out from under \nthis issue of the Federal Government being engaged in these \ncorporations. That is why I cosponsored the Corker amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I strongly oppose Senator Alexander's \namendment, No. 1862. This amendment would undermine the hard work and \npainful sacrifices that have been made over the last several months by \nGM, Chrysler, hundreds of auto parts suppliers, thousands of \ndealerships, and millions of families. It would destroy the viability \nof the domestic automotive manufacturers, and would cost America \nthousands of jobs at precisely a time when unemployment is sky-high, \nand likely to go higher.\n  This amendment would force the government to divest its interests \nwithin an arbitrary timeframe, even if doing so would be detrimental to \nthe taxpayers, the automobile companies, and the country as a whole. If \nthe government has not divested its interest within that timeframe, it \nwould be faced with a choice: it could divest the government's \nownership quickly--before the reorganization efforts are complete and \nbenefits realized--or be forced to direct the companies to issue \nmillions of fractional ownership interests to taxpayers.\n  Approximately 138 million Americans file tax returns, and under this \namendment, they would all become shareholders. The automakers will be \nfaced with enormous administrative difficulties and unknown tax \nconsequences. For example, how much would it cost to distribute proxy \nmaterials to 140 million ``owners''? How about keeping track of \nownership interests and tax filings? Berkshire Hathaway famously hosts \nits annual meetings in a massive sports and entertainment complex. \nThere is not a venue on the planet that could host a shareholder \nmeeting with nearly 140 million owners.\n  Further, an extremely diffuse ownership base could lead to \nsignificant corporate governance concerns, with a management structure \nthat may be less accountable to shareholders, not more. Because there \nwould be so many shareholders, each would have extremely limited \nability to affect change. That is exactly the wrong direction. The \ntaxpayers deserve to have a strong voice in return for their \nsignificant investments. These penalties would be disastrous for the \ntaxpayers and could be fatal to the companies.\n\n[[Page S8225]]\n\n  This amendment would impose fiduciary duties onto administration \nofficials, with their goals to be ``maximization of the return.'' The \namendment would then also subject these officials to potential civil \nsuits. This obvious attempt to co-opt traditional corporate law \nfiduciary duties is simply inappropriate here. The Secretary and his \ndesignees have duties to uphold the Constitution and the laws of the \nUnited States; they are not simply members of boards of directors. They \nare officials of the government. And they cannot be forced to take \nactions that may be contrary to their governmental duties.\n  Of course, imposing this liability would also come with some great \ncosts. The legal costs on the companies would likely be enormous, as \nwould the time demands upon the administration officials, which would \nkeep them from their critical governmental duties.\n  The amendment would also prohibit the Secretary of the Treasury from \nspending or obligating any more funds under the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act of 2008 to any automobile manufacturer. Restructuring \nan entire industry takes patience, sacrifices, and capital. And while \nwe all hope that the capital requirements are behind us, the \nadministration's ability to ensure the success of the restructurings \nshould not be unnecessarily and arbitrarily restricted.\n  This amendment is a recipe for disaster that could undo the efforts \nthat have gone into preserving the domestic auto industry these past \nseveral months, and I urge my colleagues to join me in voting against \nit.\n  Mrs. STABENOW. I wonder if I might ask unanimous consent for 1 minute \nbefore we go to a vote?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I may have an additional minute?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the unanimous consent \nrequest, as modified?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I know there is a point of order against \nthis amendment, but despite the intent, which I appreciate and agree \nwith, of protecting taxpayer dollars, unfortunately, the way this is \ndesigned, it would actually put taxpayer dollars at risk by creating an \nend deadline so that we would have all of the taxpayers' interests \ncoming up at the same time. It would lower the value. It would put the \ncompanies at risk of a takeover, which I don't believe my colleague or \nanyone in this body would want.\n  It is incredibly important that we not try to intervene with end \ndates that are, in a way, going to backfire in terms of putting \ntaxpayer investment in these companies at risk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee has 1 minute.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am surprised by this. I thought we \nall wanted to get the stock out of the government and into the hands of \nthe taxpayers. The argument I am hearing is that the government is \nwiser than the marketplace, that it is dangerous to give the stock to \nthe 120 million taxpayers who paid for it. It is their taxpayer money. \nThey should own it. General Motors had 610 million shares before it \nwent bankrupt and 51 percent of American families own stock. This is a \nclassic difference of opinion. Do we want the government to run \ncompanies? Do we trust the government or do we trust the shareholders? \nI trust the shareholders.\n  I urge colleagues to vote aye.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the motion to \nwaive the Budget Act in relation to the Alexander amendment No. 1862. \nThe yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator \nfrom Maryland (Ms. Mikulski) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 1344\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise to talk about something I have \nbrought up several times on the floor of the Senate, which is the fact \nthat the highway trust fund, essential to continuing to build out our \nhighway infrastructure, and particularly essential in the midst of a \nrecession, is about to run out of money. We need to do something about \nthat and we need to act responsibly; not merely increase debt, increase \ndeficits, borrow more money but act responsibly to replenish this trust \nfund in a way that doesn't drive up yet more the public debt and the \nFederal Government debt. I have a proposal to do that, but it is \nessential we consider this issue now, this week, and not wait until \nnext week when the House of Representatives will not even be in session \nso we can correctly address this issue and act in a responsible way.\n  Again, it is very clear the highway trust fund is running out of \nmoney. I think it is a near universal consensus that we need to act, we \nneed to do something about it so the highway program doesn't end and \nessential construction in all our States around the country doesn't \ncome to a screeching halt. But how do we do that? That is the issue.\n  There is absolutely no reason we need to do this by driving up the \ndebt yet more, borrowing yet more money from our lenders, whoever they \nmay be, including the Chinese Government. We can do this with already \nappropriated dollars. How do we do it? Well, let's move some of the \nstimulus dollars--a very small percentage of the stimulus bill which is \nalready passed, dollars which have already been appropriated--to the \nhighway trust fund. This solves the problem and does it in a \nresponsible way, without increasing our debt level, without borrowing \nyet more money from all sorts of sources, including foreign sources.\n  I summarized this proposal in a letter to Senator Reid, cosigned by \nabout 35 of my colleagues, and we sent the distinguished majority \nleader this letter on July 21. We urged him to get behind in support of \nthis proposal, but we also urged him to take up this matter of the \nhighway trust fund now--sooner, not later--so we can have a full and \nfair debate on the issue and come to a proper resolution.\n  Why does it matter when we take this up? Well, for a very simple \nreason:\n\n[[Page S8226]]\n\nThis week we could address the issue; we could have a full, fair \ndebate; we could amend House action and send it back to the House and \ninclude the proposal that funds be shifted from the stimulus to meet \nthis essential need. Next week, we can do the same thing, but I can \ntell my colleagues the first thing that will come out of the mouth of \nthe majority leader and others will be: Well, the House is gone. The \nHouse has left town. It is take it or leave it. It is accede to \neverything they want. We can't amend it one comma, one period.\n  That is bogus. We can amend it. We can, in particular, amend it if we \nact this week. That is what we should do, as soon as we conclude \nconsideration of the Energy and Water appropriations bill, which is on \nthe floor now.\n  I urge all my colleagues to come together in a reasonable, \nresponsible debate to consider this commonsense solution of \nreplenishing the highway trust fund but doing it out of stimulus \ndollars, so we don't increase the debt yet more. After all, highway \nconstruction is exactly the sort of stimulus we can all agree on. It is \nprecisely the sort of stimulus spending that has very broad, near \nuniversal, bipartisan support. So it is fully consistent with the broad \ngoals of the stimulus.\n  With all that in mind, I would repeat a unanimous consent request \nthat I proffered several days ago. Several days ago, I asked for \nunanimous consent that the Senate call up and pass S. 1344, my bill to \nuse stimulus funds to protect the solvency of the highway trust fund. \nThis request was objected to on the Democratic side.\n  I would now renew that request and specifically ask unanimous consent \nthat the Senate enter a unanimous consent agreement that would provide \nfor a time certain, immediately following the conclusion and \nconsideration of the Energy and Water appropriations bill, to consider \nthis bill and allow for relevant amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish to \nspend about a minute to explain why I will object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I know Senator Vitter serves on the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee with me. We have worked closely \non many issues. I know he is aware that our committee has already voted \nout an 18-month extension of our highway program, our transportation \nprograms, and he also knows other committees have acted on that same \nextension--the Banking Committee as well as the Finance Committee.\n  The Finance Committee has already made sure they can find about $27 \nbillion and they have acted on that. So the first thing I wish to say \nis nobody should worry about this. This Senate is acting and we have \nacted responsibly to extend the fund for 18 months while we write a \ntransformational bill.\n  I think the Senator knows there is a lot of what he says that has \nmerit.\n  I certainly say that at the end of the 18-month period, after which \nthe stimulus program was supposed to act, if there are funds left over, \nI think it makes eminent sense to put them into the trust fund. But to \ntake them out at this time, while we are in this deep recession--and my \nfriend says what better way than to put it in the highway trust fund. \nWe have billions going to highways that have yet to be spent. There \ncould be money taken out of that.\n  I am going to object to this. The Senate is doing its work. We voted \nfor the 18-month extension. The Finance Committee has come up with $27 \nbillion of the trust fund assigned. We always have the opportunity to \nlook back when the stimulus program is set to complete and see if there \nare leftover dollars. Why would we want to take money out of this \neconomy right now, when we still have the job loss rate going up, when \nwe found the money--Senator Baucus did--as an intergovernmental \ntransfer of funds.\n  Therefore, I object to this.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. VITTER. Will the Senator yield before she gets off the floor?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Sure.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask the Senator, through the Chair, to consider the \nfact that if we don't take up this matter--however you want to fund it \nor consider it--take it up now, this week, then the argument will be \nmade next week that we have to accede to whatever the House has done, \nand we cannot do anything differently. That includes a much shorter \nextension.\n  I support the idea of an extension for 18 months, as does the \ndistinguished chair of the authorizing committee. But the House is \ngoing to pass and is passing now a much shorter extension.\n  Would the Senator not agree it is a good idea to take up the general \nmatter now, immediately following the Energy and Water bill, and not \nhave the terms of our action dictated to us next week simply because \nthe House has gone out of session?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I respond to the Senator this way: I agree \nwe should take up the highway bill now with the fix as proposed by \nSenator Baucus. I think it is totally responsible. We have hotlined \nthis reauthorization. If we can get some cooperation on both sides of \nthe aisle not to load that measure with extraneous amendments and we \ncan reach a time agreement, Senator Reid has told me to come to him. So \nwe have, in fact, sent out a hotline on both sides.\n  I would be happy to work with Senator Vitter to see if we can clear \nthe way for a time agreement because, as he knows, these appropriations \nbills are very important. The first people to object that we are not \ndoing our appropriations bills are some of my friends on the other \nside. So if we are going to take time out and do the highway bill \nreauthorization--and I hope it would be 18 months--believe me, I want \nto do it as much as anybody here, if not more, given that I am chairman \nof the committee responsible for ensuring that the fund is viable. I \nhope the Senator can help me.\n  I ask him, through the Chair, if he would be willing to work with me \nto get a clean bill forward and a time agreement that we can get moving \non this. I agree it is a great idea to do it.\n  Mr. VITTER. I very much agree with that plan forward. In that \ncooperative spirit, I would amend my unanimous consent request and ask \nunanimous consent that immediately following consideration of the \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill, the Democratic proposal the \nSenator is referring to, which has been hotlined, be made the order on \nthe floor and a time certain to consider that bill and allow relevant \namendments, including the Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, first, I asked if we could \nget something done without amendment, and now my friend says we have to \nhave the Vitter amendment. What about the Boxer amendment, the Landrieu \namendment, and the rest of the amendments?\n  Maybe my friend misunderstood me. I said I want to go to a clean 18-\nmonth extension, the way it passed out of all the committees, get this \ndone, and have a time agreement on both sides. What my friend is \nproposing is that we allow amendments, and we don't have the agreement.\n  I will object to this in the hopes that we can work it out between us \nand the leaders--a time agreement, hopefully, with no amendments; and \nthat if we have to have one or two, we have agreements on those, with \nside by sides. Then I think Senator Reid would be very open to it.\n  Obviously, if we are going to bring this up and have 30 Senators \nfilibustering here, that will not help the highway trust fund. I think \nwhat we need to do is work together to get a bipartisan agreement, \nwhere we can get a time agreement, a couple narrow amendments, if we \nhave to, and then have a vote.\n  So I will object. I will not object if we can come back with a time \nagreement, but I object at this time.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I renew the plea that we work on that sort \nof agreement to consider the matter this week immediately following the \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill.\n  Yes, I absolutely want a Vitter amendment considered because that is \nthe whole issue I have been pushing--to fund this out of the stimulus, \nnot to run up debt. I believe we can have an agreement for a very \nlimited number of\n\n[[Page S8227]]\n\ngermane amendments. But it is essential for that discussion to be \nmeaningful and that it happen this week.\n  I renew my encouragement of the chairman to help put together an \nagreement for consideration of the bill this week, a limited number of \namendments, including the concept of funding it out of the stimulus. I \nbelieve that is the way we can act responsibly and not be held hostage \nand be married to whatever the House says is the right answer, simply \nbecause they are leaving town at the end of this week.\n  I look forward to working with the chair of the authorizing committee \ntoward that end. With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, to tie this up, let me make it clear that \nI have been working with the majority leader. He is very anxious to get \nthis done. If we can get cooperation on both sides of the aisle on a \ntime agreement, we can move this very quickly.\n  I think Senator Vitter makes the point that is urgent and important. \nI agree. That is why we hotlined this, and any Senators listening, \nplease don't object to letting us go to this 18-month extension. We \nhave it figured out and paid for. Let's move forward on it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 1874.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, pursuant to the Lott precedent, I make a \npoint of order that the amendment is not germane.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Pursuant to the precedent of May 17, 2000, the \namendment violates rule XVI. The point of order is sustained and the \namendment falls.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, what is the pending business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Amendment No. 1865, as modified, offered by \nSenator Corker.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I make a point of order that the amendment is legislation \non appropriations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment violates rule XVI. The point of \norder is sustained and the amendment falls.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, time and time again, we have heard that \nour health care system is not working. Costs are too high, outcomes are \ntoo poor, and access is too limited. I agree with so many of my \ncolleagues who have spoken out over the last several weeks that the \nstatus quo is not sustainable. We must take action. We must all work \ntogether to ensure that every American has access to quality and \naffordable health care.\n  Everyone deserves stable health care coverage that they can count on, \nregardless of the job they hold or the curveballs that life may throw. \nAll Americans should be able to count on insurance premiums and \ndeductibles that will not continue to rise and eat away more and more \nof their paychecks. All Americans deserve stable health care that lets \nthem keep their doctor and their health care plan, especially if they \ntrust their doctor and their plan and they have built a relationship \nwith both.\n  Let me be clear. Health care costs are too high. Every day, in New \nHampshire and across our country, families are struggling. The crushing \ncosts of health care threaten their financial stability, threaten \nleaving them exposed to higher premiums and deductibles, and put them \nat risk for possible loss of health insurance coverage and, too often, \neven bankruptcy. Studies have shown that medical problems contribute to \nover 40 percent of the personal bankruptcies in the United States \ntoday.\n  Unfortunately, too many of us are just one heart attack away from a \npotential personal financial disaster due to the cost of health care \nand inadequate coverage.\n  In 2007, our Nation spent $2.2 trillion, or 16.2 percent of the gross \ndomestic product, on health care. This is twice the average of other \ndeveloped nations. As a country, the quality of care we receive is no \nbetter. We still lag behind other countries when it comes to \nefficiency, access, patient safety, and adoption of information \ntechnology.\n  I have one proposal that I think will help with our current health \ncare situation and, along with Senator Susan Collins, we have \nintroduced a bipartisan piece of legislation that we are calling the \nMedicare Transitional Care Act of 2009. It would help address our \nhealth care crisis.\n  The Medicare Transitional Care Act would improve quality of care \nwhile saving money. This bill aims to reduce costly hospital \nreadmission and improves the care patients receive while cutting \nMedicare costs. The legislation will help keep seniors who are \ndischarged from the hospital from having to go back. Simply put, it \nprovides transition planning for seniors on Medicare who are leaving \nthe hospital and, in doing so, it will improve the health care we offer \nour seniors, while saving money; savings that experts estimate to be \n$5,000 per Medicare beneficiary.\n  According to a report from the New England Journal of Medicine, \nalmost one third of Medicare beneficiaries discharged from the hospital \nwere rehospitalized within 90 days. One-half of the individuals \nrehospitalized had not visited a physician since their discharge, \nindicating a real lack of followup care.\n  The study also estimated that, in 2004, Medicare spent $17.4 billion \non these unplanned rehospitalizations. This problem is costly for our \ngovernment and troublesome for our seniors. The good news is, it is \navoidable.\n  Research shows the transition from the hospital to the patient's next \nplace of care--whether that is home, a nursing facility or a \nrehabilitation center--can be complicated and risky. This is especially \ntrue for older individuals with multiple chronic illnesses. These \npatients talk about difficulty in remembering instructions for \nmedications, confusion over the correct use of medications, and general \nuncertainty about their own condition. Seniors need support and \nassistance to manage their health during the vulnerable time after \ndischarge from a hospital to ensure they are not rehospitalized. This \nlegislation provides that support. This is the type of commonsense \nlegislation that needs to be included in our health reform. It saves \nmoney and it improves quality.\n\n  I am proud that in New Hampshire we have two exciting health reform \ninitiatives underway to address health care costs and improve quality. \nWe have a medical home pilot project with close to 40,000 patients \nacross the State. The medical home pilot is changing the way health \ncare is delivered and the way we think about health care, making it \nmuch more patient centered. It is encouraging doctors to collaborate \nwith other providers to create health care plans for each patient. They \nalso utilize electronic medical records to reduce errors, improve \nquality, and contain costs. It is a new way of practicing medicine, and \nit is one that will deliver better care for less money.\n  New Hampshire is also the home for the Dartmouth Institute for Health \nPolicy, which is the leader in comparative effectiveness research. It \nhelps empower patients to make vital health care decisions.\n  The research provided by the Dartmouth Atlas Project has provided \ncritical analysis about the difference in the amounts of money we spend \non health care in different regions of the country. The research also \nshows that these differences in spending have no impact on health \noutcomes. I want to repeat that because I think this goes to the crux \nof one of the problems we are having with our health care system. What \nthe research at the Dartmouth Atlas Project and other places around the \ncountry has shown is that differences in spending have no impact on \nhealth outcomes.\n  It is amazing to me that regions that spend more money on health care \ndo not necessarily produce better health\n\n[[Page S8228]]\n\ncare results. We must address this inadequacy as we turn to health care \nreform, and we must empower patients to make them equal partners in \ntheir health care decisions. Research supports this point. In fact, it \nshows that up to 40 percent of the time, patients who participate in \ndecisions related to their care will choose procedures that are less \ninvasive and less costly. These choices produce better outcomes with \nhigher rates of satisfaction. We must remember to keep patients at the \ncenter of this debate on health care reform.\n  Finally, people are struggling because of the high cost of health \ninsurance. It is a burden to families in New Hampshire and across the \ncountry. In my State, there are nearly 150,000 people who have no \nhealth insurance, even more who are underinsured with policies that do \nnot provide the coverage they need. For those who do have insurance, \nthe costs are very high.\n  Over the past 9 years, premiums for employer-sponsored health \ninsurance have more than doubled--a growth rate that is four times \nfaster than cumulative wage increases. This has created a huge burden \non middle-class families.\n  In my State of New Hampshire, from 2002 to 2006, there was a 41.6-\npercent increase in the premiums businesses paid for an individual plan \nfor their workers. For our smallest businesses, those with fewer than \n10 employees, the increase was almost double that, a 70.6-percent \nincrease. That is staggering, and that disturbing increase in premiums \ncaused what one would expect: Many small businesses dropped their \ncoverages. That is unacceptable. Health care costs and insurance costs \nmust be contained.\n  Chuck Engborg from Ashland, NH, talked about the high cost of \ninsurance and the instability of the insurance market at a recent \nhealth care roundtable I attended in New Hampshire.\n  Almost 30 years ago, Chuck was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. He \nsuffered a mild stroke, a heart attack, and he has had five bypass \nsurgeries. He also developed a complication from his diabetes that \nrequired him to walk on crutches for 3 years. Despite all of that, \nChuck has lived to tell his tale, but the turning point for him came 2 \nyears ago when his wife Kathy was laid off from her job. They had to \npurchase COBRA health insurance and found that the cost of COBRA, plus \nhigh copays, amounted to 50 percent of their annual income. In the \nmeantime, Kathy also suffered a heart attack that resulted in her own \nbypass surgery. They are two of the lucky ones because Kathy has found \nnew employment and they have health insurance through her job. But that \nhealth insurance comes with a very high annual deductible.\n  I heard a similar situation from a woman named Laura Mick from \nManchester who also struggles with high insurance costs. While she has \nnot had surgery in 16 years, the insurance companies are able to target \nher and charge her outrageous rates under a preexisting condition \nloophole.\n  Laura was born with a cyst on her brain. Fortunately, it was \nrecognized by doctors a few weeks after she was born, and at 1 month \nold she underwent surgery. A shunt was inserted into her brain to drain \nfluid and another surgery at 16 years old to relieve the pressure. She \nis currently an active young woman in her late twenties, and she works \nhard to maintain a healthy lifestyle. But she is not being rewarded for \nit. She has been denied from every insurance company in New Hampshire \nunless she accepts the high-premium, high-deductible plans.\n  We need to enact health care reform to help people like Chuck and \nLaura. We need to ensure that every American has access to affordable, \nquality health care they can count on when they need it. This is a \nbasic principle on which many business groups, labor organizations, and \nmedical professionals now agree. We must take steps as a nation to \nreduce the costs of health care while improving the quality of care \nAmericans receive.\n  Health care reform is economic reform, and I believe that for our \neconomy to truly recover and prosper, we must help middle-class \nfamilies, businesses, and Federal, State, and local governments cope \nwith the skyrocketing health care costs. The status quo is not working, \nand it is clearly not sustainable.\n  We need to act, and we need to act soon. I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact health reform \nthat addresses the health care cost crisis and ensures quality, \naffordable health care for everyone in New Hampshire and across this \ncountry.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \naddressing one of the biggest issues facing our economy and our \ncountry; that is, the threat posed by global warming. This challenge \npresents us with an opportunity as well. It is the opportunity to \nrevitalize our economy while simultaneously changing our national \nenergy policy to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and to increase \nour energy efficiency and conservation, which will save money for the \npeople of Pennsylvania, as well as people across the United States.\n  We have a long debate ahead and a lot of issues to discuss, but I \nbelieve it is critically important, in these weeks in the summer \nleading up to the break Congress will take, to begin the debate, which \nI know will continue into the fall and maybe beyond that.\n  I do agree with a majority of accredited climatologists and \nscientists that human-caused global warming is a threat. Specifically, \nglobal warming is a threat to our economic and national security. It \nthreatens our economic security because the problems we face become \nmore expensive the longer we do not act.\n  If the past is any indicator of our future, we should be concerned \nthat over the past 28 years--1980 to 2008--the cost of the 90 largest \nweather events that happened in that time period was $700 billion--$700 \nbillion attributable to those weather events. If we do nothing and the \nworst-case scenarios become a reality, mitigating the change in our \nclimate will be expensive and difficult.\n\n  Global warming threatens our national security by setting off a chain \nof events that could lead to decreased food production, relocation of \nlarge numbers of people, an increase in extreme weather events, and a \nrise in sea levels.\n  Like many Americans, I came to understand this challenge in a way \nthat was very poignant. I remember reading a Time magazine story a few \nyears back, and it talked about the percentage of the Earth that has \nbeen the subject of drought. That percentage of the Earth's surface \nthat has been the subject of drought doubled in about 30 years. That is \nall we need to know. We know what drought means: it means disease and \nhunger and darkness and death. That is the threat posed by global \nwarming.\n  The threat is real enough that we are now currently assessing the \nreadiness of our military to protect us and keep the peace should \nglobal warming continue unchecked. One area of the world we are \nexamining in that analysis to determine the impacts is the region that \nencompasses Pakistan, India, Afghanistan, and the Indus River that is \nfed by the Himalayan glacier which all three countries share. The \nchanging global climate is causing that glacier to retreat; that is, to \nmelt and disappear. Once the glacier is gone, the Indus River is \nexpected to lose 30 to 40 percent of its waterflow. India, Pakistan, \nand Afghanistan are already water-stressed countries that rely heavily \non that river. I don't think I have to explain to this Chamber or \nanybody else the national security implications of that threat, \nespecially with regard to Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n  What a permanent drought would mean for countries is those countries \nnot having enough drinking water and not able to grow food in those \ncountries as a result of that threat.\n  I understand this may seem a long way off to the people in \nPennsylvania or in other States around the country who at this time, \nand at a time of economic stress, are leading lives of struggle and \nsacrifice and real hardship. They are struggling to keep their jobs,\n\n[[Page S8229]]\n\npay their mortgages, put their kids through college, or pay for this \nweek's groceries. What we do on climate change does affect their lives \ndirectly--not indirectly, directly.\n  I wish to talk this morning about the economy and jobs as it relates \nto this issue. We all know things are tough for so many people right \nnow in our country. We are suffering through the worst recession since \nthe Great Depression. But I think it is time--instead of talking about \nhow we got here on a day like today--to focus on the future.\n  One of the solutions is transforming the way we produce and use \nenergy, which saves bill payers money and creates new jobs along the \nway. The good news is that these jobs are not the same hazy concept as \nrelates to the future. We are creating clean energy jobs right now in \nPennsylvania. To give one example among many I could cite, Aztec Solar \nPower in Philadelphia employs a team of solar experts, certified \nelectricians, installers, and energy consultants to build systems for \nresidential and commercial buildings. Not only is Aztec employing \nPennsylvanians in clean energy jobs now, they plan to expand their \nbusiness. The company is constructing a $10 million manufacturing \nfacility in York, PA, and will create over 100 new jobs.\n  I believe we in this country on this issue are right at a crossroads. \nOne direction we could take--and some people in Washington want to take \nthis direction--is business as usual, keep losing jobs, keep losing our \ncompetitive edge to countries such as China, which is outinvesting us \nand outinnovating us when it comes to new energy technologies and the \njobs that come from that.\n  I believe we can take a different direction. We should move down a \ndifferent path, a path where America will reclaim its competitive edge, \nbring manufacturing jobs back home to Pennsylvania and States across \nthe country, give us the opportunity to manufacture new technologies \nfor exporting those technologies to other countries, and create a new \neconomic engine that will put people back to work.\n  This is a strategy for economic renewal. Creating a new energy policy \nwith a focus on building clean energy jobs and innovative energy \ntechnologies will take time. Indeed, it will take time, but it will \nalso take leadership. It will take the dedication, the know-how, the \ningenuity, and the innovative skills of the American worker. A lot of \nthose workers are in Pennsylvania.\n  So the choice before us is clear: We can stay on the road we have \nbeen on, which we know leads to not just more drought and darkness and \ndeath but also leads to job loss in the end because our economy won't \nhave the dynamism to compete with places such as China, or we can take \na different path--the path of change, the path of reform, the path of \nnot doing business as usual. I think it is time we create policies that \nwill rebuild our economy and create permanent new energy technology \njobs in Pennsylvania and in States across the country. We know how to \ndo this. We have done it before, throughout our entire history in our \nState as well as States across the country. We have to do it again.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       In Praise of Dave DiBetta\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise once more to recognize our great \nFederal employees. Many Americans can recall from memory the acronyms \nof several Federal law enforcement agencies--FBI, DEA, ATF, and TSA, to \nname a few. These are more than just acronyms. These agencies are \ncomposed of thousands of hard-working men and women who risk their \nlives to ensure our safety. Today I will share the story of one such \nlaw enforcement agent from my home State of Delaware.\n  When speaking about someone from Delaware who has spent a career \nrisking his life in service to others, I cannot help but think of the \ngeneration of Delawareans who fought for independence. They, in \nparticular, are part of the tradition of public service and courageous \nsacrifice that has always characterized the people of the First State.\n  I am reminded of Caesar Rodney who, on the 1st of July, 1776, rode \nhis horse 80 miles through a thunderstorm from Dover to Philadelphia to \ncast a decisive vote in favor of independence. I can only imagine the \nlook on the faces of the other delegates when Rodney burst into \nIndependence Hall, soaking wet in his riding boots, eager to do his \npart for liberty.\n  Rodney had already risked his life for the cause of American \nindependence. A month before his famous night ride to Philadelphia, he \njoined with fellow patriot Thomas McKean at the old courthouse in New \nCastle. There, before the Delaware Colonial Assembly, the two made the \ncase for separation from Great Britain.\n  The unanimous resolution by the Delaware Assembly in favor of \nseparation was the first of its kind. By this brave act, its members \nbecame traitors to the Crown, punishable by death. This went a long way \nin encouraging the delegates to the Continental Congress to vote for \nindependence.\n  Delaware has a long legacy as a pioneer among States. We are \nrecognized as the First State because, as many Americans know, Delaware \nwas the first to ratify the Constitution. Just as we took the first \nstep toward independence, we led the way in accepting the ideas about \ngovernment that were radical in 1787 but which are recognized today as \nfundamental to preserving our liberty.\n  So many Delawareans continue in this tradition of service today. One \nof them is Dave DiBetta of Wilmington, who has been a special agent for \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives for over 20 \nyears.\n  Prior to his service with the ATF, Dave served as a military \npoliceman in the U.S. Army, stationed at Fort Miles in Lewes, DE. He \nalso worked as a customs inspector at JFK in New York. In 1988, Dave \njoined the ATF as a special agent in New York. Two years later, he was \ntransferred to the Houston Division's Special Response Team, which \nfocuses on high-risk missions.\n  While serving as an agent in New York and Texas, Dave participated in \nover 350 high-risk operations, and he was decorated with the ATF's \nDistinguished Service Medal in 1993. In 1996, Dave began work at ATF \nheadquarters, helping to lead large-scale investigations and managing \nthe bureau's photography program with a $57 million budget. He also \ntaught undercover investigation techniques at the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Center.\n  Dave returned to Delaware in 1999, where he continues his work in the \nDelaware office, overseeing tobacco and firearm investigations. Dave \nhas assisted in providing security for the 1996 Republican Convention, \nthe 2000 Democratic Convention, as well as the 1996 and 2004 Olympic \nGames. In the days following the September 11 attacks, Dave was \nassigned to special duty as air marshal for 6 months, helping to \nrestore public confidence in air travel and serving on the front line \nagainst terror.\n  As part of his duties in Wilmington, Dave represents the ATF at the \nDover Downs raceway. He has trained staff how to identify and prevent \nimprovised explosive devices, ensuring the safety of spectators.\n  Over the course of his two-decade career, Dave has been awarded eight \nspecial service awards, the ATF Director's Award, and several letters \nof commendation. He currently represents the ATF in the leadership of \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Officer Association, and he helped restart \nthe association's Delaware chapter.\n  When asked about why he decided to work in public service, Dave \npointed to the value of voluntarism he learned as an Eagle Scout. He \nalso said he wanted a life characterized by a sense of adventure. Dave \nsaid:\n\n       I have never had 2 days in my career that were the same. I \n     have traveled to just about every State, been overseas to \n     four countries, I have seen the good and the bad, but one \n     thing I can never say is that it was boring.\n\n  Dave and his wife are active in the Wilmington community, \nvolunteering\n\n[[Page S8230]]\n\ntheir time for community service projects with St. Anthony's Church and \na number of charitable organizations. I had the privilege of meeting \nDave last month at the St. Anthony's Italian Festival in Wilmington, \nand I am so glad he and his family could be here today at the Capitol.\n  Dave DiBetta's story is one of so many in Delaware and across the \ncountry. His willingness to risk his own safety and serve the common \ngood recalls the heroism of our revolutionary forebears, such as Caesar \nRodney, Thomas McKean, and those other Delawareans who were the first \nto vote for separation and who fought for freedom.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring the contribution made \nby Dave and other Federal law enforcement agents who daily risk their \nlives to keep our citizens safe. They all deserve our gratitude.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before he departs from the floor, I \ncommend our colleague from Delaware, our new colleague from Delaware, \nSenator Kaufman.\n  Senator Kaufman was appointed to fill the seat of my great friend and \ncolleague and seatmate for many years, Joe Biden. And while he has only \nbeen here about 6 months as a new Member of the Senate, what a \nwonderful contribution he has made. I have watched him over the last \nnumber of weeks, with his focus and attention on people who work for \nour country every single day but who probably will never get much \ncredit for showing up every day and doing a wonderful job on behalf of \nthe American people. Whether they be civil servants, police officers or \nothers--the military--the fact he has taken as much time--almost on a \ndaily basis, I say to my colleagues and others who may be watching \nthese proceedings--Senator Ted Kaufman of Delaware has made it his \nbusiness to express our collective gratitude to these people who serve \nour country every single day to keep us safe and secure and to keep us \nfunctioning as a society.\n  It may not seem like much to some, but I will guarantee there are \nthousands of people today who are at work who appreciate it. And there \nare millions more, I suspect, whose family members, whose neighbors, \nwhose coworkers, and others appreciate the recognition he has given \nthem, as well as some ideas he has brought to the table legislatively \nto make a difference for people.\n  So I commend my fellow colleague. For a relative newcomer and a short \ntimer, he has made a substantial contribution to our country, and I \nthank him for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I wish to say that this has been a \nlabor of love for me, talking about great Federal employees. And I must \nadmit that one of the truly great Federal employees, who embodies \neverything I talk about when I talk about the other Federal employees--\nin terms of dedication, in terms of sacrifice, in terms of commitment, \nin terms of intellect, in terms of participation--is the Senator from \nConnecticut. I have admired him for many years, and watched how he has \ndone us all proud, and makes every Federal employee proud of the fact \nthat they are a Federal employee, and demonstrates how important our \nFederal employees are.\n  I thank the Senator from Connecticut for his kind remarks and for his \nlong and honorable service.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Senator. I did not intend to turn this into a \nrecipient compliment, but I thank him tremendously, and if he wants to \ntalk a little longer, that is fine.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I have been on the floor every day and \nspeaking about health care, for a few minutes anyway, although I know \nthere are other matters of business before this body.\n  I am privileged to work with the Presiding Officer on the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee--a new member who has made a \ntremendous contribution as well to our efforts--and as she knows, back \na few weeks ago, we went through that marathon session to try to at \nleast fulfill our obligation on the health care debate and to deal with \nthe matters over which we have jurisdiction--things such as prevention \nand the quality of health care, the workforce issues, the fraud and \nabuse questions, as well as other matters. Obviously, the Finance \nCommittee has to grapple with these as well. So I thought it would be \nworthwhile, over these last number of days, to talk about things we \nhave done in our bill. It will be a part, I hope, of a combination of \nefforts when we meet hopefully in the next few weeks, depending upon \nthe outcome of the efforts in the Finance Committee, which we are all \nwaiting for with anticipation, and confidence, I might add, as well.\n  I have a lot of confidence in Kent Conrad, and Max Baucus, Chuck \nGrassley, and Jeff Bingaman, and others involved in these negotiations \nto try to reach some understanding that will allow us to move forward. \nBut I thought in the meantime it would be helpful to talk about various \nconstituencies in the country and what this means to them. Because I \nthink we all want to know how does this affect me and my family--what \nwe are doing here. People are saying: I know you are talking about \naccess, and you are talking about quality of health care, talking about \nthe cost of health care, but I wish to get some idea of what are you \ndoing and how it affects me and my family, and where is this all \nheading.\n  So while we are only in the first stages of developing what we hope \nwill be a comprehensive proposal on health care reform, it is important \nthat we at least communicate with people where we are coming from and \nhow we look at these issues.\n  We have all heard the numbers, that 47 million Americans have lost or \ndo not have health care today--a statistic I bring up every day, \nbecause I think it is important to point out. We completed our work \nabout 2 weeks ago on the Affordable Health Choices Act. Since we \ncompleted our work 2 weeks ago, 196,000 fellow citizens have lost their \nhealth insurance. About 14,000 a day lose their health care coverage. \nAbout 100 people in Connecticut lose their health coverage, for one \nreason or another--they lose their jobs or their employers decide to \ndrop their coverage; all sorts of reasons that can cause someone to \nlose their health care. Overall, it is about 14,000 a day.\n  These are people who have health insurance but are losing it. These \nare not people who have no insurance. They are just added to the rolls. \nAnd some people get health insurance as well and come off the rolls. So \nit is important to point out that happens as well.\n  But it is worthwhile to note that every single day we go forward in \nthis process--and it is an important and deliberative process. I am not \nin favor of rushing something through. We need to get this thing right. \nIt is a terribly complex matter. We have all noted that almost every \nsingle Congress over the last 70 years, along with almost every \nadministration over the last 70 years, has tried to solve this issue. \nSome have succeeded in part. But there is a reason this has not \nhappened up to now. It is because it is not easy. I commend our \ncolleagues for trying as well as commend the Obama administration for \ninsisting this issue be such a high priority.\n  Why is that the case? It is not just because it would be nice to get \nit done. It is because if we do not get something done, the status quo \nis debilitating, to put it mildly--first, in macroeconomic terms of \nwhat it does to our country, in terms of consuming such a large part of \nour gross domestic product, that easily could jump to 35 percent. What \ndoes that mean to the average family? That gross domestic product \nnumber, which may not mean much to many people--what does that mean? It \nmeans the average family could, in 8 to 10 years, if we did nothing and \nlet the status quo continue, that about 50 percent of your gross income \nwould be consumed in paying for health care premiums if you wish to \nhave your family covered. Obviously, that is unacceptable and \nunsustainable. If we were to end up consuming that much of our gross \ndomestic product and our incomes each year, families could not survive.\n\n[[Page S8231]]\n\n  Today I would like to speak for a few minutes about a group of \nAmericans who are being cheated by the current system. Those are the \nvery people who are affected by this number, people who have health \ncoverage but lose it every day because of various economic \ncircumstances or other problems they face and for whom I would also say \nthe status quo is unacceptable. These are Americans who have insurance \nbut are underinsured. Their numbers are roughly 25 to 30 million of our \nfellow citizens. Obviously, it changes every day as many lose their \ncoverage. These are about 25 to 30 million people who cannot get the \ncare they need. These people paid good money for health insurance, and \nthey think in exchange they are going to receive at least some \nguarantee that if things go wrong--if someone in their family gets a \ncancer diagnosis or is hit by an automobile or some other injury \noccurs--at least they will not have to be concerned about whether they \ncan afford to pay for the care they need.\n  They worry, obviously, about getting better, getting back on their \nfeet. But there is that sense of stability and certainty that I have a \nhealth care plan. I am not going to get wiped out. I am not going to \nget ruined economically. I have insurance. It may not be great, but I \nam in pretty good shape. I feel pretty confident, if something tragic \nhappens, I will be OK. That is what insurance literally is supposed to \nmean.\n  Life is uncertain. Unfortunately, things happen to all of us. People \nget ill, injured, people get hurt. While you expect to get better, you \nwant to be sure you are not going to get wiped out. But in our Nation, \nthe wealthiest in the world, of course, nobody should lose their home \nor their economic security because of an illness or injury, in my view. \nWe write checks to insurance companies every month or see premiums \ndeducted from our paycheck and what do we expect in return? We expect \nthat if something happens, we at least will not have to worry about \nanything but getting better, getting back on our feet again.\n  Unfortunately, for tens of millions of our fellow citizens, that is \nnot how it works at all. These are people who have insurance, but they \ncannot be sure about anything. There is the uncertainty of what will \nhappen. Some find out the hard way that their insurance does not cover \nwhat they thought it covered. That fine print you kind of glazed over \nwhen you signed onto that contract, I know we all wish we had read it \nbetter, understood it better, but the reality is, when you finally are \nin some situation and you go to this company and say I think I am \ncovered, they say: I am sorry, but if you had read this more carefully \nyou would have understood that fact situation is not covered, that your \npreexisting condition that you didn't properly let us know about \nexcludes you from the kind of coverage in these situations. You may \nhave high deductibles and copays. You may have an injury that can be \ntaken care of for $5,000 or $10,000, but your insurance doesn't kick in \nuntil after that.\n  Five or ten thousand dollars may not seem like much for some, but for \na working family, that can also be a major economic crisis.\n  Some who suffer from serious illnesses, such as cancer, hit an annual \nor lifetime benefit cap; thus, the sickest Americans find themselves \ncut off entirely.\n  Our legislation, by the way, that we adopted, the Presiding Officer, \nmyself, and 21 other Members of the Senate, we eliminate preexisting \nconditions so you never again have to be excluded from coverage because \nof that preexisting condition. We will not exclude you because of \nportability. Today if you moved you could lose your coverage. And we \nwill not allow these caps either. Today you could find out that while \nyou have a serious illness, your coverage will take care of you for a \nweek or two, or three or four or five visits, but that is it. Our \nlegislation eliminates those kinds of concerns that people have worried \nabout for a long time.\n  Many of our fellow citizens, of course, have children. Children have \ndifferent health care needs than adults. For millions of children who \nfall under insurance provided by their parents' employer, those needs \nare not covered. Some have that coverage taken way by a profit-hungry \nbureaucrat at the moment when they need it the most, and many of our \nfellow citizens watch as skyrocketing premiums slowly consume more and \nmore of their family budget until they have to choose between having \ntheir kids uninsured or having them receive the kind of benefits they \nought to be receiving as children.\n  When we talk about health care reform, we are not talking about a \nfree gift for the American people. We are talking about keeping a \npromise to our fellow citizens. We are talking about guaranteeing that \ninsurance actually insures against economic ruin for working families. \nAs it stands today, millions of our fellow citizens with health \ninsurance are spending their life savings on care; 50.7 million insured \nAmericans spent more than a dime out of every $1 they earned on health \ncare last year. That is, more than 10 percent of their income today is \nspent on health care; last year, more than 50 million of our fellow \ncitizens. For almost 14 million of our fellow insured Americans it was \nmore than 25 cents out of every $1 of their income that was spent on \nhealth care. As it stands, millions of our fellow citizens, not just \nthe uninsured, are unable to get the care they need when they need it.\n  Let me share some numbers, if I can. I am always reluctant to do this \nbecause numbers can glaze over the eyes of people, but people can find \nthemselves in these situations. These numbers affect people with \ninsurance primarily. Some here are without insurance but primarily with \ninsurance. Today I wish to focus on the underinsured--not the people, \nthe 47 million without insurance, I am talking about the 30 million now \nunderinsured or those who have insurance but have high deductibles and \nexpect out-of-pocket expenses.\n  Thirty-seven percent of people insured in our country took home \nremedies or over-the-counter drugs instead of seeing a doctor. They \ndecide to go that route rather than getting the kind of care that would \nreduce their health care problems; or 31 percent postponed getting \nhealth care they need because of cost; or they skipped a recommended \ntest or treatment, 27 percent; or they did not get a prescription \nfilled, around 25 percent; and close to 20 percent cut pills in half or \nskipped doses altogether in order to try to meet their health care \nobligations. Obviously, in doing so they put themselves at greater risk \nfor even more problems medically, thus raising the cost for care when \nthey end up going back in to treat a problem that could have been \ncontained if, in fact, they were taking the medication as prescribed.\n  This gives you some idea of the kind of choices people make who are \ninsured. These are not the uninsured now, these are insured. This is in \nterms of what they need in order to provide for themselves.\n  When we talk about health care reform, I think it is very important \nwe talk about the many people in this country who believe they are in \ngood shape and are not worried they are going to lack coverage if, in \nfact, a health care crisis confronts them. The reality is, this \nconstituency of our fellow citizens with insurance has much to worry \nabout with the status quo; thus, the necessity for reforming a system \nin areas where it is broken and leaving alone those areas where it \nworks pretty well.\n\n  This is not just people, again, who do not have insurance. These \nnumbers include people, obviously, who have insurance. Americans with \nhealth insurance are forced into bankruptcy, as we know, as well. The \nnumbers are not ones I make up; 62 percent of the bankruptcies in our \ncountry over the last several years occur because of a health care \ncrisis in that family. That statistic is alarming. The next statistic \nis even more alarming to me--75 percent of that 62 percent are people \nwith insurance. Here are people with insurance who ended up in \nbankruptcy because of a health care crisis. That is the last thing you \nwould assume to have happen to you. If you have health insurance and \nyou run into a major health care problem, you are assuming because you \npaid those premiums you are not going to be put into bankruptcy or \nfinancial ruin. Three out of four people in that 62-percent number had \nhealth insurance and still ended up being bankrupt or put into a \nbankruptcy situation.\n\n[[Page S8232]]\n\n  Fifty percent of foreclosures--there are 10,000 foreclosure notices \nevery day in the country, roughly. Those have been rather static for a \nlong time. But 50 percent of those notices went out to families who are \nlosing their homes because of a health care crisis.\n  I don't know the number of how many of that 50 percent had insurance \nor not. I don't have the same statistic as I did for the numbers of \nbankruptcies. We ought to try to get that number if we can, to find out \nwhat percentage of the 50 percent actually had insurance at the time \nthey got the foreclosure notice.\n  Americans with health insurance give up the financial foundation they \nhave worked a lifetime to build because we have not taken the action to \nfix the system that too often is designed to deprive them of the \ncoverage they thought they bought at the very critical moment they need \nit. What I discovered over the years is there are sort of two groups of \npeople within the insured category. Everyone in that category has \ninsurance. As long as you have never had to deal with it, then you feel \npretty secure about it--and you should--because you think you are \ncovered. If all of a sudden you find yourself dealing with it and you \nthought you had the coverage, that is when it drives you to \nfrustration, to put it mildly, when you discover that condition was a \npreexisting condition; there were caps on how much you could get for \nthat; that, in fact, the very illness you have was never covered under \nthe insurance policy.\n  That is where an awful lot of people discover, despite that sense of \nsecurity they had, that the present system is more designed to deprive \nthem of the coverage they need rather than to help out during those \ncrises. That is why this issue is so important.\n  Again, this is a complicated one. There are no simple answers to it. \nWe are not going to resolve all those problems even with one bill. It \nwill be a perpetual struggle for us to get this right in the years \nahead, but we need to from an economic standpoint, as well as serving \nthe needs of individual people.\n  This debate is not just about the uninsured. I think we make a huge \nmistake if we leave that impression with our fellow citizens. This is \nnot just about the 47 million without insurance. We would all like to \ndo something to see to it that people who are uninsured get coverage, \nbut it is about the millions of people who have insurance, the 30 \nmillion underinsured, and the many more who have insurance but could \nfind themselves without the kind of coverage they anticipate having.\n  Each one of us, of course, insured or not, is hurt by inaction. \nPremiums are rising faster than wages. One insurance company in my \nState of Connecticut the other day announced they were raising their \nrates by 32 percent. Imagine that, a 32-percent increase in premium \ncost for health insurance coverage.\n  The average family writes a check for $1,100 in our country, $1,100 \nto cover the uninsured because we in this country take care of people. \nIf you are uninsured in Connecticut or North Carolina and something \nterrible happens to you and you show up in a hospital in Charlotte or \nHartford, we take care of people. That is because of who we are. If you \nwalk into the emergency room, we do not throw you out, we take care of \nyou. I am proud I live in a country that does that. But Americans need \nto know it is not free when people show up without insurance, with no \nability to pay for the care they get in North Carolina, Connecticut or \nanywhere else. That bill gets passed on.\n  To whom does it get passed on? To the insured who get added costs in \npremiums to get covered. That is a tax you are paying each year, about \n$1,100 to pay because of uncompensated care. We try to address that \nbecause we ought to.\n  That is one way to bring down the costs for the insured in our \ncountry. There are other ideas as well that our committee worked on: \nprevention; the quality of care; reducing some of the problems with the \nfive chronic illnesses that consume 75 cents of every $1 in our Nation \nfor health care. These are measures we take to try to move that curve, \nif you will, downward when it comes to affordability and cost, as well \nas, of course, improving the quality of health for all our fellow \ncitizens.\n  Of course, in this body, we all have health insurance--I made that \npoint over and over again, every Member of Congress, every Member of \nthis body. I never had to go to bed at night with one eye open, \nwondering whether, if something happened to my 4-year-old or 7-year-old \ndaughters, I would be able to pay for it in the morning with the \npolicies we have. I am glad we do have good health insurance. I just \nthink it is important, as we are here, to remember a lot of the people \nwe represent are not in that situation, to remember the uncertainty and \nlack of stability they live with. When a crisis happens--and it happens \nevery single day to people--when that happens, they ought not to have a \nsense of free-fall: I will get wiped out; I can't possibly take care of \nthis; I can't even provide the care my child needs.\n  I will never forget Senator Kennedy--who is the chairman of the \ncommittee I have been asked to help, to temporarily step in and write \nthis legislation because of his own illness. Senator Kennedy has told \nthe story over the years of when his 11- or 12-year-old son, Teddy \nKennedy, Jr., developed cancer, and it was a serious form of cancer, \none that was very dangerous and could take his life. He had to have his \nleg amputated. But there were some protocols to determine whether they \ncould treat that cancer. They let Senator Kennedy's son be part of that \nprotocol because during that kind of test they welcome you into it. It \ndoesn't cost anything.\n  Halfway through that test, that protocol, it was determined that \ntreatment actually worked. It could save Senator Kennedy's son's life, \nas it could the lives of the other children who were utilizing that \ndrug. The difference was, of course, once the protocol was determined \nto be successful, it no longer was free, and it was very expensive--\nthousands and thousands of dollars.\n  Senator Kennedy, obviously, as he tells the story, comes from a \nfamily who had the resources to be able to write that check to continue \nto make sure his son would get the treatment that allowed Teddy, Jr. to \nrecover, to lead a very healthy life. Today he lives in my State of \nConnecticut with his wife Kiki and their children, and he got that kind \nof medicine.\n\n  But he tells the story of other families at that time, years ago now, \nwho did not have the money and begged the hospitals and doctors: Could \nthey get a quarter of the treatment, could they get a half of it, to \nsee that their child may have the same chance to succeed and recover as \nSenator Kennedy's son did.\n  It was that moment that Senator Kennedy, some 40 years ago, 35 years \nago, decided this would be the cause of his life, when his child, \nbecause they had the resources to get the treatment, could get back on \nhis feet but some other child, through economic circumstances, could \nnot.\n  In the United States of America, no child ought to be deprived the \nopportunity--or that family--to get back on his or her feet again. I \nthink that is what joins us here together. I think this is hard. We \nrealize that. It is difficult. But I believe it demands our attention \nand time.\n  So for those who are insured today, and while they are feeling pretty \nsecure--and I hope you do--understand that these moments can happen. If \nyou are uninsured, obviously it is a frightening feeling of what can \nhappen in your family. I know these are difficult questions and there \nare not going to be easy answers. There is going to be some shared \nresponsibility in all of this. But I believe we have an obligation, as \nU.S. Senators, at this moment in our history, to rise to that challenge \nand not to fail, as others have in years past because it is too hard.\n  There was a great line Edward R. Murrow once used when talking about \nanother subject matter. He said: The one excuse history will never \nforgive you for is that the problem was too difficult.\n  I do not think history will forgive us if the answer we give is: It \nwas just too hard. We just could not figure out how to come together. I \nthink history will judge us harshly if that is the excuse we use for \nnot rising to the moment and dealing with this issue in a comprehensive \nand thoughtful manner. It can never be too difficult. It is hard. We \nought to have the ability to resolve this issue. That is my plea today.\n\n[[Page S8233]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. First, let me compliment my colleague from Connecticut \nfor his great leadership on the issue of health care. As the acting \nhead of the HELP Committee, he has done a great job on a bill that has \ngarnered wide support and praise from the one end of the country to the \nother. So I salute him for his work and his diligence.\n  I rise today to speak in support of the critical resources provided \nin the Energy and Water bill, the bill we are debating, for Federal \nhydrogen and fuel cell research technology which will give America's \nautomotive industry a much needed shot in the arm that it needs to \nrevitalize and compete in the global market for fuel-efficient \nvehicles.\n  In June, I joined a bipartisan coalition of 17 Senators, and we wrote \nto protect the funding for this critical technology after hearing that \nthe administration had significantly cut the budget for hydrogen \nresearch.\n  I generally agree with the administration on energy policy, but in \nthis area, they are wrong. Hydrogen research is one of our futures. As \na result, I thank Chairman Dorgan for helping. The fiscal year 2010 \nEnergy and Water appropriations bill contains $190 million in much \nneeded investment in hydrogen technology and fuel research and \ndevelopment. The $190 million that is included in the bill for hydrogen \ntechnology and fuel cell research is $37 million more than the House \nappropriations bill.\n  It is my hope that some of this money, particularly given the fact \nthat we have added extra money, will go to the General Motors Honeoye \nFalls, NY, fuel cell facility. It has the potential to create 400 clean \nenergy jobs. The facility is ideally situated to play a leadership role \nin transforming this technology into reliable and affordable options \nfor all American drivers.\n  The bottom line is, the facility at Honeoye Falls is the only GM \nhydrogen fuel cell research facility in North America. There will not \nbe another facility with its potential or progress. It is one of only \nfour facilities in the world that can go from research to application \nin fuel cell development, and the only one in America. There is one in \nGermany and there are two in Japan.\n  If we are going to abandon this vital area of research, several years \nfrom now it will create real problems for our automobile companies \nwhich we hope can get back on their feet.\n  This is the only facility in the United States that can go directly \nfrom science to vehicle, as it did for General Motors in Project \nDriveway, where at Honeoye Falls the researchers there developed, \ndesigned, and engineered GM's Equinox fuel cell fleet. As I said, these \nare good-paying jobs in the Rochester area. Honeoye Falls is a suburb \nof Rochester where we desperately need jobs and have a great educated \nworkforce. It will keep us globally competitive with Japan and Germany, \nwhich are ahead of us in fuel cell development and infrastructure--\nsomething we cannot afford. At Honeoye Falls, zero tailpipe emissions \nand research, development, and engineering are all under one roof and \nare an American treasure.\n  Let me now talk a little more generally, not simply about Honeoye \nFalls but about hydrogen fuel research and the need for us to move \nforward.\n  As the United States forges a global relationship role in the \ndevelopment of new energy ideas and initiatives, it is critical that we \nprotect the areas where we are already leading the competition. That \nincludes hydrogen and fuel cell technologies. Any compromise in our \nNation's investment in this cutting-edge area of research will diminish \nour accomplishments to date, hamper our ability to compete with other \nnations, and hamper the ability of companies such as General Motors and \nChrysler to come back and be at the competitive edge. We have come too \nfar to close the door on this important research, only to hand over the \ngains we have made to other nations such as Japan and Germany. By \ncutting this kind of research, by not funding Honeoye Falls, we would \ndo just that.\n  In confronting the daunting challenge of climate change and \ndependance on foreign oil from dangerous areas of the world, we need to \nhave all of the tools in our arsenal to achieve our long-term goals. No \none should question the fact that hydrogen technology has a clear and \nimportant role to play.\n  As we all know, hydrogen is the most plentiful element in the \nuniverse. We are never going to run out of it. Fuel cell vehicles are \ngasoline free, representing a dramatic opportunity to break from our \ncurrent addiction to foreign oil. And fuel cell vehicles are emission \nfree.\n  The National Research Council found that fuel cell vehicle technology \nshould be a necessary part of our energy portfolio for achieving the \ntarget of 80 percent global greenhouse reduction in 2050. In fact, it \nis hard to see, if we do not do this, how we will meet that goal. That \nis an important goal.\n  In short, cars running on hydrogen have the potential to \nrevolutionize on-road transportation, change our everyday travel \nexperience, and clean up our environment by eliminating tailpipe \nemissions. Our Nation's automotive companies have made significant \nstrides in meeting or exceeding the administration's interim goals for \nfuel cell cost, but they still have much work to do.\n  Meanwhile, while the United States--and I have just seen the chairman \nof the Energy and Water Subcommittee come on the floor, and I salute \nhim for understanding the need for hydrogen fuel cells. As I said, this \nis one area where the administration has a hard-to-explain blindspot.\n  While we are twiddling our thumbs in this area, debating whether we \nshould fund it, other countries understand the importance of this \ntechnology and are aggressively moving ahead to develop hydrogen \nvehicles. By protecting our Nation's investment in this program, we can \nprotect our current leadership position and develop hydrogen and fuel \ncells on a faster timeline than competing nations. The alternative--to \nabandon a promising technology and allow our work to be the foundation \nof our competitors' success--is not acceptable.\n  In conclusion, I hope this legislation, with its increase in hydrogen \nfuel cell funding, passes. I hope that in its wisdom the Energy \nDepartment will understand the necessity of continuing the research at \nHoneoye Falls and fund it accordingly.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, in 1945, President Truman delivered a \nspeech to a joint session of Congress in which he declared:\n\n       Millions of our citizens do not have a full measure of \n     opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health. Millions do not \n     now have protection or security against the economic effects \n     of sickness. The time has arrived for action to help them \n     attain that opportunity and that protection.\n\n  Unfortunately, little happened after President Truman's speech. It is \nmy hope that 64 years later, we will finally be able to achieve the \nhealth reform President Truman envisioned and our country deserves. We \ncannot settle for marginal improvements. We must fight for substantial \nreforms that significantly improve our health insurance system.\n  Every day, Ohioans are frustrated with health insurance that is \nnearly impossible to afford. Every day, Ohioans are stuck with health \ninsurance that fails to protect them from catastrophic health costs. \nEvery day, Ohioans deal with health insurance that too often \ndiscriminates based on age and gender and location and medical history. \nMillions of Americans are one illness away from financial ruin. Some \n14,000 Americans lose their coverage every day, and 45 million \nAmericans are uninsured and tens of millions more are underinsured.\n  We can find a way for Americans who have coverage to keep it and for \nthose Americans who lack coverage to buy it. We can find the will to \nboost our health care system so that it is far less costly, is \ninclusive, and it is far more patient centered. We can make historic \nimprovements in our health care system which harken back to the day, 44\n\n[[Page S8234]]\n\nyears ago tomorrow, July 30, 1965, when President Johnson signed \nMedicare into law.\n  What lessons can we learn from Medicare and from its passage? The \nMedicare experience taught us that progress in this country does not \ncome easily, especially in the face of false claims, inflammatory \nrhetoric, and twisted facts. It also taught us that progress is not \nalways a function of bipartisanship, as much as we would like it to be. \nMost Republicans today will not support fundamental reform regardless \nof what form it takes. We learned that lesson from Medicare. If you go \nback to key congressional votes on Medicare in 1965, an overwhelming \nnumber of Republicans voted no and an overwhelming number of the \nDemocratic majority vote yes. Gerald Ford voted no, Strom Thurmond \nvoted no, Donald Rumsfeld voted no, and Bob Dole voted no. In fact, Bob \nDole said in the 1965 debate, speaking for the great majority of \nRepublicans in the House and Senate--he bragged:\n\n       Fighting . . . voting against Medicare . . . because we \n     knew it wouldn't work.\n\n  It is no surprise that the only time Republicans had a chance to make \nmeaningful reform to Medicare, when the stars aligned, when they had a \nconservative Republican President and large Republican majorities in \nboth Houses for the first time since Medicare was formed--in 2003, they \npartially privatized Medicare. They did it--I was there in the House of \nRepresentatives--literally in the middle of the night, literally by one \nvote, when most Americans were asleep. I do not blame them in those \ndays for hiding that bill from the American people. It was a Medicare \nbill written for the insurance companies and by the insurance \ncompanies, and it, purely and simply, started Medicare down the road to \nprivatization 6 years ago when it happened.\n  We are seeing the same tactics today. Many Republicans want to defeat \nhealth care reform in order to break President Obama, making it, in the \nwords of one of my conservative colleagues, his Waterloo--a fine \nexample of partisanship trumping the national interest. Special \ninterests groups, the health insurance industry, and the drug industry \nare spending millions of dollars--millions of dollars--to influence \nhealth reform legislation. They are deriding anything that does not \ninflate their profits. Special interests are pulling out all of the \nstops to subvert sound public policy.\n  It is the same page out of a tired playbook that informed then-\nprivate citizen Ronald Reagan in the early 1960s when he warned \nAmericans that if Medicare were enacted, ``one of these days, you and I \nare going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our \nchildren's children what it was like to live in America when men were \nfree.'' That is what he thought of Medicare.\n\n  The American people didn't share Ronald Reagan's opposition to \nMedicare but influential special interests did. They played every card \nin an attempt to derail health care coverage for seniors. Before \nMedicare was signed into law, 50 percent of senior citizens were \nuninsured; 44 years ago today, 50 percent of senior citizens were \nuninsured. Today only 3 percent are.\n  In 1995, Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich said he wished Medicare \nwould ``wither on the vine.'' That was the beginning of privatization \nefforts.\n  Progress has never come easily in our history. Passage of the Civil \nRights Act in 1964 was not easy. Passage of the Voting Rights Act in \n1965 was not easy. Enactment of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965 was not \neasy. Every major step forward in our Nation's history, every \nprogressive move forward is never easy.\n  As Senator Harkin said, passage of legislation to prohibit \ndiscrimination against women, the elderly, and people with disabilities \nwas not easy. That doesn't mean we stand down. It doesn't mean a \npopular President or Democratic majorities in Congress should give in \non every major principle as we enact health care reform. Medicare \nchanged our Nation. It helped pull millions of seniors out of poverty, \nfostered independence, helped fuel our economy, and helped retirees \nlive long and healthy lives. The United States does not rank \nparticularly high in life expectancy compared to other rich industrial \ndemocracies, but if you reach 65 in America, we rank near the top for \nlife expectancy. So if you get to be 65 in the United States, you are \nlikely to live a longer, healthier life than the great majority of \npeople around the world, even in rich industrial countries.\n  Health care reform will change our Nation. It will end uncertainty \nabout health care coverage because public and private insurance will \nalways be available. That is why we have the public option that is \nsupported by so many of us, including the Presiding Officer. It will \nconfront the needless redtape, medical errors and the fraud and abuse \nthat inflate health care costs and compromise quality. It will harness \nthe power of market competition to drive premiums down and customer \nsatisfaction up. We want competition. We want a public option competing \nwith private plans. Both will get better as a result. It will finally \nallow our Nation to move on from the human tragedy, from health care-\nrelated bankruptcies, from the endless march of double-digit premium \nincreases, from the competitive disadvantages American businesses face \nas health care expenses explode.\n  The HELP Committee made the first strong step toward health insurance \nreform that keeps what works and fixes what is broken. Our work will \nnot be done until crucial national priorities are no longer crowded out \nby health care spending. Our work will not be done until exploding \nhealth care costs no longer cut into family budgets, no longer weigh \ndown businesses, and no longer drain tax dollars from local and State \ncoffers and from the Federal budget. We must keep working and keep \nfighting for the change people demand.\n  We will keep fighting for the Ohioans I met in Cleveland last week at \nMedWorks, where hundreds of people were provided free medical care from \nvolunteer doctors, nurses, and hospitals, when Zac Ponsky, a young \nbanker in Cleveland, decided to put this MedWorks program together.\n  None of this will be easy. When President Johnson signed Medicare 44 \nyears ago tomorrow in Independence, with Harry Truman alongside him, he \ndemonstrated that the hardest fought battles yield the greatest \nvictories. When our 44th President signs health care reform into law \nlater this year, we will finally realize Harry Truman's vision six \ndecades and 10 Presidents later.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1855 to Amendment No. 1813\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending business and call up amendment No. 1855.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1855 to amendment No. 1813.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require all agencies to include a separate category for \nadministrative expenses when submitting their appropriation requests to \n   the Office of Management and Budget for fiscal year 2011 and each \n            fiscal year thereafter, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___.

While Senator Bennett and I await our colleagues to offer \namendments on the underlying appropriations bill, I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, our country is in a very deep economic \nhole, the most significant economic decline since the Great Depression. \nMuch of it is attributable to the fact that we have created an economy \nin recent years, especially the last two decades, in which we have \nresponsible business men and women engaged in casino-like gambling. \nThey do it under the rubric of business.\n  In 1994, I wrote a cover story for the Washington Monthly magazine \ntitled ``Very Risky Business.'' The subtitle of that article was about \nthe banks trading very risky derivatives, which I said I believed could \nlead to taxpayers being on the hook for a bailout. That was 15 years \nago. At that point, there was $16 trillion of notional value in \nderivatives. And banks, even then, which prompted me to write the \narticle, were trading very risky derivatives on their own proprietary \naccounts, which I believed was unbelievably ignorant of the risk \ninvolved.\n  The $16 trillion in notional value of derivatives exploded way beyond \nanyone's expectation. Then at the same time that the trading of \nderivatives was exploding, new instruments were being developed, credit \ndefault swaps and CDOs and all kinds of exotic instruments to be traded \nback and forth, creating a dramatic amount of additional risk.\n  Even as that was occurring, we saw the development of a subprime loan \nscandal in which we were watching brokers and mortgage banks provide \nentreaties to those who had homes or those who wished to buy homes: \nCome and get a mortgage from us. You have bad credit, slow pay, no pay, \nyou have been bankrupt, come to us. We would like to give you a loan. \nSubprime home loans--some called liars loans--you don't even have to \ntell the person giving you the loan what your income is. By the way, \nyou don't have to pay any principle. We will wrap that around the \nbackside, just pay interest. Can't pay interest, then name your own \npayment. Don't want to do that, then don't pay any principle and don't \npay all your interest. We will wrap it around the backside, and you \ndon't even have to describe what your income is. By the way, when you \nget a mortgage from us, we will not tell you it is going to reset in 2-\n3 years because we are giving you a 2-percent teaser rate right now, \nwhich means your home loan payment will be way down here, and it is \ngoing to look good. But the reset that will happen in 24 or 36 months, \nyou will never be able to make the payments.\n  Everybody was fat and happy, making a lot of money putting out bad \nloans and then slicing them up into mortgage-backed securities and then \ntrading them up to the hedge funds and investment banks, and everybody \nwas making a lot of money, not asking any questions. Then the whole \nthing collapsed. And it is derivatives, it is swaps, it is mortgage-\nbacked securities. It all collapsed in a sea of greed with unbelievable \nrisk, and it brought down with it some of America's largest financial \ninstitutions.\n\n  I describe all of that gambling and all of that risk because \nsomething else happened last year that has the American people \nconcerned and worried--and they should be wondering: What was the cause \nof it?\n  Here is what happened last year. I have this chart in the Chamber \nthat shows the price of crude oil. It actually went from $60 a barrel, \nin October of 2006, up to $147 a barrel in July of 2008. It went up \nlike a Roman candle, and then came right back down. By the way, the \nsame folks who made the money on the upside made the money going back \nthe other way, starting last July. It was unbelievable speculation in a \nmarket called the oil futures market.\n  This is not an abstract graph. This means right up here someplace, as \nshown on the chart, every American who went to the gas pump to fill up \ntheir vehicle with gasoline was paying through the nose--$4, $4.50 a \ngallon.\n  So the question for them, and the question for other users--airlines, \nfor example, were hemorrhaging in red ink, unable to pay the cost of \nthis kind of oil price--the question was: What has caused all of this? \nWhat has resulted in this unbelievable spike in oil prices?\n  The answer? An orgy of speculation in the oil futures market by \ninterests that were never before--at that point--manipulating that \nmarketplace. Investment banks, for the first time, were actually buying \noil storage and holding it off the marketplace until the price rose, as \nan example.\n  The oil futures market, it is estimated, was populated in terms of \nthe trades by somewhere between two-thirds to three-fourths of the \ntrades coming from speculators--not people who were moving the physical \ncommodity back and forth, at least people who would want to sell the \nphysical commodity to somebody who wanted to buy the physical commodity \nbecause they want oil. Instead, it was speculators who were simply \nbetting on this. They could have gone to Las Vegas. They did not need \nto. They were able to go to the oil futures market and make a lot of \nmoney going up and a lot of money going down; and, meanwhile, the \nvictims were the American drivers who had to fill their gas tanks with \ngasoline.\n  I am describing this because yesterday there was a hearing in this \ntown by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a commission that has \nlargely been dead from the neck up for some while, uninterested in \nregulating--despite the fact that is their charge--sitting on their \nhands, doing nothing. And all of last year while this was going on, \nwhile the price of oil was going up, up, up, the CFTC largely explained \nit away as saying: Well, this is supply and demand. That is what is \ngoing on.\n  There is another agency other than the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission that did not do its job. This is an agency we are actually \nfunding. Senator Bennett and I are actually funding it in this bill. It \nis called EIA, the Energy Information Administration. It has several \nhundred people working there. It is a very important agency. It \nprovides substantial amounts of information to our country, to \npolicymakers, about what is happening with energy.\n  I want to show you what has happened with the EIA. We spend about \n$110 million a year on this agency with several hundred people. They \nare good people, smart people, the best in the business, we assume. \nHere is what happened. In May of 2007, they had to make an estimate. \nThat is what they do. They make an estimate: What is the price of oil \ngoing to be? Well, they started here, as shown on the graph, and they \nsaid: Here is where we think the price of oil is going, right that way. \nSo in May of 2007--I do not know what they had to eat back then, but \nsomething was affecting the brain. Here is what happened to the price \nof oil. Here is where they estimated the price of oil would be.\n  These are smart people. These are the best. We are spending a lot of \nmoney getting their advice. So let's pick January of 2008. They made a \nnew estimate: Here is where we think the price of oil is going to go. \nWell, the price of oil did not do this. The price of oil went like \nthis--almost straight up. So what did they get wrong? In April of 2008: \nHere is what we think the price of oil will be. Here is what it was.\n\n[[Page S8236]]\n\n  My point is, this agency, along with the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission, would come to our committee at a hearing, and I would say: \nWhat is it that you get it so unbelievably wrong? They said: Well, it \nis supply and demand.\n  That is total rubbish. The fact is, even while this was happening, \nthe supply was going up and demand was going down, which meant that the \nprice of oil would not be going up like a Roman candle. In fact, the \nprice would be moderating. Instead, speculators captured that market. \nThat is why EIA got it so wrong. They did not have the foggiest idea \nwhat they were doing. Supply and demand--total nonsense. But we know \nwhat happened to these prices.\n  The reason I want to discuss this for a moment is because yesterday \nthe Wall Street Journal had a story. The Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission--this is the commission that last year spent all of their \ntime telling us this was just supply and demand. We knew better. But \neither they knew better as well and would not admit it or they did not \nknow better. That agency was insisting it was supply and demand. Well, \nthe very same agency now, with a new head, is going to issue a report \nnext month, according to the Wall Street Journal, ``suggesting \nspeculators played a significant role in driving wild swings in oil \nprices.''\n  Three people in my hometown cafe--I come from a small town of 300 \npeople--3 people, over a strong cup of coffee, knew that last year. \nWild swings in oil prices as a result of speculators.\n  Last year, the same U.S. futures market agency pinned oil price \nswings primarily on supply and demand. But the new report will say that \nanalysis was based on ``deeply flawed data.''\n  So the question is, What does all this mean? It means if we are going \nto have some impact on an economy where we put it back on some solid \nfoundation, we have to have markets that work, and we have to have \nregulators who are not blind.\n  I happen to think the free market system is the best system of \nallocating goods and services that I know of. I taught economics ever \nso briefly in college, and I always say I was able to overcome that, \nnonetheless, and lead a productive life. But the field of economics is \nsomething that is so important in terms of understanding how markets \nwork. I believe the free market system is an incredibly good system--\nnot perfect. The free market system needs effective oversight and \nregulation from time to time. That means we have regulators who are \nsupposed to be wearing the striped shirts, blowing the whistle, and \ncalling the fouls because, yes, there are fouls in the free market \nsystem.\n  Go back and ask Teddy Roosevelt, when he was a big trust buster. What \nwas he doing? He was busting those interests that were trying to \nsubvert the free market system. The same thing happens today. We have \ninterests--and I described it earlier--that want to subvert the system \nby getting engaged in substantial risk and establishing mechanisms by \nwhich they can control a market at the expense of the rest of the \nAmerican people.\n  That is what I believe has happened in the oil futures market. The \noil futures market is very important, and we need to make it work the \nright way. It ought to work responding to the urges of supply and \ndemand. But, regrettably, that has not been the case. My hope is now \nthe Commodity Futures Trading Commission will be able to take the kind \nof action necessary to straighten this market out.\n  Every market needs liquidity. That means some speculators will play a \nrole in the market. But when speculators capture the market, and begin \nto play the kind of games that were played last year, that has a \nprofound impact on this country's economy. We should expect the \nagencies that are hired to do the regulatory oversight do their jobs, \nand do it properly. That has not been the case for some while.\n  So my hope will be--with the new report coming out that will finally \nassign the responsibility of excess speculation in this perversion of \nthe marketplace--my hope will be we will have effective regulators who \nwill take action. What should that action be? My own view is the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission should designate a distinction \nbetween the traders in this marketplace: those who are truly trading a \nphysical commodity because they are engaged in the marketplace because \nthat is the business they are in and those who are just speculators. \nThe Commodity Futures Trading Commission could at that point \ndetermine what kind of margin requirements, what kind of speculative \nlimits should exist so that activity does not subvert the marketplace.\n\n  Let me be quick to say there are people who will listen to me, and \nwho hear what I say, and they will say: Do you know what. You don't \nhave the foggiest idea what you are talking about. All of this system \nworks. None of that which you describe existed. All of that risk by the \nsmartest people in the room, the top investment banks that took on this \nmassive amount of risk, the investment banks that were buying oil \nstorage, to buy oil and take it off the market until it goes up in \nprice--all of that is just business.\n  It is not just business. Just business is running a business the \nright way. Does anybody believe it was just business to have the \nbiggest financial enterprises in the country run into the ditch because \nof bad behavior by those who were running the companies--by the way, \nsome of whom are still running the same companies?\n  By the way, with respect to solutions, does anybody think it is just \nbusiness to decide we had institutions in this country that were too \nbig to fail--that loaded up with risk and then failed--and the taxpayer \nis told they cannot be allowed to fail, they are too big, and you have \nto bail them out? And now we say to those same businesses: We are not \ngoing to get rid of ``too big to fail.'' In fact, we are going to allow \nyou to merge with other firms, which makes you much too big to fail--\ntoo much bigger to fail.\n  We have a lot of work to do this year to address these issues and \naddress some of the causes that caused the economic collapse last year. \nI want us to put this economy back on track. First and foremost, it \nstarts with jobs and restoring confidence. Confidence is everything \nabout this economy. When people have confidence, they will do the \nthings that are expansive to this economy: buy clothes, buy a car, take \na trip, buy a house. That expands the economy. When they are not \nconfident, they do exactly the opposite.\n  I want the American people to have confidence. I want them to have \nconfidence in believing that Federal agencies that hire regulators are \ngoing to look over the shoulder and provide the oversight to make sure \nthis is not going to happen again, to make sure someone is not going tp \nsubvert a marketplace that makes the rest of the American people \nvictims.\n  All of this, in my judgment, with good government, can be done. But \nit will not be done if we have regulators who boast about being \nwillfully blind. It will be done if we understand our responsibility to \nmake sure the free market system is indeed free.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, it is nearly 2 o'clock on Wednesday. We \nhave been on this bill since Monday. Senator Bennett and I have spent a \nlot of time on the floor waiting for amendments to be offered. We have \nhad several and we appreciate that, but we have many filed but not \noffered.\n  I know the majority leader has filed a cloture motion which would \nripen tomorrow, so we would have a cloture vote tomorrow. Our hope has \nbeen we would not get to that point.\n  Inasmuch as we have waited and waited very patiently for Senators who \ndo have amendments that they wish to offer but have not come to offer \nthem, Senator Bennett and I have talked about perhaps going to third \nreading this afternoon at 5 o'clock. So I ask, if there are those \nSenators and/or staff who have amendments they wish to have considered \non this legislation they would keep that in mind.\n  We have a couple of hours here. Senator Bennett and I have talked \nabout going to third reading by 5 o'clock. I would ask people to come \nand offer\n\n[[Page S8237]]\n\namendments, let's have debates on the amendments and have votes and see \nif we can resolve this legislation this afternoon.\n  I make a point of order that a quorum is not present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I have taken the floor before to talk \nabout the need for health insurance reform, health care reform. I \ntalked about the high cost of health care and how we need to get a \nhandle on the amount of resources we spend as a nation on health care. \nI have talked about the need to improve prevention and wellness \nprograms. I have talked about the public insurance option and why I \nthink it is so important to have a public insurance option.\n  But today I want to talk about a different issue. I want to talk \nabout what happens if we do nothing because I think the people of this \nNation need to understand that our current health care system is \ncausing huge challenges for the people of our Nation. Whether you have \nhealth insurance or do not have health insurance, you are impacted by \nthe fact that your options are limited.\n  Let me give an example. Maryland citizens will continue to lose \nhealth care coverage every day if we do not reform our health care \nsystem. There are currently 760,000 Marylanders who have no health \ninsurance. That number has been growing during this economic crisis. \nAnd now 230 Marylanders are losing their coverage every single day.\n  There are people in our community who currently have adequate health \ninsurance--at least they think they do--but they are liable to wake up \ntomorrow and find out that because their company is going out of \nbusiness or because their employer can no longer afford to provide \nhealth coverage for their employees, they no longer have health \ninsurance to count on.\n  Marylanders have seen an 11-percent increase in the number of \nuninsured since 2007. What does this mean? As the number of uninsured \nincreases, there is more and more cost shift. That means those of us \nwho have health insurance are paying higher premiums than we otherwise \nwould have to pay because we are paying for those who do not have \nhealth insurance. It means those of us who pay our doctor bills or our \nhospital bills are paying more than we should because we are paying for \nthose who cannot pay their bills, who have no health insurance, who are \npart of uncompensated care. It is a never-ending struggle because as we \ncost shift more to those who have insurance, insurance becomes more \nexpensive, and therefore fewer people can afford insurance and we have \na higher number of uninsured. And that is happening today.\n  Marylanders with health insurance are paying more. If we do not fix \nthe system, those in my community and in your community who have health \ninsurance are going to end up paying more.\n  The average family premium in Maryland costs $1,100 more each year \nbecause our health care system fails to cover everybody, because we \nhave the cost shifting, because we have not gotten health care costs \nunder control. The fact is, health insurance premiums for Maryland \nfamilies have been increasing rapidly over the last 8 years, going up \nby 64 percent from 2000 to 2007. Whether you pay that premium directly \nor your employer helps contribute to it, it is part of your family \ncost. It reflects in the compensation you would otherwise receive in \nsalaries as an employee. It has been a 64-percent increase for \nMarylanders since 2000.\n  For family health care coverage, the average annual premium rose from \n$7,200 to almost $12,000 during that period of time from 2000 to 2007. \nFor individual health coverage, the average premium rose from $2,600 to \n$4,100.\n  If we fail to enact health care reform and if we do nothing to \ncontrol the escalating cost of health care, if we do nothing to deal \nwith those who are uninsured and an increasing number of those who do \nnot have health insurance, if we do not deal with wellness and \nprevention, if we do not deal with medical technology and with a more \ncost-effective system, then these trends are going to continue and we \nare going to see these types of double-digit increases in health care \ncosts, which means more Marylanders, more people in this country will \nnot be able to afford their current insurance coverage.\n  Let me mention one other fact which is something we all talk about. \nWe want to maintain choice. One of the prime objectives of health care \nreform is to maintain choice--choice so you can choose your doctor; \nchoice so you and your doctor make decisions concerning your medical \nneeds; and choice, I would hope, in terms of what type of health \ncoverage is out there to meet your needs.\n  Right now, two insurance companies in Maryland hold 71 percent of the \nMaryland market. For most Marylanders who have health insurance through \nwork, they do not have a choice today. We want to offer more choice so \nwe can keep costs down. You can tailor a health care plan to meet your \nfamily needs.\n  We can do better. The current status quo should be unacceptable to \neveryone in my State, whether they currently have good health care \ninsurance or they are uninsured, whether they are a small business \nowner or work for a large company.\n  Let me give a couple examples of stories from Maryland. Let me give \nyou this one. A constituent named Catherine from Baltimore wrote me a \nletter:\n\n       Mr. Cardin: I just received my health insurance bill from \n     [an insurance company]. The premium for next year went from \n     $666 to $968. This is a quarterly bill. . . . We have high \n     medical expenses and I cannot afford this increase. I cannot \n     go to another insurance company because I am high risk and I \n     have been turned down from other medical insurance \n     [companies]. I cannot receive medical assistance because they \n     say we make too much. . . . I am 51 years old. When I called \n     my insurance carrier and asked about the increase, I was \n     laughed at and told either accept it or go somewhere else. \n     When I asked if I could pay monthly, I was told, ``Indeed \n     not.'' What am I to do? I need medical help, but no one wants \n     to help. Please, could you please look into this matter and \n     see what you can do for me?\n\n  This is a person who has health insurance, and if we don't do \nanything, that person is going to lose her health insurance and, quite \nfrankly, access to quality care will also be jeopardized.\n  I will give another story about a small business owner, Alexis from \nBaltimore, who owns a small software production company that oversees \nIT for the city of Baltimore. He competes against much larger companies \nfor business. He wants to do the right thing, so he has health \ninsurance for his employees. He has 20 employees. He paid half of the \ncost of the employees' coverage. Some of his employees came in and \nsaid: Hey, look, can't you help us with family coverage? He would like \nto provide family coverage for his employees; he just cannot afford to \ndo it and be able to compete against larger companies. He goes on to \ntell me that his premiums are increasing much faster than what is \nhappening with the larger companies against which he has to compete. He \ndoesn't have the options the larger companies have. The status quo \ndiscriminates against small companies in their health care plans.\n\n  What we need to do in health reform is to deal with these issues. \nThat is why I come to the floor. I know there are different views as to \nwhat we need to do with health care reform, but I hope the one option \nthat would not be on the table is the status quo. We cannot say to the \nCatherines of our community: We are not going to do anything to help \nyou. We have to listen to the Catherines who are telling us: Look, get \na handle on what is happening with health costs, whether we have health \ninsurance or we do not have health insurance. Get a handle on helping \nthose who don't have insurance so we don't have the cost shifting that \ngoes on, that we can provide quality health care for all, that we can \nbring down the cost of health care in our community. Listen to Alexis, \nwho says: Help the small business owner do the\n\n[[Page S8238]]\n\nright thing for their employees. Help bring down the cost of health \ncare.\n  I urge my colleagues, we can have a robust debate as to what should \nbe included in health care reform, but I hope at the end of the day we \nwill listen to our constituents and provide the type of reform that \nwill allow for people in our communities to have access to affordable, \nquality health care, make health care costs manageable, bring down the \ncost of health care, and provide prevention and wellness programs to \nkeep people healthy. If we do that, then we are really listening to our \nconstituents and will help our economy and help our Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to address one of the \ndefining challenges of our time--the restructuring of our Nation's \nenergy supply. Reforming our energy policy is critical for multiple \nreasons: to improve our national security, to create jobs and rebuild \nour economy, and to protect our children and our communities from the \ndamaging effects of carbon pollution. Today I want to focus on just the \nfirst of these--improving our national security.\n  It has been said before and it will be said again, but it deserves \nrepeating until we in Congress act to change it: Our Nation is addicted \nto foreign oil. This dependence makes us vulnerable to the whims of \nnations that do not have our best interests at heart.\n  This afternoon, I will examine this problem in some detail and \nconsider the implications for a national energy policy that will \nstrengthen our national security and end our addiction to imported oil. \nI emphasize that there is a cure. If we as a nation focus on smarter, \nwiser use of energy and aggressive development of homegrown renewable \nenergy sources, we can indeed greatly reduce or eliminate dependence on \nimported oil, improve our national security, and strengthen our \nnational economy, all at the same time.\n  Well, let's talk about dependence on foreign oil. Our dependence on \nforeign oil comes from two intertwined factors: First, our economy \ndepends upon oil for transportation. Cars, trucks, trains, planes, \nboats that we use to move ourselves and our goods around the country \nare entirely dependent on oil. Indeed, 95 percent of the energy used in \nour transportation sector comes from oil. Second, our oil addiction \nrelies on foreign imports: 58 percent of the oil we consume is \nimported. Thus, access to foreign oil is essential to the vitality of \nour economy. The result is that maintaining access to this oil becomes \na very high priority for our national security.\n  Exactly whom do we depend on? The good news is, nearly 30 percent of \nour imported oil comes from our democratic neighbors to the north and \nsouth in North America. But that is where the good news ends. Take a \nlook at this chart. Seventy percent of our imported oil comes from \noutside North America, and this chart shows the top four nations \noutside North America from which we import oil.\n  All four of these countries represent security challenges for the \nUnited States. Saudi Arabia is No. 1 on the list. It is the source of \none in nine barrels of imported oil. Before addressing the fact that it \npresents national security challenges, it should be noted Saudi Arabia \nhas often been a significant ally to the United States in our \ninterests, in a relationship going back decades. Nevertheless, the \ndependency on their oil creates two national security issues:\n  First, the oil infrastructure and delivery systems of Saudi Arabia \nare vulnerable to terrorist attack or to manipulation by governments in \nthe region. Consider the Strait of Hormuz. The Strait of Hormuz is a \nvulnerability for all Persian Gulf oil, 90 percent of which moves \nthrough the Strait. The Strait is 21 miles wide, with a narrow shipping \nchannel. So, geographically, it is vulnerable to disruption, and Iran \nhas explicitly threatened to put pressure on traffic going through the \nStrait or attempt to control it outright.\n  Second, the wealth we send to Saudi Arabia in exchange for petroleum \nhas not always served us well. Former CIA Director James Woolsey \ntestified in the Senate a few years ago that over the last three \ndecades the Saudis have spent between $70 billion and $100 billion to \nsupport conservative institutions that often promulgate viewpoints and \nactions hostile to the United States. The wealth dispensed in this \nmanner has, in some cases, migrated into terrorist organizations such \nas al-Qaida to recruit and build institutional capacity. This has led \nformer CIA Director Woolsey to say of our current military conflicts: \nThis is the first time since the Civil War that we have financed both \nsides of a conflict.\n  Venezuela is No. 2 on the list. It is, of course, led by President \nHugo Chavez, a vocal critic of our country who has expressly threatened \nto cut off U.S. oil supplies. He told an Argentine newspaper that \nVenezuela has:\n\n       A strong oil card to play on the geopolitical stage . . . a \n     card that we are going to play with toughness against the \n     toughest country in the world, the United States.\n\n  The third nation on this list is Nigeria. Nigeria has had a series of \ndisruptions just this year due to civil unrest. In February, oil \ncompanies reported to Reuters that 17 percent of the country's oil \ncapacity was cut off from export because of attacks and sabotage by \nmilitants. According to testimony given to our Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee by the National Defense Council Foundation in 2006, Nigeria \nloses 135,000 barrels per day to theft.\n  Iraq, No. 4 on our list, has gone through enormous upheavals. Saddam \nHussein's forces destroyed much of the nation's oil infrastructure when \nPresident Bush launched the Iraq war in 2003. That infrastructure has \nbeen subject to ongoing sabotage over the last 6 years. A significant \nshare of Iraqi oil, similar to its neighbors, moves through the Strait \nof Hormuz, an additional point of vulnerability. Moreover, Iraq has not \nsucceeded yet in passing a national law to share oil wealth among the \nethnic groups in the nation, and the friction that comes from this \ncontinues to allow the possibility of factional conflict and \ndisruptions in supply.\n  Iran isn't on this list. We have an embargo against Iran. We don't \nimport oil from there, but it is still worth mentioning. Many of our \nallies get oil from Iran and their oil supplies are large enough to \naffect the world markets and thereby the stability and cost of our own \nsupply. Again, turning to former CIA Director Woolsey testifying in the \nSenate, he noted that Iran derives 40 percent of its government budget \nfrom oil exports. According to the RAND Corporation, higher oil \nrevenues have not just emboldened the Iranian Government to defy the \nUnited Nations regarding their nuclear program but also helped Iran to \nfinance the activities of Hezbollah and Hamas.\n  Our dependence on foreign oil makes us vulnerable to a disrupted \nenergy supply, and the risk is heightened because most of the world's \nproven reserves are controlled by just a few governments. State control \nmeans countries can and do manipulate energy supply. We had a case this \nlast year when Russia manipulated gas markets to dominate new \ndemocracies in Eastern Europe.\n  The Energy Modeling Forum at Stanford University brought together a \ngroup of leading experts to assess the chances of a major oil supply \ndisruption. They identified major areas of the globe where oil \ndisruptions are most likely due to geopolitical, military or terrorist \nthreats. Those areas include Saudi Arabia, the rest of the Persian \nGulf, Russia, the Caspian states, and a group of nations in Africa and \nSouth America--which account for 60 percent of world oil production.\n  So the threat of disrupted supply is a serious one for our economy, \nas we found out during the oil shocks of the 1970s, which cost our \neconomy about $2.5 trillion. If repeated today, such a crisis would \ncost our American economy about $8 trillion. We were reminded of the \nthreat of supply disruption again when Hurricanes Katrina and Rita \ndisrupted supplies and caused price spikes here in our Nation.\n  These don't supply the United States, but they do supply our allies, \nand in a global oil market these supplies are interdependent. A \ndisruption of European oil supplies would have effects on our economy.\n\n[[Page S8239]]\n\n  We also expend extraordinary resources to maintain our access to \nforeign oil because it is so important. It is important to the success \nof our economy. While estimates vary, according to a study produced by \nthe National Defense Council Foundation, the indirect security and \nmilitary costs relating to securing our access to oil amount to about \n$825 billion. That equates to more than $5 a gallon, on top of the \nprice we pay at the pump. So we cannot allow our Nation's security and \nthe health of the American economy to rely on the whims of unstable, \nunreliable, even hostile governments.\n  If we refuse to address our single greatest point of vulnerability, \nwe fail in our most fundamental duty to protect this Nation. It is \nclear we need to end this addiction. We need to be energy self-\nsufficient. But how are we going to get there? One answer, which we \nheard chanted in rallies across America last year, was: Drill, baby, \ndrill.\n  It is true we could increase production from American reserves in the \nshort term with an aggressive drilling strategy. In fact, I support \nchanging leases on hundreds of thousands of acres already approved for \npetroleum drilling and converting those into ``use it or lose it'' \nleases because major oil companies have secured those leases, and they \nare sitting on them without doing a thing.\n  Nevertheless, drilling is not, and cannot be, a long-term strategy \nfor the security of our Nation for one simple reason: America uses a \nlot of oil but has, globally speaking, limited reserves. In fact, the \nUnited States has just 2 percent of the world's oil reserves, as this \nchart shows right here. Here we are, down here at the small end, with \nMexico and Europe. Then, we see Eurasia, with 7 percent; Africa, with 9 \npercent; Central and South America, with a little bit more; then \nCanada; and then the whopper, the Middle East, which makes my point \nabout security for our supplies.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, if the distinguished Senator from \nOregon would care to complete his remarks, I would have no objection. I \ndon't suspect anyone else would.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I thank the Senator for that offer. I think that would \nbe a period of about 5 or 6 more minutes, if that would be acceptable.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Absolutely.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I would have no objection. We are limiting \nmorning statement business up to 10 minutes. We are on the business of \nthe energy and water appropriations bill, waiting for amendments to be \nfiled. So we have a general order on this bill that morning business \nspeeches will be 10 minutes.\n  I have no objection if the Senator wishes to take a few minutes \nextra, but I did want both Senators to understand that we are on the \nenergy and water appropriations bill, and morning business is done \nunder the consideration of that legislation. So I have no objection.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. I would certainly defer to the Senator from North \nDakota, if he feels there is other business he wishes to conduct. But I \nwill proceed if he feels that is acceptable.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. President, we have looked at the reserves side of this, but now \nlet's look at the consumption side. As this chart shows, America, which \nhas only 2 percent of the reserves, consumes 24 percent of the world's \noil. So we only have one-fifth of the supply but we consume one-fourth \nof the output. That is a formula for trouble. A nation would be in a \nstrong position if it had very high reserves and very low consumption, \nbut it is vulnerable if it has very low reserves and high consumption. \nUnfortunately, that is right where America is.\n  To make things worse, the price of petroleum is going to continue to \nrise as the thirst from China and India increases. Because of the \nposition we are in, our addiction to imported oil will only grow if we \ndon't significantly change our energy strategy.\n  So what about other fossil fuels? In my home State, energy \nspeculators are looking to build terminals to import LNG or liquefied \nnatural gas. There are vulnerabilities there as well. Where does LNG \ncome from? Top producers include Qatar, Indonesia, Malaysia, United \nArab Emirates, and Oman.\n  Other folks argue we can extract more oil from Canadian tar sands or \nturn our abundant oil into transportation fuel. But it is worth \nobserving that these strategies require extraordinary energy to produce \nfuel and emit extraordinary amounts of pollution in the process. So we \nhave to look elsewhere to find a solution, and the place to look is \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy.\n  Energy efficiency is the fastest and cheapest way out of our \ndependence, and we know it works. In response to the 1970s oil crisis, \nthe Nation doubled the required gas mileage performance of our cars and \ntrucks and saw per capita oil consumption plummet, even as our economy \ngrew. Our progress in this area has not been steady, however. It has \nstagnated over the last two decades.\n  Progress resumed this year, when President Obama made the \nannouncement that we would increase gas mileage standards to more than \n35 miles per gallon 5 years ahead of the date scheduled. But we can do \nbetter. China will beat us to 35 miles per gallon, and 35 miles per \ngallon is not sufficient. We could aggressively develop and employ \nplug-in hybrid technology--cars with highly regenerative braking that \ncan go at least 30 miles on a charge, enough to cover the daily \ncommute, with no petroleum at all.\n  We need to deploy efficient strategies for the trucks that carry out \nour commerce--similar strategies with efficient body design. We need to \nmove goods by rail and barge. A barge can move a ton of cargo 576 miles \non a gallon of fuel, and a train can move a ton of cargo 413 miles on a \ngallon of fuel.\n  We should give our families and workers better transportation \noptions, better access to rail and bus lines. We know from experience \nthat with the right policy choices, we can use far less energy to power \nour economic activity.\n  We use a fraction of the energy today for gross domestic product that \nwe did 30 years ago. If we give American scientists, engineers, and \nbusinesses the right incentives, tomorrow's economy will be orders of \nmagnitude more efficient.\n  The other half of the equation is renewable energy, produced right \nhere in America. It is the second major weapon in the war against oil \naddiction. Renewable electric energy can replace oil by providing power \nfor plug-in electric vehicles.\n  I have heard Senator Reid describe Nevada as the Saudi Arabia of \nsolar power renewable electric energy, and I have heard the good \nSenator from North Dakota describe North Dakota as the Saudi Arabia of \nwind power renewable electric energy. We need to seize this Nation's \npotential for renewable electric in wind, solar, wave, and geothermal.\n  We can also transition to homegrown renewable liquid fuels in the \nform of biofuels. In my State of Oregon, as one example, we have lots \nof fiber that can be converted, forced biomass that can be converted \ninto fuel. We can produce biobutanol, biodiesel, and bioethanol. \nProducing biofuels from agricultural and forestry waste and waste from \ncellulosic nonfood crops raised on marginal lands, we can produce \nsignificant quantities of energy and create jobs and wealth for \nAmerica's farmers and timber workers.\n  If an American car can go 30 miles with renewable electricity and \nthen, if needed, switch over to a 50-mile-per-gallon engine burning \ncellulosic biofuels derived from forest biomass, that car is not using \na single drop of imported foreign oil. It is running on 100 percent \nred, white, and blue energy.\n  In energy efficiency and renewable energy, we have twin elements that \ncan break our addiction to foreign oil, but to achieve that self-\nsufficiency we need a comprehensive energy policy, a comprehensive \nstrategy for saving energy and producing our energy here at home. That \nis what President Obama called for and what the Senate Committee on \nEnvironment and Public\n\n[[Page S8240]]\n\nWorks is developing--drafting a comprehensive system of incentives and \ninvestment that, in combination with energy policies crafted by the \nSenate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, will reduce our \nfossil fuel dependence and put us on the track to energy self-\nsufficiency.\n  Some say that energy conservation and renewable energy are too \nexpensive. They could not be more wrong. Every economist will tell you \nthat the cheapest energy is the energy you never use. Even today, \nrenewable solar, wind, and geothermal are cheaper than imported oil \nwhen you factor in the huge price we pay to maintain our access to that \noil.\n  Let me add, when we stop spending $2 billion a day on imported oil \nand spend that money on renewable fuels here in the United States, we \nare going to create a lot of good-paying jobs for America's families.\n  Depending on a few foreign nations for imported oil is a colossal \nmistake. We need to change course, improve our national security, and \nspend our energy dollars here in America to create jobs. That is why I \nhope every Member of the Senate will join me in supporting our 2009 \nclean energy and jobs bill when it comes to the Senate floor this fall.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the 1 o'clock time has passed for the \nfiling of amendments as a result of the cloture motion being filed last \nevening. I believe we now have about 90 amendments filed to this bill. \nNot all of them will be offered, certainly, but 90 amendments represent \nthe determination of people who wish to alter this bill, who wish, \npresumably, to come and offer amendments, have a debate on amendments, \nand perhaps have a vote on their amendments. Yet no one arrives.\n  I indicated earlier that Senator Bennett and I have talked about a \nthird reading on this legislation to move it through the Senate. The \nfact is, the majority leader will not have the patience to allow us to \nsit here with nothing to do and people saying they want to offer \namendments but not being willing to show up to offer amendments. We \nhave been here since Monday afternoon, and very little has been done.\n  I again say to the staff that may be watching or Senators who are \nwatching, I think we ought to conclude this bill. If people are not \ninterested in offering amendments--filing amendments is not offering \nthem. If they do not have the interest in coming to the floor of the \nSenate to offer them, I am going to push very hard with the majority \nleader to go to third reading and finish this legislation this \nafternoon.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, while we await the arrival of Senators \nwho may be interested in offering their amendments, I ask unanimous \nconsent to speak for up to 12 minutes in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleague from \nOregon in discussing the challenges and opportunities America faces as \nwe look to ensure our economic leadership and prosperity for the 21st \ncentury and beyond.\n  America has always been a land of innovation and entrepreneurship. We \nled the way during the industrial revolution, which began at Slater \nMill in Pawtucket in my home State of Rhode Island. We led the way in \nthe information technology revolution that began in Silicon Valley. It \nis in American DNA to think boldly and through hard work to translate \nbold thinking into practical solutions, solutions that improve people's \nlives all over the world and bring prosperity to our shores.\n  It is time for us to lead again. A clean energy economy beckons, and \nwe must not, we cannot ignore the call. Congress must act to pass clean \nenergy legislation that will promote, here at home, cleaner, cheaper \nrenewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and biofuels. I stand \nhere today in strong support of such legislation.\n  Our transition to a clean energy economy is past due. This country \nhas run on the same fuels at basically the same efficiency levels since \nthe start of the industrial revolution over a century and a half ago. \nThis was acceptable in 1900, perhaps even in 1950, but where does it \nleave us today, in 2009?\n  First, it leaves us dependent on foreign oil. Approximately 40 \npercent of our energy needs are met through oil, and more than 70 \npercent of this oil, at a cost of $630 billion out of the American \ntaxpayers' pocket every year, comes from foreign sources including \nSaudi Arabia, Venezuela, and other regimes that do not wish us well. It \nis the largest transfer of wealth in history, and we are on the losing \nend of it, and international big oil is only too happy to profit off \nAmerica's decline.\n  Second, while we enrich hostile foreign governments and international \nbig oil, other countries have embraced the development, manufacture, \nand export of renewable clean energy technology, such as wind turbines \nand solar panels, so that now half of America's existing wind turbines \nare manufactured overseas. The United States invented the first solar \ncell, but we now rank fifth among countries that manufacture solar \ncomponents. The United States is home to only one of the world's top 10 \ncompanies manufacturing solar energy components and to only one of the \nworld's top 10 companies manufacturing wind turbines.\n  Recently, two wind turbines went up in Portsmouth, RI. One was \nmanufactured by Vestas, a Danish company, and the other by an Austrian \ncompany with a Canadian distributor that delivered the components to \nRhode Island. These turbines are very welcome. It was like a barn \nraising when they went up. People came out to watch. As a result, Rhode \nIsland and America got the benefit of cleaner, cheaper energy, but we \nmissed out on the manufacturing jobs these projects should have created \nfor American workers.\n  Other countries that have embraced the demand for clean energy \ntechnology, such as China, Germany, Japan, and Brazil, are all \ninvesting more per capita in clean energy than the United States.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a Washington \nPost article dated July 16, 2009, ``Asian Nations Could Outpace U.S. in \nDeveloping Clean Energy.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 16, 2009]\n\n      Asian Nations Could Outpace U.S. in Developing Clean Energy\n\n                           (By Steven Mufson)\n\n       President Obama has often described his push to fund \n     ``clean'' energy technology as key to America's drive for \n     international competitiveness as well as a way to combat \n     climate change.\n       ``There's no longer a question about whether the jobs and \n     the industries of the 21st century will be centered around \n     clean, renewable energy,'' he said on June 25. ``The only \n     question is: Which country will create these jobs and these \n     industries? And I want that answer to be the United States of \n     America.''\n       But the leaders of India, South Korea, China and Japan may \n     have different answers. Those Asian nations are pouring money \n     into renewable energy industries, funding research and \n     development and setting ambitious targets for renewable \n     energy use. These plans could outpace the programs in Obama's \n     economic stimulus package or in the House climate bill \n     sponsored by Reps. Henry A. Waxman (D-Calif.) and Edward J. \n     Markey (D-Mass.).\n       ``If the Waxman-Markey climate bill is the United States' \n     entry into the clean energy race, we'll be left in the dust \n     by Asia's clean-tech tigers,'' said Jesse Jenkins, director \n     of energy and climate policy at the Breakthrough Institute, \n     an Oakland, Calif.-based think tank that favors massive \n     government spending to address global warming.\n       Energy Secretary Steven Chu and Commerce Secretary Gary \n     Locke are visiting China this week to discuss cooperation on \n     energy efficiency, renewable energy and climate change. But \n     even though developing nations refused to agree to an \n     international ceiling for greenhouse gases last week, China \n     and other Asian nations are already devoting more attention \n     to cutting their use of traditional fossil fuels such as oil, \n     natural gas and coal.\n       South Korea recently said it plans to invest about 2 \n     percent of its GDP annually in environment-related and \n     renewable energy industries over the next five years, for a \n     total of $84.5 billion. The government said it would try to \n     boost South Korea's international market share of ``green \n     technology'' products to 8 percent by expanding research and \n     development spending and strengthening industries such as \n     those that produce light-emitting diodes, solar batteries and \n     hybrid cars.\n       China and India are kick-starting their solar industries. \n     India aims to install 20\n\n[[Page S8241]]\n\n     gigawatts of solar power by 2020, more than three times as \n     much as the photovoltaic solar power installed by the entire \n     world last year, the industry's best year ever. And China's \n     new stimulus plan raises the nation's 2020 target for solar \n     power from 1.8 gigawatts to 20 gigawatts. (A gigawatt is \n     about what a new nuclear power plant might generate.)\n       ``China is trying to catch up in a global race to find \n     alternatives to fossil fuels,'' the official China Daily said \n     in an article last week.\n       ``A lot of people underestimate how focused China is on \n     becoming a global leader in clean technology,'' said Brian \n     Fan, senior director of research at the Cleantech Group, a \n     market research firm. China now provides a $3-a-watt subsidy \n     upfront for solar projects, he said, enough to cover about \n     half the capital cost. Fan said it is ``the most generous \n     subsidy in the world'' for solar power.\n       China is also expected to boost its long-term wind \n     requirement to 150 gigawatts, up from the current 100 \n     gigawatt target, by 2020, industry sources said. Jenkins said \n     China could provide $44 billion to $66 billion for wind, \n     solar, plug-in hybrid vehicles and other projects. Fan said \n     China also plans to make sure that many of the orders go to \n     its own firms, Gold Wind and Sinovel.\n       The big Asian research and investment initiatives come as \n     U.S. policy makers boast about their own plans, giving \n     ammunition to those who say this country needs to do more.\n       ``That R represents America's chance to become the \n     world's leader in the most important emerging economic \n     sector: energy technology,'' said House Majority Leader Steny \n     H. Hoyer (D-Md.) in a May 13 speech to the U.S. Chamber of \n     Commerce. ``In the years to come, I hope that America will be \n     selling clean technology to China and India and not the other \n     way around.''\n       Confident that the United States will develop top-notch \n     technology, the House voted overwhelmingly on June 10 to \n     oppose any global climate change treaty that weakens the \n     intellectual property rights of American green technology.\n       ``We can cede the race for the 21st century, or we can \n     embrace the reality that our competitors already have: The \n     nation that leads the world in creating a new clean energy \n     economy will be the nation that leads the 21st century global \n     economy,'' Obama said on June 29.\n       But countries in Asia are not standing still waiting for \n     U.S. advances.\n       That both excites and worries U.S. manufacturers torn \n     between opportunity and fear of a boost for Asian competitors \n     at a time when the world's biggest market, the United States, \n     has slowed down sharply. ``This is heavy manufacturing \n     business. The U.S. has had a great position over the last \n     several years,'' said Vic Abate, vice president of renewables \n     at General Electric, the world's number two wind turbine \n     company. ``If it slows down and if investment doubles down in \n     China, it will be a lot harder to catch up.''\n       ``We have already been left behind in some areas,'' said \n     Mark Levine, director of the environmental energy \n     technologies division at Lawrence Berkeley National \n     Laboratory. ``But . . . there remain many opportunities,'' he \n     said, adding that ``the U.S. can carve out key areas in clean \n     energy technology.''\n       Although GE is the only U.S. company among the world's top \n     10 wind turbine makers (China has two, Germany has three), \n     Levine said ``there are areas in wind energy where we are \n     likely to develop crucial technologies that we will both \n     exploit and likely license to others.'' He cited advanced \n     materials that would permit stronger rotors and techniques \n     for taking advantage of higher wind speeds at greater \n     heights.\n       Levine said the United States is unlikely to ``become the \n     or even a leading photovoltaic manufacturer. But our \n     scientific talent . . . has a good chance of developing the \n     next-generation PV systems which we could either manufacture \n     in China or another country . . . or license to foreign \n     companies. . . . Even if the manufacturing is done abroad, \n     this will lead to very real and large benefits to the U.S. \n     from licensing fees, not to say sales in the U.S. and \n     elsewhere.''\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. We have some catching up to do, and while we do that \ncatching up, millions of Americans are out of work.\n  My home State of Rhode Island has one of the highest unemployment \nrates in our country. Across my State and across our country, couples \nare sitting at the kitchen table at night after the kids are in bed, \nwith the bills on the table in front of them, and they are trying to \nfigure out how to make ends meet and it is not adding up. That is the \nreality many Americans face when we cling to the failed policy of the \npast, when we care more about keeping big oil happy than about finding \nnew, inventive ways for the average American worker to find lasting, \nsecure employment in the tradition of American entrepreneurship.\n  Remarkably, there are those in Congress who would have us do nothing, \nwho would remain wedded to tired, centuries-old technologies and left \nin the dust as other nations race for leadership in the new clean \nenergy world. I submit this do-nothing caucus is selling America short. \nDon't they trust that when it comes to inventing new technologies and \nmanufacturing valuable products, we are the best in the world?\n  If Congress passes strong clean energy legislation that creates the \nnecessary incentives for the research, development, manufacture, and \nsale of clean energy technologies, that spirit of innovation and \nentrepreneurialism will again lead the world, as it has so often over \nthe centuries. We can have confidence in that.\n  We have already seen some progress. It is clear, at least, that \npeople outside the beltway get it. In the last 10 years, jobs in the \ntechnology sector have grown nearly 2\\1/2\\ times faster than overall. \nIn 2006 alone, the American Solar Energy Society estimates that \nFederal, State, and local governments spent $8.6 billion on energy \nefficiency, creating 64,000 direct jobs and 83,000 indirect jobs. Their \ninvestment of an additional $3.2 billion in expanding new energy \nproduction created more than 7,000 direct jobs and nearly 9,000 \nindirect jobs.\n  Every day in America, real people and real companies are moving into \nthe clean energy economy. In Rhode Island, Newport Biodiesel is \nproducing a cheaper form of home heating oil for Rhode Island families \nby recycling restaurant grease. Alteris Renewables is creating jobs in \nRhode Island installing solar energy systems on residential homes. I \nrecently visited a home in Charleston, RI, where a family has a new \nAlteris solar energy system on their roof and heard from them about the \nsignificant energy savings they will achieve.\n  But this is only a fraction of the scale needed to revolutionize our \neconomy. The American people, our researchers, entrepreneurs, and \nworkers from the largest, most sophisticated research institutions and \ncorporations to our smallest local businesses, can create clean energy \njobs everywhere in the United States--in urban areas as well as rural, \nin the Rust Belt as well as the Wheat Belt, in our deserts and on our \ncoasts. All they need is for us in Congress to set the economic \nparameters correctly, to level the playing field with foreign \ncompetition, to meet the market for investment in these products. \nAmerica is waiting for Congress to act.\n  As I close, let me address a couple of the points we often hear from \nthe do-nothing caucus and their see-nothing supporters in the \nboardrooms of the big polluters.\n  First, we simply cannot drill our way toward a secure energy future. \nIt would take 10 years before we would see any tangible results from \ndrilling, and the result would be negligible when it came. The United \nStates has only 3 percent of known oil reserves. Yet we use 25 percent \nof the world's oil production. We cannot drill our way out of that \nmath. The United States could supply 20 percent of our energy needs \nthrough wind power alone, not even factoring other forms of renewable \nenergy.\n  The choice is a clear one for the future: Do we continue to enrich \nExxonMobil and continue our dependence on foreign oil from places such \nas Saudi Arabia and Venezuela or do we decide to lead the world and tap \ninto America's most abundant resource, the innovation and \nentrepreneurship of the American people?\n  We should also be skeptical of the champions of the status quo when \nthey exaggerate the cost associated with transitioning to a clean \nenergy economy. Our CBO has projected that clean energy jobs \nlegislation would cost most American households on average less than a \npostage stamp per day, and it actually puts money back into the pockets \nof the poorest families, and that didn't even consider the savings to \nindividuals and companies from energy efficiency practices and \ntechnologies. If prices go up a little but efficiency reduces demand \nand reduces use, families save. They always leave that part out of \ntheir see-nothing scenarios. We can easily increase our energy \nefficiency to cover 15 percent of our energy needs by 2020 and save \nAmerican families and businesses nearly $170 billion in electricity \ncosts.\n  Of course, the do-nothing caucus overlooks the cost of doing nothing. \nUnchecked greenhouse gas pollution has already begun to melt our \nglaciers and warm our oceans, leading to stronger, more frequent storms \nand rising sea levels. America's insurers are\n\n[[Page S8242]]\n\nworried about our coasts, home to over 53 percent of the U.S. \npopulation, where we generate over 83 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct. We put a lot at risk if we follow the lead of the do-nothing \ncaucus.\n  We have heard the ``Do Nothing Caucus'' argue that strong \nenvironmental legislation would hurt the economy and cost us jobs. It \nis the same old polluters' argument. It is as wrong now as it has \nalways been before.\n  In the 1990 debate on the acid rain program, manufacturers warned \nthat the health benefits of the program were unclear and that their \nadoption could deal a ``crushing blow to U.S. business.'' But when the \nacid rain program was enacted, the program began delivering $70 billion \nannually in human health benefits, at a benefit-to-cost ratio of more \nthan 40 to 1. Industry and environmentalists alike now agree the \nprogram was a success. Oops to that argument.\n  In 1995, DuPont warned the costs of phasing out ozone-depleting \nchemicals would exceed $135 billion and that ``entire industries would \nfold.'' But when the phaseout became law, compliance costs turned out \nto be less than 1 percent of the doomsday projection. DuPont made \nmillions selling substitutes for the phased-out chemicals, and we \nmanaged to shrink the hole in the ozone layer of our Earth's \natmosphere. Oops again.\n  We are at a crossroads. We can step toward the clean energy economy \nthat beckons and show the world our capacity for leadership in the \nworld economy, as we have done time and time again, or we can cling to \nthe status quo, heads firmly wedged in the sand, and trade in our \nfuture for the well being of big oil and the Saudi Arabia royal family.\n  The right choice is clear, and I am confident we will make it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley.) The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                              Tort Reform\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I know a number of our colleagues have come to the floor \nand talked about health care reform. I think this is not only an \nimportant debate, I think the American people deserve our best work and \ncertainly our closest attention to something that will impact not just \nsome of us but literally all 300 million of us living here in the \nUnited States.\n  I want to focus my remarks on the next few minutes on what is \nmissing, what is missing from the bills moving in the Senate and the \nHouse of Representatives. Millions of Americans are paying attention to \nwhat is in these bills. That is a good thing. Everybody wants to see \nwhat Congress is up to and everybody wants to understand what is in \nthese bills and how it will impact their health care.\n  As I talk to my constituents in Texas, they tell me that Congress may \nwell make the problem worse, and for good reason. Families are worried \nthat Congress will increase the cost of their health care or force them \ninto a government plan, a pathway to a single-payer system.\n  Small business owners are concerned that higher taxes and new \nmandates will make it harder for them to weather the current recession. \nPhysicians and other health care providers are worried that we will not \nfix the problem with Medicare and Medicaid, and will make their hassles \neven worse by creating new government programs on top of flawed and \nunsustainable current government programs.\n  Patients--that would be all of us--are worried about the quality of \ncare and whether the government will ultimately deny treatment or delay \ntreatment as in Canada and the United Kingdom and other places where \nthe government has taken over health care. And everybody is, frankly, \nworried about spending more taxpayer dollars, especially after the \nspending spree we saw earlier this year with the flawed stimulus \npackage which spent more than $1 trillion, including interest, of \nborrowed money, and which has failed so far to meet its intended goal \nof keeping unemployment down to 8 percent or less.\n  I believe the people of this country will have greater confidence in \nCongress if we focus on reforms that will actually lower the cost of \nhealth care and not reduce access or quality, and that will actually \nincrease access and quality.\n  One proven way of doing that is not even on the table. I think the \nAmerican people would be justified in asking: Why? Why is that not on \nthe table? Why are we not talking about eliminating junk lawsuits that \ncreate the practice of defensive medicine and which do nothing but \nexacerbate and worsen high health care costs in this country?\n  Medical liability laws exist for a very good reason, to compensate \nvictims of negligence and other medical errors. Every victim of medical \nmalpractice deserves access to the courts and for their case to be \nheard. But over the years our laws have somehow encouraged a wave of \nfrivolous litigation which has done little but enrich trial lawyers and \nencourage the practice of defensive medicine and increase the cost of \nhealth care for all of us. It is estimated that defensive medicine \ncosts the American taxpayer more than $100 billion every year, $100 \nbillion of additional cost. That is according to economists Daniel P. \nKessler and Mark B. McClellan.\n  Yet despite this potential savings of $100 billion, trial lawyers \nhave not been asked to make the same sacrifices as others have to lower \nhealth care costs.\n  We know there is a lot of arm twisting going on here in Washington \nthese days. Hospitals, drug makers, insurers, and others have all been \nasked to pitch in, make a commitment to help. But so far there is one \ncontingent that has not been asked for one dime. That is the trial \nlawyers. They have not been asked to step up and take one for the team.\n  Medical liability reform can lower costs while expanding access to \ncare. I would respectfully suggest to my colleagues that they look to \nthe experiment we have recently conducted in the State of Texas. It is \na successful experiment to increase access and lower costs. Texas \nillustrates both the problem and the solution. In the early part of the \ndecade, Texas was a trial lawyer's dream and a doctor's nightmare. Our \nState had become a haven for medical malpractice lawsuits. As a result, \nphysicians' medical malpractice premiums had doubled and many insurers \nsimply gave up and left the State and would no longer write medical \nmalpractice insurance coverage at all. In fact, the number of physician \nliability insurers writing policies in Texas fell from about 17 to 4. \nMany doctors left the State or restricted the procedures they were \nwilling to perform or simply retired early. This reduced access to \nhealth care as well as quality for millions of people across the State \nof Texas.\n  Our legislature and our Governor at the time saw the problem, and in \na series of legislative reforms culminating in 2003, they took action. \nThey placed a $750,000 cap on noneconomic damages in medical \nmalpractice cases. They required the punitive damages; that is, damages \nthat are awarded for punishment, not as compensation, be approved by \njuries unanimously. They imposed a firmer statute of limitations saying \nyou needed to bring your claim within a specified time rather than sit \non your rights and allow this claim to be stale and witnesses' memories \ndim. They set a higher standard for expert witnesses, the so-called \nout-of-town folks with a briefcase who are willing to testify for or \nagainst a particular claim depending on their compensation.\n  These and other reforms were designed to create an honest and \npredictable civil justice system, in which victims would receive just \nand timely compensation; bad actors would be held to account; and the \ngood doctors could afford to practice in our State.\n  As I indicated, the results of this experiment have been dramatic. \nAverage premiums for medical malpractice fell by 27 percent on average, \n27 percent lower premiums, and in some cases by more than 50 percent.\n  Patients saw lower premiums for health care because doctors no longer \nhad to pay skyrocketing premiums for their medical liability insurance. \nThat translated into lower premiums for patients for their health care.\n  More than 400,000 Texans are now covered by health insurance because \npremiums have become more affordable. That is 400,000 more since these \nreforms took place.\n  Another amazing phenomenon here is that physicians literally flocked \nto our\n\n[[Page S8243]]\n\nState. They literally returned to the Lone Star State in large numbers. \nWe saw the overall growth rate of 31 percent in the number of new \nphysicians moving to our State, including underserved areas such as El \nPaso, TX, where a 76-percent increase in that underserved area was seen \nas a result of this reform.\n\n  We also saw a number of key medical specialists who had simply fled \ncritical parts of our State--such as obstetricians, neurosurgeons, \northopedic surgeons--return to practice and provide access to good \nquality health care.\n  Some Texans who had never had access to prenatal care or emergency \ncare available in their county now have greater access, which means \nshorter drive times and wait times and healthier babies and happier \nfamilies.\n  The results in Texas, I would submit, have simply been remarkable. \nBut what a great laboratory for us to learn from in enacting \ncommonsense medical liability reform as part of our overall health care \ndebate. But, of course, Texas is not unique in this experience. Other \nStates have reformed their laws as well to similar effect, including \nCalifornia, Colorado, Florida, Indiana, Montana, and Virginia. They \nhave seen lower costs and greater access to health care. What works in \nthe State can also work here in Washington, DC and around the whole \ncountry generally if we were simply to have the courage to embrace it. \nWe must include medical liability reform in eliminating junk lawsuits \nand frivolous litigation as part of any comprehensive health care \nreform bill.\n  Specifically, we should enact standards that cap noneconomic damages, \nestablish firmer statutes of limitations so that claims will be brought \non a timely basis and not after memories fail and evidence is lost. We \nshould implement several other reforms that have proved to be so \nsuccessful both in Texas and around our States. These reforms will \nlower the cost of health care for all Americans.\n  But do not take my word for it. Ask the Congressional Budget Office. \nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has been under tremendous \npolitical pressure these days, including an unprecedented invitation by \nthe President of the United States for the current Director to come \nover to the White House and explain why they have come back with such \neye-popping, sticker-shock numbers as they have with some of the \nproposals that have been made.\n  But the Congressional Budget Office took a look at the potential cost \nsavings if Washington adopted national reform along the lines of what \nwe have done in Texas. They estimated that the Federal Government alone \nwould directly save $5.6 billion from these types of reforms and that \ntotal health care spending could be reduced further if these reforms \nreduced the practice of defensive medicine.\n  CBO also concluded that such reforms would likely increase access to \nhealth care as we have seen in Texas, where doctors, instead of \nretiring, decide to continue to practice where they will feel less like \nhunted prey and more like the health care provider they always have \nwanted to be, and provide healing and comfort and care to people \nwithout access to care right now.\n  Medical liability reform cannot solve all of the problems in our \nhealth care system, but no health care reform bill will ever be \ncomprehensive without it. I would ask my colleagues why it is that \nevery other idea under the Sun seems to have made its way into the \nhealth care reform bills we have been debating except for one of the \nmost obvious, which is medical liability reform.\n  Even President Obama acknowledged that huge liability judgments lead \ndoctors to practice defensive medicine, which drives up the cost of \nhealth care for all of us.\n  Now is the time for Congress to reach the same conclusion and to take \nsteps that have proven so successful in a number of States. If we \nreform medical liability laws nationwide, eliminating junk lawsuits and \nfrivolous litigation, we will lower the cost of health care, we will \nexpand access to health care, and we will show the American people that \nwe are listening to them and focusing on solutions that will work.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1903 to Amendment No. 1813\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1903.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1903 to amendment No. 1813.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide additional amounts for technical assistance \n                                grants)\n\n       On page 34, line 7, before the period, insert the \n     following: ``: Provided further, That within existing funds \n     for industrial technologies $15,000,000 shall be used to make \n     technical assistance grants under subsection (b) of section \n     399A of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. \n     6371h-1(b)):\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this amendment addresses the issue of \ndistrict heating which has incredible potential as a force for \nsustainable energy. Specifically, what this amendment would do is \nprovide $15 million in technical assistance grants to institutional \nentities such as municipal utilities, institutions of higher learning, \npublic school districts, local government or a designee of any of these \nentities through section 399A of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act \nas incorporated by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. It \nwould do this by directing $15 million within the $100 million for the \nDOE industrial technologies program to be directed toward district \nenergy and combined heat and power.\n  This Nation has a huge opportunity to reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions, create jobs, and provide reliable energy for heating and \ncooling and electricity by moving toward district energy and combined \nheat and power. District energy systems provide heating and cooling to \ntwo or more buildings or facilities through underground pipes. These \nsystems can efficiently meet the heating and cooling needs of towns and \ncities. Much of Copenhagen, for example, is now heated through district \nheating. It can provide electricity and heating for college campuses, \nfor hospitals, public buildings, and other facilities.\n  Combined heat and power refers to the production of both electricity \nand thermal energy. You are creating electricity and heat from the same \npowerplant. Combined heat and powerplants can provide thermal energy \nfor district energy systems.\n  In my city of Burlington, VT, where I had the honor of being mayor \nfor 8 years, we built the largest wood chip burning plant in the State \nof Vermont. This plant has a 50-megawatt capacity that runs on wood \nchips and wood waste. Roughly 60 percent of the energy produced by this \nplant is lost as wasted heat. Burlington, similar to other cities \naround the country, could capture that waste heat and use it to provide \nheating and cooling to multiple buildings downtown.\n  According to a 2008 Department of Energy report, combined heat and \npower systems, particularly in coordination with district energy \nsystems, could make a huge impact in meeting our energy needs while \nlowering greenhouse gas emissions. Approximately 40 percent of our \nenergy consumption is for heating and cooling of our buildings as well \nas industrial process heat. Combined heat and power represents roughly \n9 percent of our electric power capacity today. If we can move to 20 \npercent combined heat and power by 2020, we could, according to the \nDOE, create more than 1 million new jobs and avoid more than 800 \nmillion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions. This would avoid more \nthan 60 percent of the projected growth in carbon dioxide emissions \nbetween now and 2030. In other words, this is a big deal. We are \ntalking about real technology that is deployable today, not 50 years in \nthe future. It is here today, ready to be utilized.\n  In Copenhagen, district energy provides clean heating to 97 percent \nof the city. This has saved energy, reduced fossil fuel consumption, \nand avoided greenhouse gas emissions. In our own country, in St. Paul, \nMN, district energy and combined heat and power provide 65 megawatts of \nthermal energy and 25 megawatts of electricity from renewable urban \nwood waste. That is an extraordinary development. This\n\n[[Page S8244]]\n\nheats more than 185 buildings, 300 homes, and cools an additional 95 \nbuildings. This has reduced emissions and provided exceedingly reliable \nenergy for St. Paul. Same story, smaller scale, Jamestown, NY.\n  I offer amendment No. 1903, which will provide $15 million for \ntechnical assistance grants under a program authorized in the 2007 \nEnergy Independence and Security Act. These grants will help with \nengineering studies and feasibility studies. The grants do require a \nmatch of between 25 and 60 percent so we are leveraging Federal dollars \nwisely. These grants were authorized but have never received funding. \nIn fact, we have long neglected district energy and combined heat and \npower systems. We should be providing Federal support for these \nefficient technologies.\n  Interestingly, according to the Biomass Resource Center and the \nInternational District Energy Association, there are hundreds of \nshovel-ready projects that need capital for infrastructure to go \nforward right now. We are on the verge of putting people to work, \ncutting greenhouse gas emissions, making these systems more energy \nefficient. We also have many programs around the country that are in \nneed of money for feasibility studies. By providing for technical \nassistance grants, we are taking an important step to move these \nprojects forward.\n  I ask the chairman of the committee, I have offered this amendment. \nHow does he suggest we proceed?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I am prepared to accept the amendment. My \ncolleague, Senator Bennett, is as well. The amendment has been cleared. \nWe have reviewed it. We think it has merit, and we have approved it on \nboth sides. I suggest we ask for consideration and have a vote on the \namendment at this point.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1903) was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I thank the Senator from Vermont. I know he cares \npassionately about this issue. The description he has given \ndemonstrates the merit of this proposal. Frankly, I am happy to be \nsupportive.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1895 to Amendment No. 1813\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside and Coburn amendment No. 1879 be called up.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Might I ask the Senator to yield for a question?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Senator Coburn and I and Senator Bennett talked about the \norder of his amendments. I believe he has three amendments. We intend \nto accept one. I had indicated to him on the contracting amendment he \nintends to offer, I will offer an amendment as well, and we will have \nside-by-side votes. I wonder if I might offer my amendment to have it \npending. The Senator would then offer his amendment and discuss it and \nI would offer my amendment on behalf of myself and Senator Bennett. If \nthat is acceptable to the Senator from Oklahoma, I believe my amendment \nis filed. I ask unanimous consent that that amendment be called up. It \nis amendment No. 1895. I ask that on behalf of myself and Senator \nBennett.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \nDorgan amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Dakota [Mr. Dorgan], for himself and \n     Mr. Bennett, proposes an amendment numbered 1895 to amendment \n     No. 1813.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide requirements regarding the authority of the \n         Department of Energy to enter into certain contracts)\n\n       On page 63, after line 23, add the following:\n       Sec. 312.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used by the Department of Energy \n     to enter into any federal contract unless such contract is \n     entered into in accordance with the requirements of the \n     Federal Property and Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 \n     U.S.C. 253) or Chapter 137 of title 10, United States Code, \n     and the Federal Acquisition Regulation, unless such contract \n     is otherwise authorized by statute to be entered into without \n     regard to the above referenced statutes.''\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1879 to Amendment No. 1813\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the Coburn amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1879 to amendment No. 1813.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To reduce the appropriation for Departmental Administration \n of the Department of Energy so that the Department can set an example \n        for all Americans by reducing unnecessary energy usage)\n\n       On page 44, line 4, strike ``$293,684,000'' and insert \n     ``$279,884,000''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me first discuss the amendment No. 1895. The American \npeople need to know what this is.\n  This is a way to say we are following the law on everything in terms \nof contracting except if it is an earmark. That is what this amendment \ndoes. It says we will follow all the laws on contracting except if we \nhave an earmark that we want some company to get that might be a \npolitical friend or political donor or might be something we think is \nbetter than somebody else might think. Dorgan 1895 essentially guts \ntransparency for this country in terms of when we buy, what we buy, and \nhow we buy.\n  My amendment says anything we buy is going to be competitively bid. \nSenator Dorgan may have something he believes in strongly and believes \nshould be done. There is nothing wrong with that, especially if it is \nauthorized. But there is plenty wrong with saying who is going to get \nthe benefit from that being done, which company, which firm, which \nspecial interest group. Most often earmarks are for the well heeled, \nthe well connected in this body. When I bring an amendment to the floor \nthat says we will have transparency, the American people will get \nvalue. Even if we do an earmark, at least we know we will buy that \nearmark at a competitive price compared to what we could have bought it \nfor otherwise.\n  What the Dorgan amendment does is guts that. It says we will follow \nthe law all the time, the Federal contracting statutes, except when we \nhave earmarked something. So what it does, it allows them to vote to \nsay they are following the law with the exclusion of all earmarks. \nWhereas my amendment says if you are going to earmark something, at \nleast in these times of trillions of dollars of deficit, maybe the \nAmerican taxpayer ought to get the benefit of having it competitively \nbid so that we get real value for it. It is not any more complicated \nthan that.\n  What we say in my amendment is if it is out there, get good value for \nthe American people, competitively bid it. Make sure it is online. Make \nsure we follow all the rules and regs. Today it is much more important \nthan ever because government purchasing is more important to those \npeople whose businesses are down-sliding. So we are having many more \npeople interested in competing for the dollars on government work. Yet \nwe have an amendment that is going to be voted on side by side for \npolitical cover only that sounds good. It sounds good. It says:\n\n       None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available \n     by this Act may be used by the Department of Energy to enter \n     into any Federal contract unless such contract is entered \n     into in accordance with the requirements of the Federal \n     Property and Administrative Services Act . . . or Chapter 137 \n     of title 10, United States Code, and the Federal Acquisition \n     Regulation, unless such contract is otherwise authorized by \n     statute . . .\n\n  That is code word for earmark, ``unless such contract is otherwise \nauthorized by statute.''\n  If you vote for the Dorgan amendment, you want to continue to connect \nthe well heeled, the well connected and you don't want transparency and \nyou don't want competitive bid prices on what we as Americans pay \nthrough our tax dollars for what the government buys. It is as simple \nas that. What my amendment says is, each time, every time, unless it is \nin the interest of national security, we will, in fact, competitively \nbid. We may not all agree\n\n[[Page S8245]]\n\nwhere Senator Dorgan or I may want something done, but at least when we \nare doing it, we will buy it in a more efficient, more effective way \nand save money for the American taxpayer.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays on my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Is the order that we will pool votes for a later time?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will respond, of course, to the comments \nof the Senator from Oklahoma. If he would wish, it might be sensible \nfor him to proceed to offer his other amendments, calling them up, \nsetting aside this amendment, and we will have them all in front of us. \nThen we can discuss them and develop an order by which we might vote.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 1878 as Modified to Amendment No. 1813\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask that the pending amendment be set aside and I call \nup amendment 1878; further, that it be in order to modify the amendment \nwith the change I send to the desk. I understand Senator Dorgan has \napproved this change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1878, as modified to amendment No. 1813.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment, as modified, is as follows:\n\n     (Purpose: To require public disclosure of reports required in \n                         appropriations bills)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. ___. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act and except as provided in subsection (b), any report \n     required to be submitted by a Federal agency or department to \n     the Committee on Appropriations of either the Senate or the \n     House of Representatives in an appropriations Act shall be \n     posted on the public Website of that Agency upon receipt by \n     the committee.\n       (b) Subsection (a) shall not apply to a report if--\n       (1) the public posting of the report compromises national \n     security; or\n       (2) the report contains proprietary information.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, throughout this appropriations bill, we \nhave a lot of reports we are asking agencies to come up with. This is \nanother amendment about transparency. I appreciate the fact that the \nchairman and ranking member will accept this amendment.\n  What this says is, if we get a report, the agency has to report it to \nthe American people. In other words, they have to publish it. We get to \nsee what the results of that report are. There are exceptions for \nnational intelligence and the military, but in those areas where there \nis not a reason for the American people not to see it in terms of \nnational defense or our own security, what this amendment says is the \nagencies have to release the reports and put them online and make them \navailable to the American people. You paid for the report; you ought to \nbe able to see the results. Far to often around here, we get reports \nbut only certain people get the reports. Some of us never get reports. \nSo what this says is, the reports that come out of here that are not \nrelated to national security or defense and otherwise are appropriate \nwill be made available by the agency to the American public.\n  With that, I yield to the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Bennett and I have reviewed this \namendment and think it has merit and support it and hope we could vote \non this by voice vote and that we might do so immediately. So, Mr. \nPresident, if the Senator from Oklahoma is ready, I will suggest that \nwe dispose of this amendment by consent.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is fine for us to accept it.\n  Mr. DORGAN. It has been cleared by both the Republican side and \nDemocratic side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, without objection, the amendment, as modified, is agreed to.\n  The amendment (No. 1878), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COBURN. So I understand, Mr. President, we have accepted \namendment No. 1878. I also understand that amendment No. 1884, which \nrequires contracts, has a side-by-side with Dorgan amendment No. 1895.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1879\n\n  Mr. President, is amendment No. 1879 pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, it is.\n  Mr. COBURN. At the Department of Energy, one of its tasks in this \ncountry is to help us with energy efficiency, to help us with a lot of \nwhat we would expect to be within the Department of Energy. It is \npeculiar, however, when the Department of Energy has looked at \nthemselves, they are highly inefficient, according to their own \ninspector general, with the utilization of energy.\n  They have 9,000 buildings. The inspector general said last year they \nwasted at least $13.8 million in energy costs--$13.8 million. There is \n$13.8 million they could have saved had they done some small, simple, \nstraightforward things like they request every other agency in the \nFederal Government to do. Isn't it ironic that the very agency that is \ntelling all the rest of the agencies to save money by becoming \nefficient with their computers, by becoming efficient with their \nheating and cooling systems, by becoming efficient with their \nutilization of lighting, does not even follow their rules they ask the \nrest of the agencies to follow.\n  This is a very simple amendment. We know at least $13.8 million was \nwasted last year. That is probably just the tip of the iceberg. This \namendment says we are going to reduce their funds by $13.8 million. And \nI can tell them the steps tomorrow as to how they can save $13.8 \nmillion so it will have no net effect on the agency. So with what we \ndo, the American taxpayers get $13.8 million, as a minimum, of energy \nsavings out of the Department of Energy. That is as straightforward as \nI can say it.\n  Here is another one of those reports that nobody reads except our \nstaff, and you see the IG is doing their actual work, and now we are \nbringing an amendment to the floor. It has not been agreed to. It has \nnot been accepted. But it is absolute common sense. I do not understand \nwhy it is not accepted, when the IG has plainly listed out where you \ncan save the money and how you can do it. Why would we not reduce their \nfunding to force them to do that?\n  So it is a no-net-revenue-loss for them because they are going to \nsave the $13.8 million as they reconfigure computers, as they follow \ntheir own regulations within the Department of Energy. I will not go on \nin detail. But this is the kind of commonsense amendment we need to be \ndoing in the Senate to hold the agencies accountable to follow their \nown rules, as they force everybody else to follow the same set of \nrules. This is not ``do as I do.'' This is ``do what you see us \ndoing.'' That is the model, and that is the example.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1884 to Amendment No. 1813\n\n  Mr. President, it is my understanding that amendment No. 1884 still \nneeds to be called up. So at this time, I ask unanimous consent to set \naside the pending amendment, call up amendment No. 1884, and then \nfollowing its calling up, to set it aside and resume the present \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1884 to amendment No. 1813.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n    (Purpose: To prohibit no bid contracts by requiring the use of \ncompetitive procedures to award contracts and grants funded under this \n                                  Act)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this \n     Act, none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by this Act may be used to make any payment in \n     connection with a contract unless the contract is awarded \n     using competitive procedures in accordance with the \n     requirements of section 303 of the Federal Property and \n     Administrative Services Act of 1949 (41 U.S.C.\n\n[[Page S8246]]\n\n     253), section 2304 of title 10, United States Code, and the \n     Federal Acquisition Regulation.\n       (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, none \n     of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available by this \n     Act may be awarded by grant unless the process used to award \n     the grant uses competitive procedures to select the grantee \n     or award recipient.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1879\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are back on the \nprevious amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. One last point I would like to make is that the \nDepartment of Energy is responsible for numerous private sector energy-\nefficient programs and for the enforcement of those programs. It makes \nsense that if they are going to be the enforcer and be responsible, \nthey ought to follow those same energy efficiencies to regain the \nconfidence of the very people they are saying they want change from. It \nis pretty hard to expect people to swallow making changes for energy \nefficiency in all the rest of the government agencies when the very \nagency that is telling you to do it does not follow its own rules. So \nthis is straightforward.\n  I know the appropriators do not like somebody coming and cutting \nmoney, but this is a no-net-cost to the agency. All they have to do is \nabout 15 small steps--very inconsequential in terms of cost--and they \ncan save almost $14 million next year. Probably they will save $20 \nmillion or $25 million, and that is just based on the two IG reports we \nhave from the fall of last year and the spring of this year. So this is \nnot old data. This is brandnew data. These are brandnew reports from \nthe IG.\n  I hope my colleagues would reconsider and accept this amendment \nbecause it is one of the ways we can save $13.8 million. It is an easy \ndeal.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, as always, the Senator from Oklahoma is \nthoughtful and courteous, and we appreciate--Senator Bennett and I \nappreciate--him coming to the floor and offering his amendments.\n  Let me say to the Senator from Oklahoma, we cut the administration \nbudget in the Department of Energy by $8 million as we brought it to \nthe floor. But even more important than that, we have cut $643 million \nfrom the Department of Energy from the President's budget. So as CBO \nrecalculates the President's request to the Congress, we have cut $643 \nmillion. And we have cut $8 million in the administration budget in the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  So I sympathize with his notion. I certainly strongly support what he \nis suggesting to the Department of Energy they should do. I just say to \nhim, we have already made those cuts and far, far more in terms of what \nthe President wanted for the Department of Energy. We are $643 million \nbelow the President's request and $8 million below in the \nadministration accounts in the Department of Energy.\n  Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, the Senator would admit, would he not, \nthat the President's request is what he requested, it is not what was \nactually spent last year? That is No. 1. What you have done is cut $8 \nmillion from actual expenditures in administration last year.\n  Mr. DORGAN. That is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. So therefore would the Senator agree to accept my \namendment to just adding $5.5 million to the $8 million you have \nalready cut, because you are going to get it back in energy savings?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, again, I agree that what we ought to be \ndoing is encouraging the Department of Energy--all Departments--to be \nengaged in energy savings and efficiencies and so on. I will be glad to \nvisit the Senator about cuts. But, as I said, we already made \nsubstantial cuts. I think the Senator from Oklahoma knows that the \nPresident's request, in the context of the broad range of budget \nrequests for a broad group of Federal agencies, was what he felt he \nwanted and needed in order to have some sort of transformational energy \nfuture.\n  We are working on a wide range of new and innovative energy \napproaches: decarbonizing coal, additional production in wind and solar \nand biomass, additional production offshore in the gulf. We are working \non a lot of issues, and some of that requires substantial research and \ndevelopment. So the President had a pretty good appetite for what he \nfelt was needed. We cut that by $643 million.\n  The reason I am emphasizing that to the Senator is Senator Bennett \nand I did not just saddle up and say: Well, whatever you want, here it \nis. We cut it, and we cut it because we felt those cuts were deserved.\n  I certainly appreciate the Senator from Oklahoma coming to the floor \nwanting additional cuts. But $643 million is a pretty substantial walk \naway from what the President had originally requested for that agency.\n  My hope is that we can include--we will include--certainly I will be \nthe chairman of the conference--we will include very strong and \nassertive language of the type the Senator is requiring of the \nDepartment of Energy. I would insist, as well, that the Department of \nEnergy--all agencies--demonstrate efficiencies and conservation and the \nkinds of things that can and should be done to address the overusage of \nenergy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I would associate myself with the \nchairman's remarks and simply add a few more figures. In the energy \nefficiency and renewable account, we reduced funding for program \ndirection by $85 million, and program support funding was reduced by \n$48 million. In the Office of Science, we have cut funding for field \noffices by $13 million and cut headquarters funding by $6 million. And \nthe President's request for the personnel and program direction account \nwe cut by $160 million.\n  So these are a little more granular than the overall figure the \nchairman mentioned. But I mention them to point out that we have indeed \nlooked at each one of these individual items very carefully and \nproduced the result the chairman described.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me just make a comment.\n  I know the Senator feels strongly about contract reform, and on the \ntwo amendments in front of us, the Senator from Oklahoma talked a lot \nabout earmarks. But, of course, he is well aware that his amendment \ndeals with far more than just earmarks. The issue of formula awards to \nState and local governments which are carried in this legislation, the \nissue of competitive grants, the contract competition model that the \nSenator seems to suggest the Senator believes is appropriate for the \ncompetition and research and development, many of which are very exotic \nand interesting and cutting-edge, world-class research projects in the \nDepartment of Energy--I do not know that--I guess the people who do \nknow suggest that the contract competition model for some of those \nkinds of things does not work very well because you are looking at \nthings that go well beyond just who is going to bid the lowest on the \nkind of research and very high-tech, exotic research we are doing in a \nwide range of energy fields.\n  I generally have always supported contract competition. There is \nnobody who has been tougher on the Department of Defense, for example, \non some of these contracts, particularly no-bid contracts to those who \nare contracting in Iraq. Next Monday will be my 20th hearing on issues \nlike that. I strongly support competition in contracting.\n  I think this amendment that has been offered is not an amendment that \nvery well fits this bill and addresses, in a very broad-stroke way, \nsome things that should not be addressed that way. So that is the \nreason I have offered an alternative to it. My hope is that the Senate \nwill agree with the alternative.\n  I might say, I believe this exact debate was held 2 weeks ago on the \nHomeland Security bill and has already been resolved by the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I enjoy my debates with the appropriators. \nI love you guys. I think it is great.\n  The one thing that was not mentioned is that in the stimulus bill the \nDepartment of Energy got an additional billion dollars. So there has \nbeen no net cut. There has actually been a massive increase in the \nDepartment of Energy when you count the stimulus bill.\n\n[[Page S8247]]\n\n  No. 2 is, you have ramped up the FEMP the Federal Energy Management \nProgram, by 50 percent, going from $22 million to $33 million, the very \nprogram that they are enforcing on everybody else. Yet they won't \ncomply with it.\n\n  I also would say the Senate is going to get to decide this every time \nwe have an appropriations bill as far as transparency in contracting. I \nmay get smarter at the way I write it, but the American people deserve \nto have great value.\n  If you want to change the contracting law to say there are certain \ntimes we shouldn't do that in terms of highly specific scientific \nthings, that is fine with me; but the fact is billions and billions and \nbillions of dollars are well placed directly to businesses in this \ncountry at higher rates than they would have been otherwise had we had \ncompetitive bidding and open contracting. Nobody can deny that fact. \nNobody can deny that fact. I am talking about all across the \ngovernment.\n  So we are going to get a vote on competitive bidding on every \nappropriations bill that comes before the Senate. The American people \nget it. It is a great defense you are offering, but it isn't going to \npass the smell test with the American people. They deserve the best \nvalue they can get on every penny we spend of their money, not our \nmoney.\n  I understand we think we have decided it. We are going to keep voting \nit; we are going to keep voting against it, and we are going to keep \ntelling the American people we are still going to connect up with our \nbuddies, we are still going to make sure these people who are well \nheeled and well connected are going to get the contracts.\n  I will grant to the chairman there are certain things that should be \noutside of this that are highly scientific, that are limited to very \nfew potential bidders, and maybe even only one. But, remember, we have \nFutureGen going in Chicago now, a $2 billion earmark that is going to \nbe a $4 billion earmark that is going to be a $6 billion earmark that \nwe said only one person can do, and MIT says nobody can do it because \nthe technology isn't finished. We have that going. That is a Department \nof Energy earmark. So it is not just hundreds of thousands of dollars; \nit is billions and billions and billions of dollars.\n  America should hear that what we are going to see is we have all the \nreasons in the world why we are not going to be competitively bid. We \nare going to give you all the reasons why we are not going to be \nefficient with your dollars, why now is not the time, why we shouldn't \ndo this now. But the fact is that while we shouldn't be doing it, we \nare cutting the legs off of our children and grandchildren.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Oklahoma is not going to \nwin a debate we are not having.\n  I agree with most of what the Senator from Oklahoma said. I support \ncontract--but the Senator from Oklahoma himself suggested maybe we \nshould have a different model for the highly exotic research contracts. \nBy the way, they are not just a few. You go to the labs and take a look \nat the contracts that are going on around the country in very exotic, \nhigh-tech research; cutting-edge, world-class research. If, in fact, \nthere should be perhaps a different model for that, it is not in this \namendment. That is my point.\n  I would be happy to sit down with the Senator from Oklahoma to bring \nan amendment to the floor that does address things in the right way, \nbut to bring an amendment to the floor that has a very broad brush that \ncovers everything when the Senator himself acknowledges that probably \nsomething other than that should be done with respect to these kinds of \nexotic research programs--he didn't respond to the issue of State \nformula grants and so on--but again, we are not having a debate about \nthe merits of what you aspire to achieve.\n  I want us to have contracting rules that give the American people the \nbest value for their dollar, that advance this country in the most \nsignificant, capable way. We want the same things. But my point is, \nwhen one offers an amendment such as this that says, All right, do it \nall this way, and even--I would say to the Senator from Oklahoma, even \nthe Senator acknowledges there are areas that perhaps shouldn't be \nhandled that way. So let's do it in a way that resolves it in the right \nway.\n  I know he is frustrated that we likely won't pass this amendment, but \nif he is going to bring it up time and time again, the next time or the \ntime after, let's do it in a way that gets closer to that which we \nbelieve will address all of these issues the right way for the American \ntaxpayer, and I will be on his side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I say to both the chairman and the \nSenator from Oklahoma, if there is going to be a meeting to try to \nwrite this in the proper way, I want to be a part of it, because I \nagree absolutely with the effort the Senator is making.\n  But the Senator from Oklahoma made one reference to efficiency. He \nsaid we want a bidding process that is efficient. I want to step out \nfor a moment from the scientific debate into another circumstance that \nhas to do with this bill, that has to do with my own State that I can \ngive an exact example for.\n  We have a cleanup program in southern Utah dealing with the cleanup \nof an old uranium plant. The tailings from that plant are right next to \nthe Colorado River, and the fear is that the leaching from the tailings \nof that plant is going into the Colorado River, not only threatening \nthe fish but the population downstream, downstream States, and the \ncountry of Mexico, and significant problems. All right. A contractor \nwas necessary to clean up the tailings pile and there was competitive \nbidding that went on and the contractor was chosen and is now involved \nin a very significant, multimillion-dollar cleanup program.\n  As I understand the language of the amendment of the Senator from \nOklahoma, because we are appropriating more money for that cleanup \nprogram in this bill, we need another competitive bidding proceeding to \nsee if that is the right contractor. This is a contractor who is \nlooking at 10 years, 12 years for the contract, and every time a new \nappropriation is necessary in each bill. It would seem to me it makes \nsense that once we have picked the contractor through competitive \nbidding, there does not have to be a competitive bid every year to see \nwhether another contractor can now move in, take over, and make this \nwork. It is possible we could. It is possible that this first \ncontractor might be running up costs in fashions he shouldn't be doing \nand there should be a review. But I agree with the Senator from North \nDakota that this is too much of a broad brush in that kind of area.\n  I was involved as a freshman Senator with respect to concessions at \nnational parks, and I angered the ranking member of that committee when \nI sided with some other Senators in the majority--the Democrats at the \ntime--to change the rules with respect to concessions in national parks \nbecause I said this is a rigged bidding situation where the incumbent \ncontractor is always going to be taken care of. We finally got that \ndone.\n  I am completely in sympathy with what is trying to be done here, but \nI discovered in going through that process--the same general idea, \ndifferent set of facts--that it is more difficult than it looks on the \nsurface. That is why I am supporting the chairman in the amendment he \nis offering. But if there is going to be a discussion of how this gets \nmore efficient in the pattern in which it is written, I want to be a \npart of that, because I am completely sympathetic to the effort of \ntrying to see to it that we have open contracting wherever it makes \nsense.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. The Senator from Utah mischaracterizes both the intent \nand the function of the amendment. If something is already contracted \nthat has already been appropriated for, it won't be affected. It is new \ncontracts and new bids. That is the intent.\n  The reason I come with this is because nothing ever changes here. If, \nin fact, we pass my amendment, you know what. We will have to change \nthe contracting. How do we change contracting with everything that is \ncoming across the floor? How do we get it through committee? We will \nnever move it until we are forced to move it.\n\n[[Page S8248]]\n\nThat is why this amendment is written this way, because all of us know \nthe great deal of difficulty to get anything done in this body.\n  So if, in fact--we are going to do three bills in the next 2 weeks: \none on the transportation trust fund, one on unemployment insurance, \nand one on HUD that has to be done. They will get done. So the reason \nit is written this way is because it will have to get done and we will \ndo it. We will never get it done the other way, and both of my \ncolleagues recognize that there is truth in that statement.\n  I am going to insist we have a vote on the amendment. I thank the \nchairman and ranking member for their debate. I remind the American \npeople that there is always an excuse in Washington not to have \ntransparency, not to be efficient, and not to be effective. We will \nalways find a way not to get good value for your money.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, without prolonging this debate, let me say \nto the Senator from Oklahoma there are other ways to get things done as \nwell. I mean, look, some of the most significant contracts that have \ngone out of this town recently in the last 10 years or so--the LOGCAP \ncontract which provides services by contractors in Iraq--sole-source \ncontract, billions and billions and billions of dollars--most of it \nwent to Halliburton and KBR, by the way; not all of it but the fact is \nmassive amounts of money.\n  I have held 20 hearings as of Monday on these issues. You know what. \nFinally, they are bidding all of those contracts. Finally, they are \nbidding them. When you hold up some of the abuses, you can actually \nrequire change, in my judgment. Yesterday the inspector general said \nthose who were providing electrical services to the military bases in \nIraq were responsible for the electrocution of soldiers because they \nwere hiring third-country nationals who didn't know how to ground \nelectrical wires, didn't know how to speak English. You know what. \nThose contracts are now going in other directions. There was a contract \nto provide water to military bases and the nonpotable water was more \ncontaminated than raw water from the Euphrates River, paid for by our \ntaxpayers to contractors who didn't have the foggiest idea what they \nwere doing and got billions of dollars of contracts they didn't have to \nbid on.\n  The fact is this sort of thing is despicable and needs to change. I \ntake no backseat to any Member of the Senate about trying to change \nthese things. I have held 20 hearings on these contract issues in \nrecent years. The Senator from Oklahoma comes and raises important \nquestions, always. I understand that. My point to him was simple: This \namendment, in my judgment, doesn't respond to all of the issues the \nSenator needs to respond to if the Senator is going to do an amendment \nthat does reform contracting. I am very interested in working with him. \nHe is on the right subject, in my judgment, just the wrong amendment.\n  I wanted to say, there are a lot of ways to change things. Yes, with \nan amendment here on the floor of the Senate; in committees; and I am \nsure the Senator from Oklahoma does that as well; pressing Federal \nagencies. You can get change by putting all of the spotlights on the \nsame spot in a Federal agency to say, How do you justify this? We \ndemand you change.\n  So there is a lot of good work that goes on by people who care about \nforcing change, and many of us have done it.\n  I wanted to say there are a lot of ways to do this and I encourage \nthe Senator from Oklahoma to continue. I want to be a part of \nconstructive change on contracting. I have been in the past and will be \nin the future.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me ask if the Senator would agree, if \nhe would withhold--I believe the Senator from Missouri wishes to make a \nvery brief statement and she may be offering an amendment--I don't know \nthat she is going to require a vote on it--and then we could line up--I \nbelieve we will have three recorded votes.\n  Mr. COBURN. That will be fine with me.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If we could turn to the Senator from Missouri at this \npoint and then we could line up three successive votes on the Coburn \namendments, two by Senator Coburn and one by myself and Senator \nBennett.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North Dakota. \nI wish to agree with my friend, the Senator from Oklahoma, on his \namendment on contracting competition. Maybe it is fitting that in the \nEnergy bill, I am probably doing a Don Quixote here, tilting at a \nwindmill.\n  I have learned during my time in the Senate that there are certain \nthings that are very protected, and one of them is the earmarking \nprocess. I think most people would acknowledge that we have billions in \nnoncompete contracts through earmarks, and they are not all for exotic \nresearch. Yes, we have noncompete contracts a lot of places and we \nshould try to get rid of all of them, every last one of them. If it is \nexotic to research, then there are probably not going to be very many \npeople who have bid on it.\n  So I don't agree with my friend from North Dakota on this issue of \ncarving out earmarks as an area of noncompete. I think----\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The Senator is not describing my position. I did not \nsuggest carving out earmarks. The Senator has not heard that this \nafternoon.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I just listened to the debate.\n  Mr. DORGAN. You didn't hear that during the debate.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Let me restate what I heard. I heard the Senator from \nOklahoma wants to pass an amendment that would require competition for \nall of the earmarks in the bill. I think that is a good idea. I think \ncompeting for all earmarks is a good idea. I think it is not correct \nthat the noncompetitive earmarks are all exotic research or any other \nkind of earmark that could lend itself to competition. I think there \nare many that could easily lend themselves to competition. I believe \nthat once we get to competition, it is going to provide transparency \nthe American people are aching for in this area of earmarking.\n  (Mr. BURRIS assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield again?\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. The discussion wasn't just about earmarks. Perhaps it \nincluded them, but if the Senator is describing an amendment that only \nrequires competition, or competitive bidding on earmarks, that is not \nthe amendment.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. My discussion is about the noncompetitive earmarks. I \nthink whatever amendment gets us to more competition, I am for it. I \nthink there are way too many. I could not be a bigger fan of the \nSenator from North Dakota and what he has done on contracting relating \nto the war in Iraq. I followed those hearings before I came to the \nSenate, and I continue to follow them. He has been a groundbreaker in \nthe area of wanting competition.\n  If you look at the billions of dollars that were wasted in the Iraq \nwar over noncompete contracts, and if you look at the atrocities \ncommitted in the name of noncompetition which the Senator from North \nDakota has exposed, he has been terrific on that. Some of us just \ndisagree about whether earmarks should be competed. Although I try to \nagree on every bill that removes all earmarks, I generally don't go \ninto and pick out an earmark to complain about. I generally don't vote \nfor amendments that do, because in many ways I think the process of \npicking on one amendment here or there, or one earmark here and one \nearmark there can be as arbitrary as the process of earmarking \nsometimes appears to be. So I generally don't do that.\n  But in this instance, there is an earmark in the bill that I know a \nlot about. The Senator from North Dakota has done this because he \nbelieves very much in having another study on the Missouri River. We \nhave been fighting over water in this country for as long as this \ncountry has been around. Water is very important in Missouri. \nNavigation of the Missouri River is incredibly important to our farmers \nand to our utility companies.\n  There was, in fact, a large study undertaken on the Missouri River \nthat\n\n[[Page S8249]]\n\nwas completed in 2004. It cost the taxpayers $35 million. It took 15 \nyears to complete, and there were all kinds of lawsuits over it between \nthe various States up and down the river. There were a couple of things \nthat came out of the study. One of them was there was an agreement that \nbegan the Missouri Recovery and Implementation Committee. It is a \ncommittee that includes stakeholders from all along the river who meet \nseveral times a year to help develop a long-term management plan for \nthe river. This process has recently begun. It hasn't even had time to \nwork.\n  I feel strongly that repeating another study is unnecessary, when \nthere is nothing that has dramatically changed since we spent the $35 \nmillion on the study done in 2004. And now we are going to begin \nanother $25 million study by the same group, looking at the same \nissues. That, to me, is wasteful.\n  I think considering the fact that the Senator from North Dakota did \nparticipate aggressively in the long-term management proposal on the \nMRIC, Missouri Recovery and Implementation Committee, I hope we can \ngive it time to work before we embark on another policy. I know there \nwas a GAO study that talked about navigation, and I know that study \nshowed there are less goods being shipped on the Missouri River. But \nthat GAO study didn't take into account a couple of things. One was \nthat the navigation season has been severely limited by the Corps. That \ndrives away the shippers. The GAO study also didn't include the value \nof the goods shipped, the jobs associated with the shipments, or the \nimpact on utilities.\n  We have, in fact, four powerplants located along the river that need \nthe water in the Missouri River to cool their plants. I think this \nstudy is not going to end the fight over the river. I cannot fathom \nwhat a $35 million study failed to accomplish that a new $25 million \nstudy is now going to accomplish. This is a great example of studies to \ntry to impact policy, so that you keep having continuous studies.\n  The amendment I have offered would remove the money for this study, \nbecause I think it is wasteful duplication, and I believe very strongly \nthat, in fact, we should not be embarking on another one of these \nstudies. It is wasteful and it is duplicative, and I want to continue \nto work with the Senator from North Dakota. Obviously, we don't see eye \nto eye on who should get all the water on the Missouri River. I look \nforward to working with him and, hopefully, as we move forward with the \nMRIC, we can have all the stakeholders at the table and continue to \nnegotiate in a cost-effective way for the taxpayers that doesn't harm \nthe State of North Dakota or any of the other States along the Missouri \nRiver.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the Senator from Missouri is an active, \navid, and aggressive fighter for the interests of her State. I \nunderstand and recognize that. I would not expect anything else. But I \nwill tell you a story about water and about the Missouri River. The \nMissouri River was a big old wild tangled river for a long time. It \nused to flood; it flooded a lot. In the spring, when the floods came \nfrom the river, it would devastate parts of my State, and South Dakota, \nand other States down South, and it would ruin the parks and flood them \nin St. Louis, MO, and so on. So some people came to North Dakota from \nthe Federal Government and said: We would like to harness that Missouri \nRiver. They cannot play softball in the parks in St. Louis because of \nthe flooding, and we would like to get the benefits of flood control. \nOur deal is this: If you will allow us, in the middle of North Dakota, \nto put in a flood that will come and stay forever--a big old flood, \nhalf a million acres of permanent flood, if you allow us to do that, we \nwill allow you to have some benefits. We understand we are asking to \nflood your State in order to protect the downstream States. But if you \nallow us to do that, and if Montana and South Dakota will allow us to \ndo that, we can put in these big old floods in the upstream States; and \nwe understand there is a cost to you to have this flood, so we will let \nyou move water around to benefit your State, and it will be good and \nyou will appreciate it. The folks in my State, believing this was on \nthe level, signed contracts and said that would be OK. They moved the \nIndians off the bottomland from reservations of the three affiliated \ntribes, and built the big old dam, and President Dwight Eisenhower came \nout to dedicate the dam. They backed up the water, and we have the half \nmillion acre flood. The Elbow Woods Indian Hospital is now under water, \nand has been for 50 years. So we have the flood that comes and stays.\n  The problem with the way the river is managed, after they built six \nmainstream dams, in order to harness the Missouri River, the way they \nmanage it today is the way they planned to do it 60 years ago. They \nsaid we have a vision. We will be able to navigate the river down South \nwith barges, and we will haul material on barges. What a great thing. \nThink of the value of having barge navigation on the downstream reaches \nof the Missouri River. Do you know what. There are days when--and I can \nget you reports--there is only one miserable boat floating in the \ndownstream reaches of the Missouri. Yet we are furiously releasing \nwater from the upstream dams to support one little old barge. By the \nway, that barge is hauling mostly sand and gravel, which is something \nof relatively low value. So we have this big fight about how the river \nshould be managed.\n  In the old days, they predicted a lot of commercial value of barge \ntraffic. But, in fact, that is not the case. The upstream value of \nrecreation, tourism, and fishing is now almost 10 times the value of \nthe downstream value of barge traffic. Yet the river is still managed \nfor the minnow and not the whale, which is typical of the Corps of \nEngineers: Never change. Resist change. Never change, no matter what.\n  So they did an evaluation of the river, and all of the States, except \nMissouri--which was an outlier, and they wouldn't agree to anything--\nthey did an evaluation, and finally a study was developed. That study \nhad a lot more to do with the Endangered Species Act and managing those \nissues than for determining whether we are making the best use of the \nriver system in our current management scheme.\n\n  The answer is that the current management scheme makes no sense at \nall. We are releasing the water in the middle of a drought, which we \ndid, by the way. It is a river system that has a capacity of around a \n55 million to 58 million acre-feet of water. It was down to, I think, \n35 million acre-feet of water, and we were releasing water to float one \nboat. That is unbelievable to me.\n  Last year, I included funding for a study that will study the \nmanagement of this river, what is appropriate and should be done, with \nsome semblance of common sense here. I know people objected to doing \nthat because the answer may well be an answer that moves away from what \nI have called a ``one State hog rule,'' meaning give us all you have \nwhen we need it, and keep it all when we don't want it. It is an \ninteresting way to manage the river, but that is the way some States on \nthe Missouri have suggested it be managed.\n  It is not fair to us. We are waiting, 60 years later, for all of the \nbenefits promised us if we would allow a permanent flood to stay \nforever in the middle of our State. Our ancestors did that. They said \nwe will sign up for that, but we got all of the costs and have not yet \nreceived the benefits.\n  With respect to the management of the Missouri River system, it is \nlong past time that the river be managed with the recognition of its \ncurrent use. When we are still releasing water for one little barge, on \n1 day, on the lower reaches of the Missouri, somebody ought to have \ntheir head examined. We cannot examine their head, but we can examine \nthe master manual. That is what we are going to do with this study.\n  I have so much more to say, but let me resist and defer.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:15 p.m.\n\n[[Page S8250]]\n\ntoday, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the following \namendments in the following order, with no amendments in order to any \nof the amendments covered in this agreement, with the time until then \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form; that after the first \nvote, the succeeding votes in the sequence be limited to 10 minutes \neach: Coburn amendment No. 1879, Dorgan amendment No. 1895--that is \nDorgan-Bennett--and Coburn amendment No. 1884. Those three amendments \nare again No. 1879, No. 1895, and No. 1884.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, Senator Bennett and I have discussed--and \nI have also visited with the majority leader within the last hour--my \nhope that we will be able to go to third reading, with the consent of \nSenator Bennett and the majority leader, following these votes and \nfollowing a period in which we would gather together whatever remains. \nThere are a few amendments that remain that we can clear. We have \nwaited all day, and we waited all day yesterday. Senators have had \nplenty of opportunity, plenty of time, and their staffs have had plenty \nof notice, to come and offer amendments.\n  For the next hour, we will be here. We will have the vote at 5:15 \np.m., and following that vote, it is my intention that we finish this \nbill very shortly following that vote by going to third reading. We \ndon't want to preclude opportunities for people to offer amendments, \nbut no one can hardly come to the Senate floor with a straight face and \nsuggest they have been precluded from anything, given the fact that \nSenator Bennett and I have been sitting here patiently for well over \nthe past 2 days.\n  Again, with the cooperation of our colleagues and with the hard work \nof our staff and our colleagues, I think we can finish this bill this \nevening.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask that the time during which we are in \nthe quorum call be equally divided between both sides.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have no objection to that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1891\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an amendment \nSenator Carper and I filed earlier today, amendment No. 1891. This is a \nsimple amendment, and one I hope the Senate will support.\n  Our amendment addresses the Delaware River Deepening Project. This is \na project to deepen the river's shipping channel from a depth of 40 \nfeet to one of 45 feet in an effort to bring more commerce.\n  Twenty-nine miles of the shipping channel run through the State of \nDelaware on its way to the ports in Philadelphia and New Jersey.\n  Those of us with ties to the three States that are involved know the \nlong history of this project. The project has had a lot of starts and \nstops over the years--that I won't go into now--and it was put on hold \nin 2002 before being restarted in 2007.\n  What our amendment does is prohibit the use of any funds from this \nbill on the portion of the deepening project that is within Delaware, \nuntil the State government issues the applicable permit.\n  This action is necessary for several reasons.\n  Earlier this month, the Delaware Department of Natural Resources and \nEnvironmental Control denied a permit for this project that had been \npending for 8 years, since 2001.\n  During that time, the scope of the project had changed substantially, \nand the State was lacking current scientific data. The rejection of the \nold permit application, however, was made without prejudice, permitting \nthe Corps to apply for a new permit.\n  Furthermore, the Army Corps has not yet provided the State with an \nupdated and detailed Environmental Assessment of the deepening, nor has \nthe State been given any detailed information regarding the placement \nof the dredged soils that will result from the project.\n  Finally, the Government Accountability Office is undertaking a \nreanalysis of the costs versus benefits of the deepening project. This \nanalysis is due out at the end of this year.\n  These are important questions that the people of Delaware deserve to \nhave answered and that is why we offered this amendment.\n  This amendment merely prohibits funding in the bill from being used \nto carry out this project within Delaware, until the State government \nhas given its approval.\n  This will give DNREC the opportunity to do its job--and protect the \nriver's environment. And it will give the State the ability to obtain \ninformation vital to the citizens of Delaware prior to any deepening \nbeing done in our own State.\n  I would hope all of my colleagues can understand and identify with \nthis.\n  If it were their State, I suspect they would feel the same way.\n  Again, I hope the Senate will support the adoption of the amendment, \nwhich I will introduce later.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1879\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 1879.\n  The yeas and nays have been ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The need to \n     evolve a more comprehensive physical understanding of the \n     causal relationships between atmospheric inflow phenomena and \n     windfarm interaction was identified as the key remaining \n     science issue before new technology and microcimatology \n     concerns could be addressed.\n       We have been briefed in detail on the plans of Texas Tech \n     University and Pantex/NNSA for the funding, installation and \n     operation of a research windfarm near Amarillo, Texas to help \n     address this technology challenge. This facility will not \n     only meet the requirements of the President's Executive Order \n     13423 for the DOE it will also serve as a publicly-accessible \n     large-scale, windfarm research vehicle addressing the \n     principal concerns of industry in advancing operation, \n     performance and technology. This facility is a unique \n     opportunity to address immediate science and technology gaps \n     while helping achieve the nation's goal of attaining 20% of \n     its electrical energy supply from renewables by 2030.\n       To initiate the research planning and utilization of this \n     facility, Texas Tech has applied for a FOA award to plan for \n     its utilization to meet the research needs of the US wind \n     industry and allied stakeholders, Based on preliminary \n     discussions, we are happy to provide support during these \n     initial planning phases and estimate our level of effort at \n     $50K per year for the first two years. Of course, a more \n     detailed cost estimate will be\n\n[[Page S8252]]\n\n     prepared with a successful award and with concurrence of our \n     DOE sponsors.\n       We strongly support the establishment of this new research \n     facility and are looking forward to our continued and long \n     standing RD relationship with Texas Tech along with other \n     national laboratories, industry and academic partners \n     involved with this program.\n       If we can answer questions about the project or how it can \n     meet the needs of the US wind industry, please do not \n     hesitate to contact us.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                          Michael C.

RAEL focuses \n     on designing, testing, and disseminating renewable and \n     appropriate energy systems. The laboratory's mission is to \n     help these technologies realize their full potential to \n     contribute to environmentally sustainable development in both \n     industrialized and developing nations while also addressing \n     the cultural context and range of potential social impacts of \n     any new technology or resource management system.\n       I am writing to support and recommend that the Department \n     of Energy create a world-class research wind farm and \n     National Wind Resource Center. We believe this project will \n     help ensure significant access to the wind farm for public \n     research, led by Texas Tech University and supported by their \n     research partners and alliances. The National Wind Resource \n     will include partnerships with industry, public research \n     institutions and members of academia and will provide an \n     effective vehicle to help reach our renewable energy \n     objectives as a nation. RAEL's work on integrating low-carbon \n     energy systems fits well with the mission of Texas Tech \n     University's project and will make the efforts of both \n     institutions stronger in their service of national clean \n     energy independence.\n       The Wind Science and Engineering Center at Texas Tech \n     brings their 38 years of expertise as a leader in wind energy \n     research to the partnership to create a national wind \n     research and resources center on their 5,800 acres parcel \n     adjacent to the Pantex site. This national center will \n     provide multi-disciplinary research along with workforce \n     training and development programs to address the critical \n     issues facing the wind power industry. An important aspect of \n     this project is the broad partnerships with other national \n     laboratories, and academic and industry partners will be \n     invited by Texas Tech University to collaborate and have a \n     presence in the center.\n       Once again, I want to express my strong support for this \n     innovative renewable energy project. This initiative \n     represents an innovative approach in demonstrating the United \n     States leadership in wind energy, and will establish a multi-\n     faceted use of the wind farm and facility for research and \n     workforce development. Please do not hesitate to contact me \n     to discuss this matter further.\n           Sincerely,\n     Daniel M.

In addition, AWEA represents hundreds of wind \n     energy advocates from around the world. With over 2,000 \n     members & advocates, the American Wind Energy Association \n     (AWEA) is the hub of the wind energy industry. AWEA promotes \n     wind energy as a clean source of electricity for consumers \n     around the world.\n       I am writing to encourage the efforts of Texas Tech \n     University to develop a world class research wind farm and \n     national wind resource center. We believe this project will \n     help ensure significant access to the wind farm for public \n     research, led by Texas Tech University and supported by their \n     research partners and alliances.

This proposed project is designed to include \n     partnerships with industry, public research institutions and \n     members of academia and will provide an effective vehicle to \n     help reach our renewable energy objectives as a nation.\n       The Wind Science and Engineering Center at Texas Tech \n     brings their 38 years of expertise as a leader in wind energy \n     research to the partnership to create a national wind \n     research and resources center on their 5,800 acres parcel. \n     This national center will provide multi-disciplinary research \n     along with workforce training and development programs to \n     address the critical issues facing the wind power industry. \n     In addition to the partnerships noted above, I understand \n     other national laboratories, along with academic and industry \n     partners will be invited by Texas Tech University to \n     collaborate and have a presence in the center.\n       Once again, I support this innovative renewable energy \n     project. This initiative represents an innovative approach in \n     demonstrating the United States leadership in wind energy, \n     and will establish a multi-faceted use of the wind farm and \n     facility for research and workforce development. Please do \n     not hesitate to contact me to discuss this matter further.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Denise Bode,\n                                           Chief Executive Office.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask that we pass this amendment, \nwhich would require $8 million of the $85 million already in the bill \nfor energy efficiency and renewable energy to be competitively awarded \nto universities for turbine equipment purchases to study turbine \nperformance, because there is a lack of understanding about why wind \nfarms are experiencing premature turbine component failures and power \nunderperformance, and this is an area we need to address.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the acceptance of my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I support the amendment. I would defer to \nSenator Bennett, but I believe it is agreed to by myself and Senator \nBennett.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I support the amendment and hope we will \nnow vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate on the amendment?\n  If not, the question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 1864), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Amendments Nos. 1859, as Modified, 1867, as Modified, 1842, 1888, as \n                   Modified, 1891, and 1892, En Bloc\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think we are very close to final \npassage. We need to clear that, but Senator Bennett and I wish to \nproceed to the amendments that have been cleared on both sides as part \nof the managers' package. They have been considered by both sides and \nagreed to.\n  I ask unanimous consent to bring up, en bloc, the following \namendments: 1859, as modified, and I send the modifications to the \ndesk; 1867, as modified, and I send those modifications to the desk; \n1842; 1888, as modified, and I send the modifications to the desk; \n1891; and 1892.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to dispense with \nthe reading of the amendments that I sent to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, to clarify, I said 1892 as the last \namendment.\n  Again, those amendments have been cleared on both sides, and I \nbelieve there is no further debate. I would yield to my colleague, \nSenator Bennett, for his comments, and I would hope then for immediate \nconsideration of the amendments.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will confirm that the amendments have \nbeen cleared, and I appreciate the cooperative way in which the two \nstaffs have been diligently doing this. We are glad, after the long \nperiod of wait, that we finally are hurrying up. The old army line \n``hurry up and wait,'' we have turned it around: Wait, and now we have \nhurried up. So I am delighted we are moving.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for the immediate \nconsideration of the amendments I sent to the desk, en bloc.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendments are pending, en bloc.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that they be \nagreed to, en bloc.\n\n[[Page S8253]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?

Mr. President, I rise to discuss amendment No. 1859.\n  This amendment, cosponsored by Senator Feinstein, would allow for \ncritical water transfers to agricultural users in California's San \nJoaquin Valley.\n  Three years of below-average precipitation have restricted water \nsupplies for much of California. Drought conditions have particularly \naffected agricultural communities in the San Joaquin Valley.\n  In Fresno County alone, the drought has impacted more than 450,000 \nacres of cropland, contributed to the loss of 3,265 jobs, and may \njeopardize an additional 2,200 more jobs in the near future.\n  Some cities on the west side of the San Joaquin Valley are facing \nnearly 40 percent unemployment, and people wait in line for hours at \nfood banks to secure basic staples to feed their families.\n  Working with many Members of California's House delegation, Senator \nFeinstein and I have worked to identify solutions to the drought.\n  Senator Dorgan's subcommittee included funds in the underlying bill \nto expedite the timely evaluation of projects to improve operational \nflexibility of water management, such as the intertie between the \nDelta-Mendota Canal and the California Aqueduct, and ``Two Gates,'' the \nconstruction of two temporary gates in Old River and Connection Slough \nin the Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.\n  And Senator Feinstein and I worked with the California delegation in \nthe House to include language in their Energy and Water bill that would \npermanently allow voluntary water transfers among Central Valley \nProject contractors, providing operational flexibility to help get \nwater to agricultural communities when they need it most.\n  The House provision would allow these transfers permanently--this is \nthe outcome we want, and it is the outcome we will fight for in \nconference.\n  However, at this time we understand that allowing permanent water \ntransfers is not an approach acceptable to the chairman of the Senate \nEnergy Committee without first holding hearings on the subject.\n  I thank Senator Bingaman for working with us on an amendment that \nwould allow Central Valley Project water transfers to occur for a 2-\nyear period. This amendment ensures that the Senate is not silent, and \ninstead is taking one step forward on this critical issue.\n  It is critical that we continue to work on solutions for farmers in \nCalifornia who have lost up to 90 percent of their expected water \nallocations this year.\n  These measures alone will not solve California's water crisis, but \nthey are a good first step toward helping these communities as we \ndevelop long-term solutions to improve water management in California.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I believe we are again within minutes of \nbeing able to get to final passage. I make a point of order a quorum is \nnot present.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from North Dakota withhold \nhis request?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I withhold my request.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you so much. Mr. President, I wanted to take a \nminute, on behalf of myself and Senator Feinstein, to thank the two \nmanagers. We had such an important amendment dealing with water \ntransfers at a time of such severe drought, and both these managers \nhave worked so hard with us to make sure we could get this done \ntonight.\n  Senator Feinstein and I are very grateful. We had support in the \ncommunity for this, across party lines, and it wound up that we had \nsupport across party lines here. So I wish to say to both managers, \nfrom the bottom of my heart, you are making a difference tonight. In \nsome of these towns, we have a 40-percent unemployment rate because of \nthe drought. So you are making a difference. We hope to get this into \nconference and to make this final.\n  So, again, my deepest thanks.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to briefly comment on \ntwo amendments that I filed to the fiscal year 2010 Energy and Water \nappropriations bill.\n  The first amendment deals with the Bloomsburg Flood Control Project. \nThis project was authorized by Congress in the Water Resources \nDevelopment Act of 2007 to protect the town of Bloomsburg from chronic \nflooding that has plagued it throughout its history. Bloomsburg has \nsuffered 33 floods since 1990. The proposed floodwall will protect more \nthan 400 homes, 7 businesses, and 1,200 people affected by flooding. \nThe project was authorized at a total cost of $44.5 million. However, I \nam advised that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Interagency \nPerformance Evaluation Task Force issued revised criteria for \nfloodwalls which increase the project's cost. The amendment would raise \nthe authorization amount to $65 million to account for this change and \nproceed with this important project to project the citizens of \nBloomsburg.\n  The second amendment deals with the Scranton Flood Control Project. \nThis project was initially authorized in 1992 and modified in 1996, and \nthis amendment would further modify it so that the city of Scranton can \nproceed with downstream mitigation activities and construction of a \nrecreational trail. The amendment also provides that the city shall \nreceive credit against its nonFederal share for mitigation activities \nit already completed.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt these amendments to improve flood \nprotection in Pennsylvania.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak regarding the Energy and \nWater Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2010 and voice my strong \nsupport for the inclusion of resources for the National Deepwater \nOffshore Research Center at the University of Maine, which Senator \nCollins and I jointly requested. In a time of economic distress, I \nbelieve it is even more important for Congress to focus on short-term \nrelief as well as on a long-term comprehensive energy strategy that \nreduces America's dependence on foreign oil, creates jobs, embraces \nrenewable and alternative sources of energy, and, most importantly, \nmakes energy prices affordable for consumers.\n  Developing deep water offshore wind technology can transform the way \nwe generate energy to power the planet, and Maine is uniquely poised to \nbe a leader in this effort. In fact, within 50 miles of the coast of \nMaine lie wind resources that can generate the energy equivalent to \napproximately 40 nuclear powerplants. This is exactly the type of \ninvestment that our country must make, and I am pleased that this \nAppropriations bill includes $5 million for this critical research. \nWithout question, as President Obama stated in his speech to Congress \nin February, the United States must not simply follow in the wake of \nother nations as they develop the new clean energy technologies of the \n21st century and monopolize the jobs and financial rewards that will \ninevitably follow. But already countries such as China, Germany, South \nKorea, Norway, and Denmark are boldly adopting plans to develop these \ntechnologies: energy efficiency, solar, hybrid engines, and offshore \nwind. In fact, a Norwegian company is now moving forward with \ndeployment of the first deepwater offshore floating turbine, which will \nbe located in more than 328 feet of water. Clearly, our competitors are \nrapidly moving forward to position themselves at the forefront as we \nexit this economic morass. We must expand our research into offshore \nwind, and Maine is uniquely positioned to be successful in the U.S. \ndevelopment of offshore wind energy.\n  The oceanographic conditions in Maine's own State waters, within 3 \nmiles of shore, provide excellent wind resources and water deep enough \nto deploy floating turbines. These are ideal\n\n[[Page S8255]]\n\nconditions for the installation, testing, and maintenance of deepwater \noffshore wind turbines. In fact, Maine is the only State on the east \ncoast with the appropriate oceanographic and meteorological conditions \nfor such testing inside State waters. Additionally, there has been \nstrong support by both the Governor and the Maine Legislature in their \ncommitment to developing and deploying this technology in Maine by \npassing legislation earlier this summer that will allow this research \noff our shores.\n  Considering that the majority of the U.S. population lives in coastal \nStates, offshore wind energy could be a significant part of our \nNation's energy future. The U.S. has nearly 2,500 gigawatts, GW, of \noffshore wind potential within 50 nautical miles, but more than half of \nthis resource, about 1,500 GW, is in waters deeper than 200 feet. \nUnlocking this vast energy potential requires the development of next \ngeneration fixed foundation offshore wind turbine technologies, as well \nas testing of floating platform prototypes.\n  With 80 percent of homes using heating oil, Maine is extremely \nvulnerable to rising crude oil prices. By 2018, the cost of energy, the \nsum of gasoline plus heating oil plus electricity, could consume as \nmuch as 40 percent of the average Maine household's income. Maine has, \nhowever, abundant natural resources to generate clean renewable energy, \nparticularly wind energy. In fact, the wind is so powerful off the \ncoast of Maine, on average, a wind turbine in the gulf of Maine can \ngenerate twice the energy that the same turbine will generate in the \nKansas-Texas wind corridor.\n  I would like my colleagues to be aware that the Department of Energy \nrecently released a report, ``20 percent Wind Energy by 2030,'' which \nrecommended seven key long-term offshore development research \npriorities, including the need to develop low-cost foundations, \nanchors, and moorings and increase the economic viability of large-\nscale, deepwater offshore wind turbines. The University of Maine is in \na unique position to provide this critical research assistance. During \nthe past several years, the University of Maine's Advanced Engineered \nWood Composites, AEWC, Center has been solving challenges driven by the \nenergy crisis, focusing on the vast potential of Maine's offshore wind \nresource and the need for expertise and innovation in advanced \nstructures and noncorrosive composite materials to harness the wind \nresource in the gulf of Maine. In fact, this facility has also \ndeveloped blades for wind turbines using composite materials that are \nstronger, lighter, and more durable than today's commercially available \ntechnology. The University of Maine is well poised, with the research \nand technology capabilities already in place, to ensure that offshore \nwind development becomes a success along the east coast.\n  The goal of the National Deepwater Offshore Wind Research Center \nwould be to enable the design and testing of a large-scale, floating, \noffshore wind platform that could serve as the basis of a large-scale \noffshore wind industry. This would be an opportunity for Mainers to use \ntheir skills and experience, specifically in deep water relatively \nclose to shore, to lead the Nation in developing a new source of clean \nand renewable energy.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I want to express my disappointment \nthat the Energy-Water appropriations bill before us today does not \nfully fund the administration's request for its energy innovation hubs. \nAs my colleagues know, I have a long history of support of federal \ninvestments in science and research, and in energy research in \nparticular. I have called for a series of ``mini-Manhattan projects'' \non seven clean energy grand challenges: improving batteries for plug-in \nvehicles, making solar power cost competitive, making carbon capture a \nreality, safely recycling used nuclear fuel, perfecting advanced \nbiofuels, designing green buildings, and providing energy from nuclear \nfusion.\n  It should come as no surprise, therefore, that I am a strong \nsupporter of the administration's proposed energy innovation hubs.\n  In testimony earlier this year, Energy Secretary Chu has indicated \nthat these hubs are one of his top priorities and will focus on \novercoming the most significant barriers to achieving national energy \nand climate goals.\n  The challenges the Secretary has asked these hubs to address are very \nsimilar to the grand challenges I outlined last year. I believe \nCongress and the Federal Government should tackle these seven grand \nscientific challenges during the next 5 years in order to put the \nUnited States firmly on the path toward clean energy independence \nwithin a generation. If we are to end our energy dependence and make \nrenewable energy cost-competitive then we must double our investment in \nenergy research and development.\n  I believe the administration's hubs are a firm commitment to put us \non this path to energy independence.\n  I know the energy research community is eager to compete for this \nfunding and to meet the challenges before our Nation. The passion and \ncommitment of our researchers is palatable both at home in Tennessee \nand across the country. In fact, my home State boasts some of the \nfinest energy researchers in the country at Oak Ridge National \nLaboratory as well as research institutions such as Vanderbilt and the \nUniversity of Tennessee. At these institutions and similar institutions \nacross the country, researchers are eager to make progress on these \npressing issues to improve the lives of their fellow citizens and solve \nsome of our greatest energy challenges. It is our obligation to ensure \nthat they have the full backing and support of the U.S. Government, \nwhich means funding these energy innovation hubs.\n  These multidisciplinary research hubs will harness the best and \nbrightest researchers at our universities and national labs as well as \nin industry. Each one could very well become a world-class research \nfacility in its given program of focus. They are conceived as highly \ncollaborative, integrated centers of innovative thinking that will \nfocus teams of researchers from multiple institutions on developing \nnovel ideas to overcome major scientific and technological barriers. \nTheir efforts will complement--not duplicate--other DOE programs such \nas the Energy Frontier Research Centers, EFRCs and the Advanced \nProjects Agency for Energy, ARPA-E, differing from these programs in \ntheir larger scale, their duration, and their breadth spanning basic \nand applied science as well as limited technological development \nefforts. Moreover, the hubs are designed so as to permit flexibility \nand to allow for the quick reallocation of funding within each topic \narea to pursue new research opportunities or alternatives quickly, as \nthey emerge--without the delays that may impede other government \nprograms.\n  I recognize that the Department may not have had all the details \nfleshed out when they initially presented the hubs to the Congress. \nDespite its best efforts, the Department is not yet operating with a \nfull staff--although I hope this situation is improving daily. But my \ncolleagues are right to ask for a fuller explanation of this concept \nand its role in the greater Federal research enterprise. The funding \nlevel requested is not insignificant and deserves careful scrutiny. So \nI am pleased to report that additional details have now been submitted \nwhich address many of the very valid questions and concerns my \ncolleagues have raised. I hope that this additional information will \npermit us to move forward with full funding for all eight hubs.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, first, I would like to \nrecognize the efforts of the Appropriations Committee and Chairman \nInouye and Ranking Member Cochran and the chair and ranking member of \nthe Energy and Water Subcommittee, Chairman Dorgan and Ranking Member \nBennett. These leaders have a hard job to balance the many interests \ninvolved in their vital legislation.\n  I would like to focus on the decision of the Senate Appropriations \nCommittee to ban new Army Corps of Engineer projects from being \nreceiving funding in this bill.\n  I want to make a point that, when it comes to the Comprehensive \nEverglades Restoration Plan, CERP, a strong case can be made that the \ntwo authorized projects that this legislation does not fund are not new \nstarts.\n  I am speaking of the Indian River Lagoon project and the Site One \nImpoundment project, both of which have been duly authorized by \nCongress. They are elements of the CERP that was authorized by the \nWater Resources\n\n[[Page S8256]]\n\nDevelopment Act of 2000. At the time of its authorization, CERP was a \nplan that envisioned over 60 separate modifications to the old Central \nand Southern Florida Flood Control Project, C Project. It is clear \nto me that CERP is an extension of the old Central and Southern Florida \nFlood Control Project, C Project.\n  The disastrous flood of 1947, which followed a severe drought in \n1945, and the serious intrusion of saltwater gave rise to a demand for \na new and effective water management system. In response to public \ndemand, the Army Corps of Engineers Jacksonville District conducted \npublic hearings throughout South Florida to collect information on how \nbest to revamp the water management system. A comprehensive report was \nprepared by the Corps and submitted to Corps headquarters in December \nof 1947.\n  The report cited the problems of flood protection, drainage, and \nwater control and determined that the St. Johns, Kissimmee, Lake \nOkeechobee, Caloosahatchee, and Everglades drainage areas composed a \nsingle system and economic unit. The report included a plan to deal \nwith the problems of water management. This plan became the Central and \nSouthern Florida Flood Control Project, C Project.\n  The C project was approved by Congress as a part of the Flood \nControl Act of 1948. The stated goal of the plan was to ``restore the \nnatural balance between soil and water in this area insofar as possible \nby establishing protective works, controls, and procedures for \nconservation and use of water and land.'' But this project worked too \nwell and caused far-reaching and devastating environmental impacts.\n  In response, Congress directed a Restudy to modify the C Project \nand to restore the Everglades and Florida Bay ecosystems while \nproviding for the other water-related needs of the region. The Restudy \ndeveloped the Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan, CERP, that was \nsubmitted to Congress and authorized in the Water Resources Development \nAct of 2000.\n  This chain of events shows that indeed CERP and its individual units \nare part of the C Project that has received hundreds of millions of \ndollars in Federal funding over the years. The Corps fiscal year 2009 \nbudget request document states: ``The C Project includes the \nComprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP).''\n  The language of WRDA 2007 includes the term ``Central and Southern \nFlorida'' when describing the Indian River Lagoon, Picayune Strand, and \nSite One Impoundment projects. These projects are a modification of an \nexisting project that remains under construction.\n  In its fact sheet for the fiscal year 2009 budget, the Corps states \nthe following: ``The C Project includes the Comprehensive Everglades \nRestoration Plan (CERP)''\n  I also would note that in the Secretary of the Army's Annual Report \nfor fiscal year 2007 on Civil Works Activities the following appears in \nparagraph 76: ``CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN FLORIDA, INCLUDING COMPREHENSIVE \nEVERGLADES RESTORATION PLAN''\n  I think it is clear that we do not have a situation of separate \nprojects involved in CERP. CERP is a unified and comprehensive \ncontinuation of the old Central and Southern Project.\n  Senator Martinez and I have filed amendments to put the projects back \nin the bill. The Florida Congressional delegation made sure the \nprojects were fully funded and included in the House-passed bill.\n  Therefore, when the legislation goes to conference, I urge the \nleaders of the full committee and the subcommittee to consider this \nunique situation involving these two components of the CERP--the Indian \nRiver Lagoon and the Site One Impoundment projects. I respectfully ask \nthem to keep an open mind on this issue in conference and would further \nadd the House version of the legislation would fund those projects.\n  Now may I say a few words about these projects.\n  Mr. President, I grew up on the Indian River Lagoon. It is a \nwonderfully diverse area. The St. Lucie River and the Indian River \nLagoon are periodically devastated by discharges from Lake Okeechobee \nand the areas surrounding the estuaries. The local citizens of Martin \nCounty have assessed themselves to raise money to buy land to be \nrestored and used for reservoirs for the project. So far they have \nspent some $50 million. They have done their part.\n  The Site One Impoundment project will save water from being \ndischarged to sea and use it to benefit the Loxahatchee National \nWildlife Refuge and provide benefits, including improved water quality, \nto downstream estuaries. It will also improve water flow into the \nEverglades, protect local water supplies, and provide environmental \nbenefits to Water Conservation Areas.\n  These projects are vital to restoring America's Everglades. I again \nurge the leaders of the Committee to consider these facts in \nconference.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the fiscal year 2010 Energy and Water \nDevelopment appropriations bill provides important funding for the \nDepartment of Energy, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and other \nagencies.\n  This bill starts to make good on our efforts to develop new sources \nof energy--clean energy, that creates jobs and cuts back on greenhouse \ngas emissions.\n  The bill would provide $2.23 billion for the Department of Energy's \nenergy efficiency and renewable energy programs.\n  For many families in Illinois and across the Nation, energy costs are \na big part of the budget.\n  Adding insulation, sealing leaks, or upgrading the furnace can help \nfamilies cut their energy bills by 30 percent--sometimes more.\n  The weatherization program at the Department of Energy has helped \nmore than 6 million low-income households seal up their homes.\n  But many more families are eligible for this help. The President has \nset a goal of weatherizing 1 million American homes annually.\n  This bill includes $200 million to help meet that target.\n  This bill also puts $200 million into R to produce buildings that \nproduce as much energy as they consume.\n  And another $50 million is included for the State Energy Program to \nhelp States adopt new energy efficiency and renewable energy \ntechnologies.\n  The bill increases funding for research and development on clean \nenergy technologies to power our cars, homes, and businesses.\n  One of the most promising areas is the $235 million dedicated to \ndeveloping electricity and high-performance fuels from agricultural and \nforestry residues, municipal solid waste, industrial waste, crops, and \nalgae.\n  These homegrown energy sources could help us reduce carbon emissions, \nand the research on these fuels is creating economic opportunities in \nIllinois and across the country.\n  And to bring alternative energies mainstream, the bill provides $255 \nmillion for R on solar energy, $85 million for wind; $50 million for \ngeothermal; and $60 million for water power energy.\n  To make use of all this new power, we need to overhaul the Nation's \nelectric grid.\n  We need new transmission lines to transport energy from wind farms to \npopulation centers. We need more research on energy storage so that \nelectricity will be available when it is needed, not just when the Sun \nshines or the wind blows.\n  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act took a giant step toward \nmodernizing the electric grid and integrating renewable energy sources.\n  This appropriations bill builds on that effort, with $180 million to \nmake the grid more modern, reliable and secure.\n  America gets more than half its electricity from coal. We have over \n600 coal-based power plants--along with many thousands of power and \nindustrial facilities--that all contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.\n  Most of these facilities will remain in service for 10 to 30 years to \nmeet our energy demands, and new facilities will be constructed.\n  That is a reality. So we have to pursue research and development into \nhow we can use fossil energy in a cleaner way.\n  Funding programs within the Department of Energy's Office of Fossil \nEnergy will allow us to accelerate fossil energy research.\n  The investments made in this bill will help us shift to a clean \nenergy\n\n[[Page S8257]]\n\neconomy, strengthen our national security against the threats that \nenergy dependence creates, and protect the environment.\n  The Department of Energy is the largest source of Federal funding for \nbasic physical science research in the United States.\n  The bill increases funding for the Department's Office of Science to \n$4.899 billion. This funding will support the good work undertaken at \nArgonne and Fermi National Laboratories in Illinois, as well as \nresearch at laboratories and universities across the Nation.\n  This bill provides $5.125 billion for the Army Corps of Engineers.\n  The Corps provides quality, responsive engineering services to the \ncountry. The Corps provides planning, designing, building and operating \nwater resources. It also designs and manages the construction of \nmilitary facilities for the Army and Air Force.\n  Every year, the Corps carries out a variety of projects through its \nCivil Works Program, from environmental protection and restoration to \ncontrolling flood damage.\n  Traveling through my State of Illinois, the work of the Corps is \nevident. The best place to start is the shores of beautiful Lake \nMichigan.\n  For the past decade, the Corps has worked with the Chicago Park \nDistrict to rebuild the deteriorating shoreline and protect millions of \ndollars of property, and water supplies.\n  The Corps has also been working in Chicago's western suburbs to \naddress regular flooding in Des Plaines and surrounding communities. \nThese flood control efforts will provide safety and peace of mind for \nthousands of property owners in affected areas.\n  On the western edge of the State is the mighty Mississippi River. The \nRock Island and St Louis Corps districts ensure a majority of the \nIllinois portion of the river is navigable. Barges travel the length of \nthe Mississippi, which provide an important transportation option for \nour agricultural producers.\n  It is difficult to overstate the importance of the Corps when \nconsidering the disaster preparedness and response efforts during the \nhistoric floods of 2008. I joined sandbagging efforts in communities \nthat were fighting rising floodwaters, and civilian and military Corps \nemployees were providing supplies and guidance on how to prepare for \nthe rising waters.\n  The Corps' mission didn't end with the flood they have worked with \nthe State of Illinois and FEMA to help communities recover.\n  The Mississippi flows south to St. Louis and my birthplace, East St. \nLouis. These communities are protected by several levees built and \nmaintained by the Corps of Engineers.\n  In central and southern Illinois, Lake Shelbyville and Carlyle and \nRend Lakes are beautiful recreational areas maintained by the Corps.\n  In addition to providing flood control, these areas allow for \nboating, camping and other activities for Illinoisans and others \nvisiting my State. The communities around these lakes benefit as well \nthe recreation areas boost the local economies.\n  In recent years, the Corps has taken a more active approach to \nenvironmental protection and restoration.\n  These efforts should be encouraged. The Federal Government needs to \ncontinue its investment in these areas.\n  Restoring wetlands can help reduce the incidence of flooding, and we \nneed to understand that the development of acreage upstream can have \nsignificant negative impacts downstream.\n  The Corps' work in this area can be seen at Emiquon Refuge in Central \nIllinois. Since its establishment in 1993, the major habitat management \nefforts on Emiquon Refuge have been the restoration of the historic \nIllinois River floodplain and associated wildlife communities.\n  Through restoration of altered habitats and protection of existing \nareas, Emiquon Refuge will be managed to provide the diversity of \nnative plant and animal communities found in this area prior to \ndrainage and conversion to cropland.\n  I would like to thank Senator Dorgan and Senator Bennett for their \nhard work on this bill. They had many competing interests to consider, \nbut the bill we are considering today is balanced. I hope the Senate \ncan complete work on the fiscal year 2010 Energy and Water \nappropriations bill in a timely manner.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I support the Energy and Water Development \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2010. This bill provides critical \ninvestments that will support the development of clean and alternative \nenergy and utilization of domestic energy resources. Further, this \nlegislation provides much needed resources to improve our Nation's \nwater infrastructure.\n  This bill fosters American innovation in clean energy and energy \nefficiency. It supports worthy programs that further hydrogen, wind, \nhydropower, and solar technologies, as well as weatherization \nassistance for families and programs for building and industrial \ntechnologies. These programs better our Nation's security and economy \nby putting people to work advancing energy independence and \nsustainability.\n  I am very pleased that working with the senior Senator from Hawaii, \nwe were able to include $6 million in this legislation for the Hawaii \nEnergy Sustainability Program at the University of Hawaii's Hawaii \nNatural Energy Institute. This funding will allow for the continuation \nof the program's important work supporting increased use of clean, safe \nsources of energy. We must continue to invest in the development and \nimplementation of systems to allow for a transition away from foreign \noil. As Hawaii relies on imported oil for about 90 percent of its \nenergy needs, work to facilitate this transition is critical to the \nState's energy security. Moreover, the Hawaii Energy Sustainability \nProgram will provide economic development benefits and will further \nresearch valuable in applications both in Hawaii and nationwide.\n  This bill will also help address water infrastructure needs around \nthe country. Provisions contained within the bill permit the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers to conduct essential navigation, flood control, and \nenvironmental restoration projects. Such projects are particularly \nimportant for Hawaii, given our remote geography and our interconnected \nand diverse ecosystems. I appreciate the inclusion of nearly $14 \nmillion for Hawaii water development and infrastructure projects.\n  As Hawaii is susceptible to threats from severe weather and flooding, \nI was proud the bill contained specific provisions addressing this \nneed. Working with Senator Inouye, $1 million was included to assist \nthe State of Hawaii and Pacific Territories with updating and preparing \ncomprehensive flood plans. Also, much needed funding for the Ala Wai \nCanal and Waiakea-Palai Stream flood damage reduction projects is \nincluded in the legislaiton. On Oahu, accumulation of silt and debris \nfrom the Manoa, Palolo, and Makiki streams has significantly reduced \nthe carrying capacity of the Ala Wai Canal. Funding of $233,000 has \nbeen provided to complete necessary studies that will mitigate and \nreduce flooding threats to property and roads in the Waikiki and \nneighboring areas, while ensuring public safety and enhancing human and \nenvironmental health. Given the damage to roads, residences, bridges, \ndrainage systems, and personal property over the years due to the \nflooding of Waiakea and Palai Streams, $300,000 has been included to \ninitiate the Precontruction Engineering and Design phase needed to \nminimize flooding in the affected communities.\n  We know from experience that investment in wise stewardship and \nmanagement at a watershed level will have a significant positive impact \non numerous natural resources. For the island of Maui, I was involved \nin securing $100,000 for the West Maui Watershed to initiate a study \nthat may ultimately result in additional watershed improvements. A \ncompleted reconnaissance study for the area has already identified \nflood damage reduction, aquatic and marine ecosystem restoration, and \nshoreline protection projects that could be undertaken by the Corps of \nEngineers along with county and State agency partners.\n  Further, recognizing that shoreline erosion threatens upland \ndevelopment and coastal habitats along much of Hawaii's shoreline, I \nworked to include $500,000 for a regional sediment management \ndemonstration program to better understand the dynamics of complex \ncoastal processes and promote the development of long-term strategies \nfor sediment management. These\n\n[[Page S8258]]\n\nresources will assist in protecting communities from severe weather and \nfurther conservation efforts in coastal communities.\n  I am encouraged by the inclusion of provisions that will invest in \nour science and technology sectors and enhance U.S. competitiveness. It \nis vital that we support the research and development of sustainable \nand clean energy technologies. Such efforts empower us as a country to \nreduce our reliability on foreign oil and strengthen our ability to \nmeet our energy needs domestically.\n  In conclusion, I thank the senior Senator from Hawaii, chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee, as well as the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Senate Appropriations Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee for their efforts in developing and managing this bill \nthrough the legislative process.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the fiscal year 2010 Energy and Water \nDevelopment appropriations bill would provide $629,000 for Yazoo \nBasin--Yazoo Backwater, MS. I want to clarify that nothing in the \nlanguage is intended to: (1) override or otherwise affect the final \ndetermination that was effective August 31, 2008, and published in the \nFederal Register on September 19, 2008, of the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency under section 404(c) of the Clean Water Act that \nprohibits the use of wetlands and other waters of the United States in \nIssaquena County, MS, as a disposal site for the discharge of dredged \nor fill material for the construction of the proposed Yazoo Backwater \nArea Pumps Project, (2) create or imply any exception with respect to \nthe project to the requirements of the Clean Water Act, including any \nexceptions from the prohibitions and regulatory requirements of the \nClean Water Act under section 404(r); or (3) affect the application of \nany other environmental laws with respect to the project.\n  As chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over the Clean Water \nAct and authorizations for the civil works program of the Corps of \nEngineers, I believe it is critical that our environmental laws be \nadhered to in the planning, construction, and operation and maintenance \nof all Corps of Engineers projects.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate has included my \namendment to allocate $75.7 million in Desert Terminal Lakes funding as \npart of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act, 2010. The \nlegislation builds on the many projects and research to benefit all of \nNevada's desert terminal lakes--Walker, Pyramid, and Summit. I \nappreciate Senator Ensign's cosponsorship of the amendment.\n  Briefly, the legislation allocated $8.5 million for continued work in \nthe Truckee River Basin. The bill provides $1.5 million to help the \ncity of Fernley and the Pyramid Lake Paiutes continue their efforts \ntowards accomplishing their mutually beneficial goals of securing a \nmunicipal water source and protecting a renowned resource, Pyramid \nLake. The bill also helps the States of Nevada and California, the \nTruckee Meadows Water Authority, the Pyramid Lake Paiute Tribe, and the \nFederal watermaster implement the Truckee Settlement Act and the \nTruckee River Operating Agreement. I am committed to seeing the full \nimplementation of the Operating Agreement, and my legislation supports \nthis effort.\n  But I rise today primarily to discuss this legislation's $67.2 \nmillion allocation for work in the Walker River Basin.\n  Over the years, money that I have secured for work in the Walker \nRiver Basin has created jobs and other opportunities for Nevadans.\n  For example, this funding has resulted in world-class research \ncompleted by some of Nevada's best faculty and researchers at the \nUniversity of Nevada, Reno, and the Desert Research Institute. A \nresulting publication and international conference on desert terminal \nlakes will feature their work.\n  The Walker River Paiute Tribe has accessed funds to implement a 5-\nyear water leasing program for its farmers, develop efforts to \nstrengthen a fishery at Walker Lake, and work on efforts to combat \ninvasive species along the stretch of the Walker River that runs \nthrough their reservation and to Walker Lake. Working with the tribe \nand others, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and other Federal \nagencies have been able to develop long-term plans to strengthen the \npresence of Lahontan cutthroat trout at Walker Lake, one of Nevada's \nmost interesting and threatened treasures, and improving the Walker \nRiver riparian habitat. Funding is also being used to increase the \ninstream flow of the Walker Rivers that end in Walker Lake.\n  But today's legislation is different. I believe it marks a new \nchapter of collaborative efforts in the Walker River Basin.\n  The legislation brings new partners to develop solutions to address \ncompeting water uses in the Walker River Basin.\n  Working with local partners, the National Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation will coordinate the Walker Basin Restoration Program, a \nprogram that includes a water rights acquisitions program, a \ndemonstration water leasing program, various conservation and \nstewardship activities, and an alternative agriculture project.\n  Of particular importance to their efforts, the foundation brings the \nnecessary expertise to complete complex water transactions in a way \nthat preserves and protects the Walker River watershed. Working in the \nColumbia River Basin, the foundation has the experience of working with \nFederal and State agencies, tribes, municipalities, irrigation \ndistricts, and individual farmers and ranchers to bring about creative, \nbusiness-wise, and responsible solutions to balance the many demands on \nwater uses--for agriculture, for municipal use, and for fishing and \nrecreation. I am pleased with their commitment to work with Federal and \nState agencies in Nevada, Mineral and Lyon Counties, the Walker River \nIrrigation District, the Walker River Paiute Tribe, and many \nindividuals in Smith and Mason Valley and to develop a local entity to \nguide their efforts in the basin.\n  In addition, the Walker River Irrigation District has accepted a \nleadership role in finding a cost-effective way to increase in-stream \nflows in the Walker River while preserving agriculture interests. The \ndistrict has agreed to administer and manage a $25 million, 3-year \ndemonstration leasing program that will help get water to Walker Lake \nwhile providing farmers an additional opportunity to strengthen their \noperations. I appreciate the years of negotiations and conversations \nthat has led to the district taking on this important program, and I \nhope that it is successful in achieving its purpose.\n  I support the agricultural communities in northern Nevada, and I have \npushed for this demonstration leasing program and $200,000 for \nalternative crops and agriculture cooperatives. Providing farmers and \nranchers with more resources to manage their businesses and \nopportunities to explore new markets will stimulate the agriculture \neconomy in Lyon County, NV, and maintain the agricultural setting and \nlivelihood enjoyed by generations of Nevadans.\n  Throughout the years, I have stated that I would work to assure the \nviability of agriculture in Smith and Mason Valleys. This legislation \ndoes this--by providing Nevada's hard-working farmers with more tools \nto make good business decisions.\n  While helping farmers and dedicating water rights for the benefit of \nWalker Lake is part of a solution to restore and maintain Walker Lake; \nthe other part requires coordinated conservation and stewardship \nactivities. This bill supports the National Fish and Wildlife \nFoundation's efforts to coordinate watershed planning, water \nmanagement, and habitat restoration efforts, among other activities. It \nsupports efforts by the U.S. Geological Survey to work with other \nagencies and interested entities to develop a water monitoring plan in \nthe Walker River Basin. Of course, with this data and through other \nefforts, the University and Desert Research Institute will be able to \nassess whether these activities are successful in improving instream \nflows and getting water to Walker Lake.\n  The health of the Walker River Basin and Walker Lake depends on \npeople working together--the Federal, State and local governments and \nagencies; the tribe; the Irrigation District; the National Fish and \nWildlife Foundation, and others. This legislation reflects the\n\n[[Page S8259]]\n\nmany ways farmers, ranchers, sports men and women, and agencies can \nparticipate in this effort. The millions that will be spent in the \nWalker Basin--through the water leasing demonstration program, \nadditional alternative agriculture programs, additional water \nacquisition funds, and broader conservation opportunities--means that \nwilling and interested people can choose ways to participate in a \nsolution for the basin that best serves their business, personal and \ncommunity's interests.\n  After my years of working on efforts in the Walker River Basin, I am \nhopeful that this legislation will help communities work together to \nprotect what is important to all Nevadans--preserve our unique natural \nresources enjoyed by sportsmen and the right of individuals and \ncommunities to choose the what will make our businesses successful, our \nlocal economies more diverse, and our resources more attractive to the \npublic.\n  This is an opportunity to make significant progress in the Walker \nRiver Basin, and I am committed to seeing these Desert Terminal Lakes \nfunding priorities signed into law by the President.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wanted in these moments to say a special \nthank you to Senator Bennett and the staff on the minority side and \nmajority side who put this bill together and worked with us. This is a \nbill that funds the energy programs and water in this country. It is a \nbill that is very important. It has taken us a while on the floor to \nget it done.\n  I believe we have two amendments also remaining that we are trying to \nclear. We hope to clear those by voice vote momentarily. Then we will \ngo to final passage. Hopefully we will get clearance to do that so we \ncould be done in 10 or 15 minutes. It has been a long saga on the floor \nof the Senate here on this bill for the last several days, but I think \nthe work is valuable and important and useful for the country. It is a \ngood investment in our future.\n  As I said when we started this process, Senator Bennett is a great \nSenator to work with, a great Senator to partner with on some very \nimportant issues. He and his staff have done a great job, as has the \nstaff on the majority side, putting this bill together. I am going to \ninclude all their names in the Record. I included most of their names \nat the start of this discussion a couple of days ago, but I want \nrecognition paid to the people who spent time to put this bill \ntogether.\n  I want to alert colleagues I hope within a matter of 5 or 10 minutes \nto be able to do the two amendments remaining by voice and then go to \nfinal passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his kind words \nand echo his comments about the staff and the hard work they have done. \nWe are grateful to Doug Clapp and Barry Gaffney, Roger Cockrell, and \nFranz Wuerfmannsdobler, Brad Fuller, as well as Tyler Owens, Ben \nHammond, the floor staff, and of course Scott O'Malia of the committee \nstaff who has worked so hard with me.\n  This has been a challenge for Scott and others because this is my \nfirst experience as the ranking member of this subcommittee. I was far \nmore comfortable working on agricultural matters. But to have moved \nfrom the Agriculture Subcommittee to the Energy and Water Subcommittee \nhas been a significant challenge and I am grateful to the chairman and \nthe others for their willingness to work with me as I have come through \nthis maiden experience.\n  I agree with the chairman that this is a very important bill \naddressing one of the most significant challenges we face in this \ncountry, which is getting our energy policy right and getting the \nenergy initiatives properly funded. I am grateful it has finally come \nto the point where we are in fact within moments of final passage.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I think the Senator from Florida is going \nto seek recognition in a moment. I wish to mention for the Record the \nnames of those staff who have contributed to the construction of this \nappropriations bill on the Energy and Water Subcommittee: Doug Clapp, \nScott O'Malia, Roger Cockrell, Barry Gaffney, Franz Wuerfmannsdobler, \nMolly Barackman, Ben Hammond, Tyler Owens.\n  We have had a lot of staff people who have put in a great deal of \ntime. I wished to mention them by name as my colleague has done as \nwell. We are very grateful for the amount of time people put in to make \nthese things happen. This bill was a very important bill. I think it \nwas constructed very well.\n  We had a markup in the subcommittee, the full committee, and now good \ndiscussion on the floor of the Senate. We are very close to final \npassage. We are waiting because a couple Senators are asking for \ncommitments on amendments on a bill that does not relate to this before \nthey will agree to final passage. I think we are very close to having \ntheir appetite for that satisfied and we can go to final passage.\n  I believe the Senator from Florida is going to talk about two \namendments that have been cleared on both sides that could then be \ncleared.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n               Amendments Nos. 1852 and 1893, as Modified\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. I call up en bloc amendment Nos. 1852 and \n1893, as modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of FLORIDA. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Martinez be added as a cosponsor to amendment No. 1852 and that \nI, Senator Nelson of Florida, be added as a cosponsor to amendment No. \n1893.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, it is my understanding that \nthis has been agreed to by both sides. I would ask for a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Both the minority and majority have cleared both these \namendments. I would ask for a voice vote on the amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendments.\n  The amendments were agreed to, as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1852\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the Federal share of the cost of the Ten Mile \n                       Creek Water Preserve Area)\n\n       On page 17, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1__. TEN MILE CREEK WATER PRESERVE AREA.\n\n       Section 528(b)(3)(C)(ii) of the Water Resources Development \n     Act of 1996 (110 Stat. 3769; 121 Stat. 1270) is amended--\n       (1) in subclause (I), by striking ``subclause (II)'' and \n     inserting ``subclauses (II) and (III)''; and\n       (2) by adding at the end the following:\n\n       ``(III) Ten mile creek water preserve area.--The Federal \n     share of the cost of the Ten Mile Creek Water Preserve Area \n     may exceed $25,000,000 by an amount equal to not more than \n     $3,500,000, which shall be used to pay the Federal share of \n     the cost of--\n\n       ``(aa) the completion of a post authorization change \n     report; and\n       ``(bb) the maintenance of the Ten Mile Creek Water Preserve \n     Area in caretaker status through fiscal year 2013.''.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1893, as modified\n\n(Purpose: To ensure that previously appropriated funding for the Tampa \n   Harbor Big Bend Channel project is used for the original intended \n              purpose of the funding and not reprogrammed)\n\n       On page 17, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Sec 1_. As soon as practicable after the date of enactment \n     of this Act, from funds made available before the date of \n     enactment of this Act for the Tampa Harbor Big Bend Channel \n     project, the Secretary of the Army may reimburse the non-\n     Federal sponsor of the Tampa Harbor Big Bend Channel project \n     for the Federal share of the dredging work carried out for \n     the project.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8260]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I wish to make a few comments on the bill. \nFirst, let me commend Chairman Dorgan and Senator Bennett for their \nexcellent work, not only on this legislation but also on the Recovery \nAct that was passed a few months ago.\n  Both bills apply significant money to deal with issues and \ninfrastructure that are so important, that would promote green jobs, \nalternative energy and energy efficiency. They have done an \nextraordinary job, and I wish to thank them personally.\n  There is one issue I do want to address, though, and that is the \nissue of weatherization. In the Recovery Act, there was $5 billion for \nweatherization. That is now flowing out to the States, localities. We \nare going to see, particularly in the next few weeks or months, an \nincrease in activity which is going to put people to work and also to, \nin the long run, curb our use of energy.\n  This was a major accomplishment. I know Senator Dorgan and Senator \nBennett were key to getting it included in the Recovery Act. The bill \nwe have before us now includes a very small amount, in my view--I am a \nproponent of weatherization--for weatherization.\n  Essentially, the President asked for $220 million, the bill has $130 \nmillion and two $35 million pilot projects. But one of the aspects of \nthe decrease from $200 million to $130 million is that every State will \nget a haircut, if you will. Rhode Island, for example, would have, if \nit was $200 million, $350,000 more to spend on weatherization.\n  Going forward with the weatherization money from the Recovery Act, \nthis might be something we can bridge this year. But if we do not \nreturn to a base of at least $200 million, we are going to see severe \ndisruptions going forward.\n  The $350,000 seems like a small sum. But my State has a 12-percent \nunemployment rate. Any money that can be used, particularly since we \nhave geared up this program for the Recovery Act, would put people to \nwork and would be deeply appreciated. This issue is the same for many \nother States. New York, they would lose $6 million; Michigan, $4 \nmillion; Maine, $1 million; Nevada, $300,000; all across the States.\n  I would hope we could have met the President's objective of $220 \nmillion. But one of the other issues is that $70 million for this \nfunding was carved out for a pilot program. I would hope that, again, \nif we are doing pilot programs, we could not go after the basic \nweatherization fund but find them elsewhere to initiate these pilots.\n  One of the pilots is basically to demonstrate energy savings through \nthe use of insulating and sealing homes built before 1980. There are \nmany individuals and organizations that question whether this is a \npilot program that is worthy of $35 million or so.\n  One of the things it does is undercut the notion that the whole house \nshould be weatherized, that there is no magic of just insulating, there \nare windows, there are door jams, there are energy-efficient \nappliances. All these things should be considered. So a single, one-\ndimensional approach raises question with many of the organizations \nthat are actively engaged in weatherization.\n  For these reasons and more--in fact, I will mention one more that is \ncritical, which is that, under the law, these homes that are insulated \nwould be ineligible for additional weatherization, for weatherization \ntreatment. That is sort of one bite at the apple.\n  As a result, they would not be able to perhaps be more efficiently \nweatherized in the future. So I think that is something that has to be \nconsidered. As a result, the National Association for State Community \nServices Programs, the National Community Action Foundation, both of \nthem have written with concerns about this proposal.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthese two groups.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. REED. We originally, Senator Snowe and I, filed an amendment to \nsee if we could restore the funding. But I think at this moment, what \nwe want to see is this bill move forward to conference. I would love to \nwork with the chairman and the ranking member on this issue. Also, I \nwould expect that if these pilot projects for this year are fully \nevaluated, that next year, we take another hard and close look, if we \ncannot resolve it in conference, on the use of these funds for pilot \nprograms.\n  Finally, again, we are fortunate because of the work of Senators \nDorgan and Senator Bennett that we have a significant amount of \nweatherization money through the Recovery Act. But, again, I think we \nshould have to insist that we maintain a good base fund, and I would \nhope we could do that going forward.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n     Hon. Daniel Inouye,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations, Hart \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development, U.S. \n         Senate Committee on Appropriations, Hart Senate Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Inouye and Chairman Dorgan: The National \n     Association for State Community Services Programs (NASCSP) \n     represents the state administrators of the Weatherization \n     Assistance Program and the National Community Action \n     Foundation (NCAF) represents the local Community Action \n     Agencies that deliver the program's services. We are very \n     concerned about the language in the FY 2010 Committee Report, \n     which allocates $70 million for alternative and vaguely \n     specified uses to be determined by the Department of Energy. \n     Those funds could be used to weatherize nearly 11,000 low-\n     income homes. The disappointing appropriations level of $200 \n     million itself is only 80% of President Obama's Request. \n     After the funding earmarked for alternative uses is taken \n     away from state allocations, just $130 million would remain \n     for the core program. This is the lowest program allocation \n     since 1998.\n       This diversion of funds from the core program suggests the \n     Committee lacks confidence in the burgeoning expansion of \n     Weatherization service delivery. We believe such fears are \n     not supported by the facts as laid out in the multi-year \n     plans recently approved for state Program growth under the \n     American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA). Many \n     states even plan to complete ARRA-funded work before the end \n     of PY 2010 and are counting on the `regular', appropriated \n     funds to prevent the collapse of the program and moderate the \n     loss of its workforce.\n       Further, we question the value of both of the alternative, \n     federally-run projects to be funded. One tests insulation in \n     older homes. Older homes already make up the vast majority of \n     housing stock weatherized today. Additionally, insulation is \n     just one component of a comprehensive weatherization project. \n     The intent of the program may be to test new insulation \n     materials developed by a manufacturer; in that case, a \n     dedicated program is unnecessary because the core program \n     provides a path for incorporating new technologies and \n     materials. Appendix A to Title 10, Part 440, Direct Final \n     Rule--Federal Register, June 22, 2006, specifies how test \n     results on materials are submitted to DOE technical review \n     and then placed on the approved list. However, if the project \n     is intended to test batt insulation manufacturers' suggestion \n     of an insulation-only program rather than a systematic \n     approach to the house as a system of space conditioning \n     systems and baseload usage, there are better ways. One would \n     be the long-delayed program evaluation of a sample of \n     thousands of homes where some will have received only \n     insulation. Another is to use the evaluations performed on \n     similar experiments conducted by utility DSM programs and to \n     incorporate the results into WAP practices.\n       The second pilot program, funds ``partnerships between the \n     Department and traditional and/or nontraditional \n     weatherization providers'' to increase private leveraged \n     funding. In other words the program is intended to act \n     without the states or local agencies that would, in the end, \n     need to test and adopt innovations. It is apparently to be a \n     new, direct federal Weatherization program with new delivery \n     agencies which would circumvent the statutory requirement to \n     use the experienced local network providers. It is not \n     necessary to earmark funding for leveraging activities, as \n     the statute allows substantial investment in activities to \n     leverage private funding; the millions won by Weatherizers in \n     utility rate-payer programs attest to the efficacy and \n     frequency of states' investments in innovative private \n     partnerships.\n       The Committee Report also suggests there should be a new \n     private funding match requirement for federal funds which is \n     not reflected in the re-authorization bill recently reported \n     by the Energy Committee. We question the practicality of this \n     requirement and believe hearings on the proposal's impact \n     would be appropriate.\n       Thank you for considering our concerns regarding this \n     matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Timothy R. Warfield,\n       Executive Director, National Association for State \n     Community Service Programs.\n     David Bradley,\n\n[[Page S8261]]\n\n       Executive Director, National Community Action Foundation.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I support the expansion of nuclear \npower, and so do the American people. Seventy percent, according to the \nNuclear Energy Institute, believe we should either build new or expand \nexisting nuclear powerplants. It is the key to our energy future in \nseveral different ways.\n  I believe we ought to have a robust goal toward expanding nuclear \npower, and that we should work to build 100 nuclear plants as quickly \nas possible. We built them quickly in wave of construction, and \nhopefully, we will be able to have a cookie-cutter design for plants \nthat can be used on a regular basis with good engineering, and be a \nstep above the plants we have today.\n  Nuclear energy is a clean source of domestic energy. It is American-\nmade energy. It is the kind of energy the American people support. It \nhas a role to play in reducing our dependence on foreign oil and \nbringing down the price of gasoline. If we could convert more cars to \nutilizing electricity through plug-in hybrids, then 24-hour-a-day base \nload nuclear power can charge automobile batteries at night when the \ngrid is not at full demand and a person can drive 40 miles or so the \nnext day without using a drop of gasoline.\n  Nuclear powerplants will provide long-term economic benefits. It \nmakes great strides in reducing the amount of imported oil from foreign \ncountries and it keeps our wealth at home. It certainly creates high-\npaying, clean American jobs. It is a serious solution to our energy \nfuture. New nuclear plant construction will supply as much as 50,000 \nmegawatts of additional clean and affordable electricity to meet the \ndemands of a growing economy.\n  Nuclear power is the most cost-effective way to generate electricity. \nWhile wind and solar certainly have roles, they simply will not take us \nfar enough. The average nuclear production costs have declined more \nthan 30 percent in the last 10 years to an average of 1.7 cents per \nkilowatt hour. This includes the cost of operating and maintaining the \nplant, purchasing the nuclear fuel, and paying for the management of \nused fuel. The low and stable cost of nuclear power helps to reduce the \nprice of electricity paid by consumers. We cannot just say that we need \nto use energy sources that are clean; we must also produce electricity \nat an affordable price, and nuclear power meets both of these criteria.\n  One thing I am disappointed about in the bill we are working on \ntoday, is how this measure deals with the storage of nuclear waste. \nYucca Mountain was chosen as the government's location for a deep \ngeologic repository for the safe storage of used nuclear fuel. All \naspects of the geological, hydrological, geochemical, and environmental \nimpacts have been studied, including a detailed evaluation of how \nconditions might evolve over hundreds of thousands of years at Yucca \nMountain. To date, we have spent more than 25 years and $10 billion on \nthese studies, and the Department of Energy has summarized these \nstudies in several scientific reports which served as the basis for the \n2002 decision to approve Yucca Mountain as a site repository. These \nreports, which included input from extensive public review and comment, \nformed the foundation of DOE's June 2008 application to the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission for a license to construct the repository.\n  Ending Yucca Mountain could not only hinder new nuclear construction, \nit could also pose a serious budget question. The repository is \ncurrently financed through the Nuclear Waste Fund. Presently, \nratepayers pay a one-tenth of 1 cent fee for every kilowatt hour of \nnuclear power they consume. This is collected through the monthly \nutility bill paid by ratepayers.\n  Under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act, DOE must review the adequacy of \nthe Nuclear Waste Fund fee every year. DOE last performed a fee \nassessment in August of 2008, when it found the fee was adequate. As a \nresult, the total amount of money paid into the fund is approximately \n$750 million per year and about $1 billion in interest per year. The \nCongressional Budget Office cost estimate unit told the House Budget \nCommittee that CBO could not estimate what the fee should be:\n\n       In light of the [Obama] Administration's policy to \n     terminate the Yucca Mountain project and pursue an \n     alternative means of waste disposal, there is no current \n     basis to judge the adequacy of the fee to cover future costs \n     because the method of disposal and its lifecycle costs are \n     unknown.\n\n  That is certainly true. Therefore, utilities and regulators are now \nasking the Department of Energy to suspend the fee on nuclear power. \nWhy should they pay a fee that is supposed to ensure their wasted \nnuclear fuel will be taken to a repository when this administration has \nsought to stop this repository and seems to be making progress in that \ndirection?\n  Suspending payments of the Nuclear Waste Fund could also complicate \ngeneral budget matters as the Nuclear Waste Fund is included as a part \nof the General Treasury Fund, not a trust fund, and can be appropriated \non an annual basis. The result is that these funds are often used for \npurposes other than the disposal of nuclear waste, with only IOUs being \nheld to carry out the fund's purpose. For example, according to CBO, \nthe fund provided $8 billion through 2006 in government spending that \ndid not contribute to the deficit. In other words, they took this money \nfrom the fund. So we can see the issue. If the IOUs are ever paid, the \nmoney must come from somewhere, and that payment will be scored as an \nexpenditure of the government. In fact, if lawsuits filed by utilities \npaying this fee to the government are successful, we are going to have \nto spend the money, according to the law, it seems to me, for nuclear \nwaste disposal. If so, where will the money come from? We will have to \nfind it in some other fashion. If we do like we do everything else \naround here, we will just add it to the deficit, another $8 billion to \nthe current debt.\n  Additionally, we cannot forget that the Nation's $11 trillion deficit \nmust also be factored into the debate. Regardless of what the \nPresident's Blue Ribbon Commission decides concerning Yucca Mountain, \nthe DOE will have to pay for the disposal of nuclear waste. That is the \nlegal requirement.\n  There are numerous lawsuits stemming from the delay. The courts have \nalready found DOE partially in breach of contract for not taking the \nused fuel from the nuclear powerplants as required in exchange for the \nnuclear waste fee they have been paying. This has resulted in the \nFederal Government paying approximately $300 million to utilities in \ncompensation costs, which is paid out of a judgment fund and not out of \nthe Nuclear Waste Fund. They are not paying back the money with the \nfunds already contributed by the utilities. They are taking it from the \nGeneral Treasury, a judgment fund, and paying it out of that. And there \nmay be more judgments coming along.\n  Also, DOE has appealed judgments totaling approximately $400 million \nin additional cases they may well lose. That will be another $400 \nmillion that will have to be found and there are close to 40 lawsuits \nthat have not yet gone to trial.\n  According to CBO, because judicial claims for damages are made \nretrospectively, many more cases can be expected in the coming decades \nas utilities seek to recover their own costs for storing nuclear waste \non site long after they expected it would be removed to a permanent \ndisposal site.\n  The repository is also slated to hold high-level waste left over from \nthe Cold War, and the government may be liable for compensation costs \nfrom States currently hosting defense waste as well. The Treasury \nDepartment has estimated it will cost DOE about $300 billion to clean \nup and monitor several government sites that are contaminated with \nhazardous and radioactive materials.\n  I ask my colleagues to listen to that number. As a result of \nactivities in early nuclear development, there are waste sites in the \ncountry. The Department of Treasury has estimated it will cost about \n$300 billion to monitor and clean up several of those sites. I think \nthat number is so breathtaking that I am amazed that more discussion \nhas not occurred about it. I have raised the issue with the Department \nof Energy and the Department of Defense, as I serve on both Committees, \nand I believe it can be done for less than that. It has to be done for \nless than that. We do not have the $300 billion. We have to look for a \nbetter and more responsible\n\n[[Page S8262]]\n\nway to deal with these cleanups. The waste needs to be stored \nsomewhere. The President has indicated that Yucca Mountain is not one \nof the options for disposal of nuclear waste.\n\n  I was disappointed to hear that. However, we must remember that Yucca \nMountain remains the law of the land and that the administration does \nnot have the ability to unilaterally terminate the project. In order to \neliminate Yucca Mountain, Congress would have to amend the Nuclear \nWaste Policy Act, which set a deadline for the Federal Government to \nbegin disposing of used fuel. However, more than a decade later, we \nstill have not settled on a policy for how to accomplish this, and we \nhave sunk nearly $10 billion into Yucca Mountain. That is a huge sum of \nmoney, even for the amounts we talk about today. Not to mention that it \nis the most studied geology on the planet.\n  I do not think we should abandon this project simply because of \npolitical pressure. Regardless of what this administration says, we \nwill continue to face the problem of nuclear waste management. We must \nhave a successful plan to dispose of nuclear waste, whether it is \nthrough direct disposal or recycling. I believe we need to go forward \nwith recycling and I have offered legislation to do just that. Either \nway, we are going to need a site, but if we recycle this waste, it \nwould be less toxic. It would be radioactive for far fewer years than \nwould be the case if it were not recycled and perhaps would then be \nmore palatable to those who object to the site.\n  Perhaps an answer, which to me makes sense, is to move the Nuclear \nWaste Fund off budget to a dedicated account so that the money will be \nused for what it was intended. Currently, it is being spent in other \nplaces and being replaced with an IOU. Why should utilities pay money \ninto a fund when they are not getting any benefits that they were \npromised? It just lead us into liability and lawsuits, some of which \nare already being lost.\n  I believe nuclear power has proven to be exceedingly safe in America. \nNot one American has lost their life operating a nuclear powerplant.\n  The Three Mile Island situation, which caused so much fear and \nconcern in America, did not result in even one person in the studies \nafterwards to have been sick. But the plants today, and the new ones we \nwill build, will be even safer. They will be set up in such a way that \neven without power they would automatically shut themselves down \nthrough gravity flow into the reactor core. It is a new and safer \ndesign. They can be built in mass production quantities, resulting in \nlower costs per plant, and perfecting the technology and construction \ntechniques that should result in reducing costs. It would allow the \ncomponents to be produced in larger numbers, reducing costs, and help \nthe Nuclear Regulatory Commission, because of the uniform nature of \nthese plants, to regulate them even more effectively.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Presiding Officer and would say again, \nnuclear power produces about 20 percent of our electricity today. It \nemits no CO2 or other global warming gases into the \natmosphere. It is cost effective, it is all American, and it does not \nrequire us to expend large amounts of American wealth to foreign \ncountries in order to maintain our energy supply. Nuclear power is the \nright thing to do, and I hope we will continue to work on it because I \nbelieve the country is ready to move in that direction.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that no further \namendments be in order; that the substitute amendment, as amended, be \nagreed to and the motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and the \nSenate then proceed to vote on passage of the bill; that upon passage, \nthe Senate insist on its amendment, request a conference with the House \non the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, and that the Chair be \nauthorized to appoint conferees on the part of the Senate; provided \nfurther that if a budget point of order is raised against the \nsubstitute amendment and the point of order is not waived, then it be \nin order for another substitute amendment to be offered, minus the \noffending provisions but including any amendments which had been agreed \nto previously, and that then no further amendments be in order; that \nthe new substitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to with the \nremaining provisions beyond the adoption of the substitute amendment \nremaining in effect; further, that the subcommittee plus Senator Inouye \nbe appointed as conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I understand my friend has objected. I would \nnot belabor the point, but the Environment and Public Works Committee \nworked very hard. This is an 18-month extension of the highway bill. It \nis all paid for. But we understand and we will continue working on this \nand we will see what we can come up with at a later time.\n\n\n                           Order of Procedure\n\n  Mr. REID.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Reserving the right to object, could the majority \nleader give me an indication of when we might turn to this matter \ntomorrow?\n  Mr. REID. I indicated to our floor staffs that we will do our very \nbest to get it here as early as we can tomorrow afternoon.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Early tomorrow afternoon?\n  Mr. REID.

The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise this evening before we adjourn to \nshare some letters I have received from constituents of mine in Ohio. I \nrepresent the Buckeye State in this body.\n  I have received probably hundreds of letters similar to the ones I am \ngoing to read, and thousands of calls and e-mails and faxes and visits \nfrom people asking that we move forward on health insurance \nlegislation, that we do not let special interest groups slow us down, \nthat we do not let people who want to see this fail get in the way of \nits passage.\n  I wanted to share some of these letters, because in this body, we \ntalk about exclusivity periods, we talk about the public option, we \ntalk about the exchange, the gateway, employer mandates, all of those \nthings that matter to us. They are public policy; they are important. \nBut we do not talk enough about individuals about people in Juneau or \nFairbanks, in the Presiding Officer's State, about what people in \nGalion, in Mansfield and Bucyrus and Crestline, and Findlay and \nZanesville in my State think.\n  I want to share a handful of these letters I received in the last few \ndays from people in my State.\n  I will start with Brenton from Franklin County. That is the Columbus \narea in Central Ohio:\n\n       My health care story is similar to that of many young \n     people across the country. I am 26, healthy, college-\n     educated. I have a full-time job. But even with these \n     advantages I'm unable to afford health care coverage without \n     significant help from my parents.\n       After graduating college 3 years ago, I took a part time \n     job and went without health coverage for about a year. \n     Unfortunately, I came down with a case of strep throat and \n     put off going to a doctor for several weeks until it became \n     severe.\n\n  Obviously, he did not have insurance. It was expensive.\n\n       When I finally sought medical attention, my case of strep \n     proved to be drug resistant and I had to pay for several \n     hundred dollars in different medications. I lost my job due \n     to medical absence before I returned to good health.\n       After this scare, I found a full-time job with health \n     coverage, but I still need help from my parents to cover the \n     high premiums. I realize I am fortunate to be healthy and \n     insured when compared to many Americans.\n       But it's a shame that in a country as great as ours that \n     there could be any question as to whether a young able-bodied \n     man, such as myself, should feel secure in his future if \n     presented with even a minor illness.\n\n  Think about that. This is a young man who, because he did not have \ninsurance, even though he worked full time, was playing by the rules, \ncould not get insurance. He gets sick. He puts off going to the doctor. \nIt ends up costing him out of pocket in the health care system a whole \nlot more money. He lost his job because he missed work.\n  If we had our health care bill in place, the legislation that passed \nout of the HELP Committee, if we had that bill in place, a bill that \nprotects what works in the system and fixes what is wrong, then Brenton \nwould still hold his job and would be in a much better position.\n  Richard from Youngstown in northeast Ohio is near the Pennsylvania \nborder. Youngstown, I might add, was voted in Entrepreneur Magazine \nrecently as one of the 10 best places in America to start a business.\n  Richard writes:\n\n       I ascribe my good health to regular preventive care efforts \n     to stay healthy: no smoking, regular exercise, weight \n     control. But five years ago, I had surgery for early stage \n     prostate cancer.\n       Fortunately, I am still cancer free. The surgery itself was \n     a miracle of modern medicine . . . and I've enjoyed similar \n     high standards of care from my doctors' vigilance.\n       Three years ago, at the age of 61, I hiked through the \n     Appalachian Trail as well as the Pacific Crest Trail. More \n     recently I passed my recent physical with flying colors.\n       Imagine my consternation when my insurance company told me \n     the reason my premium had been raised 30 percent was because \n     I was ``in such poor health''!\n       The insurance company wrote that my premiums increased \n     because I had moved up into a different age bracket and \n     because of my cancer history. They said for me to wait until \n     the 5 year anniversary of my cancer to shop around for a \n     different plan.\n       In the past, I wouldn't hesitate to visit my doctor or a \n     specialist to manage my care.\n       Now, I'm among the under-insured. As a retiree whose \n     retirement savings has been devastated, I have to face living \n     on a reduced income.\n       Now, I might put off that doctor visit.\n       That's why I'm so strongly in favor of a public alternative \n     to the existing for-profit insurance companies in the health \n     care reform legislation currently making its way through \n     Congress.\n\n  Under our legislation, there would be no longer the discrimination of \npreexisting condition, of cutting off people\n\n[[Page S8264]]\n\nwhen they got their insurance. There would be no copays for preventive \ncare, all the kinds of things that Richard talks about that were \nlacking in his health care plan when he had insurance are dealt with \nand will simply not happen in the health insurance bill passed out of \nour committee.\n  Next is Marcia from Cuyahoga County, which is Cleveland. Cleveland \nhas become a center for alternative energy in our State. In the next \ncouple years, there will likely be a field of wind turbines in Lake \nErie, the first time that has been done anywhere in the world in \nfreshwater. There are a lot of things going on in Cleveland that work \nfor our State and country.\n  Marcia writes:\n       I am a 56 year old continuously insured professional \n     female, but currently unemployed.\n       Since my last job, each year my health insurance has \n     skyrocketed.\n       With each of these premium increases, the coverage \n     decreases, while co-pays and more deductibles go higher and \n     higher.\n       It is a slippery slope.\n       Last year my health insurance had a triple increase in \n     three months, which is equal to almost 1 week of my extended \n     unemployment.\n       I was on a COBRA for 18 months. Then I had to find my own \n     private health insurance.\n\n  That allows one to buy insurance after they lose their job. But they \nhave to pay their own premiums and they have to pay their employer \npremium which very few people can afford once they have lost their \njobs.\n  Marcia continues:\n\n       I applied to 5 companies and was rejected by 4 of them.\n       One rejection occurred before I even filled out the \n     application.\n       The application forms are so complex and time consuming to \n     recount one's entire life's medical care.\n       The one company that accepted me charged a 50 percent \n     markup due to my prior conditions. Note, I had no major \n     diseases but a few treated conditions.\n       I now realize that anyone with an illness is uninsurable.\n\n  One of the most important things to realize about this health \ninsurance legislation is not just that it provides insurance for those \nwho are uninsured or that it will assist those who are underinsured get \nbetter insurance. It also helps those who now have insurance. It allows \nthem to keep the insurance they have, if they are satisfied. It also \nsays we will have consumer protections built in so insurance companies \nno longer are allowed to deny you care because of preexisting \nconditions or allowed to game the community rating system, no longer \nallowed to deny care for a whole host of reasons that insurance \ncompanies do now. These consumer protections will help people who are \nnewly insured and people who are now underinsured, as we provide more \ninsurance, and it will help those people--these consumer protections \nwill be built into existing insurance policies that people have today--\nwho are generally satisfied with their insurance. They are satisfied \nnow until they have a major claim where the insurance companies might \ndiscontinue their care and might cut them off. Under our plan, the \ninsurance companies would not be able to do that.\n  My last letter is from Justin from Cincinnati. That is in southwest \nOhio along the Ohio River.\n  Justin writes:\n\n       I am a 25-year-old software tester with a wife and two \n     daughters that rely on my income.\n       I've seen my health insurance costs more than double over \n     the last year.\n       This is more than my mortgage, and it is absolutely \n     crippling.\n       I've been living on advances trying to make ends meet.\n       Please fight for me; all I can do is plead and hope that \n     you listen.\n\n  If that doesn't remind us how important this work on providing health \ninsurance reform is to the people of this Nation.\n  Justin continues:\n\n       It drives me crazy that I pay so much a month to a company \n     that takes my money and then uses it to try to defeat \n     legislation that will help ease my financial burden.\n\n  He has read in the paper or seen on the Internet or heard on the \nradio or watched on channel 9 or channel 12, he has heard about \nlobbyists spending $1 million a day to lobby the House and the Senate, \npharmaceutical company lobbyists, health insurance lobbyists, to weaken \nthis bill. He resents that he is paying these companies for his \ninsurance and prescription drugs to pay the lobbyists to lobby Congress \nto weaken what we ought to be doing right for Justin and so many \nothers.\n  Justin concludes:\n\n       Please take a stand for me and Americans that say we need a \n     public option. This is literally a matter of life and death \n     for many people.\n       It can't fail this time, we can't afford for it to.\n\n  Justin referred to the public option. There have been a lot of things \nsaid about the public option, most of them not true. The public option \nis a program that will be a government option, a government insurance \npolicy, a choice provided by the Federal Government giving people the \noption. You can choose Aetna, a mutual company such as Medical Mutual \nin Ohio or Blue Cross or you can choose to go on the public option. The \npublic option will have lower administrative costs. The public option \nwill keep the insurance companies honest because we know what insurance \ncompanies do when they discontinue care, when they discriminate against \npeople because of preexisting conditions. The public option also will \nsave money because of competition. The public option simply makes \nsense.\n  I support strongly a public option. Senator Whitehouse and I wrote \nthe public option in the HELP Committee bill that passed. We wrote that \npublic option because we believe in good old-fashioned American \ncompetition. I want the insurance companies to compete. I want the \npublic option to compete. We are going to get a better public option \nbecause of private competition, and we will get better private \ninsurance because of public option competition. It is as simple as \nthat. It is not a big government program. It simply says: Let's inject \ncompetition into the system so we get better health insurance.\n  There are a lot of accusations and untruths thrown around by \nopponents, the same people who tried to stop the creation of Medicare \nyears ago and the same people who tried to privatize Medicare a few \nyears ago. We know this bill protects what works and will fix what is \nwrong. We will all be better off as a result.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/29/senate-section/article/S8264-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8264-S8265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to a period of morning business, with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that an article by \nMartin Feldstein, ``Obama's Plan Isn't the Answer'' printed in the \nWashington Post, Tuesday, July 28, 2009, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, July 28, 2009]\n\n                     Obama's Plan Isn't the Answer\n\n                         (By Martin Feldstein)\n\n       For the 85 percent of Americans who already have health \n     insurance, the Obama health plan is bad news. It means higher \n     taxes, less health care and no protection if they lose their \n     current insurance because of unemployment or early \n     retirement.\n       President Obama's primary goal is to extend formal health \n     insurance to those low-income individuals who are currently \n     uninsured despite the nearly $300-billion-a-year Medicaid \n     program. Doing so the Obama way would cost more than $1 \n     trillion over the next 10 years. There surely must be better \n     and less costly ways to improve the health and health care of \n     that low-income group.\n       Although the president claims he can finance the enormous \n     increase in costs by raising taxes only on high-income \n     individuals, tax experts know that this won't work. \n     Experience shows that raising the top income-tax rate from 35 \n     percent today to more than 45 percent--the effect of adding \n     the proposed health surcharge to the increase resulting from \n     letting the Bush tax cuts expire for high-income taxpayers--\n     would change the behavior of high-income individuals in ways \n     that would shrink their taxable incomes and therefore produce \n     less revenue. The result would be larger deficits and higher \n     taxes on the middle class. Because of the\n\n[[Page S8265]]\n\n     unprecedented deficits forecast for the next decade, this is \n     definitely not a time to start a major new spending program.\n       A second key goal of the Obama health plan is to slow the \n     growth of health-care spending. The president's budget calls \n     explicitly for cutting Medicare to help pay for the expanded \n     benefits for low-income individuals. But the administration's \n     goal is bigger than that. It is to cut dramatically the \n     amount of health care that we all consume.\n       A recent report by the White House Council of Economic \n     Advisers claims that the government can cut the projected \n     level of health spending by 15 percent over the next decade \n     and by 30 percent over the next 20 years. Although the \n     reduced spending would result from fewer services rather than \n     lower payments to providers, we are told that this can be \n     done without lowering the quality of care or diminishing our \n     health. I don't believe it.\n       To support their claim that costs can be radically reduced \n     without adverse effects, the health planners point to the \n     fact that about half of all hospital costs are for patients \n     in the last year of life. I don't find that persuasive. Do \n     doctors really know which of their very ill patients will \n     benefit from expensive care and which will die regardless of \n     the care they receive? In a world of uncertainty, many of us \n     will want to hope that care will help.\n       We are also often told that patients in Minnesota receive \n     many fewer dollars of care per capita than patients in New \n     York and California without adverse health effects. When I \n     hear that, I wonder whether we should cut back on care, as \n     these experts advocate, move to Minnesota, or wish we had the \n     genetic stock of Minnesotans.\n       The administration's health planners believe that the new \n     ``cost effectiveness research'' will allow officials to \n     eliminate wasteful spending by defining the ``appropriate'' \n     care that will be paid for by the government and by private \n     insurance. Such a constrained, one-size-fits-all form of \n     medicine may be necessary in some European health programs in \n     which the government pays all the bills. But Americans have \n     shown that we prefer to retain a diversity of options and the \n     ability to choose among doctors, hospitals and standards of \n     care.\n       At a time when medical science offers the hope of major \n     improvements in the treatment of a wide range of dread \n     diseases, should Washington be limiting the available care \n     and, in the process, discouraging medical researchers from \n     developing new procedures and products? Although health care \n     is much more expensive than it was 30 years ago, who today \n     would settle for the health care of the 1970s?\n       Obama has said that he would favor a British-style ``single \n     payer'' system in which the government owns the hospitals and \n     the doctors are salaried but that he recognizes that such a \n     shift would be too disruptive to the health-care industry. \n     The Obama plan to have a government insurance provider that \n     can undercut the premiums charged by private insurers would \n     undoubtedly speed the arrival of such a single-payer plan. It \n     is hard to think of any other reason for the administration \n     to want a government insurer when there is already a very \n     competitive private insurance market that could be made more \n     so by removing government restrictions on interstate \n     competition.\n       There is much that can be done to improve our health-care \n     system, but the Obama plan is not the way to do it. One \n     helpful change that could be made right away is fixing the \n     COBRA system so that middle-income households that lose their \n     insurance because of early retirement or a permanent layoff \n     are not deterred by the cost of continuing their previous \n     coverage.\n       Now that congressional leaders have made it clear that \n     Obama will not see health legislation until at least the end \n     of the year, the president should look beyond health policy \n     and turn his attention to the problems that are impeding our \n     economic recovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/29/senate-section/article/S8265-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   FURTHER CHANGES TO S. CON. RES. 13\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 401(c)(4) of S. Con. Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the section 401(b) discretionary spending limits, \nallocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, and aggregates for legislation making appropriations for \nfiscal years 2009 and 2010 for overseas deployments and other \nactivities by the amounts provided in such legislation for those \npurposes and so designated pursuant to section 401(c)(4). The \nadjustment is limited to the total amount of budget authority specified \nin section 104(21) of S. Con. Res. 13. For 2009, that limitation is \n$90.745 billion, and for 2010, it is $130 billion.\n  On June 25, 2009, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported H.R. \n2847, the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act, 2010, with an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute. The reported legislation contains $126 million in funding \nthat has been designated for overseas deployments and other activities \npursuant to section 401(c)(4). The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that the $126 million in budget authority will result in $104 \nmillion in new outlays in 2010. As a result, I am revising both the \ndiscretionary spending limits and the allocation to the Senate \nCommittee on Appropriations for discretionary budget authority and \noutlays by those amounts in 2010. When combined with previous \nadjustments made pursuant to section 401(c)(4), $379 million has been \ndesignated so far for overseas deployments and other activities for \n2010.\n  In addition, section 401(c)(2)(B) of the 2010 budget resolution \npermits the chairman to adjust the section 401(b) discretionary \nspending limits, allocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and aggregates for legislation making \nappropriations for fiscal year 2010 that both appropriates $7.1 billion \nand provides an additional appropriation of up to $890 million to the \nInternal Revenue Service for enhanced tax enforcement to address the \ntax gap, the difference between the amount of taxes owed and the amount \nof taxes paid.\n  On July 9, 2009, the Senate Appropriations Committee reported S. \n1432, the financial services and general government appropriations \nBill, 2010. The reported bill contains $890 million in funding that \nsatisfies the conditions of section 401(c)(2)(B). The Congressional \nBudget Office estimates that the $890 million in budget authority will \nresult in $837 million in new outlays in 2010. As a result, I am \nrevising both the discretionary spending limits and the allocation to \nthe Senate Committee on Appropriations for discretionary budget \nauthority and outlays by those amounts in 2010.\n  When combining the effects of the two adjustments, I am revising \ntoday both the discretionary spending limits and the allocation to the \nSenate Committee on Appropriations by a total of $1,016 million for \nbudget authority and $941 million for outlays.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to S.

Mr. President, as chairman of the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs, it is the responsibility of my committee \ncolleagues and I to oversee and consider legislation to award \nCongressional Gold Medals to prospective candidates deemed worthy of \nthe honor. Indeed, it is the highest honor that Congress can bestow on \nan individual or group, and as such, my committee has to ensure that \nthese bills garner broad bipartisan support in the form of two-thirds \ncosponsorship in the Senate before they can receive full consideration. \nThis year, I am pleased that a bill to award a Congressional Gold Medal \nto the Women Airforce Service Pilots, or\n\n[[Page S8266]]\n\nWASP, secured my committee's approval and passed the Senate unanimously \non May 20, 2009.\n  This bill, authored by Senators Hutchison and Mikulski, recognizes \nthe brave actions of more than a thousand women who served our country \nso courageously during World War II. Their patriotism and sacrifice \nwere essential to our war effort. Quite simply, they were responsible \nfor transporting critical military aircraft throughout the United \nStates. Ferrying over 12,000 aircraft, of nearly 80 different types, \nthese groundbreaking women operated war machines, from the fabled B-29 \nSuperfortress to the lethal P-51 Mustang fighter. The purpose of their \nmissions was to prepare these aircraft for combat and ensure their \nreadiness.\n  The WASPs were so effective that they logged over 50 percent of these \nkinds of missions for our Nation, flying more than 60 million miles \nover the course of the war. Their likes included Jacqueline Cochran, \none of the greatest female pilots of all time, who was chosen to be the \ndirector of the WASPs flight training. Jacqueline set the women's U.S. \nhigh altitude and international speed records and was also the winner \nof the coveted Bendix trophy in 1938. During the famous air race, she \nearned an epic victory flying from Los Angeles to Cleveland in just \nover 8 hours. Jacqueline was further commended for her service during \nthe war when she was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal, the \nhighest decoration she could have received from the military without \nbeing recognized as an Active-Duty servicemember. When the war ended, \nJacqueline's passion for flying would drive her to set new aviation \nrecords, becoming the first female pilot to fly a bomber across the \nAtlantic. Additionally, six WASPs are still living in my home State of \nConnecticut. One of them, Gloria Heath, flew a dangerous mission as a \nB-26 bomber pilot, flying at 6,000 feet while towing a banner that \nfighter pilots would use for target practice during live fire \nexercises. Now Gloria is nationally recognized as a leader in aviation \nsafety, having served as a founding board member of the Flight Safety \nFoundation. She also established an international safety information \ndissemination service to provide a unified, global response to \nemergencies on the land, in the air, and on the sea. Her pioneering \nefforts to ensure the safety of pilots and travelers all over the world \nhave undoubtedly saved lives. Throughout her endeavors, Gloria never \nlost sight of her lifelong commitment to flying. She would become the \ndirector of summer aviation programs at Connecticut College, helping \nyoung students discover their passion for flight, just as she did half \na decade before.\n  But these women did more than just serve our country they were also \npioneers for women's rights. They will forever have the honor of being \nthe first female aviators in American military history, serving as the \nforerunners to women's equality in the Armed Forces. In doing so, they \npaved the way for women's rights in the military and other workforces \nacross the country. And although much still remains to be done to \neradicate gender discrimination, women military combat pilots are now \nflying alongside their brothers in arms a true testament to the \nbarriers broken down by the WASPs more than six decades ago.\n  These women often faced scorn and ridicule, but they refused to back \ndown in their conviction that they could fly as proficiently as men. \nUltimately, they were proven right and demonstrated that success should \nbe measured in terms of merit and talent, not by gender.\n  Therefore it is with great pride and honor, Mr. President, that I \nsupport this bill. I commend Senators Hutchison and Mikulski for all \ntheir hard work and join them in their gratitude for the pioneering \nwomen of the WASP program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/29/senate-section/article/S8266-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           INSPECTORS GENERAL\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I, Senator Chuck Grassley, intend to \nobject to the proceeding to H.R. 885, the Improved Financial and \nCommodity Markets Oversight and Accountability Act, and a similar \nSenate bill, S. 1354, dated July 29, 2009, for the following reasons.''\n  I object to provisions regarding inspectors general in H.R. 885, and \na similar Senate bill, S. 1354, based on my reading of the language in \nthe Improved Financial and Commodity Markets Oversight and \nAccountability Act. The act is intended to require Presidential \nappointments and Senate confirmation for the following five inspectors \ngeneral: Commodity Futures Trading Commission, CFTC; the National \nCredit Union Administration, NCUA; the Pension Benefit Guaranty \nCorporation, PBGC; the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve \nSystem, FRB; and the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n  In essence, the act will change dramatically the historical and \nlongstanding classification of these five organizations from \n``designated federal entities'' DFE, under the original Inspector \nGeneral Act of 1978, to Presidential appointees.\n  These IGs, who are all nonpartisan civil servants, oppose H.R. 885. I \nhave come to agree with their conclusion that the act will neither \nimprove the independence of the five IGs nor enhance their \naccountability to the American people. Requiring that these five IGs be \nmade Presidential appointees introduces the potential for partisan \npolitics where none currently exists. This is especially true because \nwe have an administration that is not even a year old and three IGs \nhave already been dismissed. I have not yet seen a consistent policy \nreason articulated for treating these five IGs differently from other \nDFE IGs. If Congress wants to increase the independence and \naccountability of all inspectors general, there are numerous, more \neffective ways of doing so, and I would be eager to work toward that \ncommon goal. However, this legislation has not had a full and, complete \nhearing in the Senate, targets only five of the DFE inspectors general \nfor reasons that are unclear, and does not appear to achieve its stated \npurpose.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/29/senate-section/article/S8266-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8266-S8267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kyl and Senator Levin for \nworking out a second-degree amendment last week to Senator Kyl's \nearlier amendment, No. 1760, to the National Defense Authorization Act \nrelating to the post-START agreement that the United States is \nnegotiating with the Russian Federation. In my view, the earlier \namendment--and section 1239 of the House version of the NDAA, on which \nthat amendment was based--would have undermined the constitutional role \nof the Senate as the body that considers treaties, as well as the \nPresident's role in negotiating treaties. The Senate decided wisely not \nto adopt the House approach of trying to bar U.S. compliance with a \ntreaty before the treaty has even been negotiated. The substitute \namendment we adopted last week was a good result.\n  The bill approved by the Senate, as amended by Senator Kyl's modified \namendment, would require the President to report to the Congress on his \nplan to enhance the safety, security and reliability of the U.S. \nnuclear weapons stockpile, to modernize the nuclear weapons complex, \nand to maintain the delivery platforms. I would encourage the \nadministration to see that requirement not as a burden, but as an \nopportunity. If U.S. ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \nTreaty is to be approved by the Senate, Members will have to be \nconvinced that the executive branch is prepared to sustain our nuclear \ndeterrence by maintaining a stockpile of safe, secure, and reliable \nnuclear weapons, without resorting to nuclear testing. This report \nrequirement underscores that concern and the need to address it \nforthrightly.\n  I believe that this administration has the will to maintain our \nnuclear stockpile, and the successes of stockpile stewardship over the \nlast decade have been greater than even its proponents predicted when \nwe last considered CTBT. The report required by this amendment would \noffer an opportunity to explain to the Senate how far we have come, \nwhere we are going next, and how we will fund stockpile stewardship to \nensure that we will sustain our deterrent posture even as the United \nStates works with other countries to reduce the numbers and importance \nof these weapons worldwide. It may be only a preliminary report, if\n\n[[Page S8267]]\n\nthe National Defense Authorization Act is enacted well before the \nNuclear Posture Review and the President's fiscal year 2011 budget \nrequest are completed, but it will still be an opportunity to educate \nthe Senate.\n  The Kyl amendment as modified also states that the Senate urges the \nPresident to maintain his position that the post-START agreement will \nnot contain limitations on ballistic missile defense systems, space \ncapabilities, or advanced conventional weapons systems of the United \nStates. I am absolutely confident, based on the Obama-Medvedev \nstatements of April 1 and July 6, 2009, that their instructions to \nnegotiators are not to include such limitations in the agreement.\n  For example, there will be ``a provision on the interrelationship of \nstrategic offensive and strategic defensive arms,'' but ``a provision'' \ndoes not mean a limitation on U.S. missile defense or space \ncapabilities. Similarly, the existing START Treaty has ``a provision'' \nregarding antiballistic missile systems but does not limit those \nsystems.\n  Regarding the Senate's desire to avoid limitations on ``advanced \nconventional weapons,'' I would just emphasize that the adoption of \nthis substitute amendment is not intended to be a backdoor way to \noppose limitations on strategic delivery vehicles.\n  In short, I believe that the Kyl substitute amendment adopted last \nweek should do no harm and that the administration can use it to begin \nthe process of educating the Senate on a matter we will have to address \nin any event. Again, I commend Senators Kyl and Levin for reaching this \nresult.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/29/senate-section/article/S8267-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NOMINATION OF THOMAS A.

Mr. President, I wish to congratulate St. Albans VT, \nnative John LeClair for being chosen as a 2009 inductee into the U.S. \nHockey Hall of Fame.\n  John LeClair had a remarkable amateur and professional hockey career. \nThe first American-born player to record three consecutive 50-goal \nseasons in the National Hockey League, LeClair played 16 years in the \nNHL--with stops in Montreal, Philadelphia, and Pittsburgh--and he \nhelped the Montreal Canadiens capture the Stanley Cup in 1993. He \nregistered 406 goals and 413 assists for 819 points in 967 career \ngames, which ranks him 13th on the NHL's alltime points list among \nAmerican-born players. LeClair also was a 2-time Olympian, where he \nnetted 34 career points, 22-12, 31 games in a Team USA uniform.\n  Most hockey fans remember LeClair for his dramatic two game-winning \ngoals in overtime during the 1993 Stanley Cup Finals, for being a \nmember of the dreaded ``Legion of Doom'' line with the Philadelphia \nFlyers, and for leading Team USA to a Silver Medal in the 2002 Winter \nOlympics.\n  Vermonters. though, go further back with their native son. After his \nhigh school graduation from Bellows Free Academy in St. Albans, the \nMontreal Canadiens drafted LeClair with the 33rd pick in the 1987 entry \ndraft. Instead of immediately going to the NHL, LeClair chose to attend \nthe University of Vermont, where he thrilled Catamount fans for four, \nexciting seasons. Less than a week after playing his final collegiate \ngame, LeClair signed with Montreal and hit the ice with the Canadiens \nright away.\n  While LeClair quickly went on to stardom and fame in the NHL, he \nalways enjoyed a loyal following back home. Many Vermonters are \nnaturally Canadiens fans because Montreal is so close to Vermont, but \nit was amazing to see how many people converted to Flyer fans when \nLeClair moved to Philadelphia and Penguin fans when he moved to \nPittsburgh. I remember that no matter whether it was hockey season or \nnot, it seemed like you couldn't walk down the street in St. Albans or \nBurlington or Rutland without seeing someone wearing some sort of \nFlyers paraphernalia, which stood out because of the team's \ndistinguishing orange and black colors.\n  Once again, I congratulate John LeClair on this high honor of being \nselected as a member of the U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame. I ask unanimous \nconsent to have a copy of a July 29 article from the Burlington Free \nPress printed in the Record.\n  The material was ordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, July 29, 2009]\n\n LeClair to Enter U.S. Hockey Hall of Fame--St. Albans Native is Among \n                              Class of '09\n\n       Colorado Springs, Colo.--Former University of Vermont and \n     NHL star John LeClair of St. Albans, Vt., will be inducted \n     into the United States Hockey Hall of Fame.\n       USA hockey's 2009 class was announced Tuesday, and it also \n     includes former NHL players Tony Amonte and Tom Barrasso, the \n     1998 U.S. Olympic women's team and the late Frank Zamboni, \n     inventor of the storied ice resurfacing machine.\n       The date of the induction ceremony will be announced in \n     August.\n       During an NHL career that included five seasons with the \n     Montreal Canadians, 10 with the Philadelphia Flyers and two \n     as a Pittsburgh Penguin, LeClair registered 406 goals and 413 \n     assists for 819 points in 967 career games.\n       The winger helped Montreal win the Stanley Cup in 1993, was \n     the first American-born player with three straight 50-goal \n     seasons from 1995 to 1998, and was on USA's silver-medal team \n     at the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City.\n       LeClair is also a member of UVM's Hall of Fame.

HARPOLE, JR.\n\n Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, today I honor Reuben K. Harpole, \nJr.--a man who has changed countless lives in Wisconsin through his \nselfless devotion to helping people.\n  Reuben developed an entrepreneurial spirit growing up in Milwaukee. \nHis family worked at the family grocery store, sold their home-raised \nchickens in the front yard, and rented out bicycles. This work ethic \nwent with him throughout his life. He went on to serve our Nation in \nKorea from 1957 to 1959. Then he came back home, earned his bachelor's \ndegree, and began his professional life as a teacher and community \nactivist.\n  With 31 years service to University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and \ncontinued community activism, Reuben helped mold the future of \nWisconsin. In the 1960s Reuben began working to direct youth away from \ngangs into fruitful career paths. When central Milwaukee's health \nservices were shutting down in the 1970s, Reuben worked with local, \ncounty, and university officials to reinstate much needed assistance. \nHe helped establish the Isaac Coggs Health Center and a coalition of \nneighborhood health organizations. Reuben also founded or developed the \nCollege Prep Program at Marquette University High School, the UWM \nCenter for Urban Community Development, the\n\n[[Page S8268]]\n\nHarambee Ombudsman Program, and the Children's Performing Arts Group \nthat has evolved into the renowned Ko Thi Dance Company.\n  Reuben has also been an outstanding advocate for our African-American \ncommunity in Milwaukee. He has written forewords for several books \nabout African-American history in Milwaukee. He voluntarily conducts \ntours of Black Milwaukee, which brings a real-life perspective to his \nwork in African-American history. A multitude of African-American \nprograms and organizations are indebted to his service including the \nNTU African Rites of Passage Program, the Asentu Adult Rites of Passage \nInstitute, the Black Holocaust Museum, and the Milwaukee 100 Black Men \nGroup. In fact, it was on Reuben's invitation to a gathering that I met \nwith Martin Luther King, Jr., during one of his few visits to Milwaukee \nmany years ago.\n  Even after retirement, he continues to be a great leader in the \ncommunity. Most notably, he joined the Helen Bader Foundation. Through \nthis he is able to help programs and centers secure the funds they need \nto function and more successfully serve the community.\n  The work he has done for Milwaukee continues to grow as the many \npeople he has inspired are starting to follow in his footsteps. I would \nlike to specifically note the Volunteer Reading Tutoring Program at the \nUWM Reading Clinic. A truly great person is one who not only does great \nworks but also inspires other to do so as well.\n  I am proud to call Reuben a fellow Wisconsite and a dear friend. I \nwish him and his lovely wife Mildred good health, happiness, and many \nmore years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/29/senate-section/article/S8268-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING EILEEN COLLINS\n\n Mrs. GILLIBRAND.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Resort Cities \n     from Discrimination Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Tourism, including conventions and meetings, is an \n     important part of the United States economy that generates \n     billions of dollars in tax revenues for many localities.\n       (2) Analysts estimate that approximately 90 percent of \n     employers in the travel industry are small businesses and \n     more than 12 percent of United States employees are employed \n     by the travel industry.\n       (3) Many local economies around the country have developed \n     into destinations for vacationers and conventioneers alike, \n     and those local economies depend on the travel industry to \n     support local employment, create new jobs, and generate tax \n     revenues for critical public services.\n       (4) These same destinations are home to large and small \n     businesses that have unique skills, amenities, and resources \n     for planning and facilitating meetings and conventions for \n     all purposes and, consequently, may deliver value and \n     convenience for individuals and organizations in need of a \n     location for an official event.\n       (5) Locating an official event in such a city frequently \n     may save taxpayer dollars, as compared to other locations.\n       (6) Agencies and departments of the United States have a \n     responsibility to find ways to maximize taxpayer dollars in \n     conducting official business, including planning and \n     conducting official meetings attended by Federal employees.\n       (7) In deciding where to locate an official government \n     meeting by applying this principle of maximizing taxpayer \n     dollars, government officials often will conclude that many \n     locations known as resort destinations also will provide the \n     best value and convenience for official meetings and \n     business.\n       (8) Resort and vacation destination cities tend to be \n     affected disproportionally during economic downturns and, \n     therefore, are especially vulnerable to discrimination by \n     meeting and convention planners, which could exacerbate \n     unemployment and related demands on United States taxpayers.\n\n     SEC. 3. LIMITATION ON CERTAIN TRAVEL AND CONFERENCES POLICIES \n                   OF AGENCIES OF THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       No agency or department of the United States may establish \n     or implement an internal policy regarding travel, event, \n     meeting, or conference locations that discourages or \n     prohibits the selection of such a location because the \n     location is perceived to be a resort or vacation destination.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Byrd (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mr. \n        Casey, Mr. Webb, Mr. Shelby, and Mr. Warner)):\n  S. 1534. A bill to complete construction of the 13-States Appalachian \ndevelopment highway system, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nreauthorize the Appalachian Development Highway System. This network of \nhighways and corridors, known as the ADHS, was designed to provide \naccess to and from communities in Appalachia. The concept of the ADHS \nwas born 45 years ago. It was, and is, an important promise made by the \nFederal Government to the people of my State and the rest of \nAppalachia. I thank the cosponsors of my bill: Senators Rockefeller, \nCasey, and Webb, and I look forward to working with Environment and \nPublic Works Committee Chairwoman Boxer to have my legislation included \nin the next highway reauthorization.\n  While serving in the House of Representatives, I cast my vote in \nfavor of establishing the Interstate Highway System back in 1958. I \nhave had a long history of advancing the cause of our Nation's highway \nsystems and of emphasizing the immense economic and safety benefits \nthat come with the improvement of all surface transportation.\n  The ADHS's inception was in 1964, when it was recognized by the first \nAppalachian Regional Commission that, while the Interstate Highway \nSystem would provide historic economic benefits to most of our Nation, \nthe system was designed to bypass the Appalachian region. This was \nprimarily due to the difficulties involved in building roads upon \nAppalachia's beautiful, but very rugged topography. Absent the \nAppalachian Development Highway System, my State, as well as the whole \nof the Appalachian region, would have been left solely with a \ntransportation infrastructure of dangerous, narrow, winding roads which \nfollow the paths of river valleys and stream beds, winding around \nmountains and hills. Thus, the limited access to these regions has \ntended to stifle economic opportunities for countless communities--a \nproblem that still exists all these years later.\n  In addition to the Federal Government's responsibility to keep the \npromise made decades ago to the people of Appalachia, new benefits--\nbenefits to the entire Nation--have evolved because of the ADHS. In a \nrecent economic analysis conducted by the Appalachian Regional \nCommission, the study found that completion of the ADHS will result in \nsignificant reductions in travel time for personal, business, and long-\ndistance freight trips. By 2020, the aggregate savings in travel time \nis estimated to be over 67 million hours, 240,000 hours daily of travel \ntime saved, and grow to almost 180 million hours of reduced travel time \nby 2035.\n  ADHS corridor improvements will produce significant monetized travel \nbenefits to individuals and businesses both within and outside the ARC \nregion. Total user benefits--travel time, fuel and non-fuel operating \ncosts, and safety--are estimated to be $1.3 billion in 2020, the year \nof system completion, and grow to $4.3 billion by 2035. Over half the \nbenefit is expected to accrue to business-related travel--commodity-\nbased truck flows, local nonfreight truck trips, and on-the-clock auto \ntrips.\n  The reason for the existence of the Appalachian Development Highway \nSystem is no less valid today than when it was established in 1964. The \nbenefits of completion of the ADHS are twofold: continue to make \ninroads into isolated communities, and address and alleviate an already \noverly burdened Interstate Highway System.\n  Unfortunately, there are still children in Appalachia who lack decent \ntransportation routes to local schools. There are thousands upon \nthousands of people who cannot obtain sustainable, well-paying jobs \nbecause of poor transportation access to major employment centers. Some \nof the most beautiful places in the country are in Appalachia, but for \ntourism to thrive, Americans must be able to actually get to these \nbeautiful destinations.\n  It is time for this Congress, in concert with the administration, to \ntake the last great leap forward and to authorize sufficient contract \nauthority to finally complete the Appalachian Development Highway \nSystem. The legislation I am introducing today will provide sufficient \ncontract authority to complete the system, and the completion of the \nsystem will provide additional economic opportunities, safer modes of \ntravel, and ease the strain on our current transportation \ninfrastructure.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 1535. A bill to amend the Fish and Wildlife Act of 1956 to \nestablish additional prohibitions on shooting wildlife from aircraft, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment and Public \nWorks.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto prevent the cruel and unsportsmanlike practice of hunting from \nairplanes.\n  This practice undermines the hunting principle of a fair chase and \noften leads to a slow and painful death for the hunted animals.\n  I firmly believe that slaughter must be the very last option when it \ncomes\n\n[[Page S8275]]\n\nto wildlife management. Moreover, if slaughter must be carried out, it \nshould be done in the most humane method possible.\n  In my opinion, allowing private citizens to hunt from airplanes runs \ncontrary to this belief.\n  Specifically, the Protect America's Wildlife Act closes the loophole \nin current law that allows private citizens to hunt from aircraft. It \nlimits airborne hunting to employees of state fish and wildlife \nagencies, the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the Department of the \nInterior.\n  It eliminates the practice of ``land-and-shoot'' hunting by \nprohibiting the chasing or exhausting of animals from an aircraft.\n  It provides an exception to allow airborne hunting during biological \nemergencies, which is defined as a case where a wildlife population's \nsustainability is significantly threatened by an excess of predators.\n  It also ensures that this exception only applies to when it is the \nonly way to prevent a biological emergency, and limits the number of \nanimals killed to a minimum.\n  Finally, it increases fines for violations of the Airborne Hunting \nAct from $5,000 to $50,000.\n  It does not preclude States or Federal agencies from carrying out \nresponsible wildlife management programs.\n  Congress initially passed the Airborne Hunting Act of 1971 as a \nresult of the public's reaction to film of this practice broadcast over \ntelevision.\n  Currently, a loophole in the Airborne Hunting Act permits States to \nallow private citizens to engage in airborne hunting of wildlife--in \nmost cases wolves and bears--under the guise of wildlife management.\n  It was clear in the 1970's, as it is now, that airborne hunting is \ninhumane and must be stopped.\n  In my opinion, aerial hunting methods are cruel and unnecessary for \nwildlife management--and undermine the principles of sportsmanship.\n  Since 2003, more than 1,000 wolves have been killed from the air in \nthe State of Alaska. According to the animal welfare group the \nDefenders of Wildlife, more than 250 wolves have been shot dead during \nthe current hunting season alone.\n  Aerial hunting is typically carried out in one of two ways:\n  In the first method, a hunter will shoot the wolf directly from the \naircraft while flying overhead. This frequently wounds the wolf, \nleading to a slow, painful death.\n  In the second method, known as ``land-and-shoot,'' a hunter flying in \nan aircraft will chase the wolf until it is exhausted, land, and kill \nthe animal from point-blank range.\n  So, I am introducing a bill today to close the airborne hunting \nloophole that allows it to continue.\n  This legislation would not impinge on legitimate hunting rights.\n  This bill does not prohibit the use of airplanes for transportation. \nA hunter would still be able to legally fly anywhere, anytime, and hunt \nas they otherwise would.\n  Further, all other legal methods of transportation or hunting may \nalso continue: on foot, by snowmobile, by all-terrain vehicle, etc.\n  The State of Alaska, where airborne hunting is more prevalent, argues \nthat wolf populations must be limited to support sustainable levels of \nmoose and caribou.\n  The State continues to carry out airborne hunting by private citizens \nwith authority from the State Department of Game, which argues that the \nmoose and caribou populations must be increased.\n  It is estimated that the State's resident hunters alone contribute \nroughly $662 million annually to the economy. The hunting industry also \nsustains 10,000 jobs.\n  With this in mind, it is certainly not my intention to prevent \nAlaska, or any other state for that matter, from maintaining a robust \nhunting and tourism industry.\n  This is a balanced bill that will enable states to responsibly manage \nwildlife populations, while banning the most egregious cases of aerial \nhunting by civilians.\n  It limits the practice of airborne hunting to employees of State and \nFederal wildlife agencies without impinging on legitimate sport hunting \npractices.\n  It is also supported by former members of the Alaska Board of Game \nthat agree this practice should be controlled.\n  I became concerned about inhumane wildlife management practices due \nto the slaughter of nonnative deer in my own State.\n  Beginning in the summer of 2007, the National Park Service began \nculling Axis and Fallow deer at Point Reyes National Seashore near San \nFrancisco. This inhumane shooting resulted in a number of deer dying \nslow and painful deaths. Some were left to rot in the Park.\n  Hundreds of constituents from the Bay Area raised an outcry about \nthis practice and I am pleased that the National Park Service has \nstopped slaughtering the deer.\n  In conclusion, this bill prohibits the cruel practice of aerial sport \nhunting, while safeguarding the rights of legitimate hunters and \nallowing States and the Federal Government to maintain responsible \nwildlife management.\n  I am certainly open to the suggestions of my colleagues who have \nideas for improving this legislation and look forward to working with \nthem to pass it quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1535\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, as our Nation wrestles with the \nimpacts of a changing climate, we need strong science to inform our \ndecision-making. Today, I am introducing two bills to support that \neffort.\n  The first, the Black Carbon, S. 1538, and Other Aerosols Research \nAct, S. 1539, would direct research dollars towards improving our \nunderstanding of a major component of climate change--atmospheric \naerosols. We need more information about how aerosols, including black \ncarbon, impact climate change and how limiting their emissions will \nultimately affect the rate of melting in the Arctic and overall climate \nchange. Emerging research shows that black carbon and other aerosols \nhave a major impact on global climate change. In fact, the effect of \nblack carbon is thought to be second only to carbon dioxide. In order \nto reduce the impacts of aerosols on climate and air quality, we need \nto better understand their effects. Improved aerosols monitoring, \nmeasurements, and models are therefore necessary to improve our \nresponse to climate change. This legislation would authorize a program \nwithin the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to observe, \nmonitor, and model black carbon and other aerosols to better understand \nthe roles of black carbon and other aerosols in climate change.\n  Identifying and quantifying human and natural emissions of greenhouse \ngases are necessary to make informed decisions about emission reduction \nstrategies. Effective policy to address climate change requires \nmonitoring and validation of emissions from specific sources and \nprojects. Given the investments required to meet the challenge of \ngreenhouse gas reductions, it is critical that efforts to reduce \nemissions be verifiable at local, regional, national, and international \nlevels and consistent with evidence in the atmosphere. The second bill \nI am introducing today, the Greenhouse Gas Observing and Analysis \nSystem Act, would establish a robust monitoring and analysis program to \nprovide more precise and verified estimates of the amount of greenhouse \ngases in the atmosphere. This would help us monitor the effectiveness \nof programs and policies designed to reduce emissions.\n  We need continued research investments to answer the ``hows,'' and \nthe ``whys,'' regarding climate change. How are we going to be \nimpacted? Why is our atmosphere and planet responding the way it is? We \nneed sound answers to these questions to be agile and to adapt to the \nchanges our globe is experiencing. These bills will help us answer \nthese and many other questions.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1538\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 226\n\n       Whereas gospel music is a beloved art form of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas gospel music is a cornerstone of the musical \n     traditions of the United States and has spread beyond origins \n     in African-American spirituals to achieve popular cultural \n     and historical relevance;\n       Whereas gospel music has spread beyond geographic origins \n     in the United States to touch audiences around the world; and\n       Whereas gospel music is a testament to the universal appeal \n     of a historical art form of the United States that both \n     inspires and entertains across racial, ethnic, religious, and \n     geographical boundaries: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates September 2009 as ``Gospel Music Heritage \n     Month''; and\n       (2) recognizes the valuable contributions to the culture of \n     the United States derived from the rich heritage of gospel \n     music and gospel music artists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/29/senate-section/article/S8278-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 227--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 2009 AS ``TAY-SACHS \n                           AWARENESS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. BROWN submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 227\n\n       Whereas Tay-Sachs disease is a rare, genetic disorder that \n     causes destruction of nerve cells in the brain and spinal \n     cord due to the poor functioning of an enzyme called \n     hexosaminidase A;\n       Whereas there is no proven treatment or cure for Tay-Sachs \n     disease and the disease is always fatal in children;\n       Whereas the disorder was named after Warren Tay, an \n     ophthalmologist from the United Kingdom, and Bernard Sachs, a \n     neurologist from the United States, both of whom contributed \n     to the discovery of the disease in the 1880s;\n       Whereas Tay-Sachs disease often affects families with no \n     prior history of the disease;\n       Whereas approximately 1 in 27 Ashkenazi Jews, 1 in 30 \n     Louisianan Cajuns, 1 in 30 French Canadians, 1 in 50 Irish \n     Americans, and 1 in every 250 people are carriers of Tay-\n     Sachs disease, which means approximately 1,500,000 people in \n     the United States are carriers;\n       Whereas unaffected carriers of the disease possess the \n     recessive gene that can trigger the disease in future \n     generations;\n       Whereas, if both parents of a child are carriers of Tay-\n     Sachs disease, there is a 1 in 4 chance that the child will \n     develop Tay-Sachs disease;\n       Whereas a simple and inexpensive blood test can determine \n     if an individual is a carrier of Tay-Sachs disease, and all \n     people in the United States, especially those people who are \n     members of high-risk populations, should be screened; and\n       Whereas raising awareness of Tay-Sachs disease is the best \n     way to fight this horrific disease: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate designates September 2009 as \n     ``Tay-Sachs Awareness Month''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/29/senate-section/article/S8278-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8278-S8279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 228--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 14, \n  2009, AS ``NATIONAL DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS RECOGNITION WEEK''\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \nKennedy, Ms. Collins, Mr. Carper, Mr. Bunning, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Dodd, and \nMr. Schumer) submitted the following resolution; which was considered \nand agreed to:\n\n                              S.

(a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) the United States is facing a deep economic crisis that \n     has caused millions of workers in the United States to lose \n     their jobs;\n       (2) the collapse of the automotive industry in the United \n     States would have dealt a devastating blow to an already \n     perilous economy;\n       (3) on December 19, 2008, President George W. Bush stated: \n     ``The actions I'm announcing today represent a step that we \n     wish were not necessary. But given the situation, it is the \n     most effective and responsible way to address this challenge \n     facing our nation. By giving the auto companies a chance to \n     restructure, we will shield the American people from a harsh \n     economic blow at a vulnerable time and we will give American \n     workers an opportunity to show the world, once again, they \n     can meet challenges with ingenuity and determination and \n     bounce back from tough times and emerge stronger than \n     before.'';\n       (4) on March 30, 2009, President Barack Obama stated: ``We \n     cannot, and must not, and we will not let our auto industry \n     simply vanish. This industry is like no other--it's an emblem \n     of the American spirit; a once and future symbol of America's \n     success. It's what helped build the middle class and \n     sustained it throughout the 20th century. It's a source of \n     deep pride for the generations of American workers whose hard \n     work and imagination led to some of the finest cars the world \n     has ever known. It's a pillar of our economy that has held up \n     the dreams of millions of our people. . . .These companies--\n\n[[Page S8282]]\n\n     and this industry--must ultimately stand on their own, not as \n     wards of the state.'';\n       (5) the Federal Government is a reluctant shareholder in \n     General Motors Corporation and Chrysler Motors LLC in order \n     to provide economic stability to the United States;\n       (6) the Federal Government should work to protect the \n     investment of the taxpayers of the United States;\n       (7) the Federal Government should not intervene in the day-\n     to-day management of General Motors or Chrysler; and\n       (8) the Federal Government should closely monitor General \n     Motors and Chrysler to ensure that they are being responsible \n     stewards of taxpayer dollars and are taking all practicable \n     steps to expeditiously return to viability.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Federal government is only a temporary stakeholder \n     in the automotive industry of the United States and should \n     take all practicable steps to protect the taxpayer dollars of \n     the United States and to divest the ownership interests of \n     the Federal Government in automotive companies as \n     expeditiously as practicable; and\n       (2) the Comptroller General of the United States, the \n     Congressional Oversight Panel, and the Special Inspector \n     General for the Troubled Assets Relief Program should \n     continue to oversee and report to Congress on automotive \n     companies receiving financial assistance so that the Federal \n     Government may complete divestiture without delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1875.

NEXT GENERATION BOMBER AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Long-range strike is a critical mission in which the \n     United States needs to retain a credible and dominant \n     capability.\n       (2) Long range, penetrating strike systems provide--\n       (A) a hedge against being unable to obtain access to \n     forward bases for political reasons;\n       (B) a capacity to respond quickly to contingencies;\n       (C) the ability to base outside the reach of emerging \n     adversary anti-access and area-denial capabilities; and\n       (D) the ability to impose disproportionate defensive costs \n     on prospective adversaries of the United States.\n       (3) The 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review found that there \n     was a requirement for a next generation bomber aircraft and \n     directed the United States Air Force to ``develop a new land-\n     based, penetrating long range strike capability to be fielded \n     by 2018''.\n       (4) On April 6, 2009, Secretary Gates announced that the \n     United States ``will not pursue a development program for a \n     follow-on Air Force bomber until we have a better \n     understanding of the need, the requirement and the \n     technology''.\n       (5) On May 7, 2009, President Barack Obama announced the \n     termination of the next generation bomber aircraft program in \n     the document of the Office of Management and Budget entitled \n     ``Terminations, Reductions, and Savings'', stating that \n     ``there is no urgent need to begin an expensive development \n     program for a new bomber'' and that ``the future bomber fleet \n     may not be affordable over the next six years''.\n       (6) The United States will need a new long-range strike \n     capability because the conflicts of the future will likely \n     feature heavily defended airspace, due in large part to the \n     proliferation of relatively inexpensive, but sophisticated \n     and deadly, air defense systems.\n       (7) General Michael Maples, the Director of the Defense \n     Intelligence Agency, noted during a March 10, 2009, hearing \n     of the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate on worldwide \n     threats that ``Russia, quite frankly, is the developer of \n     most of those [advanced air defense] systems and is exporting \n     those systems both to China and to other countries in the \n     world''.\n       (8) The Final Report of the Congressional Commission on the \n     Strategic Posture of the United States, submitted to Congress \n     on May 6, 2009, states that ``[t]he bomber force is valuable \n     particularly for extending deterrence in time of crisis, as \n     their deployment is visible and signals U.S. commitment. \n     Bombers also impose a significant cost burden on potential \n     adversaries in terms of the need to invest in advanced air \n     defenses''.\n       (9) The commanders of the United States Pacific Command, \n     the United States Strategic Command, and the United States \n     Joint Forces Command have each testified before the Committee \n     on Armed Services of the Senate in support of the capability \n     that the next generation bomber aircraft would provide.\n       (10) On June 17, 2009, General James Cartwright, Vice-\n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and chair of the Joint \n     Requirements Oversight Council, stated during a hearing \n     before the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that \n     ``the nation needs a new bomber''.\n       (11) Nearly half of the United States bomber aircraft \n     inventory (47 percent) pre-dates the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n       (12) The only air-breathing strike platforms the United \n     States possesses today with reach and survivability to have a \n     chance of successfully executing missions more than 1,000 \n     nautical miles into enemy territory from the last air-\n\n[[Page S8295]]\n\n     to-air refueling are 16 combat ready B-2 bomber aircraft.\n       (13) The B-2 bomber aircraft was designed in the 1980s and \n     achieved initial operational capability over a decade ago.\n       (14) The crash of an operational B-2 bomber aircraft during \n     takeoff at Guam in early 2008 indicates that attrition can \n     and does occur even in peacetime.\n       (15) The primary mission requirement of the next generation \n     bomber aircraft is the ability to strike targets anywhere on \n     the globe with whatever weapons the contingency requires.\n       (16) The requisite aerodynamic, structural, and low-\n     observable technologies to develop the next generation bomber \n     aircraft already exist in fifth-generation fighter aircraft.\n       (b) Policy on Continued Development of Next Generation \n     Bomber Aircraft in Fiscal Year 2010.--It is the policy of the \n     United States to support a development program for next \n     generation bomber aircraft technologies.\n\n     SEC. 125.

Missile defence forms part of a \n     broader response to counter this threat. We therefore \n     recognize the substantial contribution to the protection of \n     Allies from long-range ballistic missiles to be provided by \n     the planned deployment of European-based United States \n     missile defence assets''.\n       (2) The Bucharest Summit Declaration also stated that \n     ``[b]earing in mind the principle of the indivisibility of \n     Allied security as well as NATO solidarity, we task the \n     Council in Permanent Session to develop options for a \n     comprehensive missile defence architecture to extend coverage \n     to all Allied territory and populations not otherwise covered \n     by the United States system for review at our 2009 Summit, to \n     inform any future political decision''.\n       (3) In the Bucharest Summit Declaration, the North Atlantic \n     Council also reaffirmed to Russia that ``current, as well as \n     any future, NATO\n\n[[Page S8299]]\n\n     Missile Defence efforts are intended to better address the \n     security challenges we all face, and reiterate that, far from \n     posing a threat to our relationship, they offer opportunities \n     to deepen levels of cooperation and stability''.\n       (4) In the Strasbourg/Kehl Summit Declaration of April 4, \n     2009, the heads of state and government participating in the \n     meeting of the North Atlantic Council reaffirmed ``the \n     conclusions of the Bucharest Summit about missile defense,'' \n     and declared that ``we judge that missile threats should be \n     addressed in a prioritized manner that includes consideration \n     of the level of imminence of the threat and the level of \n     acceptable risk''.\n       (5) Iran is rapidly developing its ballistic missile \n     capabilities, including its inventory of short-range and \n     medium-range ballistic missiles that can strike portions of \n     Eastern and Southern North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     European territory, as well as the pursuit of long-range \n     ballistic missiles that could reach Europe or the United \n     States.\n       (6) On July 8, 2008, the Government of the United States \n     and the Government of the Czech Republic signed an agreement \n     to base a radar facility in the Czech Republic that is part \n     of a proposed missile defense system to protect Europe and \n     the United States against a potential future Iranian long-\n     range ballistic missile threat.\n       (7) On August 20, 2008, the United States and the Republic \n     of Poland signed an agreement concerning the deployment of \n     ground-based ballistic missile defense interceptors in the \n     territory of the Republic of Poland.\n       (8) Section 233 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417; \n     122 Stat. 4393; 10 U.S.C. 2431 note) establishes conditions \n     for the availability of funds for procurement, construction, \n     and deployment of the planned missile defense system in \n     Europe, including that the host nations must ratify any \n     missile defense agreements with the United States and that \n     the Secretary of Defense must certify that the system has \n     demonstrated the ability to accomplish the mission.\n       (9) On April 5, 2009, President Barack Obama, speaking in \n     Prague, Czech Republic, stated, ``As long as the threat from \n     Iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense \n     system that is cost-effective and proven. If the Iranian \n     threat is eliminated, we will have a stronger basis for \n     security, and the driving force for missile defense \n     construction in Europe will be removed.''.\n       (10) On June 16, 2009, Deputy Secretary of Defense William \n     Lynn testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate that the United States Government is reviewing its \n     options for developing and deploying operationally effective, \n     cost-effective missile defense capabilities to Europe against \n     potential future Iranian missile threats, in addition to the \n     proposed deployment of a missile defense system in Poland and \n     the Czech Republic.\n       (11) On July 9, 2009, General James Cartwright, the Vice \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that the Department \n     of Defense was considering some 40 different missile defense \n     architecture options for Europe that could provide a \n     ``regional defense capability to protect the nations'' of \n     Europe, and a ``redundant capability that would assist in \n     protecting the United States,'' and that the Department was \n     considering ``what kind of an architecture best suits the \n     defense of the region, the defense of the homeland, and the \n     regional stability''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Government should continue developing \n     and planning for the proposed deployment of elements of a \n     Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, including a \n     midcourse radar in the Czech Republic and Ground-Based \n     Interceptors in Poland, consistent with section 233 of the \n     Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2009;\n       (2) in conjunction with the continued development of the \n     planned Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, the United \n     States should work with its North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization allies to explore a range of options and \n     architectures to provide missile defenses for Europe and the \n     United States against current and future Iranian ballistic \n     missile capabilities;\n       (3) any alternative system that the United States \n     Government considers deploying in Europe to provide for the \n     defense of Europe and a redundant defense of the United \n     States against future long-range Iranian missile threats \n     should be at least as capable and cost-effective as the \n     proposed European deployment of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system; and\n       (4) any missile defense capabilities deployed in Europe \n     should, to the extent practical, be interoperable with United \n     States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization missile defense \n     systems.\n       (c) Reservation of Funds for Missile Defense Systems.--\n       (1) In general.--Of the funds authorized to be appropriated \n     or otherwise made available for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 \n     for the Missile Defense Agency for the purpose of developing \n     missile defenses in Europe, $353,100,000 shall be available \n     only for the purposes described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Use of funds.--The purposes described in this paragraph \n     are the following:\n       (A) Research, development, test, and evaluation of--\n       (i) the proposed midcourse radar element of the Ground-\n     based Midcourse Defense system in the Czech Republic;

SENSE OF SENATE ON PREPARATION AND COORDINATION OF \n                   FAMILY CARE PLANS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Family Care Plans provide a military tool to document \n     the plan by which members of the Armed Forces provide for the \n     care of their family members when military duties prevent \n     members of the Armed Forces from doing so themselves. \n     Properly prepared Family Care Plans are essential to military \n     readiness. Minimizing the strain on members of the Armed \n     Forces of unresolved, challenged, or voided child custody \n     arrangements arising during deployments or temporary duty \n     directly contributes to the national defense by enabling \n     members of the Armed Forces to devote their entire energy to \n     their military mission and duties.\n       (2) When Family Care Plans are properly prepared and \n     coordinated with all affected parties, the legal difficulties \n     that may otherwise arise in the absence of the military \n     custodial parent often can be minimized, if not eliminated.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the responsibility for establishing workable and \n     legally supportable Family Care Plans lies with the members \n     of the Armed Forces;\n       (2) notwithstanding that responsibility, commanders \n     should--\n       (A) ensure that the members of their command fully \n     understand the purpose of the Family Care Plan and its \n     limitations, including the overriding authority of State \n     courts to determine child custody arrangements \n     notwithstanding a Family Care Plan;\n       (B) understand and emphasize to their members that failure \n     to involve, or at least inform, the non-custodial parent of \n     custody arrangements in anticipation of an absence can \n     undermine the Family Care Plan or even render it useless, in \n     such cases; and\n       (C) apprise their members of the risks described in \n     subparagraph (B), and strongly encourage them to seek legal \n     assistance, as far in advance of actual absences as \n     practicable;\n       (3) the Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security with respect to matters concerning the Coast Guard \n     when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, should \n     ensure that members of the Armed Forces update their Family \n     Care Plans and emphasize--\n       (A) the importance of prior planning;\n       (B) that Family Care Plans are necessary not only for the \n     single parent and for the dual military couple but also for a \n     married member of the Armed Forces who has custody of a child \n     pursuant to a court order or separation agreement or who has \n     custody of a child whose other parent is not the current \n     spouse of the member;\n       (C) that in spite of how important Family Care Plans are to \n     readiness, they are not legal documents that can change a \n     court-mandated custodial arrangement or interfere with the \n     other parent's right to custody of his or her child;\n       (D) that, to the greatest extent possible, a member of the \n     Armed Forces should inform the other parent of the member's \n     impending absence due to military orders if such absence \n     prohibits the member from fulfilling the member's custody \n     responsibilities and inform that other parent of the Family \n     Care Plan;\n       (E) that a member of the Armed Forces should attempt to \n     obtain the consent of the non-custodial or adoptive parent to \n     any Family Care Plan that would leave the child in the care \n     of a third party; and\n       (F) that if a member of the Armed Forces cannot or will not \n     contact the non-custodial parent or cannot obtain that \n     parent's consent to the Family Care Plan, the commander of \n     the member should--\n       (i) counsel the member about the implications; and\n       (ii) encourage in the strongest possible terms that the \n     member seek immediate help from a legal assistance attorney \n     or other qualified legal counsel; and\n       (4) attorneys providing legal assistance as described in \n     paragraph (3)(F)(ii) should provide members of the Armed \n     Forces a full explanation of the dangers of not involving the \n     non-custodial parent and discuss appropriate courses of \n     action.\n\n     SEC. 557.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Military and Overseas \n     Voter Empowerment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 582. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right to vote is a fundamental right.\n       (2) Due to logistical, geographical, operational and \n     environmental barriers, military and overseas voters are \n     burdened by many obstacles that impact their right to vote \n     and register to vote, the most critical of which include \n     problems transmitting balloting materials and not being given \n     enough time to vote.\n       (3) States play an essential role in facilitating the \n     ability of military and overseas voters to register to vote \n     and have their ballots cast and counted, especially with \n     respect to timing and improvement of absentee voter \n     registration and absentee ballot procedures.\n       (4) The Department of Defense educates military and \n     overseas voters of their rights under the Uniformed and \n     Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act and plays an \n     indispensable role in facilitating the procedural channels \n     that allow military and overseas voters to have their votes \n     count.\n       (5) The local, State, and Federal Government entities \n     involved with getting ballots to military and overseas voters \n     must work in conjunction to provide voter registration \n     services and balloting materials in a secure and expeditious \n     manner.\n\n     SEC. 583.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON HEALTH CARE BENEFITS AND \n                   COSTS FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES AND THEIR \n                   FAMILIES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) Career members of the Armed Forces and their families \n     endure unique and extraordinary demands, and make \n     extraordinary sacrifices, over the course of 20-year to 30-\n     year careers in protecting freedom for all Americans.\n       (2) The nature and extent of these demands and sacrifices \n     are never so evident as in wartime, not only during the \n     current combat operations, but also during the wars of the \n     last 60 years when current retired members of the Armed \n     Forces were on continuous call to go in harm's way when and \n     as needed.\n       (3) A primary benefit of enduring the extraordinary \n     sacrifices inherent in a military career is a range of \n     retirement benefits, including lifetime health benefits, that \n     a grateful Nation provides for those who choose to \n     subordinate their personal life to the national interest for \n     so many years.\n       (4) Currently serving and retired members of the uniformed \n     services and their families and survivors deserve benefits \n     equal to their commitment and service to our Nation.\n       (5) Many employers are curtailing health benefits and \n     shifting costs to their employees, which may result in \n     retired members of the Armed Forces returning to the \n     Department of Defense, and its TRICARE program, for health \n     care benefits during retirement, and contribute to health \n     care cost growth.\n       (6) Defense health costs also expand as a result of \n     service-unique military readiness requirements, wartime \n     requirements, and other necessary requirements that represent \n     the ``cost of business'' for the Department of Defense.\n       (7) While the Department of Defense has made some efforts \n     to contain increases in the cost of the TRICARE program, too \n     many of those efforts have been devoted to shifting a larger \n     share of the costs of benefits under that program to retired \n     members of the Armed Forces who have earned health care \n     benefits in return for a career of military service.\n       (8) In some cases health care providers refuse to accept \n     TRICARE patients because that program pays less than other \n     public and private payors and imposes unique administrative \n     requirements.\n       (9) The Department of Defense records deposits to the \n     Department of Defense Military Retiree Health Care Fund as \n     discretionary costs to the Department in spite of legislation \n     enacted in 2006 that requires such deposits to be made \n     directly from the Treasury of the United States.\n       (10) As a result, annual payments for the future costs of \n     servicemember health care continue to compete with other \n     readiness needs of the Armed Forces.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Department of Defense and the Nation have an \n     obligation to provide health care benefits to retired members \n     of the Armed Forces that equals the quality of their selfless \n     service to our country;\n       (2) past proposals by the Department of Defense to impose \n     substantial fee increases on military beneficiaries have \n     failed to acknowledge properly the findings addressed in \n     subsection (a); and\n       (3) the Department of Defense has many additional options \n     to constrain the growth of health care spending in ways that \n     do not disadvantage retired members of the Armed Forces who \n     participate or seek to participate in the TRICARE program, \n     and should pursue any and all such options rather than \n     seeking large increases for enrollment fees, deductibles, and \n     copayments for such retirees, and their families or \n     survivors, who do participate in that program.\n\n     SEC. 707.

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE INSTITUTE \n                   FOR SECURITY COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security \n     Cooperation was established by section 911 of the Floyd D. \n     Spence National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2001 (as enacted into law by Public Law 106-398; 114 Stat. \n     1654A-226).\n       (2) The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security \n     Cooperation provides professional education and training to \n     military personnel, law enforcement officials, and civilian \n     personnel in support of the democratic principles set forth \n     in the Charter of the Organization of American States. The \n     Institute effectively promotes mutual knowledge, \n     transparency, confidence, and cooperation among participating \n     nations. It also effectively builds strategic partnerships to \n     address the great security challenges in the region while \n     encouraging democratic values, respect for human rights, \n     subordination to civilian authority, and understanding of \n     United States customs and traditions.\n       (3) The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security \n     Cooperation supports the Security Cooperation Guidance of the \n     Secretary of Defense by addressing the building partner \n     capacity education and training needs of the United States \n     Southern Command and the United States Northern Command.\n       (4) In a joint letter, dated April 9, 2009, General \n     Renuart, the Commander of the United States Northern Command, \n     and Admiral Stavridis, the Commander of the United States \n     Southern Command, write ``[t]he outstanding service that \n     WHINSEC provides directly supports the United States Southern \n     Command's and United States Northern Command's strategic \n     objective of fostering lasting partnerships that will ensure \n     security, enhance stability, and enable prosperity throughout \n     the Americas'' and notes that the Institute provides \n     ``culturally-sensitive training, with a strong emphasis on \n     the values of democracy and human rights''.\n       (5) In establishing the Western Hemisphere Institute for \n     Security Cooperation, Congress mandates that participants at \n     the Institute receive a minimum of 8 hours of instruction on \n     human rights, due process, the rule of law, the role of the \n     Armed Forces in a democratic society, and civilian control of \n     the military. Every course devotes at least 10 percent of its \n     course work to democracy, ethics, and human rights issues. \n     The Institute is also required to develop a curriculum that \n     includes leadership development, counterdrug operations, \n     peacekeeping, resource management, and disaster relief \n     planning. In fiscal year 2008, the Institute presented 39 \n     courses and hosted 1,196 students in residence at Fort \n     Benning, Georgia, of whom 292 were police personnel, and \n     trained an additional 280 students through the Mobile \n     Training Team programs of the Institute.\n       (6) Congress mandated the formation of a Federal advisory \n     committee--an oversight committee unique to the Western \n     Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation. It provides \n     recommendations and an independent review of the Institute \n     and its curriculum to ensure the uniform adherence of the \n     Institute to United States law, regulations, and policies. \n     The Board of Visitors of the Institute includes the Chairman \n     and Ranking Member of the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate, the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Committee on \n     Armed Services of the House of Representatives, the Secretary \n     of State, the Commander of the United States Southern \n     Command, the Commander of the United States Northern Command, \n     the Commander of the United States Training and Doctrine \n     Command, and six members designated by the Secretary of \n     Defense. The six members designated by the Secretary of \n     Defense include, to the extent practicable, individuals from \n     academia and the religious and human rights communities. In \n     addition to the 13 members of the Board of Visitors, advisors \n     and subject matter experts assist the Board in areas the \n     Board considers necessary and appropriate.\n       (7) The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security \n     Cooperation operates in accordance with section 8130 of the \n     Department of Defense Appropriations Act, 1999 (Public Law \n     105-262; 112 Stat. 2335) that prohibits United States \n     military assistance to foreign military units that violate \n     human rights, including security assistance programs funded \n     through appropriations available for foreign operations and \n     training programs funded through appropriations made \n     available for the Department of Defense.\n       (8) The Western Hemisphere Institute for Security \n     Cooperation does not select students for participation in its \n     courses. A partner nation nominates students to attend the \n     Institute, and in accordance with the law of the United \n     States and the policies of the Department of Defense and the \n     Department of State, the United States Embassy in such \n     partner nation screens and conducts background checks on such \n     nominees. The vetting process of nominees for participation \n     in the Institute includes a background check by United States \n     embassies in partner nations, as well as checks by the Bureau \n     of Western Hemisphere Affairs and the Bureau of Democracy, \n     Human Rights, and Labor at the Department of State. The \n     Department of State also uses the Abuse Case Evaluation \n     System, a central database that aggregates human rights abuse \n     data into a single, searchable location, to ensure nominees \n     have not been accused of any human rights abuses.\n       (9) The training provided by the Western Hemisphere \n     Institute for Security Cooperation is transparent and the \n     Institute is open to visitors at any time. Visitors are \n     welcome to sit in on classes, talk with students and faculty, \n     and review instructional materials. Every year, the Institute \n     hosts more than a thousand visiting students, faculty, \n     civilian, and military officials.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security \n     Cooperation--\n       (A) offers quality professional military bilingual \n     instruction for military officers and noncommissioned \n     officers that promotes democracy, subordination to civilian \n     authority, and respect for human rights; and\n       (B) is uniquely positioned to support the modernization of \n     Latin America security forces as they work to transcend their \n     own controversial pasts;\n       (2) the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security \n     Cooperation is building partner capacity which enhances \n     regional and global security while encouraging respect for \n     human rights and promoting democratic principles among \n     eligible military personnel, law enforcement officials, and \n     civilians of nations of the Western Hemisphere;\n       (3) the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security \n     Cooperation is an invaluable education and training facility \n     whose curriculum is not duplicated in any of the military \n     departments and is not replaceable by professional military \n     education funded by appropriations for International Military \n     Education and Training (IMET), which education is not \n     conducted in Spanish and does not concentrate on regional \n     challenges; and\n       (4) the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security \n     Cooperation is an essential tool to educate\n\n[[Page S8333]]\n\n     future generations of Latin American leaders and improve \n     United States relationships with partner nations that are \n     working with the United States to promote democracy, \n     prosperity, and stability in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n     SEC. 904.

SENSE OF SENATE ON THE MAINTENANCE OF A 313-SHIP \n                   NAVY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Department of the Navy has a stated requirement for \n     a 313-ship fleet.\n       (2) The Navy can better meet this requirement--\n       (A) by procuring sufficient numbers of new ships; and\n       (B) by ensuring the sound material condition of existing \n     ships that will enable the Navy to utilize them for their \n     full planned service lives.\n       (3) When procuring new classes of ships, the Navy must \n     exercise greater caution than it has exhibited to date in \n     proceeding from one stage of the acquisition cycle to the \n     next before a ship program has achieved a level of maturity \n     that significantly lowers the risk of cost growth and \n     schedule slippage.\n       (4) In retaining existing assets, the Navy can do a much \n     better job of achieving the full planned service lives of \n     ships and extending the service lives of certain ships so as \n     to keep their unique capabilities in the fleet while the Navy \n     takes the time necessary to develop and field next-generation \n     capabilities under a low risk program.\n       (5) The Navy can undertake certain development approaches \n     that can help the Navy control the total costs of ownership \n     of a ship or class of ships, including emphasizing common \n     hull designs, open architecture combat systems, and other \n     common ship systems in order to achieve efficiency in \n     acquiring and supporting various classes of ships.\n       (6) The Navy needs to continue its efforts toward achieving \n     an open architecture for existing combat systems, as this \n     will have great benefit in reducing the costs and risks of \n     fielding new classes of ships, and will yield recurring \n     savings from reducing the costs of buying later ships in a \n     program and reducing life cycle support costs for ships and \n     classes of ships.\n       (7) The Navy can also undertake other measures to acquire \n     new ships and maintain the current fleet with greater \n     efficiency, including--\n       (A) greater use of fixed-price contracts;\n       (B) maximizing competition (or the option of competition) \n     throughout the life cycle of its ships;\n       (C) entering into multiyear contracts when warranted; and\n       (D) employing an incremental approach to developing new \n     technologies.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the Navy should meet its requirement for a 313-ship \n     fleet;\n       (2) the Navy should take greater care to achieve the full \n     planned service life of existing ships and reduce the \n     incidence of early ship decommissioning;\n       (3) the Navy should exercise greater restraint on the \n     acquisition process for ships in order to achieve on-time, \n     on-cost shipbuilding programs; and\n       (4) Congress should support the Navy when it is acting \n     responsibly to undertake measures that can help the Navy \n     achieve the requirement for a 313-ship fleet and maintain a \n     fleet that is adequate to meet the national security needs of \n     the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1014. DESIGNATION OF U.S.S. CONSTITUTION AS AMERICA'S \n                   SHIP OF STATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The 3rd Congress authorized, in the Act entitled ``An \n     Act to Provide a Naval Armament'', approved on March 27, 1794 \n     (1 Stat. 350, Chap. XII), the construction of six frigates as \n     the first ships to be built for the United States Navy.\n       (2) One of the six frigates was built in Boston between \n     1794 and 1797, and is the only one of the original six ships \n     to survive.\n       (3) President George Washington named this frigate \n     ``Constitution'' to represent the Nation's founding document.\n       (4) President Thomas Jefferson, asserting the right of the \n     United States to trade on the high seas, dispatched the \n     frigate Constitution in 1803\n\n[[Page S8336]]\n\n     as the flagship of the Mediterranean Squadron to end the \n     depredations of the Barbary States against United States \n     ships and shipping, which led to a treaty being signed with \n     the Bashaw of Tripoli in the Captain's cabin aboard the \n     frigate Constitution on June 4, 1805.\n       (5) The frigate Constitution, with her defeat of HMS \n     Guerriere, secured the first major victory by the young \n     United States Navy against the Royal Navy during the War of \n     1812, gaining in the process the nickname ``Old Ironsides'', \n     which she has proudly carried since.\n       (6) Congress awarded gold medals to four of the ship's \n     commanding officers (Preble, Hull, Stewart, and Bainbridge), \n     a record unmatched by any other United States Navy vessel.\n       (7) The frigate Constitution emerged from the War of 1812 \n     undefeated, having secured victories over three additional \n     ships of the Royal Navy.\n       (8) As early as May 1815, the frigate Constitution had \n     already been adopted as a symbol of the young Republic, as \n     attested by the [Washington] National Intelligencer which \n     proclaimed, ``Let us keep `Old Ironsides' at home. She has, \n     literally become the Nation's Ship . . . and should thus be \n     preserved . . . in honorable pomp, as a glorious Monument of \n     her own, and our other Naval Victories.''.\n       (9) Rumors in 1830 that ``Old Ironsides,'' an aging \n     frigate, was about to be scrapped resulted in a public uproar \n     demanding that the ship be restored and preserved, spurred by \n     Oliver Wendell Holmes' immortal poem ``Old Ironsides''.\n       (10) ``Old Ironsides'' circumnavigated the world between \n     1844 and 1846, showing the American flag as she searched for \n     future coaling stations that would eventually fuel the steam-\n     powered navy of the United States.\n       (11) The first Pope to set foot on United States sovereign \n     territory was Pius IX onboard the frigate Constitution in \n     1849.\n       (12) ``Old Ironsides'' helped evacuate the United States \n     Naval Academy from Annapolis, Maryland, to Newport, Rhode \n     Island, in 1860 to prevent this esteemed ship from falling \n     into Confederate hands.\n       (13) Congressman John F. ``Honey Fitz'' Fitzgerald \n     introduced legislation in 1896 to return ``Old Ironsides'' \n     from the Portsmouth (New Hampshire) Naval Shipyard, where she \n     was moored pier side and largely forgotten, to Boston for her \n     100th birthday.\n       (14) Thousands of school children contributed pennies \n     between 1925 an 1927 to help fund a much needed restoration \n     for ``Old Ironsides''.\n       (15) Between 1931 and 1934, more than 4,500,000 Americans \n     gained inspiration, at the depth of the Great Depression, by \n     going aboard ``Old Ironsides'' as she was towed to 76 ports \n     on the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts.\n       (16) The 83rd Congress enacted the Act of July 23, 1954 (68 \n     Stat. 527, chapter 565), which directed the Secretary of the \n     Navy to transfer to the States and appropriate commissions \n     four other historic ships then on the Navy inventory, and to \n     repair and equip U.S.S. Constitution, as much as practicable, \n     to her original condition, but not for active service.\n       (17) Queen Elizabeth II paid a formal visit to U.S.S. \n     Constitution in 1976, at the start of her state visit marking \n     the Bicentennial of the United States.\n       (18) The U.S.S. Constitution, in celebration of her \n     bicentennial, returned to sea under sail on July 21, 1997 for \n     the first time since 1881, proudly setting sails purchased by \n     the contributions of thousands of pennies given by school \n     children across the United States.\n       (19) The U.S.S. Constitution is the oldest commissioned \n     warship afloat in the world.\n       (20) The U.S.S. Constitution is a National Historic \n     Landmark.\n       (21) The U.S.S. Constitution continues to perform official, \n     ceremonial duties, including in recent years hosting a \n     congressional dinner honoring the late Senator John Chafee of \n     Rhode Island, a special salute for the dedication of the John \n     Moakley Federal Courthouse, a luncheon honoring British \n     Ambassador Sir David Manning, and a special underway \n     demonstration during which 60 Medal of Honor recipients each \n     received a personal Medal of Honor flag.\n       (22) The U.S.S. Constitution celebrated on October 21, \n     2007, the 210th anniversary of her launching.\n       (23) The U.S.S. Constitution will remain a commissioned \n     ship in the United States Navy, with the Navy retaining \n     control of the ship, its material condition, and its \n     employment.\n       (24) The U.S.S. Constitution's primary mission will remain \n     education and public outreach, and any Ship of State \n     functions will be an adjunct to the ship's primary mission.\n       (b) Designation as America's Ship of State.--\n       (1) In general.--The U.S.S. Constitution is hereby \n     designated as ``America's Ship of State''.\n       (2) References.--The U.S.S. Constitution may be known or \n     referred to as ``America's Ship of State''.\n       (3) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President, Vice President, executive branch officials, \n     and members of Congress should utilize the U.S.S. \n     Constitution for the conducting of pertinent matters of \n     state, such as hosting visiting heads of state, signing \n     legislation relating to the Armed Forces, and signing \n     maritime related treaties.\n       (4) Fee or reimbursement structure for non-department of \n     the navy use.--The Secretary of the Navy shall determine an \n     appropriate fee or reimbursement structure for any non-\n     Department of the Navy entities using the U.S.S. Constitution \n     for Ship of State purposes.\n\n                  Subtitle C--Counter-Drug Activities\n\n     SEC. 1021.

REPORT ON TAIWAN'S AIR FORCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Department of Defense's (DoD) 2009 \n     Annual Report on Military Power of the People's Republic of \n     China, the military balance in the Taiwan Strait has been \n     shifting in China's favor since 2000, marked by the sustained \n     deployment of advanced military equipment to the Chinese \n     military regions opposite Taiwan.\n       (2) Although the DoD's 2002 Report concluded that Taiwan \n     ``has enjoyed dominance of the airspace over the Taiwan \n     Strait for many years,'' the DoD's 2009 Report states this \n     conclusion no longer holds true.\n       (3) China has based 490 combat aircraft (330 fighters and \n     160 bombers) within unrefueled operational range of Taiwan, \n     and has the airfield capacity to expand that number by \n     hundreds. In contrast, Taiwan has 390 combat aircraft (all of \n     which are fighters).\n       (4) Also according to the DoD's 2009 Report, China has \n     continued its build-up of conventional ballistic missiles \n     since 2000, ``building a nascent capacity for conventional \n     short-range ballistic missile (SRBM) strikes against Taiwan \n     into what has become one of China's primary instruments of \n     coercion.'' At this time, China has expanded its SRBM force \n     opposite Taiwan to seven brigades with a total of 1,050 \n     through 1,150 missiles, and is augmenting these forces with \n     conventional medium-range ballistic missiles systems and at \n     least 2 land attack cruise missile variants capable of ground \n     or air launch. Advanced fighters and bombers, combined with \n     enhanced training for nighttime and overwater flights, \n     provide China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) with \n     additional capabilities for regional strike or maritime \n     interdiction operations.\n       (5) Furthermore, the Report maintains, ``the security \n     situation in the Taiwan Strait is largely a function of \n     dynamic interactions among Mainland China, Taiwan, and the \n     United States. The PLA has developed and deployed military \n     capability to coerce Taiwan or attempt an invasion if \n     necessary. PLA improvements pose new challenges to Taiwan's \n     security, which has historically been based upon the PLA's \n     inability to project power across the 100 nautical-mile \n     Taiwan Strait, natural geographic advantages of island \n     defense, Taiwan's armed forces' technological superiority, \n     and the possibility of U.S. intervention''.\n       (6) The Taiwan Relations Act of 1979 requires that, in \n     furtherance of the principle of maintaining peace and \n     stability in the Western Pacific region, the United States \n     shall make available to Taiwan such defense articles and \n     defense services in such quantity ``as may be necessary to \n     enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self-defense \n     capability,'' allowing that ``the President and the Congress \n     shall determine the nature and quantity of such defense \n     articles and services based solely upon their judgment of the \n     needs of Taiwan . . .''.\n       (b) Report to Congress on Taiwan's Current Air Force and \n     Future Self-Defense Requirements.--Not later than 90 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President \n     shall submit to Congress a report, in both classified and \n     unclassified form, containing the following:\n       (1) A thorough and complete assessment of the current state \n     of Taiwan's Air Force, including--\n       (A) the number and type of aircraft;\n       (B) the age of aircraft; and\n       (C) the capability of those aircraft.\n       (2) An assessment of the effectiveness of the aircraft in \n     the face of a full-scale concerted missile and air campaign \n     by China, in which China uses its most modern surface-to-air \n     missiles currently deployed along its seacoast.\n       (3) An analysis of the specific weapons systems and \n     platforms that Taiwan would need to provide for it's self-\n     defense and maintain control of its own air space.\n       (4) Options for the United States to assist Taiwan in \n     achieving those capabilities.\n       (5) A 5-year plan for fulfilling the obligations of the \n     United States under the Taiwan Relations Act to provide for \n     Taiwan's self-defense and aid Taiwan in maintaining control \n     of its own air space.\n\n     SEC. 1227.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ESTABLISHMENT OF MEASURES OF \n                   PROGRESS TO EVALUATE UNITED STATES STRATEGIC \n                   OBJECTIVES IN AFGHANISTAN AND PAKISTAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The President announced a new strategy for Afghanistan \n     and Pakistan on March 27, 2009, that calls for a commitment \n     of more resources and a significant increase in the number of \n     United States Armed Forces deployed to the region.\n       (2) It is the obligation of the United States Government to \n     the members of the Armed Forces, and to all Americans, that \n     their sacrifices be met by a clear method for evaluating the \n     progress toward achieving the objectives in the new strategy \n     of the Administration.\n       (3) The President stated, with reference to the strategy \n     for Afghanistan and Pakistan, that ``going forward, we will \n     not blindly stay the course. Instead, we will set clear \n     metrics to measure progress and hold ourselves accountable. \n     We'll consistently assess our efforts to train Afghan \n     security forces and our progress in combating insurgents. We \n     will measure the growth of Afghanistan's economy, and its \n     illicit narcotics production. And we will review whether we \n     are using the right tools and tactics to make progress \n     towards accomplishing our goals''.\n       (4) Since the announcement of the new strategy of the \n     Administration on March 27, 2009, key leaders in the \n     Administration, including in the Department of Defense and \n     Department of State, have testified before Congress that \n     progress measures were needed to evaluate performance toward \n     achieving the strategic objectives of the United States in \n     Afghanistan and Pakistan and that the Administration was \n     undertaking the process of reviewing and developing measures \n     of progress.\n       (5) Key leaders in the Administration further assured \n     Congress that the Administration would not only share the \n     measures of progress with Congress, but would also invite \n     review and comment by Congress on proposed measures of \n     progress.\n       (6) The establishment of both clear objectives and a means \n     to impartially measure success toward those objectives will \n     expound to the American people what the United States and its \n     partners intend to accomplish in and for Afghanistan and \n     Pakistan.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the Administration should, through the coordination of \n     the Departments of Defense and State, expeditiously submit to \n     Congress a comprehensive list of measures of progress with \n     regard to United States strategic objectives in Afghanistan \n     and Pakistan;\n       (2) the comprehensive list under paragraph (1) should \n     include newly-established measures of progress as well as \n     such measures of progress previously established pursuant to \n     section 1230(d) of the National Defense Authorization Act for \n     Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181; 122 Stat. 385) that \n     continue to be relevant to the current United States strategy \n     for Afghanistan and Pakistan;\n       (3) the Administration should incorporate the comprehensive \n     list under paragraph (1) with each report submitted under \n     sections 1230 and 1232 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2008 (122 Stat. 385, 392) and should \n     review, and if necessary modify, the comprehensive list for \n     each such report; and\n       (4) upon submittal to Congress of the reports required by \n     sections 1230 and 1232 of the National Defense Authorization \n     Act for Fiscal Year 2008, the Administration should provide \n     an assessment of each measure of progress by--\n       (A) setting forth the measure of progress being evaluated;\n       (B) providing data used to evaluate the measure of \n     progress;\n       (C) providing an evaluation of the performance of the \n     particular measure of progress; and\n       (D) providing a comprehensive assessment of how the \n     performance of the particular measure of progress hinders or \n     enhances the overall performance toward achieving strategic \n     objectives of the United States in Afghanistan and Pakistan.\n\n     SEC. 1232. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON IMPOSING SANCTIONS WITH \n                   RESPECT TO THE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) The illicit nuclear activities of the Government of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran, combined with its development of \n     unconventional weapons and ballistic missiles and support for \n     international terrorism, represent a grave threat to the \n     security of the United States and United States allies in \n     Europe, the Middle East, and around the world.\n       (2) The United States and other responsible countries have \n     a vital interest in working together to prevent the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran from acquiring a \n     nuclear weapons capability.\n       (3) As President Barack Obama said, ``Iran obtaining a \n     nuclear weapon would not only be a threat to Israel and a \n     threat to the United States, but would be profoundly \n     destabilizing in the international community as a whole and \n     could set off a nuclear arms race in the Middle East that \n     would be extraordinarily dangerous for all concerned, \n     including for Iran.''.\n       (4) The International Atomic Energy Agency has repeatedly \n     called attention to the illicit nuclear activities of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran, and, as a result, the United \n     Nations Security Council has adopted a range of sanctions \n     designed to encourage the Government of the Islamic Republic \n     of Iran to cease those activities and comply with its \n     obligations under the Treaty on Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \n     Weapons, done at Washington, London, and Moscow July 1, 1968, \n     and entered into force March 5, 1970 (commonly known as the \n     ``Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty'').\n       (5) The Department of the Treasury has imposed sanctions on \n     several Iranian banks, including Bank Melli, Bank Saderat, \n     Bank Sepah, and Bank Mellat, for their involvement in \n     proliferation activities or support for terrorist groups.\n       (6) The Central Bank of Iran, the keystone of Iran's \n     financial system and its principal remaining lifeline to the \n     international banking system, has engaged in deceptive \n     financial practices and\n\n[[Page S8363]]\n\n     facilitated such practices among banks involved in \n     proliferation activities or support for terrorist groups, \n     including Bank Sepah and Bank Melli, in order to evade \n     sanctions imposed by the United States and the United \n     Nations.\n       (7) On April 8, 2009, the United States formally extended \n     an offer to engage in direct diplomacy with the Government of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran through negotiations with the \n     five permanent members of the United States Security Council \n     and Germany (commonly referred to as the ``P5-plus-1 \n     process''), in the hope of resolving all outstanding disputes \n     between the Islamic Republic of Iran and the United States.\n       (8) The Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has yet \n     to make a formal reply to the April 8, 2009, offer of direct \n     diplomacy by the United States or to engage in direct \n     diplomacy with the United States through the P5-plus-1 \n     process.\n       (9) On July 8, 2009, President Nicolas Sarkozy of France \n     warned that the Group of Eight major powers will give the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran until September 2009 to accept \n     negotiations with respect to its nuclear activities or face \n     tougher sanctions.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran should--\n       (A) seize the historic offer put forward by President \n     Barack Obama to engage in direct diplomacy with the United \n     States;\n       (B) suspend all enrichment-related and reprocessing \n     activities, including research and development, and work on \n     all heavy-water related projects, including the construction \n     of a research reactor moderated by heavy water, as demanded \n     by multiple resolutions of the United Nations Security \n     Council; and\n       (C) come into full compliance with the Nuclear Non-\n     Proliferation Treaty, including the additional protocol to \n     the Treaty; and\n       (2) the President should impose sanctions on the Central \n     Bank of Iran and any other Iranian bank engaged in \n     proliferation activities or support for terrorist groups, as \n     well as any other sanctions the President determines \n     appropriate, if--\n       (A) the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran--\n       (i) has not accepted the offer by the United States to \n     engage in direct diplomacy through the P5-plus-1 process \n     before the Summit of the Group of 20 (G-20) in Pittsburgh, \n     Pennsylvania, in September 2009; or\n       (ii) has not suspended all enrichment-related and \n     reprocessing activities and work on all heavy-water related \n     projects within 60 days of the conclusion of that Summit; and\n       (B) the United Nations Security Council has failed to adopt \n     significant and meaningful additional sanctions on the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran.\n\n     SEC. 1233. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ENFORCEMENT AND IMPOSITION \n                   OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA; \n                   REVIEW TO DETERMINE WHETHER NORTH KOREA SHOULD \n                   BE RE-LISTED AS A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On April 5, 2009, the Government of North Korea tested \n     an intermediate range ballistic missile in violation of \n     United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1695 (2006) and \n     1718 (2006).\n       (2) On April 5, 2009, President Barack Obama issued a \n     statement on North Korea, stating that ``Preventing the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means \n     of delivery is a high priority for my administration'', and \n     adding, ``North Korea has ignored its international \n     obligations, rejected unequivocal calls for restraint, and \n     further isolated itself from the community of nations''.\n       (3) On April 15, 2009, the Government of North Korea \n     announced it was expelling international inspectors from its \n     Yongbyon nuclear facility and ending its participation in the \n     Six Party Talks for the Denuclearization of the Korean \n     Peninsula.\n       (4) On May 25, 2009, the Government of North Korea \n     conducted a second nuclear test, in disregard of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, which was issued in \n     2006 following the first such test and which demanded that \n     North Korea not conduct any further nuclear tests or launches \n     of a ballistic missile.\n       (5) The State Department's 2008 Human Rights Report on \n     North Korea, issued on February 25, 2009, found that human \n     rights conditions inside North Korea remained poor, prison \n     conditions are harsh and life-threatening, and citizens were \n     denied basic freedoms such as freedom of speech, press, \n     assembly, religion, and association.\n       (6) Pursuant to section 102(b)(2)(E) of the Arms Export \n     Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2799aa-1(b)(2)(E)), President George \n     W. Bush, on February 7, 2007, notified Congress that the \n     United States Government would oppose the extension of any \n     loan or financial or technical assistance to North Korea by \n     any international financial institution and the prohibition \n     on support for the extension of such loans or assistance \n     remains in effect.\n       (7) On June 12, 2009, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Resolution 1874, condemning North Korea's nuclear \n     test, imposing a sweeping embargo on all arms trade with \n     North Korea, and requiring member states not to provide \n     financial support or other financial services that could \n     contribute to North Korea's nuclear-related or missile-\n     related activities or other activities related to weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       (8) On July 15, 2009, the Sanctions Committee of the United \n     Nations Security Council, pursuant to United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1874, imposed a travel ban on five North \n     Korean individuals and asset freezes on five more North \n     Korean entities for their involvement in nuclear weapons and \n     ballistic missile development programs, marking the first \n     time the United Nations has imposed a travel ban on North \n     Koreans.\n       (9) On June 10, 2008, the Government of North Korea issued \n     a statement, subsequently conveyed directly to the United \n     States Government, affirming that North Korea, ``will firmly \n     maintain its consistent stand of opposing all forms of \n     terrorism and any support to it and will fulfill its \n     responsibility and duty in the struggle against terrorism.''.\n       (10) The June 10, 2008, statement by the Government of \n     North Korea also pledged that North Korea would take ``active \n     part in the international efforts to prevent substance, \n     equipment and technology to be used for the production of \n     nukes and biochemical and radioactive weapons from finding \n     their ways to the terrorists and the organizations that \n     support them''.\n       (11) On June 26, 2008, President George W. Bush certified \n     that--\n       (A) the Government of North Korea had not provided any \n     support for international terrorism during the preceding 6-\n     month period; and\n       (B) the Government of North Korea had provided assurances \n     that it will not support acts of international terrorism in \n     the future.\n       (12) The President's June 26 certification concluded, based \n     on all available information, that there was ``no credible \n     evidence at this time of ongoing support by the DPRK for \n     international terrorism'' and that ``there is no credible or \n     sustained reporting at this time that supports allegations \n     (including as cited in recent reports by the Congressional \n     Research Service) that the DPRK has provided direct or \n     witting support for Hezbollah, Tamil Tigers, or the Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guard''.\n       (13) The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism \n     2008, in a section on North Korea, state, ``The Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was not known to have \n     sponsored any terrorist acts since the bombing of a Korean \n     Airlines flight in 1987.''.\n       (14) The Country Reports on Terrorism 2008 also state, ``A \n     state that directs WMD resources to terrorists, or one from \n     which enabling resources are clandestinely diverted, poses a \n     grave WMD terrorism threat. Although terrorist organizations \n     will continue to seek a WMD capability independent of state \n     programs, the sophisticated WMD knowledge and resources of a \n     state could enable a terrorist capability. State sponsors of \n     terrorism and all nations that fail to live up to their \n     international counterterrorism and nonproliferation \n     obligations deserve greater scrutiny as potential \n     facilitators of WMD terrorism.''.\n       (15) On October 11, 2008, the Secretary of State, pursuant \n     to the President's certification, removed North Korea from \n     its list of state sponsors of terrorism, on which North Korea \n     had been placed in 1988.\n       (b) Report on Conduct of North Korea.--Not later than 30 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall submit to Congress a detailed report \n     examining the conduct of the Government of North Korea since \n     June 26, 2008, based on all available information, to \n     determine whether North Korea meets the statutory criteria \n     for listing as a state sponsor of terrorism. The report \n     shall--\n       (1) present any credible evidence of support by the \n     Government of North Korea for acts of terrorism, terrorists, \n     or terrorist organizations;\n       (2) examine what steps the Government of North Korea has \n     taken to fulfill its June 10, 2008, pledge to prevent weapons \n     of mass destruction from falling into the hands of \n     terrorists; and\n       (3) assess the effectiveness of re-listing North Korea as a \n     state sponsor of terrorism as a tool to accomplish the \n     objectives of the United States with respect to North Korea, \n     including completely eliminating North Korea's nuclear \n     weapons programs, preventing North Korean proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction, and encouraging North Korea to \n     abide by international norms with respect to human rights.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should--\n       (A) vigorously enforce United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009) and other sanctions \n     in place with respect to North Korea under United States law;\n       (B) urge all member states of the United Nations to fully \n     implement the sanctions imposed by United Nations Security \n     Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874; and\n       (C) explore the imposition of additional unilateral and \n     multilateral sanctions against North Korea in furtherance of \n     United States national security;\n       (2) the conduct of North Korea constitutes a threat to the \n     northeast Asian region and to international peace and \n     security;\n       (3) if the United States determines that the Government of \n     North Korea has provided assistance to terrorists or engaged \n     in state sponsored acts of terrorism, the Secretary of State \n     should immediately list North Korea as a state sponsor of \n     terrorism; and\n       (4) if the United States determines that the Government of \n     North Korea has failed to fulfill its June 10, 2008, pledges, \n     the Secretary of State should immediately list North Korea as \n     a state sponsor of terrorism.\n       (d) State Sponsor of Terrorism Defined.--For purposes of \n     this section, the term ``state sponsor of terrorism'' means a \n     country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism for purposes of--\n       (1) section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 \n     (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)) (as continued in effect pursuant to \n     the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. \n     1701 et seq.));\n       (2) section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. \n     2780); or\n       (3) section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2371).\n\n[[Page S8364]]\n\n     SEC. 1234.

This discussion will also include whether the use of \n     different authorities, procedures, and guidelines has \n     resulted in disparate monetary assistance to civilian foreign \n     nationals who have incurred substantially similar harm, and \n     if so, the frequency and effect of such results.\n       (6) A discussion of the positive and negative effects of \n     establishing general uniform procedures and guidelines for \n     the provision of such assistance, based upon the goals of \n     timely commencement of a program of monetary assistance, \n     efficient and effective implementation of such program, and \n     consistency in the amount of assistance in relation to the \n     harm incurred.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON PRODUCTION OF MOLYBDENUM-\n                   99.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are fewer than five reactors around the world \n     currently capable of producing molybdenum-99 (Mo-99) and \n     there are no such reactors in the United States that can \n     provide a reliable supply of Mo-99 to meet medical needs.\n       (2) Since November 2007, there have been major disruptions \n     in the global availability of Mo-99, including at facilities \n     in Canada and the Netherlands, which have led to shortages of \n     Mo-99-based medical products in the United States and around \n     the world.\n       (3) Ensuring a reliable supply of medical radioisotopes, \n     including Mo-99, is of great importance to the public health.\n       (4) It is also a national security priority of the United \n     States, and specifically of the Department of Energy, to \n     encourage the production of low-enriched uranium-based \n     radioisotopes in order to promote a more peaceful \n     international nuclear order.\n       (5) The National Academy of Sciences has identified a need \n     to establish a reliable capability in the United States for \n     the production of Mo-99 and its derivatives for medical \n     purposes using low-enriched uranium.\n       (6) There also exists a capable industrial base in the \n     United States that can support the development of Mo-99 \n     production facilities and can conduct the processing and \n     distribution of radiopharmaceutical products for use in \n     medical tests worldwide.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) radioisotopes and radiopharmaceuticals, including Mo-99 \n     and its derivatives, are essential components of medical \n     tests that help diagnose and treat life-threatening diseases \n     affecting millions of people each year; and\n       (2) the Secretary of Energy should continue and expand a \n     program to meet the need identified by the National Academy \n     of Sciences to ensure a source of Mo-99 and its derivatives \n     for use in medical tests to help ensure the health security \n     of the United States and around the world and promote \n     peaceful nuclear industries through the use of low-enriched \n     uranium.\n\n          TITLE XXXII--DEFENSE NUCLEAR FACILITIES SAFETY BOARD\n\n     SEC. 3201.

SEC. 4701. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This division may be cited as the ``Matthew Shepard Hate \n     Crimes Prevention Act''.\n\n     SEC. 4702. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The incidence of violence motivated by the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the \n     victim poses a serious national problem.\n       (2) Such violence disrupts the tranquility and safety of \n     communities and is deeply divisive.\n       (3) State and local authorities are now and will continue \n     to be responsible for prosecuting the overwhelming majority \n     of violent crimes in the United States, including violent \n     crimes motivated by bias. These authorities can carry out \n     their responsibilities more effectively with greater Federal \n     assistance.\n       (4) Existing Federal law is inadequate to address this \n     problem.\n       (5) A prominent characteristic of a violent crime motivated \n     by bias is that it devastates not just the actual victim and \n     the family and friends of the victim, but frequently savages \n     the community sharing the traits that caused the victim to be \n     selected.\n       (6) Such violence substantially affects interstate commerce \n     in many ways, including the following:\n       (A) The movement of members of targeted groups is impeded, \n     and members of such groups are forced to move across State \n     lines to escape the incidence or risk of such violence.\n       (B) Members of targeted groups are prevented from \n     purchasing goods and services, obtaining or sustaining \n     employment, or participating in other commercial activity.\n       (C) Perpetrators cross State lines to commit such violence.\n       (D) Channels, facilities, and instrumentalities of \n     interstate commerce are used to facilitate the commission of \n     such violence.\n       (E) Such violence is committed using articles that have \n     traveled in interstate commerce.\n\n[[Page S8490]]\n\n       (7) For generations, the institutions of slavery and \n     involuntary servitude were defined by the race, color, and \n     ancestry of those held in bondage. Slavery and involuntary \n     servitude were enforced, both prior to and after the adoption \n     of the 13th amendment to the Constitution of the United \n     States, through widespread public and private violence \n     directed at persons because of their race, color, or \n     ancestry, or perceived race, color, or ancestry. Accordingly, \n     eliminating racially motivated violence is an important means \n     of eliminating, to the extent possible, the badges, \n     incidents, and relics of slavery and involuntary servitude.\n       (8) Both at the time when the 13th, 14th, and 15th \n     amendments to the Constitution of the United States were \n     adopted, and continuing to date, members of certain religious \n     and national origin groups were and are perceived to be \n     distinct ``races''. Thus, in order to eliminate, to the \n     extent possible, the badges, incidents, and relics of \n     slavery, it is necessary to prohibit assaults on the basis of \n     real or perceived religions or national origins, at least to \n     the extent such religions or national origins were regarded \n     as races at the time of the adoption of the 13th, 14th, and \n     15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n       (9) Federal jurisdiction over certain violent crimes \n     motivated by bias enables Federal, State, and local \n     authorities to work together as partners in the investigation \n     and prosecution of such crimes.\n       (10) The problem of crimes motivated by bias is \n     sufficiently serious, widespread, and interstate in nature as \n     to warrant Federal assistance to States, local jurisdictions, \n     and Indian tribes.\n\n     SEC. 4703. DEFINITION OF HATE CRIME.\n\n       In this division--\n       (1) the term ``crime of violence'' has the meaning given \n     that term in section 16, title 18, United States Code;\n       (2) the term ``hate crime'' has the meaning given such term \n     in section 280003(a) of the Violent Crime Control and Law \n     Enforcement Act of 1994 (28 U.S.C. 994 note); and\n       (3) the term ``local'' means a county, city, town, \n     township, parish, village, or other general purpose political \n     subdivision of a State.\n\n     SEC. 4704. SUPPORT FOR CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS AND \n                   PROSECUTIONS BY STATE, LOCAL, AND TRIBAL LAW \n                   ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.\n\n       (a) Assistance Other Than Financial Assistance.--\n       (1) In general.--At the request of State, local, or tribal \n     law enforcement agency, the Attorney General may provide \n     technical, forensic, prosecutorial, or any other form of \n     assistance in the criminal investigation or prosecution of \n     any crime that--\n       (A) constitutes a crime of violence;\n       (B) constitutes a felony under the State, local, or tribal \n     laws; and\n       (C) is motivated by prejudice based on the actual or \n     perceived race, color, religion, national origin, gender, \n     sexual orientation, gender identity, or disability of the \n     victim, or is a violation of the State, local, or tribal hate \n     crime laws.\n       (2) Priority.--In providing assistance under paragraph (1), \n     the Attorney General shall give priority to crimes committed \n     by offenders who have committed crimes in more than one State \n     and to rural jurisdictions that have difficulty covering the \n     extraordinary expenses relating to the investigation or \n     prosecution of the crime.\n       (b) Grants.--\n       (1) In general.--The Attorney General may award grants to \n     State, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies for \n     extraordinary expenses associated with the investigation and \n     prosecution of hate crimes.\n       (2) Office of justice programs.--In implementing the grant \n     program under this subsection, the Office of Justice Programs \n     shall work closely with grantees to ensure that the concerns \n     and needs of all affected parties, including community groups \n     and schools, colleges, and universities, are addressed \n     through the local infrastructure developed under the grants.\n       (3) Application.--\n       (A) In general.--Each State, local, and tribal law \n     enforcement agency that desires a grant under this subsection \n     shall submit an application to the Attorney General at such \n     time, in such manner, and accompanied by or containing such \n     information as the Attorney General shall reasonably require.\n       (B) Date for submission.--Applications submitted pursuant \n     to subparagraph (A) shall be submitted during the 60-day \n     period beginning on a date that the Attorney General shall \n     prescribe.\n       (C) Requirements.--A State, local, and tribal law \n     enforcement agency applying for a grant under this subsection \n     shall--\n       (i) describe the extraordinary purposes for which the grant \n     is needed;\n       (ii) certify that the State, local government, or Indian \n     tribe lacks the resources necessary to investigate or \n     prosecute the hate crime;\n       (iii) demonstrate that, in developing a plan to implement \n     the grant, the State, local, and tribal law enforcement \n     agency has consulted and coordinated with nonprofit, \n     nongovernmental victim services programs that have experience \n     in providing services to victims of hate crimes; and\n       (iv) certify that any Federal funds received under this \n     subsection will be used to supplement, not supplant, non-\n     Federal funds that would otherwise be available for \n     activities funded under this subsection.\n       (4) Deadline.--An application for a grant under this \n     subsection shall be approved or denied by the Attorney \n     General not later than 180 business days after the date on \n     which the Attorney General receives the application.\n       (5) Grant amount.--A grant under this subsection shall not \n     exceed $100,000 for any single jurisdiction in any 1-year \n     period.\n       (6) Report.--Not later than December 31, 2010, the Attorney \n     General shall submit to Congress a report describing the \n     applications submitted for grants under this subsection, the \n     award of such grants, and the purposes for which the grant \n     amounts were expended.\n       (7) Authorization of appropriations.--There is authorized \n     to be appropriated to carry out this subsection $5,000,000 \n     for each of fiscal years 2010 and 2011.\n\n     SEC. 4705. GRANT PROGRAM.\n\n       (a) Authority To Award Grants.--The Office of Justice \n     Programs of the Department of Justice may award grants, in \n     accordance with such regulations as the Attorney General may \n     prescribe, to State, local, or tribal programs designed to \n     combat hate crimes committed by juveniles, including programs \n     to train local law enforcement officers in identifying, \n     investigating, prosecuting, and preventing hate crimes.\n       (b) Authorization of Appropriations.--There are authorized \n     to be appropriated such sums as may be necessary to carry out \n     this section.\n\n     SEC. 4706. AUTHORIZATION FOR ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO ASSIST \n                   STATE, LOCAL, AND TRIBAL LAW ENFORCEMENT.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated to the Department \n     of Justice, including the Community Relations Service, for \n     fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012 such sums as are necessary \n     to increase the number of personnel to prevent and respond to \n     alleged violations of section 249 of title 18, United States \n     Code, as added by section 4707 of this division.\n\n     SEC. 4707.

Res. 228) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 228\n\n       Whereas direct support workers, direct care workers, \n     personal assistants, personal attendants, in-home support \n     workers, and paraprofessionals (referred to in this preamble \n     as ``direct support professionals'') are the primary \n     providers of publicly funded long term support and services \n     for millions of individuals;\n       Whereas a direct support professional must build a close, \n     trusted relationship with an individual with disabilities;\n       Whereas a direct support professional assists an individual \n     with disabilities with the most intimate needs, on a daily \n     basis;\n       Whereas direct support professionals provide a broad range \n     of support, including--\n       (1) preparation of meals;\n       (2) helping with medications;\n       (3) bathing;\n       (4) dressing;\n       (5) mobility;\n       (6) getting to school, work, religious, and recreational \n     activities; and\n       (7) general daily affairs;\n\n       Whereas a direct support professional provides essential \n     support to help keep an individual with disabilities \n     connected to the family and community of the individual;\n       Whereas direct support professionals enable individuals \n     with disabilities to live meaningful, productive lives;\n       Whereas direct support professionals are the key to \n     allowing an individual with disabilities to live successfully \n     in the community of the individual, and to avoid more costly \n     institutional care;\n       Whereas the majority of direct support professionals are \n     female, and many are the sole breadwinners of their families;\n       Whereas direct support professionals work and pay taxes, \n     but many remain impoverished and are eligible for the same \n     Federal and State public assistance programs on which the \n     individuals with disabilities served by the direct support \n     professionals must depend;\n       Whereas Federal and State policies, as well as the Supreme \n     Court, in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), assert the \n     right of an individual to live in the home and community of \n     the individual;\n       Whereas, in 2008, the majority of direct support \n     professionals are employed in home and community-based \n     settings and this trend is projected to increase over the \n     next decade;\n       Whereas there is a documented critical and growing shortage \n     of direct support professionals in every community throughout \n     the United States; and\n       Whereas many direct support professionals are forced to \n     leave jobs due to inadequate wages and benefits, creating \n     high turnover and vacancy rates that research demonstrates \n     adversely affects the quality of support to individuals with \n     disabilities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning September 14, 2009, as \n     ``National Direct Support Professionals Recognition Week'';\n       (2) recognizes the dedication and vital role of direct \n     support professionals in enhancing the lives of individuals \n     with disabilities of all ages;\n       (3) appreciates the contribution of direct support \n     professionals in supporting the needs that reach beyond the \n     capacities of millions of families in the United States;\n       (4) commends direct support professionals as integral in \n     supporting the long-term support and services system of the \n     United States; and\n       (5) finds that the successful implementation of the public \n     policies of the United States depends on the dedication of \n     direct support professionals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/29/senate-section/article/S8499-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8499-S8500]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WEEK\n\n  Mr. BROWN.
