Mr. President, following leader remarks, we will be in a \nperiod for the transaction of morning business for an hour. Senators \nwill be allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes each. Republicans will \ncontrol the first half and the majority will control the second 30 \nminutes. Following morning business, the Senate will resume \nconsideration of the motion to proceed to the Travel Promotion Act \npostcloture. Following adoption of the motion to proceed to the travel \nbill later this afternoon, we will turn to the emergency supplemental \nappropriations conference report.\n  I am disappointed that we are again wasting time on a heavily \nbipartisan bill, the Travel Promotion Act, which has wide support by \nboth the Democrats and Republicans. But the Republicans forced us to \nhave a vote on cloture to allow us to get on the bill. All the \nRepublicans voted for it. They are filibustering things they even agree \nwith just to stall for time. This is 30 hours we could use to do a lot \nof good. I don't know what would be the rationale for wasting this \ntime. Maybe they don't want President Obama to complete more \nlegislation through us. It is beyond my ability to comprehend why we \nwould waste this time.\n  It has been written and talked about that this is the most \naccomplished Congress since the first year of the Roosevelt \nadministration. I don't have before me all the legislation we have \ndone, but I am going to try to recall some of the things we have done.\n  We passed the lands bill, the most significant environmental \nlegislation in more than a quarter of a century, creating more than 2 \nmillion acres of wilderness, 1,000 miles of scenic rivers, hundreds of \nmiles of trails, and many other good things in this very important \nlegislation.\n  We passed the Lilly Ledbetter legislation equalizing pay between men \nand women.\n  We passed the Children's Health Insurance Program which had been \nvetoed by President Bush on several occasions. Now more than 14 million \nchildren can go to the doctor when they are sick or hurt.\n  We passed the economic recovery package. Twenty-five percent of that \nmoney is out. The rest is coming.\n  We passed the omnibus spending bill--very important legislation which \nhad been held up by the Bush administration. We spent $1.2 trillion of \nthe people's money within a period of 3 weeks. Why did we do that? We \ndid it because Mark Zandi, among others, Senator McCain's chief \neconomic adviser, Republican economists, and Democratic economists told \nus we had to do this to stop a worldwide depression, and we have done \nthat. As Chairman Bernanke said, the crops have been planted and the \nshoots are now appearing out of the ground.\n  We went on to pass a procurement bill--extremely important--to rein \nin the excessive expenses of what has taken place in years past with \nthe Pentagon, overspending money we give them; that is, something is \nsupposed to cost this much and winds up costing twice as much.\n  We were able to pass national service legislation, allowing 750,000 \npeople in America to be involved in public service, dealing with the \nenvironment, health care, the poor. During the 7,000 hours they \nvolunteer, they get a small stipend. When they finish, they get an \namount of money to help with their college education.\n\n[[Page S6670]]\n\n  Credit card legislation--so important--we finally were able to do it. \nAfter years of talking about doing it, we did it to stop the ripoffs of \nthese credit card companies and what they were doing to hurt \nAmericans--all Americans.\n  We passed tobacco legislation. I can remember, when I was working in \nthe Capitol of the United States going to law school, the Surgeon \nGeneral came out with the first report that smoking was bad for you. \nSome people thought that was the case, but the Surgeon General of the \nUnited States said it will kill you. We have been trying ever since \nthen to get control of tobacco. After all these years, we did it.\n  We have been able to work on other important pieces of legislation--\nfinancial fraud, reported out of the Judiciary Committee, which stops \nscams taking place on people who are about to begin foreclosure, taking \nadvantage of people who are in a time of distress. We passed a lot of \nhousing legislation that is important to allow people to stay in their \nhomes. Have we stopped it all? Of course not. But we have done a pretty \ngood job at that.\n  We are now arriving at a point where we are going to pass the \nsupplemental appropriations bill, which is very important, to fund our \ntroops. This is the last time we will have to do this because President \nObama is honest with his budgeting. The cost of the war is in his \nbudget. It was never in President Bush's budget. For the 8 years he was \nPresident, he never put it in his budget. We had to come back and do \nsupplemental emergency appropriations bills to fund our troops.\n  It is interesting to note, all but five Republicans in the House of \nRepresentatives voted against funding the troops yesterday. It will be \ninteresting to see what happens here. Are my Republican colleagues \ngoing to join with us to fund the troops? I think so. I certainly hope \nso.\n  We have accomplished a lot more than what I have just outlined, but \nwe have done it by reaching out to the Republicans. We have not gotten \na lot of help from the Republicans, but we have gotten enough to pass \nbills. For example, on the economic recovery package, we needed 2, and \nneither one of the 2 would be the 60th vote, so we had to get 3, and we \ngot 3. I appreciate very much the courage of Senators Specter, Snowe, \nand Collins in doing that. It was good for their States and good for \nour country. We have reached out to the Republicans time and time \nagain.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6670-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE DEBATE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we began this year dedicated to delivering \nthe change the American people demanded in November. We began this \nCongress committed to making life better for the middle class, for \nhard-working families who play by the rules. But the American people \nalso demanded something more. They said that we, their leaders, should \nnot be unwilling to work together. The challenges we face have left no \none unscathed. We are all in this hole together, and the only way we \nclimb out of this hole is by doing so together.\n  When the American people spoke last year, they gave us, above all, a \nmandate for bipartisanship. It was in that spirit that I wrote my \nRepublican colleagues this spring. In that letter, I said one of the \nbest ways to lift our economy is to keep down health care costs. Almost \n50 million Americans have no health care, and the problem grows worse \nevery day.\n  Every day, more Americans go bankrupt or lose their homes just trying \nto stay healthy. Even those fortunate enough to have insurance pay a \nhidden tax for those who do not. What does that mean? It means 50 \nmillion people, when they get sick or hurt, go to the nearest emergency \nroom. That emergency room may be across the street or 50 miles from \nwhere they are, but that is where they go. That increases the cost of \nevery one of our health insurance policies, it increases the cost of \nthe doctor bills we get, the hospital bills we get, and indigent taxes. \nIf your family has health care, you pay at least $1,000 more than you \nwould if all other families had health care.\n  In that letter, I expressed my sincere hope that Republicans would \nwork with us to respond to this emergency. I extended my hand. I asked \nfor their help. Although I knew we would disagree at times, I told them \nI looked forward to an open and honest dialog about how to help \nstruggling Americans.\n  In this letter, I especially asked Republican colleagues to focus on \nthe concrete and critical crisis that affects children, families, and \nsmall businesses every day--a parent cannot take a child to a doctor \nbecause insurance does not exist or is prohibitively expensive; a \nfamily lives one accident or illness away from financial ruin; small \nbusinesses lay off employees because they cannot afford skyrocketing \nhealth care premiums. We hear those stories every time we go home.\n  I asked in that letter that we use the short and valuable time we \nhave to work together in our common interest rather than against each \nother and against the interests of the American people. I wish I could \nsay Republicans answered those words with deeds of equal good faith. \nBut how have they responded regarding health care? Have they taken the \nhand we have extended across the aisle? No. Have they taken the seat we \noffered at the negotiating table? No. Have they engaged in a productive \ndebate about real people and real problems that relate to health care? \nNo. Have they shown they are just as interested as we are in working \nwith each other rather than against each other? No. Have they told us a \nsingle thing they are for rather than what they are against? No; it is \nalways what they are against. In fact, ``no'' is all we hear from the \nRepublicans these days. Instead of debating facts, Republicans have \ncommitted themselves to a strategy of misinformation and \nmisrepresentation.\n  We have different priorities. We are committed to lowering the high \ncost of health care, ensuring every American has access to that \nquality, affordable care and letting people choose their own doctors, \nhospitals, and health plans. We are committed to protecting existing \ncoverage when it is good and improving it when it is not and \nguaranteeing health care for millions, including 9 million children who \nhave none.\n  I don't believe doing nothing is an option because the costs of doing \nnothing are too great. We must pass health care reform this year. As we \nsaid at the start of this year, at the start of this work period, at \nthe start of this debate, we will continue doing our best to work with \nRepublicans and pass a bipartisan bill.\n  In spite of the past, I remain optimistic that both Republicans and \nDemocrats recognize how urgent this health care debate is. The health \nof our citizens and our economy is at stake, and neither will be able \nto recover if we wait. But as important as bipartisanship is--and it is \nimportant--it is not as critical as helping the nearly 50 million \nAmericans who have nowhere to turn, the other 20 million who have bad \ninsurance, and the rest of America, which is paying at least $1,000 \nmore for their insurance policy as a result of people having no \ninsurance.\n  As I said in my letter this April, in order for this bipartisan \nprocess to take root, Republicans must demonstrate a sincere interest \nin legislating. I hope they do so because one way or another, we are \ngoing to get health care reform done.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6670-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6670]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, earlier this year, the new \nadministration proposed and Democrats in Congress approved an economic \nstimulus bill that was meant to lift the economy at a time of massive \njob losses and widespread economic hardship. Not only was the bill \nenormously complex, it was also one of the costliest pieces of \nlegislation ever proposed. Yet those who put it together insisted it be \nrushed to a vote.\n\n  Their reason, of course, was the economic downturn was too dire to \nwait. Trust us, they said; it is responsible, it is needed, and it will \nwork. So this incredibly complex, enormously expensive bill, introduced \non January 26, was passed less than 3 weeks later, just 24 hours--24 \nhours--after all its details\n\n[[Page S6671]]\n\nhad been disclosed to the public for review.\n  At the time, I argued that spending this much borrowed money in the \nmiddle of a recession on a bill that had been rushed to the floor was \nextremely irresponsible. At a time when millions were struggling to \nmake ends meet, Washington had no business borrowing hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to pay for government golf carts and ATV trails in \nthe name of economic stimulus. This week, Senator Coburn has catalogued \nsome of the other outrages that are contained in this bill. Here are \njust a few:\n  The town of Union, NY, received a $578,000 grant that it didn't \nrequest for a homeless problem it claims it does not have. Florida is \nplanning to spend $3.4 million in stimulus money to build a 13-foot \nturtle tunnel at Lake Jackson. That is more than a quarter of a million \ndollars per foot. This one takes the cake. In North Carolina, $40,234 \nin Federal stimulus money will pay for the salary--the salary--of \nsomeone whose job is to lobby for more stimulus money. That is $40,234 \nto pay someone to lobby for more stimulus money.\n  This would be comical if it weren't so maddening and if these \nprojects hadn't been sold to the American people as the answer to our \neconomic problems and if the administration hadn't assured us it would \nmake sure every cent of this money was spent efficiently and without \nwaste. But that was then.\n  The administration had promised since January it would keep an eye on \nhow precious tax dollars were spent. But just months after the stimulus \nwas signed into law, it was already admitting funds would be wasted and \npeople were being scammed.\n  In January and February, administration economists took to the talk \nshows promising that the stimulus would create 3 to 4 million jobs. \nThey said that if we passed the stimulus, the unemployment rate would \nnow be about 8 percent. But just a few months later, with job losses \ncontinuing to mount, the administration admits their early predictions \nwere simply a guess and that they guessed wrong. Today, the \nunemployment rate stands at 9.4 percent. Just yesterday, the \nadministration said it expects unemployment to climb even higher.\n  The $1 trillion they said was absolutely necessary to jump-start the \neconomy, and which was put on a fast track by an eager-to-please, \nDemocratically led Congress, is now being called a very bad guess by \nthe very people who proposed it.\n  Now they are asking us to do it again, only this time it is even more \nthan $1 trillion, and the consequences could be far worse.\n  The early estimates we are getting for the health care proposal we \nhave seen are that a portion of it--just a portion of it--will be $1.3 \ntrillion. This figure, staggering in itself, doesn't even account for \nthe money that would be needed to pay for expanding Medicaid and \ncreating a new government-run plan. No one can tell us where any of \nthis money will come from.\n  Yet similar to the stimulus, we are being told, in the most urgent \ntones, that this government takeover of health care is absolutely \nnecessary, and we have to approve it as soon as possible, without \nreview, without knowing the full cost, and without knowing how it will \naffect people's lives. Once again, it is rush and spend and rush and \nspend and a tidal wave of debt.\n  Everyone in America knows health care reform is needed in this \ncountry, but they want us to do it right. They do not want a blind rush \nto spend trillions--trillions--of dollars in the hope that the \nadministration gets it right. During the debate over the stimulus, we \nwere told we had to pass it right away, with just 24 hours to review--\nor $42 billion an hour--for the sake of the economy. Now we are being \ntold we need to approve a particular set of health care reforms for the \nsake of the economy, but we have no bill. We have no idea of its total \ncost. Yet it is rush, rush, rush.\n  We have heard all this before. We have made this mistake already. \nAmericans will not be rushed into another one. Americans do want health \ncare reform, but they want the right reform, not a government takeover \ndisguised as a reform that takes away the care they have, replaces it \nwith something worse, and costs untold trillions that they and their \ngrandchildren will have to pay through higher taxes and even more debt.\n  The administration admits it made a mistake on its predictions about \nthe stimulus. We shouldn't make the same mistake again when it comes to \nhealth care.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6671-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6671]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, as we all know, health care dominates the \nagenda and the thoughts and efforts of the Congress of the United \nStates, and it has to be addressed. It is a historic opportunity to \nachieve the health reforms Americans need today more than ever. We need \nfundamental reforms--reforms that not only help people get affordable \nhealth care coverage but reforms that bring down the cost of health \ncare.\n  Given the enormous cost associated with the bill that has been \nproposed, I have called on the other side to scrap the bill and start \nfrom scratch. We have to get it right. It shouldn't be a partisan \nprocess that forces a bad bill through committee. In starting over, we \nmust address the fundamental components of health care reform, \nincluding the major drivers of increasing health care costs.\n  One of the main factors keeping health care cost trends too high is \ndefensive medicine. Many medical practitioners order additional \nprocedures for fear of litigation, which drives up the medical \nmalpractice insurance costs faced by so many in the medical profession. \nMedical liability insurance is a direct result of out-of-control \nlawsuits that force physicians to practice defensive medicine to avoid \nthese often costly and baseless liability lawsuits. Any legislation \nreforming our health care system is incomplete if it doesn't address \nthis important issue.\n  A 2003 HHS report estimated the cost of defensive medicine to be \nbetween $70 billion and $126 billion a year. Put that in the light of \nthe report that is in the Washington Post this morning, which states \nthat CBO says Obama's health plan needs spending controls. It goes on \nto say of President Obama's plan to expand health coverage to the \nuninsured:\n\n       It is likely to dig the Nation deeper into debt unless \n     policymakers adopt politically painful controls on spending, \n     such as sharp reductions in payments to doctors, hospitals \n     and other providers.\n\n  There is a way to save about $100 billion a year--$100 billion a \nyear. Because if it were updated, the cost estimate would likely \nincrease to $100 billion to $180 billion a year. Where is it in this \nbill? It is nowhere. It is nowhere. That is a testament to trial \nlawyers of America.\n  On Monday, before a receptive crowd at the American Medical \nAssociation, the President stuck his toe in the medical liability \nreform waters by acknowledging that medical liability reform is real. \nBut the President also took caps on noneconomic damages off the table \nby saying:\n\n       Don't get too excited yet, just hold onto your horses here, \n     guys . . . I want to be honest with you, I'm not advocating \n     caps on malpractice awards.\n\n  This all but ensures that meaningful reform won't happen. Today, the \nWall Street Journal stated in an opinion piece:\n\n       President Obama mentioned the medical liability problem and \n     . . . we suppose this is progress [but] Mr. Obama's [call] \n     might have had more credibility had he not specifically ruled \n     out the one policy to deter frivolous suits.\n\n  Without caps on medical malpractice awards, ``the tort lottery will \ncontinue.''\n\n[[Page S6672]]\n\n  Interestingly, my neighboring State of California addressed this \nprecise problem in 1975 by passing legislation that capped jury awards \nfor ``noneconomic damages,'' such as pain and suffering, from medical \nmalpractice lawsuits. Not only does this cap reduce the amount of \ndamages, but it has had the effect of deterring lawsuits. Malpractice \nfilings have fallen in almost every county in California. According to \na 2004 RAND study, this has led to awards in medical malpractice \nlawsuits being 30 percent less than other States. Such a cap is sure to \nalso lead to lower medical malpractice insurance rates.\n\n  Not only do you have a reduction in the number of suits themselves, a \nreduction in awards, but you can imagine the costs that have been saved \nbecause doctors no longer feel compelled to practice defensive \nmedicine, thereby prescribing unnecessary and unneeded tests and \nprocedures simply to protect themselves in court from medical \nmalpractice\n  There are plenty of ideas that should be considered. Caps on \nnoneconomic damages, health courts, and national standards of care are \njust a few thoughtful concepts. In State malpractice reform over the \nyears, we have demonstrable success stories that capping noneconomic \ndamages brings down the cost of malpractice insurance. California and \nTexas both have reformed malpractice to stem the tide of doctors \nleaving their States.\n  There is also intriguing ideas involving health courts--courts \nfocused only on health disputes, with specially trained judges having \nexpertise in health court adjudication to make injury compensation \ndecisions.\n  Some have also pushed for a concept establishing a national standard \nof care. The concept envisions establishing specific clinical practice \nguidelines that doctors would be required to follow and enforced by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services. Supporters believe this \napproach might reduce liability concerns.\n  These are but three examples that can be considered on both sides of \nthe aisle. There are other ideas we would be well served to consider.\n  When health care costs are said to be driven up by over $100 billion \nand up to 40 percent of medical liability lawsuits being entirely \ngroundless, don't you think the other side would have some provision in \ntheir bill to address this fundamental problem; maybe even a modest \nprovision? Well, I am here to tell you that the other side has yet to \nsuggest any provision to address medical malpractice reforms. Shocking. \nIt should be addressed, and it must be addressed as part of real health \nreform.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, today in the Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions--HELP--Committee of the Senate, after several days of \ndiscussions, we are beginning to work on the health reform legislation \nthat was proposed by our chairman, Senator Kennedy. As we begin our \nwork today, I want to suggest that we put aside the legislation we were \nworking on and that we start over because the Kennedy bill we are \ndealing with is so flawed and expensive that it cannot be fixed. There \nare better proposals available for us to work on, proposals advanced by \nSenator Burr, by Senator Coburn, there is a bipartisan proposal that \nSenator Wyden and Senator Bennett have offered, and Senator Hatch, a \nformer chairman of the committee, is working with a number of Senators \non a proposal that seems, to me, to be a much better base for a \nbeginning.\n  As we go to work on health care reform, these are the things we \nshould keep in mind. We would want to be able to say to the American \npeople that we are interested in all 300 million of you, not just the \n47 million uninsured; that our goal is to provide for each one of you a \nhealth care plan that you can afford, a plan in which you and your \ndoctor--not Washington, DC--make the decisions, a plan that emphasizes \nprevention and wellness. We want to give low-income Americans the same \nkind of health plan that most Americans already have. We do not want to \nmake it harder for American businesses to compete in the world \nmarketplace by adding to their costs. And we do want a plan that your \nchildren and your grandchildren can afford so they are not saddled with \na massive debt that devalues the dollars they earn and the quality of \ntheir lives.\n  As the President has repeatedly said, the best way for us to realize \nall those objectives is to fashion this health care reform in a truly \nbipartisan way. The bill we are marking up today in the HELP committee \nis not ready to be considered. We do not have the details of the bill. \nWe do not know the costs of the bill--even though the President, within \nthe last few days, has said that pay-as-you-go rule is important. If we \nare going to spend a dollar, he said, we ought to save a dollar. Or he \nmight have said raise taxes a dollar. That is what the President said. \nSo surely we are not going to mark up a bill or finish marking it up \nuntil we know exactly whether we are going to have to save a dollar or \ntax a dollar or how many dollars we will need to save or tax in order \nto pass the bill.\n  This we do know about the legislation our committee is considering. \nThere are 47 million Americans uninsured today; it leaves 30 million of \nthem still uninsured. We know that it expands one failing government \nprogram, Medicaid, and creates another, putting Washington in between \nyou and your doctor. It reduces the ability of employers to give \nincentives for wellness and prevention--it doesn't increase it, it \nreduces it. It freezes 58 million low-income Americans into a Medicaid \nProgram that offers sporadic, substandard care; is so expensive it will \nliterally bankrupt States; and our Government Accountability Office has \ntold us it wastes $1 for every $10 it spends--that is $32 billion a \nyear, three-fourths as much as we spend on all the prescription drugs \nfor senior Americans.\n  According to unbiased government officials, its additions to the \nnational debt are astronomical. The Congressional Budget Office told us \nyesterday that the Kennedy bill, so far as it is written, will add $1 \ntrillion to the debt over the next 10 years. That does not include the \nMedicaid expansion or the expansion of reimbursements for doctors \nseeing Medicaid patients. It does not include the government health \ninsurance option. It doesn't include the employer mandate.\n  The Baucus bill, we are told, according to press reports, in the \nFinance Committee, may cost $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years and an \nindependent study released yesterday says the Kennedy bill may mean $4 \ntrillion. The National Governors Association says Medicaid itself will \nadd a half trillion dollars to the State costs over the next 10 years \nif reimbursement rates are increased as they are proposed to be \nincreased. This is on top of what the Washington Post said earlier this \nweek is a set of proposals by the Obama administration that would add \nnearly three times as much to the national debt over the next 10 years \nas we spent in all of World War II.\n  This bill, I am sorry to say, is absolutely not a bipartisan bill. We \nare having a bipartisan discussion. We are all very friendly and civil \nto one another. Chris Dodd is doing a tremendous job of sitting in for \nSenator Kennedy. We all like him, but we know what a bipartisan bill \nis, it is when 15 or 20 of us from different sides of the aisle sit \naround a table and start from scratch and take our best ideas and put \nit together and get 60 or 70 or 75 votes for something. We have done it \nmany times on energy, on intelligence, but we are not doing it on this. \nWe were presented with a bill last Thursday, or some of a bill, and \ntold: This is it. This is the way we are going to do it. We are going \nto have a lot of discussion about it but this is the way we should do \nit.\n  We should start over. If we start over based on the discussions we \nhave already had, we should be able to agree that every American should \nbe covered. We should be able to agree that it should be at a cost each \nAmerican could afford. We should be able to agree that preexisting \nconditions do not disqualify you, and that prevention and wellness is \nencouraged. We should be able to agree that low-income individuals have \nthe same choices, same opportunities for health insurance that the rest \nof us do. And we should be able\n\n[[Page S6673]]\n\nto agree that Americans should have choices.\n  On all of those things we ought to be able to agree, if we were \nstarting from scratch. If we do all those things, why do we need to \ncreate a so-called government-run insurance plan? That is the big \ndifference of opinion we have in the committee and I believe on the \nSenate floor. A government-run insurance plan inevitably leads to a \nWashington takeover, of which we are having far too many these days: \nWashington takeovers of banks, Washington takeovers of insurance \ncompanies, Washington takeovers of student loans, Washington takeover \nof car companies. Why do we need a Washington takeover of our health \nsystem? And why would a government-run insurance plan lead to a \nWashington takeover?\n  Think of it this way. It is like putting an elephant in a room with \nsome mice and saying: All right, fellows, compete. I think you know \nwhat would happen. After a little while only the elephant would be \nleft. The elephant would be your only choice.\n  We have a very good example of what that elephant would look like. We \ncall it Medicare, a program that every State has, that the Federal \nGovernment pays 62 percent of and the State pays 38 percent, on the \naverage, and it provides health care to low-income Americans, those who \nare not on Medicaid.\n  I would like to find a way to require every Senator who votes for \nexpanding Medicaid coverage to be required to go home and serve as \nGovernor of his or her home State for 8 years and try to manage and pay \nfor a Medicaid Program that is expanded to meet the needs of what we \nare trying to do. The only way you could like the Medicaid Program is \nif you have been in Washington a long time and you don't have to manage \nit, you don't have to pay for it, and you don't have to get your health \ncare from it.\n  Let me be very specific. The Medicaid Program--and I dealt with this \nfor years as Governor myself--is filled with lawsuits. It is riddled \nwith Federal court consent decrees from 25 years ago that restrict the \nability of government and legislators to make improvements. It is \nfilled with inefficiencies and delays that take a Governor a year to \nget permission from Washington to do something 38 other States are \ndoing and, I mentioned, it has intolerable waste of taxpayer dollars. \nThe General Accounting Office says $32 billion, every year, is wasted \nin the Medicaid Programs. That is 10 percent of all the money that is \nappropriated to it.\n  The second thing wrong with Medicaid, what a Senator who goes home to \nserve as Governor would find out, it would require higher State taxes \nat a time when States are making massive cuts in services and are very \nnearly bankrupt. The State of Tennessee, by my own calculations--I \nbelieve it would require a 10-percent new State income tax by the year \n2015, if the Senate were to take the Kennedy bill and the Baucus draft \nand enact them today.\n  Why would it do that? The State director of Medicaid in our State \nsays if we increase Medicaid coverage to 150 percent of the Federal \npoverty level, that costs the State of Tennessee $572 million. If the \nFederal Government pays for that, the bill for the Federal Government \nfor that increase is $1.6 billion, just for the Tennesseans covered.\n  It would also increase the pay for Medicaid providers to 110 percent \nof what Medicare pays physicians. That would add another $600 million \nin Tennessee, because Tennessee's Medicaid pays physicians 70 percent \nof what Medicare pays physicians. And Medicare pays physicians 80 \npercent of what private companies pay physicians.\n  So the increased costs, just for Tennessee of the Medicaid expansion \nin the Kennedy bill, is $1.2 billion, according to our State Medicaid \ndirectors. If the Federal Government has to pay the whole thing, it is \n$3.5 billion.\n  But then they are talking in the Finance Committee about shifting \nthose costs back after 5 years to the States. So here comes a $1.2 \nbillion bill to whoever is Governor of Tennessee in 2015.\n  Last thing, to put this into perspective, they tried to pass an \nincome tax in Tennessee. Today, a 4-percent income tax would produce \n$400 million a year. We are talking about finding $1.2 billion a year.\n  The National Governors Association said increasing the Federal \npoverty level to 150 percent would increase the cost to $360 billion \nover 10 years in all the States, and increases in Medicare \nreimbursement would bring that total to half a trillion in all of the \nStates. That is on top of the trillion dollars that the Congressional \nBudget Office has said Senator Kennedy's bill already costs.\n  One of the effects of this is it would absolutely destroy our public \ncolleges and universities across the country. It is already damaging \nthem, because Governors and legislators are finding they barely have \nenough money to keep up with increasing Medicaid costs. They have \nnothing left for colleges and universities. So the quality of the \nuniversities goes down and the tuition at the universities goes up.\n  Finally, Senators serving as a Governor of their home State trying to \nmanage an expanded Medicaid Program would find that most of the people, \nmaybe a majority, would find a hard time getting service. Today, 40 \npercent of doctors nationally do not provide full service to Medicaid \npatients because of the low reimbursement rates.\n  So any version of the bill we are now considering in the Senate HELP \nCommittee will explode into complexity and astronomical spending and \nwill never succeed.\n  There is a better way. There are several better ways. Instead of \nstuffing low-income Americans into one failing government health care \nprogram, Medicaid, that now provides substandard care and creating a \nnew government-run program, why do we not give low-income Americans \ngovernment grants or subsidies so they can purchase private insurance \nas is provided by the Wyden-Bennett bill, for example, which has a cost \nof zero to the taxpayers, according to the Congressional Budget Office; \nor the Coburn-Burr bill, or Senator Gregg's bill, or the bill that \nSenator Hatch is working on with Senator Cornyn and others.\n  Those are the ways to meet our objectives. So here are our objectives \nonce more: We want to provide health coverage to 300 million Americans, \nnot just to the 47 million uninsured. We want for you a health care \nplan that you can afford. We want for you a plan in which you and your \ndoctor make the decisions, not Washington, DC. We want a plan that \nemphasizes prevention and wellness. We want a plan that gives low-\nincome Americans more of the same opportunities and choices for health \ncare that most Americans already have. And we want a plan that does not \nmake it harder for American businesses to compete in the world \nmarketplace by adding to their cost.\n  We want, in the end, a program, a health care program your \ngrandchildren and your children can afford and does not heap trillions \nof dollars of new debt up on them, that devalues the dollar they will \neventually earn, and the quality of their lives.\n  As the President has repeatedly said, the best way to do that is in a \nbipartisan way. But in order to do that, we need to put aside the bill \nwe are working on today in the HELP Committee and start over again in a \ntruly bipartisan way to meet those objectives.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6673-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6673-S6677]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         JUDICIAL CONFIRMATIONS\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I sought recognition to comment on the \nforthcoming proceedings on the confirmation of Judge Sotomayor for the \nSupreme Court of the United States.\n  Judge Sotomayor comes to this position with an extraordinary record. \nHer academic standing at Princeton was summa cum laude, a graduate of \nthe Yale Law School where she was a member of the Yale Law Journal \nBoard of Editors.\n  Then in her practice, she was an assistant district attorney in \nManhattan, a position which gives very extensive experience in many \nfacets of the law,\n\n[[Page S6674]]\n\nsomething I know in my own experience years ago as an assistant \ndistrict attorney.\n  She was in private practice with a very prestigious New York law \nfirm, then served on the U.S. District Court, and more recently on the \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit.\n  The hearings will give Judge Sotomayor an opportunity to respond to a \nnumber of issues which have been raised about her background. I think \nChairman Leahy was correct in moving the hearing dates so that the \nconfirmation process could be concluded in time for Judge Sotomayor, if \nconfirmed, to sit with the Court during September when the Court will \ndecide what cases it will hear.\n  A great deal of the important work of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates is decided on what cases they decide not to hear. And perhaps \nthat in some ways is as important as the cases they do hear, the cases \nthey do decide. It is during that period of time when the decision is \nmade of a grant of certiorari with four Justices deciding which cases \nto hear where the presence of a new Justice could be very important.\n  Confirmation hearings at an early stage will give Judge Sotomayor an \nopportunity to respond to many questions which are highly publicized. \nIt is a very noteworthy matter when a nominee is being considered for \nthe Supreme Court. There is a lot of publicity, and some of it is \ncontroversial.\n  As a matter of fairness, the earlier a nominee can have an \nopportunity to respond to those issues--a question has been raised \nabout her decision on the New Haven firefighters case. Well, the \nnuances of disparate impact do not lend themselves too well to brief \nnewspaper articles nor sound bites on the talk shows. They are made for \nSupreme Court hearings.\n  Her decision on property rights following the Kelo decision has been \nsubjected to certain comment. There again, the nuances require a \nhearing. Or her statement about ``a wise Latina woman'' has been widely \ncommented upon. And there again, she ought to have an opportunity to \nspeak to those issues.\n  There have been some questions raised about her decisions under the \nSecond Amendment, membership in the Belizean Grove, and a lot of \nspeculation. So let's bring on the hearings where there will be an \nopportunity for Judge Sotomayor to present her views.\n  Based on what I have studied in her opinions, an extensive meeting \nwhich I had with her, she is a powerful intellect and prospectively she \nis likely to be able to have good comments. But that is what the \nconfirmation process is all about. So let's move forward on it to the \nJuly hearing dates so we can consider her nomination and she can have \nan opportunity to respond to those issues.\n  There have been contrary views about the value of confirmation \nhearings. There are some who say they have outlived their usefulness, \npointing historically to the fact that prior to 1955 or thereabouts \nthere were very few confirmation hearings, only when there was some \nextraordinary question.\n  In recent decades the confirmation hearings have been extensive. \nHaving participated in some 11 of those confirmation hearings, it is my \njudgment that they are very worthwhile, from many points of view.\n  It presents an opportunity to have a public focus on the appropriate \nrole of the Supreme Court, a lot of very major questions about the \nrespective roles on the separation of powers between the courts and \nCongress, on fact finding, and on the record.\n  There are important questions on the relative authority of the \nexecutive versus the Court on the issues of detention, of habeas; \nimportant issues on the relative power of the Congress versus the \nexecutive, as exemplified by the conflict between the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, and the powers of the President under \narticle II of the Constitution as Commander in Chief.\n  There are also hearings where it is a public focus on a civics lesson \nas to what the Court does, and public attention is focused on the \nCourt. My preference would be, as I have noted on legislation I have \nintroduced, which has been passed out of the Judiciary Committee in \nprior congresses, to have the proceedings of the Supreme Court \ntelevised under certain circumstances. That has not yet been approved. \nBut I think the day will come when the Supreme Court hearings will be \ntelevised. I think they could be televised without having showboating, \nand real insight by the public as to what happens at the Supreme Court \nof the United States, just as hearings of the House of Representatives \nand the Senate are televised.\n  There are a lot of quorum calls, but there are debates that go on \nhere for the public to see, where very major matters of public policy \nare decided.\n  At least the confirmation hearings do bring the role of the Court \ninto focused hearings, I think, to a very beneficial effect.\n  We had the hearings on Judge Bork widely commented upon, very \nextensive hearings on his writings, his view of original intent. There \nwas an opportunity for the American people and the scholars to see what \nwas involved.\n\n  There has grown a myth that in that proceeding, the nominee was \n``Borked,'' turning his name into a verb. My own view is that is not \nso; that the decision made in rejecting the confirmation of Judge Bork \nturned on the record, turned on what happened in the Judiciary \nCommittee proceedings. When we took a look at original intent, it was \nway outside the mainstream of constitutional law, way outside the \nconstitutional continuum. If we look to what Congress intended in 1868, \nwhen the equal protection clause was passed in the 14th amendment in \nthis Chamber, the galleries were segregated. African Americans were on \none side and Caucasians were on another. So the intent of Senators \ncertainly could not have been that equal protection meant integration. \nBut after Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, there was no doubt equal \nprotection did mean integration.\n  The confirmation proceedings of Chief Justice Rehnquist were very \ninformative. Chief Justice Rehnquist had more than 30 votes cast \nagainst his nomination in 1986. The issue arose as to the adequacy of \nhis answering questions as to the role of the Supreme Court contrasted \nwith the role of Congress. Chief Justice Rehnquist had written an \ninteresting article for the Harvard Law Record, back in 1959, when he \nwas a young practicing attorney, criticizing the Senate for the \nconfirmation hearings of Justice Whittaker, not asking probing \nquestions about due process of law but only extolling Justice \nWhittaker's virtues because he represented both the State of Kansas and \nthe State of Missouri, living in one State and practicing law in the \nother. When Chief Justice Rehnquist was asked questions about the \nauthority of Congress to take away the jurisdiction of the Supreme \nCourt, he answered, finally, that the Congress did not have the \nauthority on first amendment issues but declined to answer about the \nfourth amendment, fifth, sixth or eighth or to answer a question as to \nwhy he would respond on the first amendment but not on others.\n  There are some issues which are so firmly established that they are \noutside the respected rule that we don't ask nominees to say how they \nwill decide upon cases that might come before them. But where we deal \nwith issues such as Marbury v. Madison or Brown v. Board of Education \nor the authority of the Congress to take away jurisdiction of the \nSupreme Court in derogation of Marbury v. Madison, there are questions \nwhich ought to be answered.\n  The confirmation hearings provide an opportunity to go into detail \nabout the functioning of the Court. A few years ago, when the issue of \njudicial pay was before the Congress, a number of Senators were invited \nto confer with the Justices. It provided an opportunity for me to see \nthe conference room. I had been a member of the bar of the Supreme \nCourt, argued a few cases there but had never seen their conference \nroom. Frankly, it was quite an eye-opener--a small room, plain table, \nmodest chairs, very intimate, very austere, quite some insight as to \nhow close the Justices are together. When we talk about diversity, how \nlong it took to get an African American on the Court, Thurgood Marshall \ndid not go to the Court until 1967. Justice Lewis Powell made a comment \nreportedly that just having Thurgood Marshall in the room made a \ndifference in perspective. Surprising, perhaps scandalous, that it took \nuntil 1981 to have a woman\n\n[[Page S6675]]\n\non the Supreme Court. Now there have only been two. When I was asked \nfor recommendations for the current vacancy, I recommended four women. \nTo say that a woman's point of view is different and valuable is trite. \nWhen I was elected to the Senate in 1980, Senator Kastenbaum was the \nonly woman in the Chamber. Senator Hawkins was elected that year. Now \nwe have 16 and growing. It has been a very great addition and \nimprovement to the deliberations here to have more women. Another woman \non the Supreme Court would be a plus there, if Judge Sotomayor is \nconfirmed.\n  Also, the diversity on being a Hispanic is important. We live in a \nvery diverse society. When one sees that small Supreme Court Chamber, \nthey can see the intimacy and can almost visualize the intellectual \ndiscussions and the powerhouses in that room and how the big cases are \ndecided, with the Court having the last word on life and death, a \nwoman's right to choose, medicinal issues of attempted suicide, the \ndeath penalty in capital cases, all the cutting edge issues of our \nsociety.\n  The confirmation proceeding of Judge Sotomayor will give us an \nopportunity to inquire into some very important issues on executive \nversus judicial authority, on the authority of the Court versus the \nCongress. Toward that end, I wrote a letter to Judge Sotomayor, dated \nJune 15. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the \nRecord at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. SPECTER. As I note in the opening paragraph, our so-called \ncourtesy call lasted more than an hour. At that time, I commented to \nher that I would be writing on other subjects on which I intended to \ncomment at her hearing. She responded she would be glad to have that \nadvance notice. The issue I focus on in this letter involves the \nrespective authority of the Congress contrasted with the Court on the \nestablishment of a record to warrant legislation which Congress enacts. \nI noted I had written to Chief Justice Roberts in a similar vein back \non August 8, 2005, in advance of his confirmation hearings. I take up \nin my letter to Judge Sotomayor the same issue I took up with Chief \nJustice Roberts; that is, decisions of the Supreme Court in \ninvalidating congressional enactments, declaring them unconstitutional, \nbecause of what the Court says is an insufficient record.\n  I note the case of United States v. Morrison, which involved \nlegislation to protect women against violence, where the Court was \ndenigrating, disrespectful to Congress, where the Court said the \ncongressional findings were rejected because of our ``method of \nreasoning,'' as if there is some unique quality which comes to the \nnominee at the time of confirmation in walking across the green between \nthe hearing room and the Supreme Court chambers.\n  A dissent by Justice Souter noted that the Court's judgment was \n``dependent upon a uniquely judicial conference,'' as if the competence \nof the Congress was to a lesser extent. Justice Souter commented, in \ndisagreeing with Chief Justice Rehnquist, who said there was an \ninsufficient record, that ``the mountain of data assembled by Congress \nincluded a record on gender bias from a task force of 21 States, eight \nseparate reports by the Congress.''\n  There was a similar finding by the Supreme Court of the United States \nin the case of Alabama v. Garrett, where the Supreme Court decided \nthere was an insufficient record to support the enactment of title I of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, even though there had been task \nforce hearings in every State attended by more than 30,000 people, \nincluding thousands who had experienced discrimination, with more than \n300 examples of discrimination by State Governments. Notwithstanding \nthat, the Supreme Court in Garrett said there was an insufficient \nrecord.\n  In dissent, Justice Scalia called the test of congruence and \nproportionality a flabby test, a test that was ``an invitation to \njudicial arbitrariness and policy-driven decisionmaking.''\n  When we look to a standard of congruence and proportionality, it is \nvery vague. Sharp divergence from the standard that Justice Harlan \narticulated in Maryland v. Wirtz in 1968, whether there was a rational \nbasis for the congressional decision. So that as Justice Scalia noted \nin his dissent in Tennessee v. lane, the standard of congruence and \nproportionality was flabby. Justice Scalia went on to say:\n\n       Worse still, it casts this Court in the role of Congress's \n     task master. Under it the courts--and ultimately, this \n     Court--must regularly check Congress's homework to make sure \n     that it has identified sufficient constitutional violations \n     to make its remedy constitutional and proportional.\n\n  In the confirmation hearings of Chief Justice Roberts, he responded \nin a way very supportive of the role of Congress, where the Court \nshould be deferential to the Congress. In response to a question by \nSenator DeWine, he said the Supreme Court ought to defer to \ncongressional findings, and the answer will be in the Record with this \nletter.\n  In response to my questioning, Chief Justice Roberts said:\n\n       And I appreciate very much the difference in institutional \n     competence between the judiciary and the Congress, when it \n     comes to basic questions of fact finding, development of a \n     record and also the authority to make the policy decisions \n     about how to act on the basis of a particular record. It is \n     not just disagreement over a record. It is a question of \n     whose job it is to make a determination based on the record. \n     As a judge, that you are beginning to transgress into the \n     area of making a law is when you are in a position of \n     reevaluating legislative findings, because that doesn't look \n     like a judicial function.\n\n  There, the Chief Justice comes to grips with the dominant role of the \nCongress that ought to be deferred to and says, when the court takes \nover, it is judicial lawmaking, which is something which is generally \nrecognized to be in an area which ought not to be transgressed. \n``Transgression'' is Chief Justice Roberts' word, that it is up to \nCongress to make the laws and up to the Court to interpret them.\n  In a hearing on the Voting Rights Act on April 29, 2009, Northwest \nAustin Municipal Utility District v. Holder, on the issue of the \nsufficiency of the record, here we have 16,000 pages of testimony, 21 \ndifferent hearings, 10 months of action. Congress, in 2006, \nreauthorized the Voting Rights Act. In listening to the Supreme Court \nargument and reading the record--you cannot draw any conclusions \ntotally--but it looks very much as if the Court may be on the verge of \nfinding the record insufficient.\n\n  Chief Justice Roberts had this to say in the course of the argument \non the Voting Rights Act:\n\n       . . . one-twentieth of one percent of the submissions are \n     not precleared. That, to me, suggests that they are sweeping \n     far more broadly than they need to address the intentional \n     discrimination under the Fifteenth Amendment.\n       That's like the old elephant whistle. You know, I have this \n     whistle to keep away the elephants. You know, well, that's \n     silly. Well, there are no elephants, so it must work. I mean, \n     if you have 99.98 percent of those being precleared, why \n     isn't that reaching too broadly?\n\n  We will all be watching very closely to see what the Supreme Court of \nthe United States does in the voting rights case and especially the \nopinion of Chief Justice Roberts, who has testified so emphatically at \nhis confirmation hearing as to the role of the Congress being dominant, \nand it was, as he put it: ``. . . as a judge that you may be beginning \nto transgress into the area of making a law . . . ''\n  So those are issues which I am going to be addressing to Judge \nSotomayor in the course of the confirmation hearings. I am not going to \nask her how she is going to decide a case. That is outside the bounds. \nBut I think it is fair to inquire as to what is the standard. Is it the \nJustice Harlan standard of rational basis or is it a standard of \ncongruent and proportional--a standard which is of recent vintage in \nthe City of Boerne v. Flores case, and having been applied in cases \nwhere it is very difficult to understand the conclusions of the Court, \nif you take Tennessee v. Lane, where one article of the Americans with \nDisabilities Act was upheld and contrast it with the Alabama v. Garrett \ncase, where it was stricken.\n  Justice Scalia, in the argument of the voting rights case, took issue \nwith the Congress on a 98-to-0 decision, suggesting if it is 98 to 0, \nit must not have been too carefully thought through.\n  It reminds me of the 98-to-0 vote Justice Scalia got on his \nconfirmation and the many unanimous decisions of the\n\n[[Page S6676]]\n\nSupreme Court. I will ask to have printed in the Record a group of \nrecent cases--10 or more--where Justice Scalia decided cases 9 to 0.\n  So if this legislative body--the Senate--votes 98 to 0 in favor of \nrenewing the Voting Rights Act, relying upon the extensive record, \nwhich I have cited, that is not a sign of weakness. That is not a sign \nthat the Senate does not know what it is doing with a 98-to-0 vote.\n  So the questions which I have posed for Judge Sotomayor are these:\n  First: Would you apply the Justice Harlan rational base standard or \nthe congruent and proportionality standard?\n  Second: What are your views on Justice Scalia's characterization that \nthe ``congruence and proportionality standard'' is a flabby test and an \n``invitation to judicial arbitrariness and policy-driven \ndecisionmaking,'' where Justice Scalia says that is the way for the \ncourts to make law on a standard which is so vague?\n  Third: Do you agree with Chief Justice Rehnquist's conclusion that \nthe Violence Against Women legislation was unconstitutional because of \nCongress's ``method of reasoning''?\n  And fourth: Do you agree with the division of constitutional \nauthority between Congress and the Supreme Court as articulated by \nChief Justice Roberts in his responses, cited in this letter, to \nquestions posed at his hearing by Senator DeWine and myself?\n  I do believe there will be an opportunity for very important issues \nto be presented to the nominee. Based on what I have seen of her, in \nreviewing her record, and the meeting I had with her--I have noted her \nexcellent resume--I am looking forward to giving her an opportunity to \nanswer the many questions that have been raised in the press, where she \nwill have more of an opportunity than to have a sound bite but to give \ncommentary on her record in support of her nomination.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the material to \nwhich I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Recent Unanimous Decisions With Opinions Authored by Justice Scalia\n\n       Republic of Iraq v.

Sonia Sotomayor,\n     The Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judge Sotomayor: When we concluded our meeting which \n     lasted more than an Hour, I commented that I would be writing \n     to you on other subjects which I intended to cover at your \n     hearing, and I appreciated your response that you would \n     welcome such advance notice.\n       In the confirmation hearing for Chief Justice Roberts, \n     there was considerable discussion about the adequacy of \n     congressional fact finding to support legislation. This issue \n     is again before the Supreme Court on the re-authorization of \n     the Voting Rights Act where the legislation is challenged on \n     the ground that there is an insufficient factual record. At \n     our hearing, I would uphold like your views on what legal \n     standards you would apply in evaluating the adequacy of a \n     Congressional record. In the 1968 case Maryland v. Wirtz, \n     Justice Harlan's rationale would uphold an act of Congress \n     where the legislature had a rational basis for reaching a \n     regulatory scheme. In later cases, the Court has moved to a \n     ``congruence and proportionality standard.''.\n       In advance of the hearing for Chief Justice Roberts by \n     letter dated August 8, 2005. I wrote him in part:\n       ``members of Congress are irate about the Court's \n     denigrating and, really, disrespectful statements about \n     Congress's competence. In U.S. v. Morrison, Chief Justice \n     Rehnquist, speaking for five members of the Court, rejected \n     Congressional findings because of ``our method of \n     reasoning''. As the dissent noted, the Court's judgment is \n     ``dependent upon a uniquely judicial competence'' which \n     implicitly criticizes a lesser quality of Congressional \n     competence.\n       In Morrison, there was an extensive record on evidence \n     establishing the factual basis for enactment of the Violence \n     Against Women legislation. In dissent. Justice Souter noted . \n     . . the mountain of data assembled by Congress here showing \n     the effects of violence against women on interstate \n     commerce,'' and added:\n       ``The record includes reports on gender bias from task \n     forces in 21 states and we have the benefit of specific \n     factual finding in eight separate reports issued by Congress \n     and its committees over the long course leading to its \n     enactment.''\n       In a subsequent letter to Chief Justice Roberts dated \n     August 23, 2005, I wrote concerning Alabama v. Garrett where \n     Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act was based on \n     task force field hearings in every state attended by more \n     than 30,000 people including thousands who had experienced \n     discrimination with roughly 300 examples of discrimination by \n     state governments.\n       Notwithstanding those findings, the Garrett Court concluded \n     in a five to four decision:\n       ``The legislative record of the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act, however, simply fails to show that Congress did in fact \n     identify a pattern of irrational state discrimination in \n     employment against the disabled.''\n       In another five to four decision, the Court in Lane v. \n     Tennessee concluded Title II of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act met the ``congruence and proportionality \n     standard''. There, Justice Scalia dissented attacking the \n     ``congruence and proportionality standard'' calling it a \n     ``flabby test'' and ``invitation to judicial arbitrariness \n     and policy driven decision making'':\n       ``Worse still, it casts this Court in the role of \n     Congress's taskmaster. Under it, the courts (and ultimately \n     this Court) must regularly check Congress's homework to make \n     sure that it has identified sufficient constitutional \n     violations to make its remedy constitutional and \n     proportional. As a general matter, we are ill-advised to \n     adopt or adhere to constitutional rules that bring us into \n     conflict with a coequal branch of Government.''\n       During the confirmation hearing of Chief Justice Roberts, \n     he testified extensively in favor of the Court's deferring to \n     Congress on fact finding. In response to questions from \n     Senator DeWine, he testified:\n       ``. . . The reason that congressional fact finding and \n     determination is important in these cases is because the \n     courts recognize that they can't do that, Courts can't have, \n     as you said, whatever it was, the 13 separate hearings before \n     passing particular legislation. Courts--the Supreme Court \n     can't sit and hear witness after witness after witness in a \n     particular area and develop that kind of a record. Courts \n     can't make the policy judgments about what type of \n     legislation is necessary in light of the findings that are \n     made''. . . `We simply don't have the institutional expertise \n     or the resources or the authority to engage in that type of a \n     process. So that is sort of the basis for the deference to \n     the fact finding that is made. It's institutional competence. \n     The courts don't have it. Congress does. It's constitutional \n     authority. It's not our job. It is your job. So the defense \n     to congressional findings in this area has a solid basis.''\n       In response to my questioning, Chief Justice Roberts said:\n       ``And I appreciate very much the differences in \n     institutional competence between the judiciary and the \n     Congress when it comes to basic questions of fact finding \n     development of a record, and also the authority to make the \n     policy decisions about how to act on the basic of a \n     particular record. It's not just disagreement over a record. \n     It's a question of whose job it is to make a determination \n     based on the record' . . . as a judge that you may be \n     beginning to transgress into the area of making a law is when \n     you are in a position of re-evaluating legislative findings, \n     because that doesn't look like a judicial function.''\n       The Supreme Court heard oral argument in Northwest Austin \n     Municipal Utility District v. Holder on April 29, 2009 \n     involving the sufficiency of the Congressional record on \n     reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. While too much cannot he \n     read into comments by justices at oral argument, Chief \n     Justice Roberts' statements suggested a very different \n     attitude on deference to Congressional fact finding than he \n     expressed at his confirmation hearing. Referring to the \n     argument that ``. . . action under Section 5 has to be \n     congruent and proportional to what it's trying to remedy,'' \n     Justice Roberts said that:\n       ``. . . one-twentieth of l percent of the submissions are \n     not precleared. That, to me, suggests that they are sweeping \n     far more broadly than they need to, to address the \n     intentional discrimination under the Fifteenth Amendment.''\n       Chief Justice Roberts went to say:\n       ``Well, that's like the old--you know, it's the elephant \n     whistle. You know, I have this whistle to keep away the \n     elephants. You know, well, that's silly. well, there are no \n     elephants, so it must work. I mean if you have 99.98 percent \n     of these being precleared, why isn't that reaching far too \n     broadly.''\n       As a factual basis for the 2007 Voting rights Act, Congress \n     heard from dozens of witnesses over ten months in 21 \n     different hearings. Applying the approach from Chief Justice \n     Roberts' confirmation hearing, that would appear to satisfy \n     the ``congruence and proportionality standard''.\n\n[[Page S6677]]\n\n       My questions are:\n       1. Would you apply the Justice Harlan ``rational basis'' \n     standard or the ``congruence and proportionality standard''?\n       2. What are your views on Justice Scalia's characterization \n     that the ``congruence and proportionality standard'' is a \n     ``flabby test'' and ``an invitation to judicial arbitrariness \n     and policy driven decision making''?\n       3. Do you agree with Chief Justice Rehnquist's conclusion \n     that the Violence Against Women legislation was \n     unconstitutional because of Congress's ``method of \n     reasoning''?\n       4. Do you agree with the division of constitutional \n     authority between Congress and the Supreme Court articulated \n     by Chief Justice Roberts in his responses cited in this \n     letter to questions posed at his hearing by Senator DeWine \n     and me?\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I would like to mention one other issue in \nclosing. A large number of Senators signed a letter to the leader \nasking that we do our business in a very thoughtful way as it relates \nto appropriations. Each year we find ourselves in a position where we \nend up with an omnibus bill that most of us feel very uncomfortable \nsigning into law.\n  We ask that the appropriations bills be passed in such a manner that \nwe have eight of them passed individually by the August recess.\n  I know, today, we are stuck on a bill, and I realize there is some \nstalling that is taking place. I have to question why we are focused on \na tourism bill today when we still have not begun our appropriations \nprocess.\n  So I will say to the leader, I hope he will move on with doing the \nappropriations in an appropriate order so, as I have mentioned, we will \nhave at least eight of those passed by the recess so we can do our \ncitizens' work in the most appropriate manner.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and thank you for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to honor a proud son \nof Alamogordo, NM. Army SPC Chris Kurth died on Thursday, June 4, after \nhis vehicle was struck by an antitank grenade. He was 23 years old.\n  In Iraq, Chris was responsible for escorting convoys. But this job \ndescription conveys none of the risk or the courage involved in the \njob. The military can secure a town or a base, but somebody must still \ntravel the roads that cannot be secured. Christopher Kurth was \nresponsible for undertaking this act of courage.\n  Chris knew how dangerous his job could be when he began his last \nmission. He was on his second tour of duty, and he had just recovered \nfrom a neck wound that won him a Purple Heart. But for Chris, success \nwas defined by keeping his fellow soldiers safe. And that is what he \ndied fighting to do.\n  The values reflected in this duty are as important in peace as they \nare in war. His job was to protect his fellow soldiers--to be a good \nfriend in the most difficult of times. By serving them, he served his \ncountry.\n  The characteristics that made Chris Kurth a good soldier also made \nhim a good friend when he was back in Alamogordo. They made him a good \nteacher when he volunteered to tell students at his former high school \nabout his life as a soldier. They made him a loving--and loved--son, \nbrother, and husband.\n  Chris Kurth lost his life keeping American soldiers safe. He was a \nproud soldier and a good man.\n  My thoughts are with Chris's parents, with his wife, and with all \nthose who knew and loved him. I ask you to join me today in remembering \nhis service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6677-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6677-S6678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NAVAJO CODE TALKERS\n\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise to mark a solemn \nmoment for the Navajo Nation and for our country.\n  In the past month, three of America's veterans passed away: Willie \nBegay, Thomas Claw, and John Brown, Jr. These men were members of the \nsmall group of marines known as the Navajo Code Talkers. Their story is \none of the most compelling in American military history.\n  In May of 1942, 29 Navajo Indians arrived at Camp Pendleton in \nCalifornia. They were there to develop a code that could be deployed \neasily and would not be cracked by Japanese cryptographers.\n  Over the course of the war, the original 29 became a team of roughly \n400 Navajos responsible for building and using their code. Their \nsuccess in that mission helped the Marines capture Iwo Jima. It \ncontributed to the American victory, and it saved untold numbers of \nallied soldiers.\n  As most World War II veterans were returning home with stories of \ncourage and victory, the Navajo Code Talkers were ordered to keep their \nstory secret. Their mission was classified. Only in 1968 was it \nrevealed to the world. And only in 2001 did these men finally receive \nthe recognition they deserved when they were presented with \nCongressional Medals.\n  It is often said that America's diversity makes her strong. During \nWorld War II, this country's cultural diversity contributed to \nAmerica's military strength in a very real and concrete way. Because \nthe Navajo language had survived and it had been passed down, Americans \nhad a code that the Japanese were never able to crack--a weapon they \ncould not counter.\n\n  America is unique among the countries of the world. Almost every \nother country on Earth finds its sense of solidarity in a common race \nand a common culture. Even countries as diverse as our own trace their \nheritage to some imagined community older than their political \ninstitutions. Our Nation has always defined itself by its ideals, not \nby race or culture. Although we have not always lived up to this vision \nof a truly multicultural democracy, it has guided our development and \nspurred our progress.\n  When the Navajo Code Talkers first arrived at Camp Pendleton, there \nwere those who considered them less than fully equal. U.S. law had only \nacknowledged Native Americans as citizens for 17 years when our country \nentered World War II. Many of the code talkers were born as noncitizens \nin a land that had belonged to their people before the Europeans knew \nit existed. Yet 45,000 of 350,000 Native Americans in this country \nserved in the Armed Forces during that conflict, including 400 Navajo \nCode Talkers.\n  The Native Americans who signed up to serve this country in the Armed \nForces were sending a message that they, just as much as anyone else, \nwere citizens of the United States of America, their people were just \nas much a part of this country's cultural tapestry as any other.\n  In the Navajo code, the word for America was ``our mother.'' As one \ncode talker has explained:\n\n       ``Our Mother'' stood for freedom--our religion--our ways of \n     life. And that's why we went in.\n\n  The Navajo marines identified their culture with their country. When \nthey fought, they fought for both. In fact, values integral to the \nNavajo experience spurred them to fight in America's war against \ntyranny. As Americans who faced bigotry and injustice, they eagerly \nsigned on to free others from oppression. As individuals who had lived \nwith the legacy of aggression against their people, they felt keenly \nthe need to prevent other acts of aggression, even if these acts were \nbeing perpetrated on the other side of the world.\n  The passing of the three code talkers--thousands of miles and dozens \nof years from the events that made them heroes--should make us all \nremember the great patriotism and honor all the code talkers displayed. \nIt should make\n\n[[Page S6678]]\n\nus appreciate their work and honor their memory, and it should make us \nproud to live in a country where such things are possible.\n  As time does the work Japanese guns could never do, the code talkers \nare slowly leaving us. Only 80 of the original 400 remain with us. Too \nsoon, these men will live only in our memories. Let's keep those \nmemories strong, lest we lose the inspiration they can offer.\n  To Willie Begay, Thomas Claw, and John Brown, Jr., we honor your \nlives and mourn your passing. To all of the code talkers, alive and \nbeyond, we celebrate your service. Whenever stories of courage and \npatriotism are told, we will think of you.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I rise today to applaud Senator Lincoln \nand Senator Snowe for their leadership and commitment in introducing S. \n1222. This legislation would revise and extend existing empowerment \nzone, renewal community, and enterprise community rules. It seeks to \nmake these programs more effective and ensure that the incentives work \nas intended. I am proud to be a cosponsor of this important measure.\n  Congress created empowerment zones, renewal communities, and \nenterprise communities to spur economic growth and create job \nopportunities. Cities such as East St. Louis and Chicago, IL, have \nreceived tax incentives worth $5.3 billion. These incentives encourage \nbusinesses to open or expand and to hire local residents. They include \nemployment credits, low-interest loans, reduced taxation on capital \ngains, and other incentives.\n  Unfortunately, some of the programs have not operated as intended. A \nfew major hurdles have prevented full utilization of the tax benefits \navailable. These incentives desperately need to be refined and \nextended. That is exactly what this legislation would do, and that is \nwhy it is so important for the Senate to act without delay.\n  Empowerment zones such as the one in East St. Louis, IL, focus on \ngrassroots, sustainable progress. They create a bond between \nbusinesses, employees, and surrounding communities. Despite receiving \nonly one-fourth of anticipated Federal funding, they have found \naspiring entrepreneurs to expand and develop local businesses, using a \ncreative array of tax incentives and loans.\n  This legislation is an important step toward reversing the blight \nfaced by our inner cities without gentrifying these areas or shutting \nout the community members who need our help the most. Senator Lincoln \nand Senator Snowe deserve our utmost support in their fight to \nrehabilitate these communities. I am proud to cosponsor this \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to join with me in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6678-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6678]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ECONOMIC RECOVERY\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, as I address this Chamber today, our \ncountry remains in the grips of the worst economic disaster since the \nGreat Depression. We have all felt its devastating effects. In the last \nhalf century, it has never been harder for working Americans to make \nends meet. But finally we are beginning to see indications that the \nworst may be behind us. The economy is still shedding jobs but at a \nslower rate. Business is starting to pick up again for some--not all \nbut for some. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act has started to \ntake hold, and at long last some people are beginning to feel more \nhopeful.\n  But as the tide rises for some communities, others continue to slip \nfurther and further behind. In a troubling new report, the unemployment \nrate among African Americans has risen to 14.9 percent--up 6 points \nsince 2007. Everyone is hurting, but this is an alarming sign that some \ngroups are still hurting more than others. While one in five White \nteens is without a job, two in five African-American teens are \nunemployed, along with one in three Hispanic teens. The overall share \nof African Americans with jobs has reached its lowest point since 1986.\n  As we begin to emerge from the worst of this economic crisis, we must \nnot forget that there is still a long way to go for many Americans. In \nour rush to get this economy back on track, we need to make sure we \ndon't leave certain communities behind. This means increasing the \namount of capital available to employers, helping put Americans back to \nwork, and protecting small businesses.\n  As a former banker who worked hard to secure loans for small \nbusinesses, I have a deep understanding of the role these companies \nplay in creating jobs and helping the economy to grow.\n  I know how crucial it is to provide immediate relief, as well as \nlasting support. That is why I applaud President Obama's recent call to \nspeed up the disbursal of stimulus funds. This would save or create \nroughly 600,000 jobs in the next 3 months alone.\n  This will not be an easy task, but it is necessary to strengthen \nAmerica's small business, put people back to work, and restore economic \nsecurity. But as we rush to provide aid to the American people, we need \nto make sure the stimulus funds are targeted effectively. That is why \noversight is critical.\n  As billions of dollars flow from the Federal Government to the State \ntreasuries, transparency will help keep State and Federal officials \naccountable for every dollar spent in the name of economic recovery.\n  If done right, this will ensure that everyone can share in the \npromise and prosperity of a revitalized economy. That is why I \nintroduced S. 1064, a bill that will set aside small amounts of \nstimulus money to pay for regulation and oversight.\n  These costs are currently unfunded, leaving the American people with \nonly vague assurances that their money will be used effectively.\n  Mr. President, this is simply not good enough. We need to protect the \ninterests of the American taxpayers and ensure that every dollar can be \ntracked.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me in the fight for accountability. \nI thank my good friends, Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Member Collins, \nand Senator McCaskill for signing on to cosponsor this bill.\n  As the economy begins to improve for some Americans, let's make sure \nmillions of others are not left behind.\n  We need to lift the least fortunate among us and ensure every \nAmerican has an equal chance to benefit from our continued economic \nrecovery.\n  As one of our former distinguished Vice Presidents, Hubert Humphrey, \nfamously said:\n\n       The moral test of government is how that government treats \n     those who are in the dawn of life, the children; those who \n     are in the twilight of life, the elderly; and those who are \n     in the shadows of life, the sick, the needy, and the \n     handicapped.\n\n  It is time to renew our commitment to the communities that are \nhurting the most, and as we work to increase transparency and speed up \nthe responsible use of the stimulus funds, we need to make sure no one \nis left behind.\n  Mr. President, again, we need to make sure no one is left behind.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6678-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6678-S6682]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, as the rhetoric over health care reform \nstarts to heat up--and, of course, it has--I find myself trying to \ndetermine exactly what we are trying to accomplish with this debate. \nAre we attempting to put together what I think is the right\n\n[[Page S6679]]\n\napproach--a bipartisan solution to a problem that is affecting every \nAmerican family and business--or are we caught up in pushing something \nthrough this body with little deliberation and little regard for the \nconsequences of our hurried action? And the consequences are great.\n  I fear we are leaning toward the latter statement, based upon the \ntime limits and the rush in the committees charged with producing very \ncomplex health care legislation. I do not envy them their task. I would \nargue that it is more important to craft a very good, very solid bill \nthat actually will solve the problem instead of forcing a not-well-\nthought-out, half-analyzed bill onto the backs of the American people. \nWhat we do in this arena will affect every American. I believe our \nconstituents deserve so much more from us, and we should think twice \nbefore we proceed down a path that is wrong.\n  The American people deserve to know the truth about what is included \nin the bills that are being considered. They have a right to know how \nthis will affect the long-term health not only of their families but of \nthe Nation. Of course, in that arena, they need to know the long-term \nhealth of this Nation, both physically and financially.\n  We can find many points of agreement on how to reform our health care \nsystem. I have heard countless speeches about the need to eliminate \nwaste and fraud and abuse--and it does exist in this system. Many agree \nwe should use technology to eliminate administrative costs and to \neliminate errors. There is much talk about the need to enhance \ntransparency within the system, as well as the need to increase health \nand wellness efforts to lead to a healthier society. I have heard the \nvalid points made about needing to stem the rising cost of health care \nand bending the health care cost curve. These are easy areas to agree. \nI think there is a middle ground, and I think we should all be standing \nupon it when we are viewing health care reform.\n  However, I am disappointed by the recent health care proposal \nemanating from the HELP Committee--the Affordable Health Choices Act. \nThe legislation does not seem to capture the spirit of the bipartisan \neffort the President indicated he wanted to have in order to accomplish \nthis important task. Instead, the Affordable Health Choices Act is just \nanother government takeover of the health care system. This is not the \nhealth care reform that Americans have asked for, in my opinion.\n  Americans have been promised some things already. They have been \npromised that everyone will receive health care; that they would get to \nkeep their insurance, if they like it; and the government will be \nresponsible and act responsibly in using taxpayer dollars. \nUnfortunately, the current legislation simply doesn't live up to the \npromises.\n  In fact, the legislation has a number of proposals that not only \ndon't live up to the promises, they directly contradict those promises. \nFor example, the report by the Congressional Budget Office states that \n15 million Americans who currently have employer-sponsored insurance \nwill lose that coverage under this proposal. I can rise today and very \nsafely say this isn't a talking point that came off of somebody's \nsheet. This is actually an analysis done by a body that we all rely \nupon--the Congressional Budget Office.\n  These numbers are likely to increase as soon as the figures for the \ngovernment-run public plan are included. After all, the Lewin Group--\nwhich does research in this area--has issued a forecast that a public \nplan would probably cause 119 million people who have employer-provided \nhealth insurance to shift over to the public plan.\n  So let's take a moment to recap. The administration's promise: \nCitizens will get to keep their employer-provided health insurance, if \nthey choose. Reality: CBO says 15 million people will be displaced from \nthat coverage. Reality: The Lewin Group, in its estimate, says that \ncould climb to 119 million Americans dumped from their private \ninsurance onto a government system.\n  Furthermore, CBO indicated that about 39 million individuals would \nreceive coverage through the government insurance exchange. That is the \nconcept in this complex legislation. However, after you factor in those \nwho would lose their employer-based coverage and those who would switch \nfrom other government programs, we are actually only bringing 16 \nmillion currently uninsured people into the fold. In other words, our \ncountry would still have an uninsured rate--after spending over $1 \ntrillion--of 13 percent when the bill is fully implemented.\n  The administration promised coverage for all. Reality: CBO estimates \n13 percent uninsured Americans. That is millions of Americans still not \nhaving access to health care in any meaningful way.\n  Some do claim the analysis doesn't reflect the full proposal. They \nwill make the case that the final report will show that more of the \nuninsured will, in fact, be covered. However, this proposal is already \nestimated to cost $1 trillion over 10 years--a huge pricetag. Not \nsurprisingly, this pricetag is expected to increase. Spending this kind \nof money to only insure 16 million people should be disappointing to \neverybody--disappointing to every American. Just when our economy is \ntrying to achieve some equilibrium, slamming it with these kinds of \ncosts for these few results I don't believe is even a good-faith effort \non our part.\n  I believe everyone wants to solve these complex health care \nchallenges, but I think it is so important to be thoughtful, careful, \nand to take a moment to step back and take a deep breath. It makes no \nsense from a policy standpoint to rush these enormously complex \ndecisions with unbelievable results just to finish by the August \nrecess. It doesn't make any sense. We are talking, Mr. President, about \npeople's health care. We are talking about the health and safety of \ntheir families. As the adage goes: It is better to invest the time to \nget it right the first time instead of getting it wrong expeditiously.\n  We need to get back to a middle ground and follow through on the \npromises that have already been made to provide real health care \nreform--sustainable health care reform. The American people deserve a \nthorough, bipartisan debate on health care, not a rushed, ill-advised \npiecemeal approach to an enormously serious problem. I hope we have \nthat opportunity because this is too important to get wrong.\n  Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity to offer my thoughts. I \nyield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, as we meet on the floor of the Senate, we \nare deliberating a bill about promoting tourism in America, which turns \nout to be a way to increase economic activity, create some business \nactivity, keep people in their jobs, and maybe attract folks from \noverseas to see this beautiful land of ours. We are now in a procedural \nholding pattern. The minority party has asked us to wait 30 hours \nbefore we talk about it. It is unfortunate because we are prepared to \ngo and are ready and we have a lot of things to do, but the rules of \nthe Senate are available for them as for us, and they are utilizing \nthem now to delay and stop action on this bill which is very routine, \nbipartisan, and enjoyed the support of over 90 Senators when it was \ncalled yesterday on a procedural vote.\n  In the meantime, as we are waiting on the floor for the Republicans \nto give us permission to go forward, the committees are at work. I left \nthe Judiciary Committee where the Presiding Officer is also a member, \nwith the Attorney General, where we spoke about some critical issues.\n  Right across the hall from us is the Finance Committee, and they are \ndebating the future of health care in America, and that is a debate \nwhich we are all following very closely.\n  It is clearly time for us to acknowledge the obvious. Although we \nhave some of the best hospitals and doctors in the world, the fact is \nthe cost of health care in America is spinning out of control and if we \ndo not have the political will and courage to step up at\n\n[[Page S6680]]\n\nthis moment in time and address that, it is going to get much worse. \nPeople will find that there will be more uninsured people, people with \nhealth insurance that is not worth much, and that the cost of what you \ncan buy will be so expensive that average people cannot afford it. You \nwill find, if we do not do something, that health insurance companies \nwill continue to exclude people because of preexisting conditions, \ncontinue to argue incessantly with doctors over what the right \nprocedure will be. We will find unfortunately that there will be a \nsituation where we do not have the chance to utilize the very best \nhealth care in this country for needed procedures.\n  Many Senators say: I have listened to that but count me out. I have a \ngreat health insurance plan. I don't need to be part of your debate.\n  What President Obama has said and what we have said in Congress is: \nOK, we accept that. If you have health insurance that you like, that \nyou want to keep, you can keep it. There will not be any change. But if \nyou happen to be one of those Americans who think they can do better \nfor something more affordable or, sadly, if you are one of the 48 \nmillion Americans with no health insurance, for you, we think we have \nto change some of the ways we do business in this country.\n  One of the key elements here, as I mentioned already, is what to do \nwith 48 million uninsured. If these uninsured people had their own \nhealth insurance, it would be a benefit to all the rest of us who \nhappen to have health insurance.\n  Some of these political commentators like to write that Members of \nthe Senate have some special health insurance plans. We are fortunate \nto have one of the best in the world, but it is the same plan Federal \nemployees have across America. Eight million Federal employees and \ntheir families, and Members of Congress who opt to buy into it, have a \nwonderful plan. I am lucky; my wife and I are very fortunate to have \nthat kind of coverage. But for a lot of people, they don't have that \nkind of luxury. Once each year, I can choose from nine different health \ninsurance plans that sell to Federal employees who live in the State of \nIllinois. That is quite a good deal. If I don't like the way I was \ntreated last year by my health insurance company, I can change. It is \nlike buying a car; I have a lot of places to shop and look. But most \nAmericans don't have that. Most Americans do not have the option of \nlooking for health insurance, and if they do, they cannot afford it. If \nyou have to pay for it out of pocket, you may find yourself unable, and \nsmall businesses which want to provide health insurance, not only for \nthe owners but the workers, say: It is just too darned expensive, we \ncannot afford to do it.\n  That is why 48 million Americans--not the poorest because we cover \nthem with Medicaid, and not those lucky enough to have health \ninsurance, but those smack-dab in the middle who get up and work every \nday at businesses, maybe businesses they own, and do not have health \ninsurance. One out of four realtors in America has no health insurance. \nYou don't think of that, but it is a fact. So we work with them to try \nto come up with an approach--that is now being debated by the Finance \nCommittee--to have small businesses and self-employed people have a \nchance to buy health insurance just like Federal employees can buy \nhealth insurance.\n  But we really have to get to the bottom line of this issue. It is not \nenough to just say we are going to cover 48 million Americans currently \nnot covered. That is important because uninsured people who show up at \nthe hospital in America today are not turned away, they are treated. \nWho pays for them if they cannot pay for themselves? The rest of us--\ntaxpayers and people with health insurance. It is estimated that the \naverage family pays an additional $1,000 a year--almost $100 a month--\nfor coverage for uninsured people. We are picking up their health \nexpenses because they do not have health insurance. That is a hidden \ntax. So when we talk about the cost of health care reform, there is a \nreal cost of doing nothing--about $1,000 a year out-of-pocket for most \nAmerican families.\n  We need to move on to the tougher issue, and this is the one debated \nat length here on the floor. The bottom line here is the cost of \nmedical care. We spend twice as much as any other nation on Earth for \nmedical care for our citizens. Sadly, we do not have the results to \nshow for it. If you look at the basic health indicators, many countries \nthat spend far less per person than the United States have much better \noutcomes. You wonder, why is that the case? We have the best hospitals, \nwe have the best doctors, we have all the technology, all the drug \ncompanies. Why are we not the healthiest people in the world?\n  Some of it is our own fault. When you look at the chronic conditions \nthat cost so much in our health care system, it is the choice of the \nperson who decides, I am going to keep smoking cigarettes. That is a \nterrible choice. It can lead to sickness and disease and even death, \nand that is a lifestyle choice people should not make, and they do and \nwe pay dearly for it.\n  Other people do not watch their diets closely. I am certainly no one \nto preach on that. But when we suffer from obesity in this country, \npeople end up in the hospital and end up in doctors' offices 10 times \nmore frequently than people who are not obese. Diabetes comes from \nthat, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart problems--all these \ncan be managed with lifestyle choices and preventive medicine, which we \ndo not focus on in America today, so we need to do more of that.\n  But the other element is we need to have buy-in from doctors and \nhospitals and medical professionals to bring down the cost of health \ncare.\n  There is a widely read article which has been referred to over and \nover, worth repeating, published by a doctor who is a surgeon in \nBoston. His name is Atul Gawande. The article was published in the New \nYorker on June 1. I commend it to everyone following this debate \nbecause most Members of Congress are reading it closely. Dr. Gawande \nwent to McAllen, TX, and wanted to know why the average cost for a \nMedicare patient treatment in that town was $15,000 a year while the \naverage cost in El Paso--and Chicago, I might add--was right at $10,000 \na year. Why did it cost 50 percent more to treat a Medicare patient in \nMcAllen, TX? He took a look and sat down with doctors, and being a \nsurgeon he knew what questions to ask.\n  The first response was: Defensive medicine. We have to order extra \ntests because those lawyers will sue us.\n  Another Doctor said: You know that is not true, Texas has the \ntoughest medical malpractice law in America, limiting pain and \nsuffering awards to $250,000.\n  This doctor went on to say: Nobody is suing us around here. It is not \nabout defensive medicine. If it is, it is a tiny part of it.\n  What it turns out is many of the doctors in that community, and \nhospitals, are ordering more procedures than are needed. If you are a \npatient or the parent of a patient, you are not going to question it \nwhen a doctor says: I think we need an MRI. Are you going to say: \nDoctor, are you sure we need an MRI? You trust his judgment, and that \njudgment, unfortunately, can be very expensive because the doctors in \nthat town are motivated by more procedures, more billing, more money, \nmore profit. That is the wrong motivation. The motivation should be a \nhealthy patient, a good medical outcome.\n  Dr. Gawande contrasted McAllen, TX, with the Mayo Clinic, a fantastic \nmedical resource in Rochester, MN. It treated members of my family, and \nit is one of the best in the Nation. The Mayo Clinic hires the best \ndoctors they can find and pays them by salary. They are not paid by \npatient or how much they bill. So these salaried doctors are looking \nfor good outcomes. They don't want to order anything more than a \npatient needs. They want to get a good outcome. Think of the difference \nin motivation between the doctors in McAllen, TX, and the doctors in \nRochester, MN.\n  The Congressional Budget Office sent a report to us yesterday, and it \nsays if you really want to reduce the costs of health care in America, \nyou have to get to the question of reimbursement. When you talk about \nthat, you will get everybody at the American Medical Association on \ntheir feet, shaking their fists, saying if you cut back on compensation \nand reimbursement for doctors, fewer people will go into the \nprofession, you will not be able to get the\n\n[[Page S6681]]\n\nbest procedures--you understand what they are going to say. I have \nheard it. Many of us have heard it. But we have to find a good way to \napproach this. We have to bring down the rising cost of health care in \nthis country.\n  One of the suggestions is that in addition to private health \ninsurance companies offering health insurance, we have a public option, \nthat we have a plan that really is not motivated by profit, whether it \nis a government-sponsored plan like Medicare or whether it is some \nother plan, a cooperative, which Senator Conrad has proposed, that \nreally says: Let's take the profit out of it and see if we can move \ntoward the best health care outcomes and reduce the costs of health \ninsurance so we get a good medical outcome at a reasonable cost.\n  Some have come to the floor and criticized that idea. I think they \nare wrong. I think if you look at the Medicare system, 45 years after \nwe enacted it, it has been an unqualified success. Just look at how \nlong seniors are living because they have good medical care after they \nreach the age of 65. It is not a question of whether you are rich or \npoor.\n  I run into people in my State of Illinois--a woman, a Realtor who \nsaid to me in Harrisburg, IL: Senator, I want you to meet me. She said: \nI am 64 years old. I have never had health insurance 1 day in my life.\n  I could not believe that. But she said: Next year I am 65. I am going \nto have Medicare. And finally I can breathe a little easier knowing \nthat the savings I have put together are not going to be wiped out with \none trip to the doctor.\n  So we understand that Medicare has worked. And it has created quality \ncare and good outcomes. We also know the Veterans' Administration, \nanother government health insurance approach for the men and women who \nserved our country, whom we honor with a medical system that is there \nfor them, provides some of the best care in our country.\n  We need to find a way to work out these differences. Believe me, at \nthe end of the day there will always be a reason to do nothing. There \nwill be political risk in doing something. But the American people have \nto stick with us in this debate and understand that if we do not \naddress the fundamental issue, it is not just a question of whether we \nwill have deficits as far as the eye can see from medical costs or a \nprogram going through the roof, it is a question of whether we will all \nhave peace of mind of health insurance protection for ourselves and our \nfamilies that makes sure we have something we can afford, based on \nquality that will provide the kind of health care we need. It all comes \naround. Every family faces it. And when that day comes, we want to make \nsure we have done our part. This year, President Obama has challenged \nus, though we are sitting idly on the floor today doing virtually \nnothing except giving speeches. He has told us: Do not go home this \nyear without health care reform.\n  He is right. It is time to roll up our sleeves and get that done.\n  I ask unanimous consent that an article from the New York Times on \nJune 17, this morning, by David Leonhardt entitled ``Health Care \nRationing Rhetoric Overlooks Reality'' be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 17, 2009]\n\n            Health Care Rationing Rhetoric Overlooks Reality\n\n                          (By David Leonhardt)\n\n       Rationing.\n       More to the point: Rationing!\n       As in: Wait, are you talking about rationing medical care? \n     Access to medical care is a fundamental right. And rationing \n     sounds like something out of the Soviet Union. Or at least \n     Canada.\n       The r-word has become a rejoinder to anyone who says that \n     this country must reduce its runaway health spending, \n     especially anyone who favors cutting back on treatments that \n     don't have scientific evidence behind them. You can expect to \n     hear a lot more about rationing as health care becomes the \n     dominant issue in Washington this summer.\n       Today, I want to try to explain why the case against \n     rationing isn't really a substantive argument. It's a clever \n     set of buzzwords that tries to hide the fact that societies \n     must make choices.\n       In truth, rationing is an inescapable part of economic \n     life. It is the process of allocating scarce resources. Even \n     in the United States, the richest society in human history, \n     we are constantly rationing. We ration spots in good public \n     high schools. We ration lakefront homes. We ration the best \n     cuts of steak and wild-caught salmon.\n       Health care, I realize, seems as if it should be different. \n     But it isn't. Already, we cannot afford every form of medical \n     care that we might like. So we ration.\n       We spend billions of dollars on operations, tests and drugs \n     that haven't been proved to make people healthier. Yet we \n     have not spent the money to install computerized medical \n     records--and we suffer more medical errors than many other \n     countries.\n       We underpay primary care doctors, relative to specialists, \n     and they keep us stewing in waiting rooms while they try to \n     see as many patients as possible. We don't reimburse \n     different specialists for time spent collaborating with one \n     another, and many hard-to-diagnose conditions go untreated. \n     We don't pay nurses to counsel people on how to improve their \n     diets or remember to take their pills, and manageable cases \n     of diabetes and heart disease become fatal.\n       ``Just because there isn't some government agency \n     specifically telling you which treatments you can have based \n     on cost-effectiveness,'' as Dr. Mark McClellan, head of \n     Medicare in the Bush administration, says, ``that doesn't \n     mean you aren't getting some treatments.''\n       Milton Friedman's beloved line is a good way to frame the \n     issue: There is no such thing as a free lunch. The choice \n     isn't between rationing and not rationing. It's between \n     rationing well and rationing badly. Given that the United \n     States devotes far more of its economy to health care than \n     other rich countries, and gets worse results by many \n     measures, it's hard to argue that we are now rationing very \n     rationally.\n       On Wednesday, a bipartisan panel led by four former Senate \n     majority leaders--Howard Baker, Tom Daschle, Bob Dole and \n     George Mitchell--will release a solid proposal for health \n     care reform. Among other things, it would call on the federal \n     government to do more research on which treatments actually \n     work. An ``independent health care council'' would also be \n     established, charged with helping the government avoid \n     unnecessary health costs. The Obama administration supports a \n     similar approach.\n       And connecting the dots is easy enough. Armed with better \n     information, Medicare could pay more for effective \n     treatments--and no longer pay quite so much for health care \n     that doesn't make people healthier.\n       Mr. Baker, Mr. Daschle, Mr. Dole and Mr. Mitchell: I accuse \n     you of rationing.\n       There are three main ways that the health care system \n     already imposes rationing on us. The first is the most \n     counterintuitive, because it doesn't involve denying medical \n     care. It involves denying just about everything else.\n       The rapid rise in medical costs has put many employers in a \n     tough spot. They have had to pay much higher insurance \n     premiums, which have increased their labor costs. To make up \n     for these increases, many have given meager pay raises.\n       This tradeoff is often explicit during contract \n     negotiations between a company and a labor union. For \n     nonunionized workers, the tradeoff tends to be invisible. It \n     happens behind closed doors in the human resources \n     department. But it still happens.\n       Research by Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra of \n     Harvard has found that, on average, a 10 percent increase in \n     health premiums leads to a 2.3 percent decline in inflation-\n     adjusted pay. Victor Fuchs, a Stanford economist, and Ezekiel \n     Emanuel, an oncologist now in the Obama administration, \n     published an article in The Journal of the American Medical \n     Association last year that nicely captured the tradeoff. When \n     health costs have grown fastest over the last two decades, \n     they wrote, wages have grown slowest, and vice versa.\n       So when middle-class families complain about being \n     stretched thin, they're really complaining about rationing. \n     Our expensive, inefficient health care system is eating up \n     money that could otherwise pay for a mortgage, a car, a \n     vacation or college tuition.\n       The second kind of rationing involves the uninsured. The \n     high cost of care means that some employers can't afford to \n     offer health insurance and still pay a competitive wage. \n     Those high costs mean that individuals can't buy insurance on \n     their own.\n       The uninsured still receive some health care, obviously. \n     But they get less care, and worse care, than they need. The \n     Institute of Medicine has estimated that 18,000 people died \n     in 2000 because they lacked insurance. By 2006, the number \n     had risen to 22,000, according to the Urban Institute.\n       The final form of rationing is the one I described near the \n     beginning of this column: the failure to provide certain \n     types of care, even to people with health insurance. Doctors \n     are generally not paid to do the blocking and tackling of \n     medicine: collaboration, probing conversations with patients, \n     small steps that avoid medical errors. Many doctors still do \n     such things, out of professional pride. But the full medical \n     system doesn't do nearly enough.\n       That's rationing--and it has real consequences.\n       In Australia, 81 percent of primary care doctors have set \n     up a way for their patients to get after-hours care, \n     according to the Commonwealth Fund. In the United States, \n     only 40 percent have. Overall, the survival rates for many \n     diseases in this country are no better than they are in \n     countries that spend far less on health care. People here are\n\n[[Page S6682]]\n\n     less likely to have long-term survival after colorectal \n     cancer, childhood leukemia or a kidney transplant than they \n     are in Canada--that bastion of rationing.\n       None of this means that reducing health costs will be easy. \n     The comparative-effectiveness research favored by the former \n     Senate majority leaders and the White House has inspired \n     opposition from some doctors, members of Congress and patient \n     groups. Certainly, the critics are right to demand that the \n     research be done carefully. It should examine different forms \n     of a disease and, ideally, various subpopulations who have \n     the disease. Just as important, scientists--not political \n     appointees or Congress--should be in charge of the research.\n       But flat-out opposition to comparative effectiveness is, in \n     the end, opposition to making good choices. And all the noise \n     about rationing is not really a courageous stand against less \n     medical care. It's a utopian stand against better medical \n     care.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, moments from now, President Obama will \nunveil his administration's long-awaited proposal to restructure and \nreform our Nation's financial regulatory system. I wish to take a few \nminutes to share my initial reactions to some of the most important \nfeatures in the President's plan.\n  At the outset, let me say the President and his financial team \ndeserve considerable credit for tackling this critical issue. It is \nimportant that all of us recognize how critical Federal financial \nregulatory reform is and that we not put this issue off until some \ndistant future. When the present crisis is behind us--something we all \nhope will be sooner rather than later--other issues will demand our \nattention and calls for reform, I fear, will begin to fade. If that \nhappens, our financial system would remain flawed, and these flaws must \nbe corrected or they will emerge, once again, in the future to threaten \nour prosperity and to imperil financial markets.\n  In several aspects, the President's financial reform proposal \nparallels legislation I introduced in March to fundamentally transform \nour Nation's financial regulatory system. The bill I introduced would \ncreate a council of financial regulators to act as a systemic risk \nmonitor. The bill would also require stronger safety and soundness \nstandards and would close the loophole on the regulation of credit \ndefault swaps. It would eliminate the Office of Thrift Supervision, \namong other provisions.\n  There is widespread consensus that we do need a system, a measure for \nreviewing systemic risk. We need to have one entity that is responsible \nfor looking across the financial markets and financial institutions and \nidentifying regulatory black holes and high-risk practices or products \nthat could put our financial markets at risk. For this reason, I am \npleased the administration is proposing the creation of a council of \nregulators to ensure that many perspectives and areas of expertise are \nbrought to the table.\n  As we know now from bitter experience, we do not have, currently, any \nentity charged with evaluating risk across the financial spectrum. As a \nresult, we saw institutions take on far more leverage than was \nappropriate. We saw exotic new derivatives that were poorly disclosed, \nnot well understood, and lightly regulated, if at all, develop over the \nlast few years and imperil our financial markets. So it is critical \nthat we have an entity--and I believe a council of regulators is the \nbest entity--to look across the financial markets rather than having \neach regulator view its regulatory responsibilities and regulated \nentities through a narrow prism.\n  To my mind, the President's decision to rely on a council model makes \nhis proposal far more practical and effective than alternatives which \nwould have required the restructuring of most or all of the financial \nagencies that currently oversee the financial system. The effort to \nachieve that kind of massive change and consolidation would take many \nyears to implement. As the experience in the United Kingdom \ndemonstrates, it would be no guarantee that our Nation's economy would \nbe shielded from systemic risk, even after such a consolidation were \nimplemented.\n  Under the legislation I have introduced, a financial stability \ncouncil would be the primary entity responsible for detecting systemic \nrisk and taking action to protect against that risk. While I am pleased \nthe President has chosen the council of regulators model as well, I \ndiffer with his proposal to have the Secretary of the Treasury serve as \nthe head of the council. Instead, I believe the council's chairman \nshould be independent of any of the regulatory agencies serving on the \ncouncil and that it is important that that chairman devote his or her \nfull energies to that role and not have other important \nresponsibilities.\n  It is also important that individual be subject to congressional \noversight, be presidentially appointed, and Senate confirmed.\n  I do believe, however, that the President made the right choice in \nnot assigning this role to the Federal Reserve. That is a model that \nhas been discussed, that perhaps the Federal Reserve should take on the \nresponsibility of the systemic risk monitor. The Chairman of the Fed \nwould be a member of the council, I have advocated, and, of course, the \nNation's top banker would play a critical role in how the council \ndischarges its responsibilities. But, in my view, the Federal Reserve \nalready has plenty on its plate--including, after all, the conduct of \nmonetary policy--and should not be distracted from those primary \nresponsibilities by being asked to lead the new council.\n  There are several other important provisions in the President's plan \non which I would like to comment. First, with respect to the too-big-\nto-fail problem, my bill would give the council the authority to make \nsure large financial institutions do not imperil the system by imposing \nhigher capital requirements on them as they grow in size or raising \ntheir risk premiums or requiring them to hold a larger percentage of \ntheir debt as long-term debt. The President also proposes that the \ncouncil play a role in setting these requirements. We have to get away \nfrom the problem we have now where we create a moral hazard. A firm \nknows if it becomes big enough and engages in sufficiently risky \nprocesses or practices, Uncle Sam is going to step in and bail that \ninstitution out. That is exactly the wrong message for us to be \nsending.\n  It is astonishing to me that our regulatory system was so lax and had \nso many gaps in it that we could have this huge market in credit \ndefault swaps arise where they were regulated neither as a security or \nas insurance; that we can have a situation where a large firm such as \nBear Sterns has a leverage ratio that exceeds 30 to 1 and no regulator \nis stepping in; that we can have all of those kinds of problems. That \nis what we have to act to prevent.\n  The approach to too big to fail is one we have to undertake \ncarefully, however. I don't think it makes sense to put some arbitrary \nlimit on how big a firm can get, but I do believe that with increased \nsize should come increased scrutiny by the regulators and higher \ncapital requirements.\n  The TARP congressional oversight panel has adopted a similar \nposition. As the panel has explained:\n\n       We should not identify specific institutions in advance as \n     too big to fail, but rather have a regulatory framework in \n     which institutions have higher capital requirements and pay \n     more on insurance funds on a percentage basis than smaller \n     institutions which are less likely to be rescued as being too \n     systemic to fail.\n\n  Second, I support the idea of requiring that lenders keep some ``skin \nin the game'' when dealing in asset-backed securities. One of the big \nproblems with the current system is risk has become divorced from \nresponsibility. The mortgage broker gets paid for finding the client, \nplacing the loan with a financial institution, and then has no further \nobligation. The financial institution that is underwriting the loan\n\n[[Page S6683]]\n\nends up selling it on the secondary market so, again, it has no further \nobligation. This system goes on and on and on. So I think the President \nis right about requiring everyone along the chain to have a financial \ninterest in the ultimate health of the mortgage.\n  Since last spring, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee, of which I am the ranking member and Senator Lieberman is \nthe chairman, has held a series of hearings on the roots of the present \nfinancial crisis. One problem consistently raised by the experts is the \nfact that asset-backed securities allowed lenders to sell their loans \nto investors and thereby avoid the risk that borrowers might default on \nthese loans. That encouraged looser lending standards, and led to the \nboom and ultimately the bust in the housing market.\n  I understand the ability to sell those loans gives more liquidity and \nallows for additional mortgages to be made. But I think if you required \nthe lenders to retain an interest in the loan, they are going to have \nmore at stake when it comes to the financial security of the loan and, \nindeed, whether the loan should have been made in the first place.\n  Third, I am intrigued by the President's proposal to reform the role \nplayed by credit rating agencies. I am deeply concerned by the failure \nof these agencies to provide meaningful warning of the riskiness of \ninvestments backed by subprime loans, even after the market's downturn. \nI am very troubled by the way the system works now, where essentially \nthere is an auction, there is ``ratings shopping,'' and there are \nconflicts of interest inherent in the system.\n  Fourth, I support the President's proposal to regulate and bring \ntransparency to the derivatives market, including the over-the-counter \nmarket. This is a large, complex market where some companies are trying \nto enter into legitimate hedging contracts, but other financial \ninstitutions have been engaged in a tangled web of interlocking \ncontracts that are extremely difficult to properly evaluate.\n  The lack of regulation and transparency in this area led to the near \nfailure of AIG, which had engaged in hundreds of these contracts in the \nform of credit default swaps. As the financial crisis deepened, the \nAmerican taxpayer was forced to bail out AIG with at least $70 billion \ndue to the uncertainty of the impact of these credit default swaps on \nthe economy as a whole. But AIG's experience should not be used as an \nexcuse to alter the traditional authority of States to regulate \ninsurance.\n  It was a noninsurance financial subsidiary of AIG that led to the \ndebacle. AIG's insurance business remained pretty healthy. The problems \nwere in the financial services unit, and I do not think it is a \ncoincidence that unit was regulated by the Office of Thrift \nSupervision, primarily, which has been long recognized as the weak \nsister when it comes to bank regulators. That is why both my bill and \nthe effect of the President's proposal is to do away with that \nregulator and to have a consolidated regulator.\n  Fifth, I need to learn more about the President's proposal to \nconsolidate consumer protection for financial products into one agency. \nThe current financial regulatory agencies--whether the bank regulators \nor the Securities and Exchange Commission or the CFTC--all have an \nimportant role to play in consumer protection, a role that has not \nalways been played adequately in the last few years. Is the answer, \nhowever, to the problems we have seen simply to remove consumer \nprotection from the bank regulators' responsibilities? I am not sure \nthat is the right response. I think we need to look very closely at \nthis issue.\n  Finally, I welcome the President's proposal to provide Federal \nregulators with resolution authority over holding companies and other \nnonbank financial institutions similar to the kind the FDIC has over \nbanks. This lack of authority presented Federal regulators with a \nHobson's choice with respect to nonbank financial institutions such as \nAIG: bail them out or allow them to fail, notwithstanding the damage to \nthe economy as a whole.\n  Madam President, let me conclude my comments.\n  As a former Maine financial regulator, I am convinced that financial \nregulatory reform is absolutely essential to restoring confidence in \nour financial markets and to preventing a recurrence of a crisis such \nas the one we now face.\n  I applaud the administration for making this reform a priority.\n  America's Main Street small businesses, homeowners, employees, \nsavers, and investors deserve the protection of an effective, new \nregulatory system that modernizes regulatory agencies, sets safety and \nsoundness requirements for financial institutions to prevent excessive \nleverage, and improves oversight, accountability, and transparency. I \nlook forward to working closely with the administration to achieve \nthese goals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6683-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Paris Air Show\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I rise today to draw attention to an \nevent that is going on across the Atlantic Ocean and how it impacts \nthousands of good-paying family-wage jobs right here in the United \nStates.\n  As some of my colleagues know, the Paris Air Show kicked off this \nweek. The air show showcases many impressive displays of aviation, \ntechnology, and innovation.\n  But there is something else that is going to be on display at this \nyear's air show: the fruits of some 30-plus years of direct cash \nadvances and illegal subsidies to the European aerospace company \nAirbus.\n  For more than three decades now, the European governments that \ncreated Airbus to specifically compete with the United States have \naggressively funded, protected, and promoted their venture.\n  Since 1969, the European governments of France, Germany, Spain, and \nthe UK have supported--the governments have supported--Airbus's \ncommercial aircraft development with over $15 billion in launch aid. \nThose are high-risk loans at no- or low-interest, with repayment \ncontingent on the commercial success of the aircraft.\n  According to the USTR, the amount of launch aid Airbus has received \nduring the lifetime of that company--if it was repaid on commercial \nterms--is well over $100 billion.\n  Such massive, market-distorting subsidies to a private company are \ntoday allowing Airbus to offer incentives for airlines to buy their \nplanes. Airbus is a mature company, with more than half of the market \nfor large commercial aircraft. But Europe is still treating it as a \ncompany with kid gloves.\n  In fact, last week, Bloomberg News reported that Airbus is seeking \napproximately $5 billion in launch aid from the governments of France, \nGermany, Spain, and the UK to now fund the development of the Airbus \nA350. Reports indicate that the deal could be completed within the \nmonth.\n  If we want to keep a strong aerospace industry in America, we cannot \nlet that happen. Every time European governments underwrite Airbus with \nsubsidies, our American workers get pink slips.\n  If we want to lead the world in commercial aerospace, our message to \nEurope has to be strong and clear: No more illegal subsidies to prop up \nAirbus. And Airbus has to compete in the marketplace just like \neverybody else.\n  I am deeply troubled that Airbus is considering pursuing now \nadditional illegal, trade-distorting subsidies that, in effect, have \ncaused adverse effects on the American aerospace industry at\n\n[[Page S6684]]\n\nthe same time the European Union is being sued in the World Trade \nOrganization for those such practices.\n  That is why I am writing to Ambassador John Bruton urging the EU to \nshow it is serious about pursuing fair trade practices with the United \nStates by ending any discussion or movement forward on those subsidies.\n  The message sent by the U.S. Government is very clear.\n  On April 11, 2005, this Senate unanimously adopted Senate Concurrent \nResolution 25. That resolution called for European governments to \nreject launch aid for the A350.\n  Launch aid for the A350 or any other form of preferential financing \nfor Airbus is unacceptable. We will not tolerate another round of \nsubsidies that kill our American jobs.\n  In addition to the trade-distorting subsidies now being talked about \nin Paris, there are other distortions showing up in the news accounts \nas well.\n  Several weeks ago, I had the opportunity here in the Senate to \nquestion Air Force Secretary Michael Donley at our Defense \nAppropriations Subcommittee. I told him about my concerns for the \nfuture of our domestic industrial base and how I believe the future \ncapabilities of both our domestic workforce and our military must be \ntaken into account as we work to reform our procurement process.\n  Secretary Donley agreed that the Pentagon has an interest in ensuring \nthat our industrial base issues are taken into account.\n  That response now has some of Airbus's top executives upset and once \nagain distorting the facts. In newspaper reports over the weekend, the \nchief executive of EADS--which is Airbus's parent company--Louis \nGallois, claims that if Airbus is selected to build the next generation \nof military refueling tankers, they would create more jobs than \ncompetition for the U.S. aerospace industry.\n  That is pretty hard to swallow. In fact, a year ago, in June 2008, an \nindependent, nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute study concluded that \nthe now-overturned decision to award the tanker contract to Airbus \nwould have actually cost the United States 14,000 jobs.\n  The truth is, Airbus does not even have a plant here in the United \nStates and their well-documented plan is to build their tanker airplane \nin Europe and then ship sections over here to the United States to be \nassembled.\n  The Boeing tanker, however, would be built in Everett, WA, and \nmilitary capabilities would be added at the company's defense plant in \nWichita, KS.\n  Suppliers in States across America would be supported by that \ncontract. A Boeing-made tanker is estimated to support and create twice \nas many American jobs as an Airbus plane.\n  But it is not just about jobs. This is about the future of America's \ndomestic industrial strength. Our government depends on our highly \nskilled industries--our manufacturers, our engineers, our researchers--\nand our development and science base to keep the U.S. military stocked \nwith the best and most advanced tools and equipment available.\n  So whether it is our scientists who are designing the next generation \nof military satellites or our engineers who are improving our radar \nsystems or our machinists who are assembling our planes, these \nindustries and their workers are one of America's greatest strategic \nassets.\n  We ought to ask the question: What if they were not available \nanymore? What if we here made budgetary and policy decisions without \ntaking into account the future needs of our domestic workforce?\n  That is not impossible. It is not unthinkable. It is actually \nhappening. And it is time to have a real dialog here about the \nramifications of these decisions before we lose our capability to \nprovide our military with the tools and equipment they need. Because \nonce our plants shut down and our skilled workers move to other fields, \nand once all the infrastructure we have here is gone, it cannot be \nrebuilt overnight.\n  As a Senator from Washington State, I represent five military bases \nand many of our military contractors and suppliers, and, believe me, I \nam keenly aware of the important relationship between our military and \nthe producers who keep them protected with their latest technological \nadvances.\n  I have also seen the ramifications of the Pentagon's decisions on \ncommunities and workers and families. As many of my colleagues know, I \nhave been sounding the alarm about a declining domestic aerospace \nindustry for years. The American aerospace industry has taken hits from \nthe economic climate, but it is also being undermined by unfair trade \npractices and these illegal subsidies of the type that are now being \ntalked about this week in France.\n  This isn't just about one company or one State or one industry; this \nis about our Nation's economic stability, it is about our skill base, \nand it is about our future military capability. We have watched as our \ndomestic base has shrunk, as competition has disappeared, and as our \nmilitary has looked overseas for the products we have the capability to \nproduce from scratch--not just assemble but produce from scratch--here \nat home.\n  Last month, I worked with some of our colleagues in the Senate to \ninclude a provision in the Defense Acquisitions Reform Act that has now \nbeen signed by the President. My provision draws the attention of the \nPentagon leadership to consider the effects of their decisions on our \nindustrial base and its ability to meet our future national security \nobjectives. These decisions should not be made in a vacuum without \nregard to the long-term capabilities of our industrial base and the \nworkers who are its backbone.\n  Last weekend, EADS head Louis Gallois said:\n\n       We will see at the end of the day who is creating more \n     jobs. We are starting from scratch in Alabama. We have to \n     create an industrial base.\n\n  Well, America has a highly skilled aerospace industrial base. It has \ntaken a very long time to build it. We have machinists today who have \npast experience and know-how down the ranks for over 50 years. We have \nengineers who know our mission and know the needs of our soldiers and \nsailors and airmen and marines and they have a reputation for \ndelivering for our U.S. military.\n  I believe we need to move forward with a fair and transparent rebid \nof the tanker contract. The comments and the actions coming out of \nFrance this week have been anything but. But, again, this isn't just \nabout one contract; this is about our Nation's economic stability, it \nis about our military capability, and it is about ensuring that our \nworkers are a consideration in the decisions we are making on major \ndefense contracts.\n  It took us a long time to build our industrial base, and it is built \non the best America has to offer: Our innovative spirit, our dedication \nto this country and, most importantly, our Nation's workers. We have to \nwork to preserve it, and we need to stand against unfair and illegal \ntrade practices such as the ones that are being talked about at the \nParis Air Show this week.\n  The Presiding Officer and I both know we are in the middle of a \nrecession. We are engaged in wars abroad. These are two separate but \nnot unrelated challenges. We have the ability in America to provide our \nmilitary with the equipment they need to defend our Nation and project \nour might worldwide. But I fear, unless we stand for our industrial \nbase today, we stand to lose the backbone of our military might, some \nof our best-paying American jobs, and our economic strength in the \nfuture.\n  Now is the time to take this stand and stand for our military and for \nour workers. It is critical to preserving America's future strength.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Auto Manufacturers Bankruptcy\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to speak about the \nupdate on the Chrysler and GM bankruptcy and their impact on the auto \ndealer community.\n  Almost 4 weeks ago, when we were considering the supplemental \nappropriations bill, I offered an amendment to provide at least 60 days \nfor any dealer being terminated by an auto manufacturer receiving TARP \nfunding to\n\n[[Page S6685]]\n\nwind down its operations and sell its inventory. My amendment was in \nresponse to the letter sent to 789 Chrysler dealers May 13, 2009, \ninforming them they were being terminated on June 9--3 weeks later--\nwith no assistance for auto inventory, parts, or special tools. I found \nthat unacceptable. And you know, a number of the people who heard my \namendment on the floor stepped up and said: I want to cosponsor that \namendment. By the end of the day, we had 38 bipartisan cosponsors on \nthe amendment to give these valued members of our communities at least \n60 days to wind down their businesses. As a result of that amendment \nand thorough discussions with Chrysler president Jim Press and the Auto \nTask Force, Chrysler responded with a commitment to facilitate the \ntransfer of inventory and parts for the terminated dealers.\n  As soon as we returned from Memorial Day recess, Chairman Rockefeller \nand I called a Commerce Committee hearing specifically on the impact of \nthe Chrysler and GM bankruptcy on the auto dealer community. This \nhearing provided the first outlet for dealers to express their opinions \non how they were being treated in this process, and it gave Chrysler \nand GM CEOs the opportunity to explain their reasoning for the \ntermination of literally thousands of dealerships across the country. \nWe pressed the auto manufacturer executives to reconsider how they were \ntreating these independent business men and women, and we sought \nprogress reports on their commitments to me, our committee, and this \nbody to provide a softer landing for terminated dealerships.\n  In response to the concerns we raised in that hearing, Chrysler did \ntake another step forward on behalf of its terminated dealers by \nformally guaranteeing that every piece of inventory at these \ndealerships would be purchased at cost, minus inspection and \ntransportation fees. So they made the promise after the Memorial Day \nrecess that they would buy every car.\n  This reassuring news, of course, was welcome to the dealer body, but \nwe still had concerns. I continued to push Chrysler for assurances \nregarding parts and equipment. The Commerce Committee sought additional \nanswers on transparency, dealer reentry, rural access, and continuation \nagreements in both Chrysler and General Motors. On Monday, I received a \nletter that I thought was very positive from Chrysler, acknowledging \nthe need for assurances on parts. They have now guaranteed 100 percent \nof the parts inventory for terminated dealers.\n  So we have a situation here where they did listen. They eventually \nsaid they would buy all of the cars that were still left in inventory, \nand now, of course, they are going to buy the parts. Of course, the \ndealers that were being terminated had no use for the parts which they \nhad already purchased, and so I think that was a fair ending to that \ndilemma.\n  I also wish to point out another part of the answer to the Commerce \nCommittee letter, which is on dealer terminations and market reentry. \nOne of the things that came out in our hearing is that in some places \nall of the dealerships in the area were being closed, yet we had word \nthat there were new people coming in seeking financing or a new \ndealership in the same place. That didn't quite ring right with us, and \nso we did ask for assurances that any dealer that was terminated would \nhave some ability to come back in if another dealership was going to be \nput in that area. And here is what Mr. Press said in the letter of June \n12, 2009:\n\n       Chrysler Group LLC will commit to provide nonretained \n     dealers with an opportunity for first consideration of new \n     dealerships that the company may contemplate.\n\n  We sent the same request for information to the General Motors CEO, \nand his answer was:\n\n       You have asked about situations where GM will authorize the \n     establishment of a new dealership near the location where a \n     current, profitable dealer has been asked to wind down \n     operations. It is not our plan for current dealerships to be \n     wound down only to open up new dealerships. Rather, our plan \n     is to reduce overall dealer count. However, in those rare \n     instances where we do open a new dealership, in an area \n     previously served by a winding down dealer, we commit to \n     provide advance notice to former dealers and allow them an \n     advanced opportunity to apply to run the new dealership.\n\n  I think that is a step in the right direction, and I hope that will \nbe followed through on in a legitimate and positive way because it \nwould be the most cruel cut for a dealer that has been closed--a dealer \nthat is profitable--to all of a sudden have a new dealer come in and \nopen on the same ground or in the same area as the dealer that was \nclosed at great loss.\n  Remember, we have a dealer now with a huge piece of real estate. \nThese auto dealerships are big lots because they have all these cars on \nthem. So they are big pieces of real estate, and they are big buildings \nthat are generally suited just for the purpose of an automobile \nshowroom, and they have been left or sort of stuck with this real \nestate and stuck with all of the other equipment and things you have to \nhave to run a business. So I think it is untenable for us to just close \nthat person down and then 3 months later suddenly have a new person \ncome in without all of those expenses and have the opportunity to open \na new dealership.\n  So I thought that was a very important part of the letter and \ncommitment that is being made. But, of course, the commitment has to be \nfollowed through with--a responsible advance notice and a fair hearing \nfor the dealer that has gone out of business to be able to come back \nin.\n  I commend Chrysler for heeding the calls of Members of Congress and \nthe dealer community and responding in a way that does give additional \nsupport to the dealers.\n  General Motors, meanwhile, did sit down with the National Auto \nDealers Association after our Commerce Committee hearing to work out \nconcerns with the supplemental agreements continuing dealers were asked \nto sign. I commend GM for making concessions during those discussions, \nand I hope they will continue that positive dialog and interaction as \nthe GM dealer network seeks additional information, support, and \nassistance.\n  I will continue to work with the auto manufacturers to provide our \ndealer communities with the support and assistance they need in this \nvery challenging time.\n  I am worried about what is happening to many communities in my State \nand all over America because so often auto dealers are such a pillar of \nthe community. They are very community oriented. They advertise, they \nsupport the Little League, they support the United Way, and they \nsupport the high school football programs. They are community citizens, \nand they are always the first one to step up when the community needs \nsomething.\n  It has been stated that closing these dealerships is necessary, even \nwhere it is the only dealership in town and even when it is profitable. \nBut the dealer takes all of the risk. They buy the cars, they buy the \nparts, they buy the special equipment, they have the real estate costs. \nThey take the risks, not the manufacturer.\n  I am not convinced that cutting down on the number of dealerships is \nthe most productive thing for this economy today. We are trying to keep \njobs. We are trying to keep communities going. We are trying to keep \nour economy steady and growing. Why we are closing down dealers and \nputting people out of jobs when they are profitable and contributing to \nthe community is, frankly, lost on me. In fact, I asked Mr. Ron Bloom, \nwho is a member of the Auto Task Force, at a Banking Committee hearing \nafter the Commerce Committee hearing. I said: Why did the task force \nask both GM and Chrysler to go back to the drawing board and eliminate \nmore dealerships than their original plan?\n  He acknowledged they did this. Again, he gave us the argument that \nfewer dealerships will be better for sales of these cars and trucks.\n  I still, I am honest to admit, do not understand why he believes \nthat; why Mr. Bloom or the Auto Task Force or GM or Chrysler believe \nwhen the dealers take the risk, and they are profitable, that it will \nincrease sales to eliminate those dealerships. I certainly do not \nunderstand how the task force, which is part of the White House, would \nnot see that this is going to hurt the economy in the long run--putting \npeople out of jobs, thousands of people out of jobs. It is \ncounterintuitive to me.\n  However, it is being done. All we are trying to do is help the people \nwho are being shut down to have the first rights to new dealerships \nthat would open, and to make sure they are treated as\n\n[[Page S6686]]\n\nfairly as possible. You cannot say it is fair because getting 3 weeks' \nnotice to shut down an auto dealership is not fair. GM has given a \nlonger time period, but although the GM company is saying: You will \nhave until next year, 2010, to shut down your dealerships, yet the ones \nthat have gotten the notice that they are going to be closed under GM \nare being told they cannot buy any new cars to sell. They can wind down \nthe inventory they have, but they cannot stay in business until 2010 if \nthey cannot get access to new automobiles and parts.\n  It does not seem as though that is going to work very well either. I \nam hoping GM is going to also be a little more responsible in trying to \nhelp those that are being closed, with some ability to wind down in a \nmore constructive way.\n  As we continue these discussions between the dealer community and the \nauto manufacturers, I certainly hope we will be able to keep track of \nthe progress. I would like to continue to get the progress reports, to \nsee how these automobile companies are doing, and to get input from the \ndealers. It has been a very tough blow to them, especially those that \ndid not see it coming because they were profitable, or like one of my \nconstituents who had a profitable dealership in a location in Galveston \nCounty for years and years and years and then was told that he was \ngoing to be closed, even though he has dealerships in other parts of \nthe Houston area, he was being closed in Galveston County and, of \ncourse, Galveston was struck by a terrible hurricane--Ike--last year \nand his business was down in the Galveston location. That is not \nsurprising.\n  Many people have not been able to move back to Galveston County \nbecause their homes were destroyed and they have no ability to live in \nGalveston County anymore. At least until very recently there was no \nopportunity for my constituent to appeal to General Motors because they \nwere going to lose all their rights, if they appealed, to any of the \nconcessions that were being made to closing dealers. It is a very \ntroubling situation.\n  I think we are making progress. I think GM and Chrysler are doing \nbetter with regard to the dealers, and I hope they will continue to \nunderstand these are important parts of communities all over America, \nthese franchises that they have put out. They have been encouraged to \nbuy inventory to try to help the companies not to go into bankruptcy, \nand then when they did go into bankruptcy they were sort of left high \nand dry. I think it is our responsibility--particularly in the case of \nGM and Chrysler, because they are getting taxpayer dollars--that they \nshould have a little more concern about the overall economy because it \nis tax dollars that are propping them up.\n  I ask unanimous consent the letters that Senator Rockefeller and I \nreceived from Mr. Henderson and Mr. Press, of GM and Chrysler \nrespectively, be printed in the Record, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                   General Motors Corporation,\n\n                                       Detroit, MI, June 12, 2009.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller, IV,\n     Chairman, Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, \n         Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Commerce, Science and \n         Transportation, Russell Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman and Senator Hutchison: Thank you for your \n     letter regarding rationalizing of the General Motors dealer \n     network. I appreciate the time that you have devoted to \n     understand the issues facing GM and the efforts we are \n     undertaking to restructure the company for future viability. \n     I appreciate the thoughtful questions and comments concerning \n     how we decided which dealers should remain with the new \n     company and the impact of those decisions on the dealers and \n     the communities in which they operate.\n       Dealers are critical to the future of GM. Strengthening our \n     dealer network will make that future possible, and preserve \n     over 200,000 jobs at GM's remaining dealers, along with \n     hundreds of thousands of jobs with GM's direct manufacturing \n     and supplier network. As I stated in my testimony, \n     restructuring our dealer network is quite painful--for us, \n     and especially for our dealers. Many of our dealers operate \n     businesses that have been in their families for generations. \n     Our actions affect them personally as well as financially. \n     They also affect the communities and states where our dealers \n     live and work.\n       That is why we are conducting our GM dealer restructuring \n     thoughtfully and objectively and in consultation with our \n     dealers. We decided not to outright terminate dealers, and \n     instead developed a unique wind-down process that we believe \n     is considerably more equitable.\n       The issues that you raise generally result from our \n     bankruptcy. I have stated on many occasions that bankruptcy \n     was not the preferred option for GM to restructuring itself \n     for future viability. Many in and outside of Congress called \n     for a GM bankruptcy, and urged the company to use a court \n     administered bankruptcy process. As economic conditions \n     worsened, and we face the equivalent of an economic \n     depression in the auto market, bankruptcy became the only \n     option for GM to restructure and survive.\n\n\n                 Wind Down and Participation Agreements\n\n       During the hearing, many issues were raised about the \n     agreements GM asked its dealers to sign, either to wind down \n     operations or continue with the New GM. GM crafted these \n     agreements to provide dealers with more options than they \n     would otherwise have.\n       With respect to the wind down agreements, we carefully \n     drafted them to provide the dealers financial assistance, \n     flexibility and choice regarding the time they take to \n     orderly wind down their business. We did not terminate any \n     dealers, rather providing them with options to sell and \n     service vehicles for up to 16 months. This approach is in \n     stark contrast to what happens to most contracts in \n     bankruptcy, where contracts are typically simply rejected \n     with no assistance.\n       With regard to the participation agreements, we continue to \n     respect and follow state franchise law and provide a new \n     operating approach that will benefit both the dealer and GM. \n     We respectfully disagree that the participation agreements \n     are onerous or otherwise improper. At the hearing, the \n     National Automobile Dealers Association witness and some \n     Senators raised questions about the participation agreements. \n     I committed to you that we would quickly meet with NADA to \n     better understand their concerns. We are pleased to report \n     that GM and NADA, as well as representatives of the GM \n     National Dealer Council, reached an understanding of the key \n     issues and as a result, on June 9, GM sent a letter to each \n     dealer we had asked to sign a participation agreement which \n     clarified the important issues, including that the dealers \n     retained certain rights afforded by state law. I have \n     attached for you a copy of the dealer letter as well as the \n     GM and NADA press releases on these clarifications. I can \n     assure you that GM respects the rights of dealers and \n     consider them key and critical to the success of the New GM.\n\n\n                         Dealer Market Re-Entry\n\n       You have also asked about situations where GM will \n     authorize the establishment of a new dealership near the \n     location where a current, profitable dealer has been asked to \n     wind down operations. It is not our plan for current \n     dealerships to be wound down only to open up new dealerships. \n     Rather, our plan is to reduce overall dealer count. However, \n     in those rare instances where we do open a new dealership, in \n     an area previously served by a winding down dealer, we commit \n     to provide advance notice to former dealers and allow them an \n     advanced opportunity to apply to run the new dealership.\n       When rationalizing our dealer network we looked at several \n     factors, including profitability. Over two thirds of the \n     dealerships that received wind down agreements were not \n     profitable. Profitability is only one measure of a dealer's \n     suitability for a future dealership opportunity. Equally \n     important are the dealer's prior sales performance, customer \n     satisfaction performance, needed funding and ability to \n     provide acceptable dealership facilities. While a profitable \n     dealer may provide high levels of customer service, it is not \n     always true, and unfortunately a profitable dealer may rank \n     among our poor performers. Even after the dealer \n     rationalization General Motors will continue to have the \n     largest and most extensive dealer network in the U.S.\n\n\n              Litigation Pending Before Bankruptcy Filing\n\n       The treatment of lawsuits and other claims is an important \n     issue. All claimants will have the opportunity to submit \n     their claims and have them resolved as provided by the \n     Bankruptcy Code and other applicable law, both as to amount \n     and priority. We understand that the Bankruptcy Court \n     routinely addresses these issues, taking into account the \n     concerns of the claimants and the bankrupt company. An \n     unfortunate consequence of bankruptcy is that many claims do \n     not receive the priority that the plaintiff would prefer.\n\n\n                         Service in Rural Areas\n\n       We also carefully considered our dealer network coverage in \n     rural areas and small towns versus urban/suburban markets. We \n     know that our strong presence in rural areas, small towns and \n     ``hub'' towns gives us a strong competitive advantage on \n     average of more than 10 points in market share, and we would \n     like to maintain that advantage. When our rural and small \n     town dealers perform to our standards, they are a huge asset, \n     and so we intend to retain an extensive rural network of \n     1,500 dealers nationally. With this comprehensive network in \n     place we are confident we can continue to provide all of our \n     customers with reasonable access to dealers and service, \n     obviating the need for ``service\n\n[[Page S6687]]\n\n     only'' outlets. However, we will conduct market analyses to \n     ensure that there is sufficient representation of GM dealers \n     so that we meet the needs of customers, especially in rural \n     areas.\n\n\n                        GM Technician Placement\n\n       GM is proud of the dealer technicians who service GM \n     vehicles. Many of these technicians are highly trained and \n     possess multiple technical certifications. Factory trained \n     individuals with these skills and credentials are highly \n     sought after in the industry. GM shares your concern that \n     these technicians may lose their current positions. In \n     response to your letter, we commit to taking actions, such as \n     by making training records and certifications available, with \n     technician consent, to employment services and resume sites. \n     In addition, we have already begun a review with our National \n     Dealer Council to develop ideas on how GM can help the \n     dealers' technicians transition to other dealers.\n       General Motors appreciates the support of Congress and \n     President Obama and takes very seriously our responsibility \n     to create a healthy GM for generations to come. Thank you for \n     the opportunity to respond to your concerns.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Frederick A. Henderson,\n     President and Chief Executive Officer.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                 Chrysler LLC,\n\n                                  Auburn Mills, MI, June 12, 2009.\n     Hon. John D. Rockefeller IV,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Rockefeller and Ranking Member Hutchison: \n     Thank you for the opportunity to respond to the concerns \n     raised in your June 9 letter. As I highlighted last week at \n     the Senate Commerce Committee hearing, it is critically \n     important that the new Chrysler Group have a viable, \n     realigned dealer network on day one. Despite a painful \n     restructuring, Chrysler Group LLC will retain 86% of Chrysler \n     dealers by volume and 75% by location. I can empathize with \n     the dealers who were not brought forward into the new \n     company, and can understand their disappointment. This has \n     been the most difficult business action I have personally \n     ever had to take.\n       The concerns you have raised are addressed in order below:\n\n\n               vehicle inventory, parts and special tools\n\n       Regarding the concerns you have outlined relative to \n     inventories, parts and special tools, Chrysler has made a \n     commitment to its discontinued dealers that 100% of the \n     inventory on their lots will be purchased at cost minus a \n     $350 inspection, cleaning and transport fee. Through a letter \n     dated June 5, 2009 Chrysler informed all discontinued dealers \n     that we will guarantee the re-distribution of 100% of \n     eligible vehicle inventory. We have successfully found buyers \n     for 100% of the outstanding vehicle inventory, and dealers \n     requesting our assistance have received commitments for 80% \n     of their parts inventory.\n       We will continue to work with the discontinued dealers to \n     redistribute their parts inventory for the next 90 days. \n     After that time we will commit to repurchase remaining \n     qualified parts inventory from those dealers at the average \n     transaction price for all parts already redistributed. We \n     will also continue to work to redistribute all remaining \n     special tools.\n\n\n                Dealer Terminations and Market Re-entry\n\n       While some profitable dealers were not retained by \n     Chrysler, it is important to note that profitability alone is \n     not an adequate measure and is one of several elements that \n     determine a dealer's viability and value to Chrysler. The \n     factors we considered in making these decisions included:\n       Total sales potential for each individual market\n       Each dealer's record of meeting minimum sales \n     responsibility\n       A scorecard that each dealer receives monthly, and includes \n     metrics for sales, market share, new vehicle shipments, sales \n     satisfaction index, service satisfaction index, warranty \n     repair expense, and other comparative measures\n       Facility that meets corporate standards\n       Location in regard to optimum retail growth area\n       Exclusive representation within larger markets (Dualed with \n     competitive franchise)\n       Opportunity to complete consolidation of the three brands \n     (Project Genesis)\n       Dealers may be profitable while not meeting their Chrysler \n     new vehicle ``minimum sales responsibility'' level. For \n     example, a dealer may focus on maintaining a low cost \n     structure through a lack of modernization, a heavy emphasis \n     on used vehicles, lack of investment in training and \n     capacity. Therefore, a dealer could be profitable while not \n     meeting their new vehicle sales and customer satisfaction \n     obligations.\n       Also, we understand and value the loyalty and experience \n     represented in many of the discontinued dealers. As we \n     consider market re-entry or expansion in the future.\n       Chrysler Group LLC will commit to provide non-retained \n     dealers with an opportunity for first consideration of new \n     dealerships that the company may contemplate.\n\n\n         Providing Transparency in the Decision-making Process\n\n       To achieve the necessary realignment, we used a thoughtful, \n     rigorous and objective process designed to have the least \n     negative impact while still creating a new dealer footprint \n     scaled to be viable and profitable for the long-term. Factors \n     in the decision-making are outlined in the second question \n     above.\n       Upon request, we will share with any dealer the rationale \n     and specific data used in making the decision on the dealer \n     separation.\n\n\n                          Consumer Protection\n\n       Bankruptcy is a very difficult process requiring hard \n     choices and painful decisions. The bankruptcy process has \n     impacted all existing stakeholders. With a failed enterprise, \n     there are many who suffer significant losses. Traditionally \n     in a bankruptcy, liabilities such as product liability claims \n     are not carried forward into the new enterprise. The judge \n     found this decision to be within the debtor's sound business \n     judgment, and it is a customary bankruptcy outcome. Any \n     product-related claims arising from vehicles sold by the New \n     Chrysler will be addressed by the new company. This is \n     consistent with the goal of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy, which is \n     to create a framework enabling a vibrant, sustainable new \n     company to emerge.\n\n\n               Consumer Access to Service in Rural Areas\n\n       There will be over 2,300 remaining Chrysler, Jeep and Dodge \n     dealerships conveniently located with the parts and trained \n     technicians to service consumers' vehicles. Based on \n     registration data, our customers reside an average of 6.28 \n     miles from the nearest Chrysler, Jeep or Dodge dealer now; \n     this distance will increase to 6.80 miles after the \n     consolidation. With regard to rural dealers, the distance \n     increases from 9.72 to 10.70 miles. Even with the \n     consolidation, our dealers on average are more conveniently \n     located to customers than Toyota or Honda dealers are to \n     their customers.\n       Additionally, we will consider companion facilities to \n     address potential sales and service issues in areas of \n     concern. Chrysler will send a letter to all customers \n     notifying them of the four nearest dealers who can provide \n     service. It is not in Chrysler's interest to abandon existing \n     customers to the detriment of future parts and new vehicle \n     sales.\n\n                                                             CUSTOMER CONVENIENCE COMPARISON\n                                         [Average distance in miles a customer must drive to reach a dealership]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                   Old          New         Change\n                                                                 Chrysler     Chrysler     chrysler      Toyota       Honda        Chevy         Ford\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMetro........................................................         4.45         4.82         0.37         5.01         5.11         4.10         4.23\nSecondary....................................................         6.08         6.44         0.36         7.38         7.58         5.69         5.76\nRural........................................................         9.72        10.70         0.98        19.27        24.27         8.04         8.69\n                                                              ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Total....................................................         6.28         6.80         0.52         9.11        10.31         5.58         5.81\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n             Placement Assistance for Chrysler Technicians\n\n       Chrysler is sensitive to the job loss associated with the \n     non-retained dealers.

Mr. President, twice in the last 2 weeks I have asked a \nunanimous consent to proceed to consider Calendar No. 97. I would like \nto do that again at this time. We have advised the Republican side of \nthe aisle I will be doing that, so I will proceed with that at this \npoint.\n\n[[Page S6688]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 97, the nomination of Hilary \nChandler Tompkins to be the Solicitor of the Department of the \nInterior, that the nomination be confirmed, that the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table, that no further motions be in order, \nthat any statements relating to the nomination be printed in the \nRecord, that upon confirmation the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action, and that the Senate then resume legislative \nsession.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I do object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I object on behalf of the minority because they have \nnot yet had time to clear this on our side, but certainly we will work \nwith you going forward to be able to expedite this nomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me comment briefly. I regret \nobjection has been raised again. This nomination was reported out of \nour Energy and Natural Resources Committee on April 30. Of course, we \nare now at June 17. There was no testimony at our committee hearing or \nno suggestion made by anybody that Ms. Tompkins was not qualified for \nthis position. Clearly, she is qualified and well qualified for this \nposition. She has served in important positions in our State government \nin New Mexico. She is, by education and experience, eminently qualified \nto be the Solicitor.\n  I also point out to my colleagues, she is the first Native American \nto be nominated by the President to be the Solicitor for the Department \nof the Interior, and she is the second woman in the history of this \ncountry to be nominated to be the Solicitor of the Department of the \nInterior.\n  This is an extremely important position. Secretary Salazar is trying \nvery hard to put together a team of people who can help him to do the \njob of Secretary of Interior, and he needs a person in this Solicitor's \noffice he can depend upon. He has chosen her to be that person.\n  To my mind, it is unacceptable for us to continue denying him the \nchoice he has made, and the choice President Obama has made, for the \nSolicitor's office. It is very unfair to Ms. Tompkins to be denying her \nthis position. Frankly, I have great difficulty understanding why she \nwas singled out.\n  There have been a great many nominees who have come before the Senate \nin the last couple of months in connection with the Department of the \nInterior responsibilities. Why we would be singling her out and holding \nher up while others have been approved I have great difficulty \nunderstanding.\n  My colleagues say they need additional time. Frankly, I cannot \nunderstand what the additional time relates to. I know of no questions \nthat need to be looked at. I know of no objections that have been \nraised to her nomination.\n  I hope that if there is anything, any additional investigation or \nquestion that continues to exist on the Republican side, they would \nresolve that here in the next day or two so we can complete this \nnomination and get on with other business. But this is a very unfair \nsituation with regard to this nominee. In my view, there is no \njustification for it. I know the Presiding Officer, Senator Udall, and \nI will continue to pursue this repeatedly over the coming days until \nthis matter is resolved and she can be confirmed. I believe that once \npermission is given for her nomination to be voted on, she will be \noverwhelmingly confirmed. That is as it should be. But due to the \narcane rules that we operate under in the Senate, the Republican \nMembers have chosen to hold up this nomination very unfairly, in my \nview, and I think we will have to revisit it again in the next few \ndays.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I have been talking about, over the last \nseveral days, health care reform which is urgently needed. No one is \nsatisfied with the status quo. We have all heard unfortunate stories \nabout Americans who cope with health insurance. All Americans deserve \naccess to high-quality health care. In a country as innovative and \nprosperous as ours, we can achieve that goal. Republicans believe we \ncan do so by putting patients first. We believe Americans should be \ntrusted with their own money to make wise decisions about the health \ncare plan that best fits their family's needs. We do not believe \nforcing everyone into a one-size-fits-all, Washington-run system, as \nthe President wants, is the solution to our health care problems. \nIndeed, we believe a Washington takeover would create a whole new set \nof problems, the likes of which are experienced every day in countries \nsuch as Canada and Great Britain.\n  President Obama often says if you are insured and you like your \ncurrent health care, you can keep it. But as I pointed out several \ntimes, the President's plan would, in fact, force millions of Americans \ninto the government system by providing incentives for their employers \nto eliminate their coverage. Government-run health care systems in \nCanada and Great Britain have, over and over, failed the very patients \nthey were created to serve. Access to doctors, tests, treatments, and \nmedications is limited. Patients wait through painful months and years \nto get the treatment they need. The longer they wait, the more their \nconditions worsen. Medications are sometimes unavailable or the \ngovernment may refuse to pay for them, despite the guarantee of \nuniversal coverage to all. Innovation and new medical technologies are \nnot encouraged because they would lead to higher costs. Patients deal \nwith bureaucratic hassles as they try to navigate their way through an \noverly complicated maze of rules. Americans want health care reform, \nbut they don't want to experience the rationing and the ordeals that a \ngovernment system would create.\n  As opposition to this public option idea or Washington takeover \ngrows, some Democrats have been trying to disguise this takeover with a \nnew name. They have come up with the idea of calling it a health \ninsurance co-op. This started with a very good idea from the Senator \nfrom North Dakota but has evolved into simply another name for a \ngovernment-run insurance company. As we all know, a co-op in its purest \nform is a business controlled by its own members. Co-ops form when \ncommunities unite to solve a common problem or exchange goods and \nservices. In Arizona, we have more than 100 co-ops all across the \nState. Some communities use them to get fresh food, electricity, \nhardware, heating fuel or create credit unions. A bloated, Washington-\nrun health care bureaucracy forced upon the public is not a co-op.\n  As former Secretary of Health and Human Services Michael Leavitt has \nwritten in a soon-to-be-published Fox News article he shared with me:\n\n       A co-op that would be federally controlled, federally \n     funded, and federally staffed sounds like the public option \n     meets the new General Motors.\n\n  In the era of the GM takeover, Washington controls the purse strings, \npays the bills, dictates the rules. The same would be true of a \nWashington health care co-op.\n  As Leavitt put it in this article:\n\n       Washington healthcare would result in Americans being ``co-\n     opted,'' rather than being given a ``co-op.''\n\n  Americans are also concerned about the cost of the bills being \nproposed on the Democratic side. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice's preliminary estimate shows that the bill in the HELP Committee \nor the draft bill created by the senior Senators from Massachusetts and \nConnecticut--the piece of legislation I am talking about--would cost a \ntrillion dollars over the course of 10 years but only would reduce the \nnumber of uninsured by 16 million. So a trillion dollars to bring 16 \nmillion people into insurance status. For those who would be newly \ncovered, the cost would be $65,185 per person for 10 years of coverage. \nThat is\n\n[[Page S6689]]\n\nonly a preliminary estimate for part of the plan. Of course, the \npreliminary estimate does not tell the whole story. What would it cost \nto cover the remaining 31 million who are thought not to have insurance \nor the millions who would be displaced from current private coverage \nwith their employer into the public plan? Remember, I indicated that \nprivate employers would have no incentive to keep those people on their \nown rolls when it would be much cheaper to have them go to the \ngovernment option.\n  The bill also provides subsidies for families whose incomes reach 500 \npercent of the poverty line which gets you close to $100,000.\n  The first question one has to ask in these circumstances is, How do \nwe pay for all of this, and who will pay. We are all familiar with the \nhuge expenditures of this government since the beginning of the year on \nthe so-called stimulus package, the so-called omnibus bill, the budget \nthat has been provided, and now the supplemental that we will probably \nbe taking up tomorrow, all of which adds trillions of dollars in more \ndebt, more debt than all the other Presidents and Congresses of the \nUnited States put together. In fact, double that, and that is how much \ndebt is created in just one budget of President Obama.\n  We add on top of all of that a trillion, 2 trillion, who knows how \nmuch to try to find coverage for about 45 million people. We have not \nhad the answers to the questions yet of how we would pay for it and who \nwould pay, but we have seen proposals that range from taxes on beer and \nsoda to juice, salty foods, eliminating charitable tax deductions. We \neven heard about a value-added tax that would tax everyone regardless \nof income. Would there be anything left that the Federal Government \ndoes not tax at the end of this?\n  The HELP Committee would also establish a new prevention and public \nhealth investment fund. We don't know all the details, but what we have \nheard is that, it would direct billions of dollars to the government to \ndo healthy things. Like what? Like building sidewalks and establishing \nnew government-subsidized farmers markets. The idea is to encourage \nhealthier lifestyles. I suppose that creating sidewalks so people can \njog on sidewalks creates healthy lifestyles. I was at a farmers market \nthis weekend. I didn't notice any Federal subsidies. I am sure the \nvegetables there are good for everybody, and it would be nice to have \nmore farmers markets. But should the government be spending a lot of \nmoney on things such as that in the guise of trying to provide \nhealthier Americans so we have less costly insurance? Encouraging \nhealthier life styles is fine, but I don't think this is the kind of \nreform the American people have in mind. It is also indicative of a \nvery wasteful and inefficient system, whenever it is run by the Federal \nGovernment in Washington.\n  We all believe that families who can afford insurance should be \nhelped. There are ways to do that. The poorest Americans are already \neligible for Medicaid, and we should see to it that Medicaid and \nMedicare are strong and that everyone who is eligible signs up for \nthem. One of the reasons there are so many uninsured is that many of \nthe people who are eligible for private insurance or Medicaid have not \nsigned up. We could get them signed up for that.\n  That leads to another question about Washington-run health care. Will \nincreased demands for government health care diminish the quality of \ncare that is now received by America's seniors in Medicare? That is an \nimportant question for seniors to contemplate. They want Congress to \nfind ways to ensure Medicare is solvent. They don't want us to divert \nthe program's resources into a massive new entitlement for everyone. \nYet we all know, as the President himself has said, that Medicare is \nnot solvent. It is not sustainable. Now we are going to add additional \nburdens and expect that there would not be any negative impacts on \nAmerica's seniors. I find that hard to believe.\n  I haven't read anything in the Congressional Budget Office's \npreliminary report that makes me more optimistic about this. The \npreliminary numbers should make us even more weary of adding a new \ngovernment program.\n  Finally, we are told we must hurry up and pass the health care reform \nPresident Obama wants for the sake of the economy. The President \npitched this same argument to Congress as he rushed us to pass the \nstimulus, which was packed with debt and waste, the details of which \nare now coming to light thanks to a new report by Senator Coburn. The \nreality is, the bulk of the money we passed for the stimulus should \nsimply not be spent. That will not be efficiently spending taxpayer \ndollars. I argued at the time that rushing to borrow money to pass such \nan expensive and complex bill was irresponsible and a disservice to \ntaxpayers. Administration economists insisted that if Congress hurried \nto pass the stimulus, unemployment would peak at 8 percent. Four months \nlater, unemployment has now reached 9.4 percent, and here we are again \nbeing pressured to hurry up and spend another trillion taxpayer \ndollars.\n\n  Republicans will not be rushed into passing the Democrats' health \ncare bill. We are going to ask the tough questions. I think our \nconstituents deserve answers to those questions. Based upon the track \nrecord so far, I wouldn't say the experts who have told us don't worry \nabout the cost, everything will be fine, have not guessed right, as the \nVice President said last Sunday. I don't think our constituents want us \nto hurry it. They want us to do it right. We want real reform, not more \ndeficits, government waste, and unsustainable programs.\n  As we reform health care, we need an approach that makes sure the \npatients come first and that no government bureaucrat stands in the way \nof the doctors prescribing treatments and medications their patients \nneed. The success of America is largely due to the individual freedom \nwe all enjoy. Individual freedom triumphs when the doctor-patient \nrelationship remains free of government intervention. We must continue \nour great tradition as we pursue the health care reforms we all want.\n  Let me comment on a piece of legislation Senator McConnell and I \nintroduced. I would love to have everyone cosponsor this legislation. I \nam hoping we can get it adopted soon before we take up health care \nreform because it will inform us as to how we should deal with health \ncare reform on what could be the most important issue Americans find \ninvolved with this. Americans want their fellow citizens to be insured. \nThey wanted costs to be kept in check so they can afford insurance. \nThey want both those things. But they don't want their care, the care \nthey believe in and they like, interfered with in order to achieve \nthese other two goals.\n  One of the things they are most fearful of is that their care will be \nrationed. When we talk about saving money in Medicare in order to pay \nfor insuring more Americans, seniors rightly question whether some of \nthe care they have been getting is going to be denied them or that they \nwill be delayed in getting that care.\n  One of the ways that could be accomplished is by using something the \nCongress has already passed called comparative effectiveness research. \nThat stimulus bill I talked of earlier appropriated $1.1 billion to \nconduct comparative effectiveness research. It wasn't necessary because \nit is done in the private sector all the time. Hospitals, medical \nschools, associations, groups of people who want to find out which \ntreatment is best for the most people conduct this kind of research all \nthe time. Is drug X or drug Y better to treat people when they have a \ncertain condition? They run tests to see how the different medications \nperform. They then give those results to physicians who use that \ninformation in prescribing to their patients. It is a way we have found \nthat we can provide better quality care for more people. Sometimes, by \nthe way, we can save money as well.\n  The point is not to try to figure out how to cut costs so we can deny \ncertain care to people and, therefore, not have the cost of providing \nit. Unfortunately, that is one of the purposes to which this research \ncould be put. It has been acknowledged by people both within the \nadministration and without. The acting head of the National Institutes \nof Health, for example, talked about using this research for allocation \nof treatments.\n\n  Allocation of treatments is another way of saying rationing. You \ndecide\n\n[[Page S6690]]\n\nwhich treatments to allocate and which ones not to. This is the way it \nis done in Great Britain and Canada. They do not have enough money to \npay for all the health care that physicians prescribe, so they simply \ndelay some of the care until it is not needed anymore or the person \ndies or they deny it. For example, one of the policies was not to \nprescribe a drug--well, the doctor prescribes the drug, but not to fill \nthe prescription for an eye condition until the patient was blind in \none eye. Then you could get the drug.\n  Americans do not want that. They do not want to have to suffer in \nthat way when the medicines are available to treat them. What the \ngovernment agency in Great Britain has said is: Look, we don't have \nenough money to give you all of the care your doctor says you need. We \nare going to have to make tough choices. We understand that will not \nplease everyone. But there is no other way to use the limited dollars \nwe have to provide this free care to everybody within the country.\n  What we are saying is, we do not want America to get to that point \nwhere you have to ration the health care. In Great Britain they have a \nterm called ``QALY.'' It stands for Quality Adjusted Life Years: QALY. \nWhat they have literally done is to say that a person's life is worth \nbetween 20,000 and 30,000 pounds--I gather that is probably about \n$35,000 or $40,000--and that in a year of your life, I think it comes \nout to about $125 a day. If the health care the doctor has prescribed \ncosts more than that, then in most cases you do not get it, even though \nthe doctor says you need it, and he is willing to prescribe it and help \nyou with the procedure or treatment or taking the drug.\n  I would hate to get to that point in the United States where we have \nan agency that says how much we think your life is worth every day--\n$125--and says: Well, if the prescription of the doctor costs more than \nthat, you are out of luck, we are not going to pay for it.\n  Incidentally, the national health care system in Great Britain has an \nacronym for that agency; it is NICE. It is the National Institute for \nHealth and Clinical Excellence, N-I-C-E: NICE--not so nice when you do \nnot get the care your doctor says you need.\n  What Senator McConnell and I have said is that the government cannot \nuse this research, this comparative effectiveness research, for the \npurpose of denying your care. Obviously, it can be used for the purpose \nfor which it was originally intended; namely, to figure out which \ntreatments and prescriptions are best. But it cannot be used to deny \ntreatment or service.\n  We obviously make an exception for the FDA, the Federal Food and Drug \nAdministration, which can say a certain drug is dangerous to your \nhealth. Obviously, that would be exempted from this prohibition. But \notherwise we say you cannot ration health care with comparative \neffectiveness research.\n  The bill pending before the HELP Committee actually creates an agency \nto use this research for that purpose. So there is a blatant attempt in \nthe HELP Committee to use this research to ration care. Our legislation \nwould stop that. We think we ought to pass it now to instruct the HELP \nCommittee that we do not want that to happen.\n  In the Finance Committee, it is more indirect. A private entity would \nconduct the research. But there is nothing to prevent the Federal \nGovernment from using the results of the research to delay or deny your \ncare, to ration care.\n  So for the bills that are being written in both committees, our \nlegislation would provide direction that--whatever other reform we \nhave--Americans are not going to have to worry about somebody getting \nin between their doctor and themselves, when the doctor says: I think \nyou need this particular treatment, if their insurance provides for \nthat. If not, there are other ways you can get the treatment; if it is \na government program such as Medicare, you would be able to get the \ntreatment. The government is not going to inject itself between you and \nyour physician and say: You can't have that because it is too \nexpensive.\n  That is all our legislation does. I would hope my colleagues would be \nwilling to support that legislation to give direction to the two \ncommittees to ensure that they do not, in their zeal to cut costs, \nwrite legislation that would have the effect of rationing health care.\n  There are a lot of other concerns we have in putting this legislation \ntogether: concerns about a government-run insurance company to compete \nwith the private insurance companies; a requirement that all employers \nprovide health care, which, of course, would substantially add to their \ncosts and might result in their hiring fewer people or paying the \npeople who they do hire less money.\n  There are a lot of different concerns we have. But, in my mind, the \nmost serious one is this concern about rationing. Everybody wishes to \nlower costs. But the one way we cannot lower costs is by having the \nU.S. Government tell you that you cannot get medical care your doctor \nsays you need.\n  Let me conclude with this point: If you will think back, think back \n100 years ago to the year 1908. How much health care could you buy at \nthe turn of the last century, say the year 1900, 1908? The answer is, \nnot very much. Think back about 40 years before that, when President \nLincoln was assassinated and the kind of treatment he got. It almost \nseems barbaric in our modern way of looking at things that there was \nnot anything available to save his life.\n  Now think of the incredible inventions and breakthroughs in medical \nscience in the last 100 years, in the last 50 years, in the last 10 \nyears. Things have been invented. New medications, new pharmaceutical \ndrugs, medical devices, new kinds of surgery, ways of treating all \nkinds of conditions have evolved so rapidly that we are extraordinarily \nfortunate to be able to buy all of this health care.\n  So when people say we are spending too much on health care, I am not \nsure that is totally correct. To the extent there are more efficiencies \nin the system that can be brought to bear, of course we want to do \nthings to incent those incentives. That is what some of the Republican \nproposals would do. But what we do not want to do is to put a \ngovernment bureaucrat in between you and this incredible new medicine \nthat is being invented every day.\n  We should be glad we can spend more on health care if it is much \nbetter health care. As one of the experts in this area said: In 1980, \nif you had a heart attack, after 5 years, your chances of survival are \nabout 60 percent. If you have that same heart attack today, your chance \nof survival is about 90 percent--so from 60 percent to 90 percent \nsurvival in a few years, based upon new medical breakthroughs. It costs \na little more money. The question is, would you rather have 1980s \nhealth care at 1980s prices, or health care that is available today at \ntoday's prices? I submit almost all of us, when we are thinking about a \nloved one in our family, would say: I want the very best there is, the \nvery best we can get.\n  That is why Republicans say we want insurance to be affordable for \neveryone so that at least, if nothing else, for that catastrophic event \nin your life--such as a heart attack, for example--you will have all of \nthe latest health care that America has available, and it will be paid \nfor so you will have high-quality care.\n  In some of these other countries, they say: We are sorry. We can't \nafford that. We can't afford to spend money on all these new \nbreakthroughs. We are basically stuck with what we could afford back in \n1980, for example. And good luck. We know that is not going to help you \nall that much with your illness, but that is all we can afford to pay.\n  That is what we are trying to avoid. We are trying to take a very \nsmall step first and say that, at a minimum, nothing in this \nlegislation would allow the government to use comparative effectiveness \nresearch to ration our care. I do not think that is too much to ask. I \nwould ask all of my colleagues to join Senator McConnell and me in \nsponsoring that legislation and seeing to it we can get it passed for \nthe benefit of our families and our constituents.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S6691]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I see Senator Bennett from Utah. How would \nthe Senator like to do this I have about 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I wish to speak for 10 minutes in morning \nbusiness following Senator Graham, and I ask unanimous consent to \nproceed on that basis. I will be speaking as in morning business, as I \nassume the Senator will be.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. That is correct.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Detainee Abuse Photos\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I come to the floor to acknowledge an \nagreement I have reached with the majority leader and the \nadministration regarding the issue of detainee abuse photos. I think, \nas my colleagues are well aware, there are some photos of alleged \ndetainee abuse that have existed for several years; more of the same, \nnothing new. The President has decided to oppose their release.\n  The ACLU filed a lawsuit asking for these photos to be released. \nGeneral Petraeus and General Odierno are the two combat commanders, and \nI ask unanimous consent that their statements be printed in the Record \nfollowing my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, the lawsuit said if these photos are \nreleased, our enemies will use them against our troops. These photos \nwill incite additional violence against men and women serving overseas \nand Americans who are in theater. There is nothing new to be learned, \naccording to the President. I agree with that. These are more of the \nsame. The people involved at Abu Ghraib and other detainee abuse \nallegations have been dealt with. The effect of releasing these photos \nwould be empowering our enemies. Every photo would become a bullet or \nan IED. I wish to applaud the President for saying he opposes their \nrelease.\n  The status of the lawsuit is that there is a stay on the second \ncircuit order that would allow the photos to be released until the \nSupreme Court hears the petition of certiorari filed by the Supreme \nCourt.\n  I have been promised two things that were important to me to remove \nmy holds and to let the supplemental go without objection. No. 1, there \nwould be a freestanding vote on the Lieberman-Graham amendment, the \nlegislative solution to this lawsuit. The Senate has previously allowed \nthis legislation to become a part of the supplemental war funding bill. \nIt would prevent the disclosure of these photos for a 3-year period. If \nthe Secretary of Defense said they were harmful to our national \nsecurity interests, it could be renewed for 3 years. Senator Reid has \nindicated to me that before July 8 we will have a chance to vote on \nthat provision as a freestanding bill, which I think will get the \nSenate back on record in a timely fashion before the next court \nhearing.\n  Secondly, I wanted to be assured by the administration that if the \nCongress fails to do its part to protect these photos from being \nreleased, the President would sign an Executive order which would \nchange their classification to be classified national security \ndocuments that would be outcome determinative of the lawsuit. Rahm \nEmanuel has indicated to me that the President is committed to not ever \nletting these photos see the light of day, but they agree with me that \nthe best way to do it is for Congress to act.\n  So in light of that, I am going to remove my hold on the bills I have \na hold on, and I will support the supplemental. Because I think it is \nvery important for our soldiers, airmen, sailors, marines--anybody \ndeployed--civilian contractors and their families to know there is a \ngame plan. We are going to support General Petraeus and General Odierno \nand all our combat commanders to make sure these photos never see the \nlight of day. I think we have a game plan that will work. It starts \nwith a vote in the Senate. I am urging the House to take this up as a \nfreestanding bill. There were 267 House Members who voted to keep our \nlanguage included in the supplemental. It was taken out. I am very \ndisappointed that it was taken out, but we now have a chance to start \nover and get this right sooner rather than later.\n  With that understanding, that we are going to get a freestanding vote \non the Lieberman-Graham amendment and that the administration will do \nwhatever is required to make sure these photos never see the light of \nday if Congress fails to act, I am going to lift my hold on all the \nlegislation and support the supplemental. I look forward to taking this \nmatter up as soon as possible.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n           America's Top Generals Warn against Photo Release\n\n\n   declaration of general david h. petraeus, commander of the united \n                         states central command\n\n     Endangering the Lives of U.S. Servicemen and Servicewomen\n       ``The release of images depicting U.S. servicemen \n     mistreating detainees in Iraq and Afghanistan, or that could \n     be construed as depicting mistreatment, would likely deal a \n     particularly hard blow to USCENTCOM and U.S. interagency \n     counterinsurgency efforts in these three key nations, as well \n     as further endanger the lives of U.S. Soldiers, Marines, \n     Airmen, Sailors, civilians and contractors presently serving \n     there.''

The Senator from Utah.\n\n\n                           Governmental Power\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, when the Founding Fathers wrote the \nConstitution and gave us our government, they did so out of a deep \ndistrust of the power of government coming out of their experience with \nKing George, and they created a government that limits the use of \npower, deliberately setting up a system of checks and balances, a \ndoctrine of separation of powers and so on, with which we are all \nfamiliar.\n  Out of that, Americans have become used to the idea that there are \nlimits on governmental power, and one of the concerns I hear when I \nvisit with my constituents in Utah is that they are afraid there are \nnow no limits on governmental power, or at least there is certainly not \nenough limits on governmental power. I am asked: Where does it stop? \nThe government can take over insurance companies. The government can \ntake over financial institutions. The government can take over an \nautomobile company. The government can dictate who gets to be chief \nexecutive and how much he or she will be paid. Aren't there supposed to \nbe limits on governmental power?\n  Today, we have a proposal brought forward by the administration with \nrespect to how the regulatory pattern for our financial institutions \nshould be changed. As I look at that proposal, I ask the same questions \nmy constituents are asking: Shouldn't there be some limits on \ngovernmental power? Isn't this going a bit far? Indeed, I think it is a \nlegitimate question, and I wanted to address it for a moment.\n  First, let's understand a fundamental truth about the economy. That \nis that all wealth comes from taking risks. Farmers take risks when \nthey plant seeds, not knowing what the weather is going to do. \nBusinessmen and women take risks when they open businesses, not knowing \nwhat the market is going to do. New wealth comes out when we have a \nbumper crop. New wealth comes out when a business started in a garage \nturns into Hewlett Packard, but in every instance you take risks.\n  The second element that has to be added to risk-taking is the access \nto accumulated wealth. Sometimes it comes by a wealth you have \naccumulated yourself. Sometimes it comes from loans from your brother-\nin-law. Sometimes it comes from running up your credit card. Sometimes \nit comes from venture capitalists. In many instances, it comes from \nbanks. But you take a risk, and you have to have access to some kind of \naccumulated capital or you cannot create new wealth.\n\n  All right. Why do people take risks? Because they expect there will \nbe a reward in the form of a return on the capital they have taken. \nWhether it comes from a bank loan that they can pay back or from \ninvestor capital that will then receive dividends, there will be a \nreward. The risk/reward relationship is at the base of the growth and \npower of the American economy.\n  In the present crisis, we have had people saying: Yes, but there are \nsome entities that are simply too big to fail, we must not allow them \nto fail, and particularly in the financial services industry. So that \nis why we have this proposal today from the Obama administration. They \nwant to deal with systemic risk, as they call it, or those tier 1 \nentities which they describe as what I have just said: They are too big \nto fail and we are not going to allow them to fail, and this is the \nregulatory regime we will set up.\n  If there are companies or entities that are too big to fail, this \nregime is too big to function. It is so focused on preventing failure \nthat it is stacked in such a way that it will penalize the risk taker \nand prevent the risk taker from taking a risk and therefore not reap \nany kind of a reward.\n  There is a heavy emphasis on consumer protection. I am all for that. \nI think we should have all of the kinds of regulations that say you \nneed labels on things that might not be safe. That protects the \nconsumer. You need nutritional information on things that might make \nyou too fat, which protects the consumer. But let's not protect the \nconsumer to the point where they cannot buy anything or, in this case, \nprotect the system from any possible failure to the point that there is \nno risk and therefore ultimately no reward. By giving the Federal \nReserve the kinds of powers this proposal does, we are moving down that \nroad, and once again we are raising the question: Are there no limits \non the amount of power that government can have and accumulate?\n  I am convinced that if this massive, new expansion of power in the \nhands of the government goes forward unimpeded, we will see the \nshutting off of sources of credit and therefore the contraction of the \neconomy and ultimately the need for more bailouts, more expenditures of \nFederal funds to try to keep entities alive. They can stay alive if \nthey can attract capital from the private markets, but that is risky. \nSo if we say: No, we are not going to allow the risks, we shut off the \nincentive of the private market to invest in some of these entities or \nto loan money to some of these entities. And then we say: But the \nentity is so important to our economy that we cannot allow it to fail. \nSo we turn to the taxpayer and say: Let's put more taxpayer money into \nthe entity because it is too big to fail.\n  That is what I see down the road for this proposal. I may be wrong. \nBut I point out that we in the Congress have, by law, created a \ncommission to study what caused the present mess we are in and report \nback to the Congress. We wrote into that law a specific date--December \n15, 2010--to make sure the commission had enough time to examine all of \nthe possibilities, to delve deeply enough into the issue to fully \nunderstand it, and then report back to us with their findings. Now we \nare being told: Forget the commission. Forget the analysis of what \nhappened. We\n\n[[Page S6693]]\n\nthink we know. Let's put this regulatory regime in place--one that is \ntoo big to function--now. Let's do it quickly. Let's have it done by \nthe August recess. All right, we can't get it done by the August \nrecess. We are going to have health care done by the August recess, so \nwe will do it before Halloween, or whatever artificial date some may \nchoose to put on it.\n  The reality is, the issue is huge, the issue needs to be examined \ncarefully, and we need to do it within the parameters of the basic \nsuspicion the Founding Fathers had about the government. We should do \nit with an understanding that there are limits to government power and \nthat government power has the capacity to damage the economy every bit \nas much as it has the power to help it move forward.\n  Mr. President, I say let's not move with the speed and haste we are \nhearing about this proposal. Let's subject it to the most careful \nexamination we possibly can throughout the processes of Congress, and \nlet's make sure that when we do make regulatory changes with respect to \nthe financial institutions, we do them in a way that will not fail and \nthat can properly function.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                 Energy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to visit about two issues, the \nfirst of which is a bill we passed out of the Senate Energy Committee \nearlier this morning. I wish to give some context to what we have done. \nIt will perhaps not get as much notice as it should. Yet, it will be \nheaded to the floor of the Senate to deal with energy policy, and it \naffects everybody virtually all of the time.\n  All of us get up in the morning and in most cases, flick a switch and \nturn something on. We plug something in or turn a key for an engine or \na lightbulb or a toaster or an electric razor. In every way, energy \naffects our lives in a very profound manner, and what we did has a \nsignificant impact on our daily lives.\n  First, I will describe part of the challenge.\n  Every single day we stick little straws in the earth and suck out \noil. Every single day, there are about 84 million barrels of oil taken \nout of the earth. It is a big old planet with a lot of people living on \nthis planet, and of the 84 million barrels of oil we take out every day \nfrom the earth, one-fourth of it is destined to be used in the United \nStates. We use one-fourth of the oil every day. Why? We have a standard \nof living in a big old country that is far above most other places in \nthe world, and we want to drive vehicles. We use oil in a very \nsubstantial way. We have an enormous appetite for oil.\n  So here is the deal. One-fourth of all oil produced comes here \nbecause we need it and nearly 70 percent of the oil we use comes from \noutside of our country. Much of the oil produced comes from very \ntroubled parts of the world, such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Venezuela, and \nother countries. So 70 percent of the oil we need comes from outside of \nour country and nearly 70 percent of the oil we use is used for our \ntransportation system. So you see the dilemma here is that we are \nunbelievably dependent and vulnerable on something over which we have \nvery little control. By that I mean that if, God forbid, tonight \nterrorists interrupted the supply of oil coming to this country from \nother countries, this economy of ours would be flat on its back. We are \nunbelievably dependent on oil from other countries, and we have to \nbegin reducing our dependence. How do we do that?\n  By the way, as dependent as we are, we need to visit the events of \nlast year once again and remember what happened: Speculators took \ncontrol of the oil market and drove the price of oil to $147 a barrel \nin day trading. The price of gasoline went up to $4 to $4.50 a gallon. \nThere was no excuse or justification for it. There was nothing in \nsupply and demand that justified the price of oil and therefore the \nprice of gasoline going up like a Roman candle and then in July last \nyear starting to come right back down. The speculators, who made all \nthe money on the way up, made the same money on the way down. The \nconsumers who drove cars and pulled up to fill up with unbelievably \nexpensive gasoline were the victims. Still nobody has done the \ninvestigation to ask the questions who did this and how did it happen. \nHow is it that when the supply of oil is up and demand is down even \nwhile price rose?\n  I was prepared to offer an amendment this morning to the Energy \nCommittee. I didn't have the votes to offer it, so I simply described \nit. I will offer it on the floor when the bill gets here. It requires \nthe investigation and gives the Energy Information Administration the \nrequirement to investigate and authority to subpoena information to to \nfind out what happened. We need to do that to make sure it doesn't \nhappen again. The price of oil is on the rise now, and it has gone from \n$38 to $70 a barrel even as supply is up and demand is down. Describe \nthat to me, in terms of a market, how that works. It doesn't make any \nsense.\n  That is a little background of where we find ourselves. We are \nunbelievably dependent upon oil, much of which comes from troubled \nparts of the world, over which we have little control. We need to be \nless dependent on oil. How do we do that? We wrote an energy bill in \nthe Senate Energy Committee that does a lot of everything. I believe in \ndoing a lot of everything. I believe we ought to produce more oil and \nnatural gas here onshore and in the Outer Continental Shelf. We should \nconserve more because we are prodigious wasters of energy. We should \nmake all the things we use more efficient. Efficiency is an \nunbelievable component of what we can do to save energy. Further, we \nshould maximize the capability of producing renewable energy.\n  The fact is, energy from the Sun shines on this Earth every day far \nin excess of the energy we need. If we are just smart enough and \ncapable enough of doing all the research and science that allows us to \nuse all that energy, then we can make progress.\n  The wind blows every day. At least where I come from, it blows every \nday. The Energy Department calls my State the Saudi Arabia of wind. So \nwe take the energy from the wind and produce electricity. The fact is, \nonce we put the turbine up, we can gather electricity from that wind \nfor 30 years at very low cost.\n  I believe we ought to do everything, and that is what we have tried \nto do in this legislation. Key to that is not just collecting energy \nfrom the wind and turning it into electricity; it is also about being \nable to move it where it is needed.\n  I come from a sparsely populated State. My State is 10 times the size \nof the State of Massachusetts in terms of landmass and has only 640,000 \npeople living in it. We don't need the additional energy produced from \nwind farms. We don't need that additional energy in my State. But we \nneed it in the larger load centers in this country. In order to get it \nthere, what we need to do is build an interstate highway of \ntransmission capability which is capable of producing renewable energy \nwhere it is produced and then move it to where it is used. This is not \nrocket science.\n  We did this with highways in the 1950s. President Eisenhower and the \nCongress said: Let's build an interstate highway system, and they moved \nforward. In parts of rural areas, one might say: How can you justify \nbuilding four lanes between towns where very few people live? Because \nwe are connecting New York with Seattle, that is why. That is what the \ninterstate was about--connecting America.\n  The same is true with respect to the need for transmission. What we \nhave put in this legislation addresses the issues that have so far \nprevented us from building the transmission capability we need in this \ncountry. What are the key issues? Planning, siting, and pricing. If you \ncannot plan for, site or price them, then nobody is going to build \nthem. All of those issues are critical to building an interstate \ntransmission system.\n  In the last 9 years, we have built almost 11,000 miles of natural gas \npipeline in this country. During the same period, we have only been \nable to build 668 miles of high voltage transmission lines interstate. \nIsn't that unbelievable? Why can't we do it? Because we\n\n[[Page S6694]]\n\nhave all these bifurcated jurisdictions that can stop it, saying: Not \nhere; not across my State lines.\n  We have passed legislation this morning that carries out some \nimportant things. This includes my amendment to open the eastern Gulf \nof Mexico for additional oil and gas production. That makes sense to \nme. I have a chart that shows what I did with this amendment.\n  I know one of my colleagues was on the floor having an apoplectic \nseizure about this suggestion of opening the eastern Gulf of Mexico for \noil and gas exploration. He suggested that it was going to impede and \ncause all kinds of difficulties with the routes over which we have \nsophisticated, important military training.\n  I have been working with a group of retired military and business \nleaders on an energy plan. They are members of the Energy Security \nLeadership Council. In April, Senator Voinovich and I introduced the \nplan which we called the National Energy Security Act. Let me describe \na little about the membership of that group. By the way, that group \nunderstood that the western and central Gulf are open for production. \nThey believe that the eastern gulf should be open as well because there \nare substantial reserves of oil and natural gas in this eastern area. \nIt can be done in a way that does not compromise our military \nreadiness.\n  Among the membership of this group is former GEN P.X. Kelley; GEN \nJohn Abizaid; ADM Dennis Blair; ADM Vern Clark; GEN Michael Ryan; and \nGEN Charles Wald; and others. These are some of the highest military \nofficials who have served this country, all of whom have retired, but \nall of whom also believe this area should be open for development.\n  Would they suggest that if this somehow would impede a military \ntraining area? Of course not. We have military training areas in the \ncentral and western gulf, and there is no issue there. There is no \nconflict.\n  This legislation is landmark in many ways. I was one of four Senators \nwho opened this little area. Four of us--Senator Domenici, Senator \nBingaman, Senator Talent and myself--offered legislation to open lease \n181 in the gulf. That was about 3 years ago. That was opened, but it \nchanged substantially before it was opened. This is another attempt to \nopen that area, which should be open in the eastern gulf.\n  I understand there are people upset with it. They say: You can't open \nit for drilling. Let me show what my proposition is in terms of doing \nit responsibly: The states control the first 3 miles. After that, there \nwould be no visible infrastructure allowed in the line of sight so you \ncannot see anything. Beyond, 25 miles there would not be restrictions. \nThe fact is, I think what we ought to do this in a way in order to be \nsensitive to the coastal States. I am not interested in putting oil \nwells right off their beaches. That is not the point. My point is, if \nwe are going to have an energy bill that solves America's energy \nproblem by making us less dependent on foreign energy and especially \nforeign oil, then we ought to do something of everything to make that \nhappen.\n  Does it include drilling and additional production? The answer is \nyes. Does it include substantial conservation? Absolutely. Efficiency? \nYes. Maximizing renewables? Certainly. What else? We need to move \ntoward a future in which we will have an electric drive system of \ntransportation, by and large, and we will also then, in the longer \nterm, transition to hydrogen fuel cell vehicles.\n  All of that is accomplished if we can make us less dependent on oil \nfrom outside our country by producing more here and conserving more \nhere and then producing substantial amounts of additional energy from \nrenewable energy such as wind and solar. We can produce electricity to \nput on a grid, a modern interstate highway grid, to move what we \nproduce to where we produce it to where the loads are and where the \nload center is needed.\n  This is not some mysterious illness for which we do not know the \ncure. This is an energy policy that we know will work if we just will \ndecide to do a lot of everything that represents our own self-interest: \nproduce more, increase energy efficiency, and maximize renewables.\n  I have not mentioned one final point, and that is this: Our most \nabundant resource is coal. Yesterday I was reading, once again, a \nprognosis that we cannot use coal in the future. Of course, we can use \ncoal, but we have to decarbonize it and use it much more efficiently. \nThere are a lot of inventive scientific folks out there who are doing \ncutting edge research that will allow us to continue to use our most \nabundant resource--coal.\n  I talked about opening up fields of oil and gas production. I am \nmaking substantial investments through the appropriations subcommittee \nthat I chair with respect to decarbonizing coal.\n  I am convinced we can build near zero emission coal-fired electric \ngeneration plants. I am convinced of that.\n  I know one of America's most prominent scientists who is working \nright now on something that is fascinating. He is working on developing \nsynthetic microbes to consume coal from which would then produce \nmethane gas. Wouldn't that be interesting? If you create a synthetic \nmicrobe to simply consume the coal and after consumption, the microbe \nturns coal into methane gas.\n  For example, there is another scientist in California who testified \nat a hearing I chaired recently about capturing carbon from a coal \nplant by capturing the flue gas and using the CO2 by turning \nit into a value-added product that for making concrete which has value \nin the marketplace. This would help bring down the cost of \ndecarbonizing coal.\n  I don't know. We have solved a lot of difficult problems in our past. \nWe can surely solve these problems in our future if we are just smart \nand do a lot of things that work well for our country.\n  Mr. President, I compliment my colleagues--Senator Bingaman, Senator \nMurkowski, and other Democratic and Republican colleagues on this \ncommittee. We have worked on this energy bill for some months. It has \ntaken us a while to get to this point. But today, at long last, we \npassed this legislation by a bipartisan vote of 15-8. We will have it \non the Senate floor at some point. We will have further debate about \npoints of it. It is exactly what we ought to be discussing: How do we \nmake America more secure? How do we make America less dependent on \nforeign oil and things over which we have no control or very little \ncontrol? We must develop an energy program at home that makes a lot of \nsense, that does a lot of everything, and does it very well. I am happy \nsay that we have made a positive step in that direction this morning in \nthe Energy Committee.\n\n\n                            Financial Reform\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk about one other issue today, and that \nissue is something that has been announced by the President this \nafternoon. It deals with the President's plan for financial regulation. \nI know my colleague from Utah just described it from his perspective. I \nhave great respect for him. Let me describe from my perspective why it \nis necessary for us to have a financial regulation package that \nrequires some reform in those areas as well.\n  I don't think there is anything we can do in the Congress or that \nPresident Obama can do that is more important for the future of this \ncountry and lifting this economy and trying to put it back on track in \na way that expands opportunity and creates jobs than to try to instill \nsome confidence in the American people.\n  As I have said a dozen times on the floor of the Senate, this is all \nabout confidence. We have all kinds of sophisticated things we work on \nand tax policy and M-1 B and all these other issues. None of it matters \nas much as confidence. When the American people are confident about the \nfuture, they do the things that expand the economy. They buy a suit of \nclothes, they take a trip, buy a car, buy a house. They do the things \nthat represent their feeling that the future is going to be better. \nThey feel secure in their job and in their lives, so they do things \nthat expand the economy.\n  If they are worried about their job, if they are wondering whether \nthe economy will allow them and their family to continue to pay all \ntheir bills, when they are not confident about the future, they do \nexactly the opposite. They contract the economy. They defer those \npurchases. They make different judgments. We are not going to buy the \nsuit of clothes, not take that trip, won't buy the car or the house. \nThey\n\n[[Page S6695]]\n\ncontract the economy. That is why everything rests on confidence by the \nAmerican people going forward.\n  Just answer the question: How on Earth can people be confident about \nthis economy unless we fix that which caused this wreck, that which \nsteered this economy into the ditch and is now causing 550,000, 600,000 \npeople every month to have to come home and tell their loved one: I \nhave lost my job. No, not because I was doing bad work; I was told they \nare cutting back at the office or the plant.\n  This economy has in recent years been an economy with an unbelievable \nbubble of speculation about a lot of things, and at the same time there \nwas unbelievable negligence in oversight by those the public has hired \nin Federal agencies to do the oversight of what was going on. We wake \nup one morning and we discover there are hundreds of trillions of \ndollars of exotic financial products called CDOs and credit default \nswaps and all kinds of strange names that are very complicated with \nunbelievable embedded risk. We don't know who has them, we don't know \nhow much risk is out there. All of a sudden things start collapsing, \nthe economy goes into a ditch, and we are in huge trouble.\n  How did it all happen? Was someone not watching?\n  Yes, that is the point; someone was not watching for a long period of \ntime.\n  The President has talked about the need for financial reform, and \ntoday he has described at least an initial portion of what he would \nlike to do. I think many of us share his feelings about the need for \neffective regulation. That is not rocket science given what we have \nbeen through.\n  Let me say this. Effective regulation is something that I think, from \nmy personal observation, is probably not going to come from the Federal \nReserve Board. Let me talk just about where the location of this \nregulation is or should be.\n  The Federal Reserve Board, in my judgment, essentially became a \nspectator for a long period of time under then Fed Chairman Alan \nGreenspan who believed that self-regulation was by far the best. Let \neverybody do what they will and they will do in their self-interest \nwhat they believe is right and self-regulation will be just fine.\n  It turns out it was an unbelievably bad decision. But the problem is, \nto set up the Federal Reserve Board as the systemic risk regulator is \nto set up a systemic risk regulator that is unaccountable. The Federal \nReserve Board is unaccountable. It is not accountable to the Congress, \nnot accountable to the President.\n  So in addition to establishing an unaccountable entity, it is also an \nentity that operates in great secrecy. I give the President great marks \nfor suggesting we have to have more effective regulatory capability. I \nam sure we will have discussions about exactly where should that \nregulation exist, who should be responsible, how do you get it right. I \ndo hope we can have a discussion about whether the systemic risk \nregulator should or could be an entity that is not accountable and one \nthat operates in substantial secrecy. My feeling is there is a much \nbetter way to do that, No. 1. No. 2, while there are a lot of details I \nwill not describe today, I still am interested in this question of \nwhether we will confront--and I don't know that from the President's \ndescription today whether we will--the issue of too big to fail.\n\n  It seems to me this issue of too big to fail is no-fault capitalism. \nThat is, if we don't address this question of too big to fail--which \nhas caused us enormous angst, in recent months especially--we will \nultimately have to confront the issue once again down the road when it \nis very expensive again to do so.\n  I do think there is a requirement here for us to support the \nPresident in deciding that there needs to be regulation that gives \npeople confidence that someone is minding the store. When I said that \nall of this rests on a foundation of confidence, I mean if we do not \nrestore the regulatory functions in a manner that the American people \nsee as just and fair, and most especially effective, I don't think we \nwill restore the kind of confidence that is necessary to begin building \nand expanding this economy once again.\n  Again, I give the President substantial credit today for saying this \nis an important issue. Let us get about the business of doing it. He \nhas offered us a description that now gives us a chance to discuss how \nwe begin to put the pieces back together of what is the most \nsignificant financial wreck since the Great Depression. This was not \nsome natural disaster, such as some huge hurricane or some big storm \nthat came running through. This disaster was manmade, and we need to \nmake sure we put in place the things that will prevent it from ever \nhappening again.\n  There will be, I am sure, much more discussion about this in the \ncoming days. Again I thank the President for beginning this discussion \nbecause it is essential, as we begin to try to build opportunity in \nthis economy once again, to restore the confidence of the American \npeople by saying we are going to have effective regulatory capabilities \nto make certain we don't have this unbelievable bubble of speculation \nthat helped cause the collapse of our economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brownback pertaining to the introduction of S. \n1282 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Modern Day Slavery\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to share with my \ncolleagues a problem--a worldwide problem--that we thought was left \nbehind in the 20th Century--slavery. I am talking about modern slavery, \nthe human trafficking that takes place around the world.\n  Yesterday, as Chairman of the U.S. Commission on Security and \nCooperation in Europe, the Helsinki Commission, I was privileged to \njoin Secretary of State Clinton at the State Department for the \nofficial release of the Ninth Annual Trafficking in Persons Report. \nThis is a vital diplomatic tool. It is put out every year by the United \nStates. We have been doing this now for almost 10 years. It lists every \ncountry and the current status of trafficking in their country. Some \ncountries are origin countries, others allow trafficking through their \ncountries, and other countries are receiving countries.\n  This report is an objective yardstick so that we know exactly what is \nhappening in each one of these countries. It is a valuable tool for us \nto put an end to the trafficking in human beings used for slavery or \nsex or for other illegal type purposes.\n  It was interesting that the Secretary of State, Secretary Clinton, \nalso released the Attorney General's Report to Congress: An Assessment \nof U.S. Government Activities to Combat Trafficking in Persons. This is \nthe first time we have had this report. This report talks about what is \nhappening in our own country, in the United States. Because we think it \nis important, if we are going to lead internationally, that we lead by \nexample of what we do in our own country in order to stop trafficking \nin human beings.\n  The Department of State's Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking \nutilizes our vast network of embassies and consulates throughout the \nworld to compile the most comprehensive report of its kind. It is an \nobjective yardstick we should be using more and more to press every \ncountry in the world to do more to stop modern slavery. The United \nStates has shown great leadership on this issue, and I commend \nSecretary Clinton for the incredible leadership she has demonstrated, \nmaking it a priority topic for the United States nationally and \ninternationally.\n  When Secretary Clinton was Senator Clinton, she served on the \nHelsinki Commission and was one of our leaders in forming a policy \nwithin the United States-Helsinki Commission to raise the issue of \ntrafficking in persons. As a result of the work of the U.S. commission \nand the leadership of our country, we were able to get the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, OSCE, to make this a \npriority; To adopt policies within OSCE so every\n\n[[Page S6696]]\n\nmember state, all 56, would adopt a strategy to first understand what \nis happening in their own country, to take an assessment as to where \nthey are in trafficking; then to develop a strategy to improve their \nrecord, adopt the best practices as we know, what has worked and what \nhas not worked; and then to make progress to root out trafficking in \ntheir own country. Again, whether they happen to be an origin country \nor whether they happen to be the host country or whether they just \nhappen to be a transit country in which persons are trafficked through \ntheir country, they need to adopt a strategy that will help rid us of \nthis modern-day slavery.\n\n  I am very proud of the role the United States has played, our \ngovernment has played, and the Helsinki Commission has played. I wish \nto call this matter to the attention of our colleagues. I found the \nongoing work of the Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking and the \nTrafficking in Persons Report extremely useful in engaging the 55 \nparticipating states of the OSCE. We use this document frequently when \nwe meet with our colleagues or when they travel to the United States to \nmeet with us, to say: What are you doing about this? This tells us you \ncould do a better job in law enforcement. You need to recognize that \nthose who are trafficked are victims. They are not criminals, they are \nvictims, and you need to have a way to take care of their needs.\n  The report continues to function as a working document, frequently \ncited and invoked to promote adherence to numerous human rights \ncommitments and the principles of the Helsinki Act.\n  Some of the most striking parts of this year's report--besides the \nstaggering estimates by the International Labor Organization that there \nare at least 12.3 million adults and children in forced labor, bonded \nlabor, and commercial sexual servitude at any given time--are the \nwrenching victims' stories themselves.\n  We know trafficking is connected to organized crime. We know that. \nThis is not just isolated trafficking of people, it is also part of an \norganized effort, criminal efforts that we need to root out. But we \nsometimes forget that the women, children, and men who are trafficked \nare victims and we must treat them as victims, with respect and \ndignity. That is a success story. We have made progress. Tougher law \nare being adopted.\n  Take Xiao Ping of China. Now 20 years old, her testimony in the State \nDepartment report says that:\n\n        She spent most of her life in her small village in Sichuan \n     Province. She was thrilled when her new boyfriend offered to \n     take her on a weekend trip to his hometown. But her boyfriend \n     and his friends instead took her to a desert village in the \n     Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and sold her to a farmer to \n     be his wife. The farmer imprisoned Xiao Ping, beat her, and \n     raped her for 32 months. . . . Xiao Ping's family borrowed a \n     substantial sum to pay for her rescue, but the farmer's \n     family forced her to leave behind her 6-month-old baby. To \n     cancel the debts, Xiao Ping married the man who provided the \n     loan. But her husband regarded her as `stained goods,' and \n     the marriage did not last.\n\n  Tragic scenarios like this will continue unless all countries--\nwhether a point of origin for the sex trade, a transit point for slaves \nwhose criminal traffickers are undetected by law enforcement, or a \ndestination for a forced child laborer, work together to increase \nprosecution of these crimes. In concert with the immense awareness \nraising efforts of the Trafficking in Persons Report, the exchange of \nU.S. policies and countertrafficking mechanisms throughout the OSCE \nregion has resulted in a steady increase in the number of countries \nwith enacted antitrafficking legislation. That is a success story. We \nhave made progress. Tougher laws are being adopted.\n\n  Probably even more important, we are developing attitudes in \ncountries that this cannot continue, it is not something you can just \noverlook. I must tell you, these reports that were issued, now for \nalmost 10 years, have played a critical role. The United States should \nbe proud of what we have been able to do to call world attention to \nthis issue.\n  According to the State Department's report, a young woman from \nAzerbaijan, Dilara, had a sister who:\n\n       .  .  . had been tricked into an unregistered marriage to a \n     trafficker who later abandoned her when she got pregnant. \n     When Dilara confronted her sister's traffickers, she herself \n     became a victim. She ended up in Turkey, where she and other \n     abducted girls were tortured and forced to engage in \n     prostitution. Dilara escaped with the help of Turkish police, \n     who promptly arrested the nine men who trafficked Dilara and \n     her sister.\n\n  They were some of the lucky ones. Dilara and her sister found help \nfrom a local NGO, including job training, and now she works and lives \nher life as a free woman in Baku.\n  From some of these tragedies we have seen heroic actions taking \nplace, some encouragement that we are making progress.\n  Prostitution is not the only form of involuntary servitude outlined \nin this latest report. It contains true stories like: a family in India \nthat were bonded laborers at a rice mill for three generations until \nfreed with the help of NGOs; young boys in the Democratic Republic of \nCongo abducted from their school by a militia group and tortured until \nthey submitted to serving as soldiers; and an 8-year-old girl from \nGuinea given away as an unpaid domestic servant after her mother and \nbrother died.\n  These are real people. These are real stories.\n  The U.S. is not immune from the problems of modern day slavery. The \n2009 Trafficking in Persons Report highlights a young girl brought to \nCalifornia from Egypt by a wealthy couple who forced her to work up to \n20 hours a day for just $45 a month. And earlier in June, more than a \ndozen Filipinos were rescued from hotels in Douglas and Casper, WY, \nwhere they were working with minimal pay and forced to live in \nhorrendous conditions. Their ``employment agency'' purposefully allowed \ntheir work visas to expire so they would be trapped into servitude as \nillegal aliens. A Federal grand jury brought forward a 45-count \nindictment on racketeering, forced labor trafficking, immigration \nviolations, identity theft, extortion, money laundering, and other \nrelated violations in Wyoming and 13 other States.\n  These are criminal elements. Fortunately we are starting to see \nprosecutions of people involved in these activities.\n  We want to end this modern day slavery--as human beings we need to \nend this slavery--in the United States and around the world. \nInvoluntary domestic servitude, sex trafficking and forced labor should \nnot be acceptable in any 21st century civilization.\n  The OSCE has a unique role in generating instruments that empower \ngovernments to end human trafficking. Each year, the OSCE Special \nRepresentative and Coordinator for Combating Trafficking in Human \nBeings also prepares a report that outlines the trends and developments \nof counter- trafficking efforts in the OSCE region. This report has \nbeen instrumental in promoting the establishment of national \nrapporteurs, consistent data collection practices, and standardized law \nenforcement policies to ensure more robust cooperation to end modern \nslavery. It is used around the world so people can see how to better \nprepare their own country to identify trafficking and help its \nprosecution.\n  The OSCE efforts closely complement the Trafficking in Persons Report \nand demonstrate a close partnership with the efforts of the Office to \nMonitor and Combat Trafficking. I truly hope this close partnership \ncontinues to flourish.\n  We were instrumental in getting OSCE to have the capacity to do this, \nand Congress was instrumental in getting the State Department to make \nthese annual reports. Now we have the documents. Now we have the \nevidence. We know progress can be made. We have seen progress made. But \nuntil we rid our civilization of modern-day slavery, we have not \naccomplished our goal.\n  Let's take these reports, use these reports so we can bring this to \nan end and help those who have been victimized through traffickers.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S6697]]\n\n                          Judicial Nominations\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, the nomination of a new Justice to the \nSupreme Court of the United States brings to our minds a core question, \nboth for the Senate and the American people, and that is: What is the \nproper role of a Federal judge in our Republic?\n  Answering this question is not simply an academic task, it is \nfundamental to what we will be doing here. How the American people and \ntheir representatives and their Senators, the ones who have been \ndelegated that responsibility, answer that question impacts not only \nthe future of our judiciary but I think the future of our legal system \nand the American experience.\n  In traveling the world as part of the Armed Services Committee, I am \nmore convinced than ever before that the glory of our American \nexperience, our liberty, and our prosperity is based on the fact that \nwe have a legal system you can count on. When you go to places such as \nAfghanistan or Iraq or Pakistan or the West Bank or Bosnia and you see \npeople--and they cannot get a legal system working. It does not work, \nand people are not protected, in their persons, from attack, and their \nproperty is not protected, contracts often are not enforced properly. \nThat just demoralizes the country. It makes it very difficult for them \nto progress.\n  I am so proud of the American legal system. It is something we \ninherited, we built upon. It is the bulwark for our liberty and our \nprosperity.\n  So we ask this question: What do judges do? Do they faithfully \ninterpret our Constitution and laws as written or do they have the \npower to reinterpret those documents through the lens of their personal \nviews, backgrounds, and opinions?\n  Is the Judiciary to be a modest one, applying the policies others \nhave enacted, or can it, the Judiciary, create new policies that a \njudge may desire or think are good?\n  When the correct answer to a legal case is difficult to ascertain, is \na judge then empowered to remove his or her blindfold, that Lady of \nJustice with the blindfold on holding the scales? Can they remove the \nblindfold and allow their personal feeling or other outside factors to \nsway the ultimate decision in the case?\n  I am going to be talking about that and addressing those questions in \nthe weeks to come. But I do think we need to first begin at the source. \nWe must return to the words and ideas of those who founded our Nation, \nwhose foresight resulted in the greatest Republic this world has ever \nknown and the greatest legal system anywhere in the world.\n  It is clear from reviewing these words and ideas and ideals, \nparticularly as expressed in the Constitution itself, that our Founders \ndesired and created a court system that was independent, impartial, \nrestrained, and that, through a faithful rendering of the Constitution, \nserves as a check against the intrusion of government on the rights of \nhumankind.\n  The Founders established a government that was modest in scope and \nlimited in its authority. In order to limit the expansion of Federal \nGovernment power, they bounded the government by a written \nConstitution. Its powers were only those expressly granted to the \ngovernment. As Chief Justice John Marshall famously wrote:\n\n       This government is acknowledged by all to be one of \n     enumerated powers.\n\n  Enumerated means the government has the power it was given and only \nthose powers it was given. If you will recall the Constitution starts \nout:\n\n       We the people of the United States of America, in order to \n     establish a more perfect Union . . .\n\n  So the people established it, and they granted certain powers to the \nbranches of government. But those powers were not unlimited, they were \nindeed limited. They were enumerated and set forth.\n  But our Founders knew these limitations, history being what it is, \nstanding alone were not enough. So they created three distinct branches \nof the government, creating a system of checks and balances to prevent \nany one branch from consolidating too much power. The Constitution \ngives each branch its own responsibility.\n  Article I of the Constitution declares:\n\n       All legislative powers, herein granted shall be vested in a \n     Congress of the United States.\n\n  Article II two declares:\n\n       The executive power shall be vested in a President of the \n     United States.\n\n  And Article III declares:\n\n       The judicial power of the United States shall be vested in \n     one Supreme Court.\n\n  And such other Courts as the Congress creates.\n  These words are unambiguous. The Judiciary possesses no power to make \nlaw or even enforce law. In Federalist No. 47, one of our Founding \nFathers, James Madison, cites the Constitution of Massachusetts which \nstates:\n\n       The judicial shall never exercise the legislative and \n     executive powers, or either of them, to the end that it may \n     be a government of laws and not of men.\n\n  So Madison, in arguing for the Constitution, trying to convince the \nAmericans to vote for it, quoted the Massachusetts Constitution--this \nprovision in it, with approval stating that is essentially what we have \nin our Federal Government.\n  Madison was a remarkable man.\n  He went on to describe the separation of powers as the ``essential \nprecaution in favor of liberty.'' Alexander Hamilton, in Federalist No. \n78--written to encourage Americans to support the Constitution--quotes \nthe French philosopher, Montesquieu, who said:\n\n       There is no liberty if the power of judging not be \n     separated from the legislative and executive powers.\n\n  The judicial branch, then, is limited to the interpretation and \napplication of law--law that exists, not law they create. At no point \nmay its judges substitute their political or personal views for that of \nelected representatives or to the people themselves--the people's will \nhaving been permanently expressed in the Constitution that created the \njudiciary.\n  To gain a deeper understanding of this role, it is instructive to \nlook further in Hamilton's Federalist No. 78, widely regarded as one of \nthe definitive documents on the American court system. In it Hamilton \nexplains that ``the interpretation of the law is the proper and \npeculiar province of the courts. The constitution . . . must be \nregarded by the judges as a fundamental law. It therefore belongs to \nthem to ascertain its meaning.''\n  Judges do not grant rights or remove them. They defend the rights \nthat the Constitution enumerates. So it is thus no surprise that \nHamilton says a judge must have an ``inflexible and uniform adherence \nto the rights of the Constitution.''\n  In order to ensure that judges would consistently display such \nadherence to the Constitution in the face of outside pressures, our \nFramers took steps to ensure that the judiciary was independent from \nthe other branches and insulated from political interference. As was \noften the case, the Framers were guided by the wisdom of their own \nexperience. They had a lot of common sense in the way they dealt with \nthings.\n  In England, colonial judges were not protected from the whims of the \nKing. Included in the Declaration of Independence's litany of \ngrievances is the assertion, when Jefferson was setting forth the \ncomplaints against the King, he asserted that the King had ``made \nJudges dependent on his Will alone, for the tenure of their offices . . \n.''\n  That was a complaint. That was one of the things we objected to in \nthe way the King was handling the people in the Colonies. That was part \nof the Declaration. When the Constitution was drafted, that matter was \nfixed.\n  In order to shield the courts from the threat of political pressure \nor retribution, article III effectively grants judges a lifetime \nappointment, the only Federal office in America that has a lifetime \nappointment. We have to answer to the public. So does the President. It \nalso specifically prohibits Congress from diminishing judicial pay or \nremoving judges during times of good behavior. So Congress can't remove \na judge or even cut their pay. Hamilton referred to this arrangement as \n``one of the most valuable of modern improvements in the practice of \ngovernment.'' He went on to say that he saw it as the best step \navailable to ``secure a steady, upright, and impartial administration \nof the laws.''\n  So Madison hoped the courts, set apart from the shifting tides of \npublic opinion, would be better suited to act as ``faithful guardians \nof the constitution'' to stand against ``dangerous innovations in \ngovernment.'' In other\n\n[[Page S6698]]\n\nwords, courts are removed from the political process not so they are \nfree to reinterpret the Constitution and set policy, but so they are \nfree from the pressures of those who would encourage them to do just \nthat.\n  The Framers also understood that the courts, as an unelected branch \nof government with a narrow mandate, would also necessarily be the \nweakest branch. Hamilton wrote that whoever looks at the ``different \ndepartments of power must perceive that, in a government in which they \nare separated from each other, the judiciary, from the nature of its \nfunctions, will always be the least dangerous to the political rights \nof the Constitution; because it will be least in a capacity to annoy or \ninjure them. . . .It may truly be said to have neither force nor will, \nbut merely judgment. . . .''\n  So in light of this narrow mandate that judges have been given, \njudges have understood from time to time that they ought not to be \ndrawn into the political thicket; that they ought to decline to answer \nquestions that they felt were more appropriately to be addressed by the \npolitical branches of government. Typically, this distant approach has \nbeen invoked when the Constitution has delegated decision-making on a \nparticular issue to a particular branch, when the court finds a lack of \n``judicially discoverable and manageable standards'' to guide its \ndecision-making, or when the court feels it best not to insert itself \nin a conflict between branches. That is what is happening. They are \nshowing restraint and discipline. This is an example of judicial \nrestraint because it respects the powers of the other branches and the \nrole of elected representatives rather than the appointed judges in \nestablishing policy.\n  This is not an academic exercise or an abstract hypothetical. \nJudicial activism has enormous consequences for every American because \nif judges who are given a lifetime appointment and guaranteed salaries \nare given the power to set policy, then that is an anti-democratic \noutcome because we have created someone outside the political process \nand allowed them to set policy for the country and they cease to be \naccountable to the American people.\n  The men and women of the Supreme Court hold extraordinary power over \nour lives. It takes only five Justices to determine what the words of \nthe Constitution mean. You may think it is nine; it is really just \nfive. If five of the nine agree that the Constitution means this or \nthat, it is as good--hold your hats--as if three-fourths of the States \npassed a constitutional amendment along with the supermajority votes of \nthe Congress. So this is a powerful thing a Supreme Court Justice \npossesses, the ability to interpret words of the Constitution.\n  When Justices break from the ideal of modest and restrained \npractices, as described by Hamilton, they begin creating rights and \ndestroying rights based on their personal views, which they were never \nempowered to do. The temptation to reinterpret the Constitution leads \njudges, sometimes, to succumb to the siren call of using that \nopportunity they might possess to enact something they would like to \nsee occur.\n  Maybe somebody will write in a law review that they were bold and \ncourageous and did something great. We have seen some of these actions \noccur. Under the power to regulate business and commerce the government \nis given, our Supreme Court recently ruled that carbon dioxide, which \nis a naturally occurring substance in our environment--when plants \ndecay, they emit carbon dioxide; when they live, they draw in from the \nair carbon dioxide; it is plant food--they ruled that it was a \npollutant. As a result, regardless of how you see that matter, I think \nwhen the statute was passed they gave EPA regulation to control \npollution in the 1970s long before global warming was ever a \nconsideration; that Congress had no contemplation that it would be used \nto limit carbon dioxide some years later. But that is what the Court \nruled.\n  I only say that because that was a huge economic decision of \nmonumental proportions. It called on an agency of the U.S. Government \nto regulate every business in America that uses fossil fuels. It is a \nfar-reaching decision. Right or wrong, I just point out what five \nmembers of the Court can do with a ruling, and that was five members. \nFour members dissented on that case.\n  At least two members of the Supreme Court concluded that the death \npenalty is unconstitutional because they believe that it is cruel and \nunusual as prohibited by the eighth amendment to the Constitution. They \ndissented on every single death penalty case and sought to get others \nto agree with them. Some thought others might agree with them. But as \ntime went by, they have now left the bench and no other Judges have \nadhered to that philosophy. But I would say that it is an absolutely \nuntenable position because the Constitution itself makes at least eight \nreferences to the death penalty. It is implicit in the Constitution \nitself. It says the government can't take life without due process. So \nthat contemplates that there was a death penalty, and you could take \nlife with due process.\n  The Constitution also refers to capital crimes and makes other \nreferences to the death penalty. Every single Colony, every single \nState at the founding of our government had a death penalty. It is an \nabuse of power for two Judges to assert that the eighth amendment, \nwhich prohibited drawing and quartering and other inhumane-type \nactivities, actually should be construed to prohibit the death penalty. \nThat is judicial activism. They didn't like the death penalty. They \nread through the Constitution, found these words, and tried to make it \nsay what it does not.\n  So the question is not whether these policies are good or bad, \nwhether you like the death penalty or not. That is a matter of opinion. \nAnd how one believes that global warming should be confronted is not \nthe question. The question is whether a court comprised of nine \nunelected Judges should set policy on huge matters before the country \nthat we are debating in the political arena.\n  Should that not be the President and the Congress who are accountable \nto the voters to openly debate these issues and vote yes or no and \nstand before the people and be accountable to them for the actions they \ntook? I think the Constitution clearly dictates the latter is the \nappropriate way.\n  A number of groups and activists believe the Court is sort of their \nplace and that social goals and agendas they believe in that are not \nlikely to be won at the ballot box, they have an opportunity to get a \njudge to declare it so. We have the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals en \nbanc ruling that the Pledge of Allegiance to the Constitution is \nunconstitutional because it has the words under God in it. Actually, \nthat has never been reversed. It has been vacated in a sense because \nthe Supreme Court rejected it on, I think, standing grounds. But at any \nrate, those are the things that are out there. It is not in the \nConstitution. This is a bad course for America.\n  If the judiciary heads further down that path, then I think we do \nhave dangers because we are actually weakening the Constitution. How \ncan we uphold the rule of law if those who weigh the scales have the \npower to tip them one way or the other based on empathy, their feelings \nor their personal views? How can we curb the excess of Federal power if \nwe allow our courts to step so far beyond the limits of their \nlegitimate authority? How can the least among us depend on the law to \ndeliver justice, to protect them, to steadfastly protect their \nliberties, if rulings are no longer objective and if a single judge has \nthe power to place his or her empathy above the law and the evidence?\n  So with these fundamental questions in mind, I hope the comments I \nmake in the weeks to come will be of some value as we talk about the \nfuture of the judiciary, what the role of a judge ought to be on our \nhighest court, and to uphold our sacred charter of inalienable rights.\n  So let me repeat, I love the American legal system. I am so much an \nadmirer of the Federal legal system I practiced in for 15 years before \nfabulous judges. They were accused sometimes of thinking they were \nanointed rather than appointed. But I found most of the time--the \nprosecutor that you are--they did follow the law and they tried to be \nfair. I think the independence we give them is a factor in their \nfairness and something I will defend. But there is a responsibility \nthat comes with the independence judges get. And that responsibility is \nthat when they get that bench\n\n[[Page S6699]]\n\nand they assume that power, they not abuse it, they use integrity, they \nare objective, and they show restraint.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n\n                       Nomination Sonia Sotomayor\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I listened carefully to the statement of \nmy colleague, Senator Sessions, from Alabama, who is the ranking \nRepublican in the Senate Judiciary Committee, who is charged with a \nspecial responsibility at this moment in history. Because with the \nretirement of Supreme Court Justice David Souter and the vacancy that \nhas been created, the Senate Judiciary Committee has the responsibility \nto work with the President to fill that vacancy.\n  I am honored to be a member of that committee and to be facing the \nthird vacancy since I have been elected to the Senate. It is rare in \none's public political life to have a chance to have a voice or a \npartial role in the selection of one Supreme Court Justice. But to have \na chance to be involved in the selection of three, for a lawyer, is \nquite an amazing responsibility.\n  Senator Sessions and I are friends, and we see the world somewhat \ndifferently. But I would say to him that I would quarrel with the \nnotion that our laws are so clear that a judge, given a set of facts, \ncould only draw one conclusion. What we find often is the opposite. \nWell-trained attorneys who become judges can look at the same law and \nthe same facts and reach different conclusions. That is why, when it \ncomes to appellate courts, it is not unusual to have a split decision. \nDifferent judges see the facts in a different context.\n  So to argue that we want judges who will always reach the same \nconclusion from the same laws and facts defies human experience. It is \nnot going to happen. People see things differently. People read words \ndifferently. People view facts differently. Occasionally judges, faced \nwith cases they may never have envisioned, see a need for change in our \ncountry.\n  There are times when I might agree with that change and times when I \nmight disagree. In 1954, right across the street, in the Supreme Court, \na decision was reached in Brown v. Board of Education. Fifty-five years \nago, they took a look at the schools of America, the public schools of \nAmerica, that were segregated, Black and White, and said: No, you \ncannot have separate and equal schools. That brought about a dramatic \nchange in America: the integration of America's public education.\n  The critics said that Supreme Court had gone too far, they had no \nright to reach that conclusion. Well, I disagree with those critics. \nBut some of them said they should have been strict constructionists, \nthey should have left schools as they were; it was not their right to \nchange the public school system of America. I think they did the right \nthing for this Nation.\n  Having said that, there are times when a Supreme Court has reached a \ndecision which I disagree with. Most recently, this current Court--\nwhich is dominated by more conservative members, those who fall into \nthe so-called strict construction school--had a case that came before \nthem involving a woman. She was a woman who worked at a tire \nmanufacturing plant in Alabama, if I am not mistaken. She spent a \nlifetime working there. Her name was Lilly Ledbetter. Lilly rose \nthrough the management ranks and was very happy with the assignment she \nwas given at this plant.\n  She worked side by side, shoulder to shoulder, with many male \nemployees. It was not until Lilly announced her retirement that one of \nthe employees came to her and said: Lilly, for many years now, you have \nbeen paid less than the man you were working next to, even though you \nhad the same job title and the same job assignment. This company was \npaying less to women doing the same job as men. She thought that was \nunfair--after a lifetime of work--that she would not receive equal pay \nfor equal work.\n  So she filed a lawsuit under a Federal law asking that she be \ncompensated for this discrimination against her--the reduction in pay \nshe had faced and the retirement reduction which she faced as a result \nof it. It was a well-known law she filed her case under, giving each \nAmerican the right to allege discrimination in the workplace, and she \nset out to prove it.\n  Her case made it all the way to the Supreme Court of the United \nStates, across the street--the highest court in the land. This \nconservative, strict construction Court departed from all the earlier \ncases. The earlier cases had said something that was, I think, \nreasonable on its face. They looked at the statute, the law the case \nwas brought under, and said Lilly Ledbetter had a specific period of \ntime after she discovered the discrimination to file a lawsuit. I \nbelieve the period was 6 months. I may be mistaken, but I think that is \na fact--that she had 6 months after she discovered she was \ndiscriminated against to file a lawsuit. And Lilly Ledbetter said: That \nis exactly what I did. When I learned I was discriminated against, I \nfiled within that statutory requirement.\n  But the Supreme Court, across the street--the strict constructionists \nthat they are--reached a different conclusion. Their conclusion was \nthat the law did not mean that. The law meant she had to file the \nlawsuit within 6 months after the first act of discrimination. In other \nwords, the first time she was paid less than the man working next to \nher, she had a clock starting to run, and she had 6 months to file the \nlawsuit.\n  Well, those of us who have worked outside government--and even those \nworking in government, for that matter, to some extent, but those \nworking in the private sector know it is a rare company that publishes \nthe paychecks of every employee. You may be working next to someone for \nyears and never know exactly what they are being paid.\n  That was the case with Lilly Ledbetter. She did not know the man \nstanding next to her, doing the same job, was being paid more. She did \nnot discover that until many years later.\n  So the Supreme Court said: Mrs. Ledbetter, unfortunately, you did not \nfile your case in time. We are throwing it out of court. And they did. \nStrict constructionists, conservatives that they were, they departed \nfrom the previous court's decisions, which had given her and people \nlike her the right to recover and limited that right to recover.\n  Well, in the name of Lilly Ledbetter, we changed the law to make it \nabundantly clear, so that neither this Supreme Court nor any Supreme \nCourt in the future will have any doubt that it is 6 months after the \ndiscovery of discrimination, not after the first act of discrimination.\n  It was one of the first bills, if not the first bill, President \nBarack Obama signed. I happened to be there at the signing, and \nstanding next to him, receiving the pen for that signature, was Lilly \nLedbetter. She may not have won in the Supreme Court, she may not have \ncome back with the compensation she was entitled to, but she at least \nhad the satisfaction to know this Congress and this President would not \nallow the injustice created by that Supreme Court decision to continue.\n  So the Senator from Alabama came here and said: We do not need judges \nwith empathy. That word has been stretched in many different \ndirections. But if empathy means we do not need judges who understand \nthe reality of the workplace, if empathy means we would say to Lilly \nLedbetter: Sorry, you missed it, girl, you had 6 months to file that \nlawsuit from the first act of discrimination, the first paycheck--you \nmissed it, and you are out of luck--if empathy would say that is not a \nfair or just result, I want judges with empathy. I want them to know \nthe real world. I want them to know the practical impact of the \ndecisions they make. I want them to follow the law. I want them to be \nfair in its administration. But I do not want them to sit high and \nmighty in their black robes so far above the real world that they could \nnot see justice if it bit them. I think that is what empathy brings--\nsomeone who is at least in touch with this real world.\n  For the last several--2 weeks, I guess--the nominee of President \nBarack Obama for the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor, has been meeting \nwith the Members of the Senate. She had an unfortunate mishap and broke \nher ankle at La Guardia Airport, so I allowed her to use my conference \nroom upstairs on the third floor, and there was a steady parade of \nSenators coming in to meet her.\n  I asked her this morning. She said: I have seen 61 Senators, and I \nhave 6\n\n[[Page S6700]]\n\nmore today. She may break a record for actually meeting face to face \nwith more Senators than most Supreme Court nominees. But regardless, \nshe is doing her level best to introduce herself and to answer any \nquestions Senators have. I think--and I told the President when I saw \nhim at an event today--he has made an extraordinary choice.\n\n  Sonia Sotomayor was first selected to serve on the Federal court--the \ndistrict court--by President George Herbert Walker Bush. She was then \npromoted by President Bill Clinton to a higher level court--the circuit \ncourt--and now is being nominated for Supreme Court service. She has \nmore experience on the Federal bench than any nominee in 100 years, so \nshe is going to be no neophyte if she is fortunate enough to serve on \nthe Court.\n  She is a woman with an extraordinary life story, having grown up in \nthe Bronx in public housing. Her father died when she was 9 years old. \nHer mother raised her and her younger bother, who ended up becoming a \ndoctor, incidentally.\n  She was encouraged to apply to Princeton, which was a world she knew \nnothing about as a young Latino growing up in the Bronx, but she \napplied and was accepted. At the end of the 4-year period, she \ngraduated second in her class at Princeton. I do not believe Princeton \nUniversity is an easy assignment. I think it is a challenging \nassignment. Clearly, she was up to it.\n  She went on to graduate from Yale Law School. She was involved in \nprosecution. She was involved in working in private law practice. She \nhas an amazing background in law, and I think she would be an \nextraordinary member of the Supreme Court.\n  So Senator Sessions came earlier and talked about his philosophy and \ncertainly expressed it very capably. I did not have any prepared \nremarks on the subject. Although I disagree with him, I respect him \nvery much, and I hope at the end of the day we can do the Senate proud \nand serve our Nation by giving her a fair and timely hearing.\n  Let's not use a double standard on this nominee. As chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Patrick Leahy has suggested a timely \nhearing on her nomination. It is a hearing within the same schedule of \nthose who went before her, such as Chief Justice Roberts or Justice \nAlito. So if she is given the same standard of fairness, that hearing \nwill go forward. I certainly hope it does and think she will do well.\n\n\n                                Tourism\n\n  Mr. President, this bill we are considering on the floor at this time \ncould not come at a better time. On October 2, the International \nOlympic Committee is going to select a site for the 2016 Olympic games.\n  I am proud to say that Chicago is one of the final global \ncandidates--one of the final four in the world. Winning that bid would \nbring 6 million tourists from all over the world into the United States \nand generate as much as $7 billion in tourist revenue.\n  This bill, by encouraging international tourism--the one before us--\nwill welcome international visitors to our country, and it will \ndemonstrate to the world that the United States is open for visitors. \nThat can only help improve the chances that the 2016 Olympic games \nactually come to the Windy City.\n  Tourism and travel generate approximately $1.3 trillion in economic \nactivity in the United States every year, including 8.3 million travel-\nrelated jobs.\n  Overseas visits to the United States, unfortunately, are still being \nhampered by the specter and memory of 9/11. That has cost the United \nStates an estimated $182 billion in lost spending by tourists in our \ncountry and $27 billion in lost tax receipts in the last 8 years. The \ncurrent economic downturn is expected to cost another 250,000 travel-\nrelated jobs just this year alone.\n  So this bill addresses some of the problems underlying this downturn \nin overseas visitors.\n  Through a public-private, nonprofit Corporation for Travel Promotion, \nthe United States will coordinate its efforts to encourage \ninternational tourism.\n  The new Office of Travel Promotion within the Department of Commerce \nwill work to streamline entry procedures, making travel to the United \nStates more welcoming and efficient.\n  The bill does all this while reducing budget deficits by $425 \nmillion. In other words, this is one of the few bills we will consider \nthat actually is going to make money. Bringing more tourists to the \nUnited States, generating more tax revenue, is going to be to our \neconomic benefit and the benefit of our government.\n  By setting up stronger entities to promote internationally the \nbenefits of visiting America, this bill certainly advances Chicago's \nchances to be awarded the 2016 Olympic games.\n  But the bill also offers an opportunity to showcase internationally \nall the other reasons to visit America, and they are many.\n  Even in my home State of Illinois, a lot of foreign travelers come to \nwalk the streets that Abraham Lincoln walked in Springfield, IL. \nLooking for Lincoln highlights sites all across our State, with a \nseries of stories about the President's life in 42 different counties \nof Illinois where his journeys took him.\n  The Abraham Lincoln Presidential Museum in Springfield, IL, was a pet \nproject of mine I thought of about 18 years ago and today is a \nreality. This Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum draws \nalmost half a million tourists a year to Springfield, many of them \nfamilies with children who leave with a better understanding and a very \nenjoyable visit after seeing Lincoln's life portrayed in very positive \nterms.\n\n  Saline County, IL, down in southern Illinois, draws visitors to its \nGarden of the Gods--the gateway to the Shawnee National Forest, one of \nthe prettier areas in our State.\n  Quincy, IL, features historic architecture and fun along the mighty \nMississippi River.\n  We have our unusual tourist attractions in Illinois as well. Near my \nold hometown of East St. Louis, you can visit Collinsville and see the \nworld's largest catsup bottle or the two-story outhouse in Gays, IL, or \nthe home of Superman, including a 15-foot Superman statue in \nMetropolis, IL, and a 6-foot Popeye statue in Chester, IL. A lot of \nphotographs have been taken in front of the statue.\n  Every State has these historic, amazing places to visit and those \ncuriosities that bring people from all over the United States and all \nover the world.\n  Illinois offers the international visitor a truly American \nexperience. In fact, Illinois tourism adds $2.1 billion to State and \nlocal tax coffers and supports more than 300,000 jobs annually. In \n2008, there were about 1.4 million international visitors to my State. \nThese travelers spent $2 billion in all sectors of the economy, from \ntransportation, to lodging, to food service, to entertainment. These \ninternational visitors generated an additional $521 million in wages \nand salaries for Illinois residents.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bipartisan bill. I am sorry \nit was delayed today. There was no reason for that. We sat here idly \ntoday making wonderful speeches when we should have been passing this \nbill. I hope we get to it soon, and I hope, with passing it, we will \nhelp this economy get back on its feet.\n  Mr. President, I see the Senator from Ohio is in the Chamber. I have \none last short statement I have to make.\n\n\n                  Consumer Financial Protection Agency\n\n  Mr. President, today I went to the White House to hear President \nObama announce a significant, sweeping change in the regulation of \nfinancial services. It is the most important change since the Great \nDepression. At the heart of President Obama's proposal is the creation \nof an independent new agency. It is called the Consumer Financial \nProtection Agency. It is going to put the interests of American \nfamilies and consumers above the interests of a lot of businesses and \nbanks.\n  I introduced a bill last year, and then again this year, that would \ncreate that same agency. It is an honor for me that the President would \npick up on this idea and make it a major part of what he is doing. But \nbefore I take too much credit for it, the idea really originated with \nElizabeth Warner. She is a professor at Harvard Law School who is one \nof the more creative, innovative people who advise us here on Capitol \nHill. She realizes, as most of us do, that most consumers and customers \nand businesses are at the mercy of a lot of regulations and a lot of \nfine print that is almost impossible to follow, so\n\n[[Page S6701]]\n\nshe suggested the creation of this agency, and the President followed \nthrough today.\n  It is simple: an agency staffed by people who wake up in the morning \nthinking about how to make consumer financial transactions safer in \nAmerica and more understandable. It will mean we are going to protect \nconsumers from making mistakes and making decisions that could be very \ndamaging to them economically.\n  Today, there are no fewer than 10 Federal agencies with the \nresponsibility for consumer protections from predatory or deceptive \nfinancial products to a variety of other areas, but none of them--not \none of them--has oversight as its primary objective. That is going to \nchange with President Obama's bill. This agency will encourage \ninnovation that benefits consumers rather than innovation that benefits \nthose who are going to make a profit off of those same consumers. There \nis a large coalition of consumer advocacy groups supporting this \nconcept. I look forward to working with Chairman Dodd and the Banking \nCommittee to see that this agency becomes a reality. It won't be an \neasy task, but it is a perfect followup to our Credit Card Reform Act.\n  We need to be more sensitive to consumers in America struggling in \nthis economy to make sure they have protection. One illustration tells \nit all.\n  There was a prepayment penalty that was folded into a lot of these \nsubprime mortgages. If you have been to a real estate closing on your \nhome, you know they stack up papers on a table in front of you and they \nturn the corners and they say: Keep signing, and eventually you will \nget out of here.\n  You may slow them down and say: What am I signing?\n  They will say: It is standard. It is boilerplate. It is a government \nrequirement. Keep signing.\n  Sign and sign and sign, 20, 30, 40 times, and then you get the check, \nhand it back to the bank, and you go home with the keys in hand. That \nhas happened to me a few times with my wife. I am a lawyer. Did I read \nevery page? No.\n  Well, it turned out that the mortgages that were sold for a long \nperiod of time in America had a prepayment penalty. So if you got into \na bad mortgage and decided, man, that interest rate is too high; I \ncan't keep making payments, so I am going to the bank next door where I \ncan get a lower interest rate, they would say: Sorry to tell you this, \nbut to pay off your old mortgage, there is a penalty that is pretty \nsteep. And you say: Well, I didn't know that. Well, you missed it. You \nmissed it in that stack of papers. That prepayment penalty sentenced \nthousands of American homeowners to be stuck with subprime mortgages \nthat were unfair and eventually led to foreclosure. Why wasn't there \nsomeone to warn that customer, that person borrowing for their home? \nThis agency can do that. This agency can make that sort of thing clear \nto customers and consumers across America so that they have a fighting \nchance. They can avoid bad decisions that can be disastrous for their \npersonal finances.\n  As Congress embarks on financial regulatory reform, our improved \nregulatory system must focus not just on safety and soundness of the \nproviders of financial products but also on the safety of the consumers \nof financial products. The Consumer Financial Protection Agency will do \njust that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I see my colleague from Ohio is here. I \nam wondering if we are in an alternating situation. I wish to speak for \nabout 5 minutes. Would that be all right?\n  Mr. BROWN. That is fine.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n\n\n                         Supreme Court Rulings\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, my colleague from Illinois, Senator \nDurbin, is such a fine lawyer and an excellent Senator. I would \nrespectfully talk about some of the ideas he suggested.\n  One, he raised the question about the case of Brown v. Board of \nEducation where the Court held that separate was not equal, and that \nsomehow this is a justification for a judge setting policy. He thought \nit wasn't good policy. I would see it differently. I would say Brown v. \nBoard of Education was the Supreme Court saying that the Constitution \nof the United States guarantees every American equal protection of the \nlaws. They found that in segregated schools, some people were told they \nmust go to this school solely because of their race, some people must \ngo to this school solely because of their race, and that, in fact, it \nwasn't equal. So there are several constitutional issues plainly there, \nand I don't think that was an activist policymaking decision. I think \nthe Supreme Court correctly concluded that these separate schools in \nwhich a person was mandated to go to one or the other based on their \nrace violated the equal protection clause of the United States, and, in \neffect, they also found it wasn't equal, which they were correct in \ndoing.\n  With regard to the Lilly Ledbetter case, Senator Durbin and my \nDemocratic colleagues during the last campaign and during the last \nseveral years have talked about this case a lot. I would just say that \neverybody knows it is a universal rule that whenever a wrong is \ninflicted upon an individual, they have a certain time within which to \nfile their claim. It is called the statute of limitations. If you don't \nfile it within the time allowed by law, then you are barred from filing \nthat lawsuit. It happens all over America in cases throughout the \ncountry.\n\n  The U.S. Supreme Court heard the evidence, and it was argued in the \nU.S. Supreme Court. This one lady, Lilly Ledbetter, took her case all \nthe way to the Supreme Court. They heard it, and they concluded that \nshe was aware of the unfair wage practices that she alleged long before \nthe statute of limitations--long before--and that by the time she filed \nher complaint, it was way too late. In fact, one of the key witnesses \nhad already died. So it was years after. So they concluded that.\n  The Congress, fulfilling its proper role, was unhappy about it and \nhas passed a law that I think unwisely muddles the statute of \nlimitations on these kinds of cases dramatically, but it would give her \na chance to be successful or another person in that circumstance to be \nsuccessful.\n  So this wasn't a conservative activist decision; it was a fact-based \nanalysis by the Supreme Court by which they concluded that she waited \ntoo long to bring the lawsuit, and it was barred. Congress, thinking \nthat was not good, passed a law that changed the statute of limitations \nso more people would be able to prevail. It is not wrong for the Court \nto strike down bad laws.\n  We just had a little to-do with Attorney General Holder today in the \nJudiciary Committee in which the Office of Legal Counsel of the \nDepartment of Justice had written an opinion that he kept down and has \nstill kept it hidden that declared that the legislation we passed to \ngive the District of Columbia--not a State but a district--a U.S. \nCongressman was unconstitutional. He didn't want that out since he and \nthe President supported giving a Congressman to the District of \nColumbia. But I think that case is going up to the Supreme Court, and I \nwould expect it will come back like a rubber ball off that wall because \nI don't think that was constitutional. And I don't believe that is \nactivism or an abuse of power; it is simply a plain reading of the \nConstitution.\n  If the Congress passes laws in violation of the Constitution, they \nshould be struck down. There is nothing wrong with that if the Court is \ndoing it in an objective, fair way, not allowing their personal, \nemotional, political, cultural, or other biases to enter into the \nmatter.\n  So I think we are going to have a great discussion about the Supreme \nCourt and our Federal courts. I look forward to it.\n  I really appreciate Senator Durbin. He is a superb lawyer. If I were \nin trouble, I would like to have him defending me.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, across the street today, in the so-called \nSenate Caucus Room--a room which, next to this Chamber, is perhaps the \nmost famous room in the Senate; a room where the McCarthy hearings, the \nMacArthur hearings, the Watergate hearings, and the hearings for the \nSupreme Court nominees during the confirmation process have been held. \nIt is the room where Senator John F. Kennedy\n\n[[Page S6702]]\n\nannounced his campaign for the Presidency in 1960. It is the room where \nSenator Robert F. Kennedy, whose desk at which I sit, announced his \ncandidacy for President in March of 1968. It is the room where today we \nare beginning to mark up the health care legislation that is the most \nimportant thing I have worked on in my, I guess, 17 years in \nWashington. It is probably the most important bill, with the exception \nof war and peace issues, this Congress has worked on in a long time.\n  This Congress has been trying for many years, as have been \nPresidents, to pass legislation to reform our health care system.\n  In 1945, Harry Truman spoke before a joint session of Congress down \nthe hall in the House of Representatives and said:\n\n       Millions of our citizens do not now have a full measure of \n     opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health. Millions do not \n     now have protection or security against the economic effects \n     of sickness. The time has arrived for action to help them \n     attain that opportunity and that protection.\n\n  That was 1945. That was President Harry Truman.\n  A dozen years before, President Roosevelt made a momentous decision. \nPresident Roosevelt decided, in large part because of his fear of the \npower of the American Medical Association, to not include health care \nin the Social Security legislation, in the bill to create Social \nSecurity, because President Roosevelt actually believed Social Security \nmeant a pension and health care.\n  But he thought the power of the doctors' lobby would keep him from \nbeing successful, so he moved forward in the creation of Social \nSecurity. Who knows if that was the right decision then, but it \ncertainly brought us a program that has mattered in the lives of our \nparents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. Harry Truman was not \nable to accomplish Medicare or any other significant health care reform \nin his 7 years or so as President.\n  Fast forward to July 1965. President Johnson passed legislation \ncreating Medicare. But leading up to that legislation, again, it was \nthe American Medical Association--the most conservative members, \nbecause I know a lot of doctors who wanted to see us move forward, \nincluding my father, who was a general practitioner for almost 50 \nyears. He died at 89 in 2000. Some in the AMA, in 1965, regarding the \ncreation of Medicare, called it socialized medicine, and said it was \ntoo expensive and it would lead to runaway, rampant socialism--the same \narguments they used in the 1930s, and the same arguments some are now \nusing about the public plan option in this health care legislation \ntoday.\n  People obviously know that Medicare, since 1965--coming up on 44 \nyears--has worked for the American public. Here is the best \nillustration of why Medicare works. There have been many studies over \nthe years comparing the outcomes in the United States--health \noutcomes--to the outcomes in other countries in the world. We rank, in \nterms of infant mortality, maternal mortality, diabetes, child obesity, \n\nand immunization rates--amazingly enough, even though we spend twice as \nmuch as everybody, we rank almost at the bottom among the rich \ncountries in the world on all of those things. There is one statistic \nwhere we rank near the top, and that is life expectancy at 65. So these \npages sitting in front of me, five decades from now when they turn 65--\nwe are going to change the system before then, but people who are 65 in \nthis country have a longer, healthier life in front of them than almost \nall other countries in the world. That is because we have Medicare, and \nMedicare works, pure and simple.\n  Today, some 65 years after Harry Truman made the speech to the joint \nsession I mentioned, we are still waiting for a health care system that \ndelivers on the promise of affordability and quality health coverage \nfor all.\n  We are waiting for reforms that lower costs for businesses and \nfamilies buckling under the weight of ever climbing premiums.\n  We are waiting for reforms that foster competition in the insurance \nmarket and give Americans better choices, including a public health \ninsurance option.\n  We are still waiting for reforms that bring accountability to the \nsystem, ensuring that our patients in this country get the highest \nquality care in the world.\n  We are waiting, in other words, for reforms that fix what is broken \nand keep what is working. That wait is nearly over. Today is a historic \ntime. That wait, since 1932 when FDR decided not to include it in the \nSocial Security law, to 1945 when President Truman spoke to a joint \nsession, to 1965 when President Johnson was able to push through \nCongress with a heavily Democratic House and Senate, as the \noverwhelming number of Republicans opposed it, the creation of \nMedicare, to today, we are finally at the historic moment. The wait is \nnearly over when we are going to have real health insurance reform. It \nis not a moment too soon for many Ohioans, who are one illness away \nfrom financial catastrophe.\n  For example, take Ann from Dayton, a community in southwest Ohio. She \nwrote to me last year. In the past 5\\1/2\\ years, she has paid almost \n$130,000 in health care bills. How can this be? Was she uninsured? No. \nWhen her illness struck, she was a partner in a law firm and had good \ninsurance. But once she became too sick to work, she lost her coverage \nand was forced to fend for herself.\n  She and her family of four went on COBRA for as long as they could, \nand then they paid $27,000 a year for insurance on the individual \nmarket, where medical underwriting runs rampant. That is where the \nadministrative costs run 30, 35, even 40 percent.\n  She recently traded that plan--the $27,000 a year plan, at $2,500 a \nmonth, almost--for a bare-bones policy that costs only $15,000 a year, \nbut doesn't cover prescription drugs and has a $5,000 deductible. \nBefore she gets $1 of care paid for by insurance companies, she is \npaying $15,000 for premiums and a $5,000 deductible. So she already has \npaid $20,000 before the insurance company comes in and helps her. She \nwrites, ``This is not what insurance is supposed to be about.''\n  The bill before us today will take a number of steps to ensure that \nAmericans do not meet the same fate as Ann and her family.\n  For one, it provides for better regulation of the health insurance \nindustry. This insurance industry, in some ways, is one step ahead of \nthe sheriff. It is an industry that always tries to figure out how to \nbeat the system and how to insure you because you are healthy; they can \nmake money on you, but they may exclude you because you are not so \nhealthy and they might lose money.\n  No longer will we allow insurance companies to play that game. We \nwill ban preexisting condition exclusions and prevent insurance \ncompanies from denying coverage based on medical history. We will \neliminate annual and lifetime benefit caps. No longer will insurance \ncompanies be able to selectively cover only those who pose little or no \nrisk of needing health care, leaving everybody else in a lurch. Health \ninsurers are not supposed to avoid health care costs; they are supposed \nto cover them.\n  Second, this reform will extend the reach of our health care system \nto protect those with no health insurance today.\n  Let me tell you about Jaclyn. She used to work at a child care \ncenter, but her employer didn't offer health care benefits, which is \nnot surprising. When she discovered a lump in her left breast, she had \nnowhere to turn. She tried the State Medicaid Program, but despite \nhaving an income in 2006 of only $4,500, she did not qualify. She had \nno dependents at that point. Her daughter was grown. She started \nchemotherapy last year, but doesn't know how she will pay her bills.\n  This bill would expand Medicaid and offer premium subsidies to those \nwho need help. This bill would increase competition in the health \ninsurance market by establishing a federally backed health coverage \noption for those who want it.\n  There is nothing like good old-fashioned competition to reduce \npremiums, improve customer service, and keep the health insurance on \nits toes.\n  Not surprisingly, the health insurance lobby has launched a massive \ncampaign to prevent inclusion of a public health insurance option with \nwhich they would have to compete.\n  I guess competition is a good thing, unless they are the ones who \nhave to compete. If you have a public option, insurance companies--the \nPresident says repeatedly that the whole point of\n\n[[Page S6703]]\n\nan option is that the public plan will compete with a private plan, \nwhich will keep the private plans more honest. We have done that with \nstudent loans. Fifteen years ago, the only game in town for students, \nby and large, if they wanted to borrow money for college, was to go to \na local bank, or another service, which were all private and \nunregulated. President Clinton, in the mid-1990s, decided maybe we \nshould have a direct government program so students could borrow \ndirectly from the Federal Government. Do you know what happened? The \nbanks brought their interest rates down. The banks started to provide \nbetter service. The banks behaved better. That is analogous to what we \nwill see with the public plan.\n  The conservatives in this body, who are major recipients of insurance \ncompany money for their campaigns, whose philosophies are always that \nbusiness can do it better, the people who have aligned their political \ncareers with the insurance industry all oppose the public option, the \npublic plan. Why? It is simple. It is because insurance companies will \nhave to cut down their administrative costs, maybe even pay lower \nsalaries to their top executives. Maybe they will have to change their \nmarketing practices, be less wasteful, and maybe they will behave a \nlittle better. In that case, the public option was competing with \nprivate banks, and everybody got better. A public health insurance \noption competing with the private insurance companies will make \neverybody get better. That is the whole point.\n\n  With private insurance competition, when it is just the insurance \ncompanies competing with each other, funny things tend to happen. We \nsee huge salaries and, second, a huge bureaucracy in the insurance \ncompanies and, third, we see all kinds of marketing campaigns, and we \nsee huge overhead and administrative costs--sometimes up to 35, 40 \npercent.\n  We also see that the term ``private insurance competition'' is often \nsimply an oxymoron. In Ohio, the two largest insurance companies \naccount for 58 percent of the market. I am not a lawyer, so I didn't \ntake the antitrust course. I didn't go to law school. When you have two \ncompanies that have 58 percent of the market, that is not competition. \nIn some Ohio cities--as I assume it is in the Presiding Officer's State \nof Illinois--the two largest insurance companies account for 89 percent \nof the market. That is not exactly healthy competition. If we bring in \na public option and compete with these two companies, their rates would \ncome down and salaries for top executives would come down. There would \nbe no more multimillion-dollar salaries, and administrative costs would \nbe cut. They would be leaner and meaner, a better insurance company as \na result.\n  Finally, this bill gives providers new tools to improve the way \nhealth care is delivered in this country, with improvements that help \nAmericans with chronic conditions manage those conditions, that can \ndramatically reduce medical errors and overcome unjustifiable \ndisparities in health care outcomes.\n  These reforms draw insight and inspiration from the work already \nbeing done by dedicated individuals within our health care system--\nindividuals such as Dr. Derek Raghavan, who heads the Taussig Cancer \nCenter at the Cleveland Clinic. He has devoted himself to reducing \nhealth disparities. In Cleveland, he has been instrumental in combating \nsignificant differences in cancer death rates between African Americans \nand Caucasian Americans.\n  Dr. Peter Pronovost from Johns Hopkins has a simple checklist for \npreventing hospital infections, which saved 1,500 lives and $100 \nmillion over an 18-month period in the Detroit area hospitals in \nMichigan.\n  In Mansfield, my hometown, the community health workers--just high \nschool graduates, and some with only GED, high school equivalency \nstudies, young women in their early twenties mostly, making only $11 or \n$12 an hour--working with local health care authorities and doctors and \nnurses, reduced the prevalence of low birth weight babies from 22 \npercent to 8 percent over 3 years. These young women are only 5 or 6 \nyears older than the pages in front of me. They don't have the \nopportunities that most of the pages have. These are young women who \ndon't have parents who went to college, who probably weren't planning \non going to college, and are only making $11 or $12 an hour--young \nwomen who grow up in some of the poorest parts of Mansfield. They have \nalready saved lives because they have made a difference in helping \npregnant women get the nutrition they should have, to learn about \ntaking care of babies, learn about pregnancy, and they can come in to \nsee an OB/GYN doctor. They have already had an impact on many lives. I \nbet that in 5 or 10 years some of these young women who didn't have \nmuch of a future because of their upbringing will become doctors and \nnurses because they have had this experience of making a difference.\n  Those are some of what is going on in this country. If we do it \nright, we can take this program in Mansfield and replicate it and see \nit all over the Nation.\n  This bill will also address serious workforce shortages that exist \nacross the spectrum--from nurses, to pediatric specialists, to dental \ncare providers, to primary care physicians.\n  We have a lot of work to do. I am optimistic that we can pass good \nhealth care reform in this country. We know that the first rule of \nthumb is to make sure that if people are happy with the insurance plan \nthey are in, they can keep it. Second, we have to do a better job of \nreining in the costs to many people in the health care system--\nemployers and individual businesses--the employers, individuals, and \ngovernment. Third, we need to make sure that everybody in this country \nhas access to health care.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, we are, as a nation, facing an incredibly \nsevere fiscal situation, not only in the short term but in the long \nterm. The debt of this country is piling up at astronomical rates. We \nwill, this year, have a deficit that comes close to $2 trillion--$2 \ntrillion--or 28 percent of our gross national product. We are talking \nabout a deficit next year of well over $1 trillion. Under the budget \nsent to us by the President and approved by this Congress--not with my \nsupport or many Republicans--I don't think any Republicans supported \nit--the deficit will run at $1 trillion a year for as far as the eye \ncan see.\n  The debt of this country will double in 5 years. It will triple in 10 \nyears. Deficits are running at 4 to 5 percent of GDP--not only \nimmediately after we get past this recessionary period--for, again, the \nnext 10 years. And the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is a test of how viable \na nation is, will jump to 80 percent.\n  Those are numbers which are not sustainable. Everybody admits they \nare not sustainable. In fact, they are numbers that are so \ndevastatingly large and so unmanageable for our Nation that were we \ntrying to get into the Europe Union, we wouldn't be allowed in. That is \nhow irresponsible our deficit and our debt is. They are numbers which \nwill lead us as a nation to lose the value of our dollar--the value of \nour currency--and our ability to finance our debt. In fact, we are \nalready seeing signs to that effect. The leadership of the Chinese \nfinancial systems have made a number of statements which basically have \nsaid they would not necessarily forever rely on American Treasury notes \nand purchase our notes. And they are financing us right now.\n  The country of Great Britain, which is considered to be the second \nmost stable country in the world, has received a notice from Standard & \nPoor's that its debt will not necessarily be downgraded, but it is \nbeing taken to negative status.\n  A leading economist and reviewer of the bond issues of the United \nStates, as recently as today, has announced that\n\n[[Page S6704]]\n\nour triple A rating--triple-A-plus rating, which is the best in the \nworld--is at risk because of this massive explosion in debt.\n  To quote Senator Conrad, the chairman of the Budget Committee--a \nperson I greatly admire on issues of fiscal policy--the debt is the \nthreat, and it is. It is a threat to our Nation, it is a threat to our \nyoung people because they will inherit this massive obligation to pay \nfor costs which are being expended today.\n  There are a lot of reasons why the debt is going up radically. \nPrimarily, though, it is spending. It is quite simply spending. The \nspending of the Federal Government will jump from the traditional level \nof about 20 percent of GDP, which it has been at now for 40 years, to \n25 to 26 percent of GDP under President Obama's proposal.\n  In the short run, obviously, revenues are a factor because we are in \na recessionary period. But in the long run, what is driving the \ndeficit, what is driving this massive increase of debt, which will be \nunsustainable, is spending.\n  Well, the Congress has a chance, in the next couple days, to do a \nsmall but significant part in the way of a public statement and in the \nway of a statement of policy that we are concerned about the debt. We \nhave a chance to do something. This administration has a chance to do \nsomething. As of today, five banks have repaid large amounts of their \nTARP funds. It is estimated we are going to get about $65 billion of \nTARP payments back.\n  In other words, the way the TARP worked during the crisis, which \nalmost led to a fiscal meltdown--the government stepped forward and \npurchased preferred stock from a variety of major banks in this \ncountry. That preferred stock paid dividends to the taxpayers. It was \nan asset, and it was a good decision. It stabilized the financial \nindustry. The TARP funds kept us from going over the precipice, kept us \nfrom an economic meltdown of catastrophic proportions, and saved Main \nStreet. People on Main Street probably don't appreciate it that much, \nbut essentially that decision saved folks' homes, their ability to \nborrow, to go to school, their ability to borrow to start their \nbusiness, to meet their payroll, and basically operate as a typical \neconomy.\n  The idea always was that the TARP money would come back to the \nFederal Treasury, the $700 billion worth of TARP money that was \nauthorized would come back after the financial situation stabilized. \nWell, now we are starting to see it come back in the first tranche--$65 \nbillion plus about $4.5 billion of interest. That is pretty good. We \nmade $4.5 billion in interest--in less than 4 months, by the way. The \ntaxpayers did pretty well on this.\n  So what are we going to do with that money? Well, I suggest--and the \nlaw actually states--what should be done with that money. We should pay \ndown the debt. That is a good way to use this money. The other option \nis the Treasury can simply hold on to it in anticipation of, \npotentially, another crisis. But that is not necessary. The Treasury \nstill has a line of credit under TARP which reaches $50 billion to $75 \nbillion, depending on how you account for it.\n  We know the risks out in the marketplace right now are nowhere near \nthat number, and they are certainly not systemic. Therefore, these TARP \ndollars are not needed. They are not needed right now or in the \nforeseeable future for the purposes of maintaining financial stability \nand avoiding a systemic meltdown. So it is totally appropriate that all \nthat money be used to pay down the debt, or at least a significant \nportion.\n  It would be an extraordinarily positive statement by this \nadministration if they said to the markets and to the American people: \nThe responsible thing to do is to take this money and pay down the \ndebt. I think the market would react positively immediately. They would \nsay we are serious. I think the American people would react positively \nimmediately too. It would be a huge win for this President--the policy \nworked. This President and the prior President, President Bush and \nPresident Obama, had the courage to step up in the face of fairly \nsignificant headwinds and make the decision to use the TARP money in \nthis way. Now it has worked, they should use it to pay down the debt \nand get the double win of having been able to say what we did was good \npolicy, it was not popular policy but it was good policy, it worked to \nstabilize the financial institutions, and what we are doing now to pay \ndown the debt is also good policy and it is what the law calls for in \nthe end.\n\n  That is the first thing that could happen right now, and it should \nhappen. This money that was paid in today to the Treasury should be \nused immediately to pay down the debt, and that should be announced by \nthe Treasury--or if I were President, I would announce it myself; it is \npretty good news. So that is a step in the right direction. Granted, on \na $2 trillion deficit, it is not massive, but it is a statement, and a \nstatement is important at this time. And you know, $68 billion is a lot \nof money anyway, so it would be a good decision.\n  The second thing we should do, and we can do, is not allow the war \nsupplemental--which is an important piece of legislation needed to fund \nour troops--to be used as a passenger train for unfunded baggage which \nwill pass debt on to our children on extraneous issues. That is what it \nis being used for.\n  Last week, the President held a press conference at the White House \nsurrounded by the Democratic leadership of the Congress, and he said we \nare going to return to pay-go, we are going to require that new \nprograms be paid for. I applaud that as an attitude and approach. It \nhas not been followed around here, but I applaud the fact that he \nstated that and he had standing behind him the Democratic leadership of \nthis Congress when he said that.\n  Ironically, on the same day, I believe, the House of Representatives \npassed a bill which increased spending by $1 billion which had nothing \nto do with the war, which was not paid for. Therefore, it did not meet \npay-go but instead created a debt our children will have to pay. They \nstuck that legislation in the war fighting bill so it could not be \namended and paid for or amended and improved. It is called the Cash for \nClunkers, and it is a clunker of a bill because it passes on to our \nchildren a $1 billion price. It is $1 billion of new debt.\n  Why would we do that? Cash for Clunkers may be a program that is \ngood. Maybe it is a reasonable idea to pay for old cars to get them off \nthe road, to put new cars on the road, hopefully to increase mileage of \nthe auto fleet and also to stimulate the economy. That may be a good \nidea, but it is not a good idea to not pay for that. We have already \nspent $740 billion on the stimulus package, unpaid for. We have spent \n$83 billion on the automobile buyouts, on the automobile bailout--\nunpaid for. Now to put this extra $1 billion on top of all that just \nadds insult to injury to the next generation and our children's \nchildren who will have to pay the price for this. Why should our \nchildren and our grandchildren have to pay the bill for us paying \n$3,500 to somebody to buy their car today? How fiscally irresponsible \nis that? It is especially fiscally irresponsible when you realize it is \ndone in the context and on the same day, I believe, as the President \nannouncing that we are going to go back to pay-go principles around \nhere where we actually pay for new programs we put on the books. But in \norder to avoid that, in order to avoid what they had just signed onto, \nthe congressional Democratic leadership down at the White House, \nstanding behind the President and cheering when he said we are going \nback to pay-go, stuck this language in the war supplemental.\n  That is an insult to our troops. In order to fund our troops, they \nhave to take along with them $1 billion of new debt, passed on to their \nchildren. Many of these extraordinary people who are fighting for us \nhave children. Is it right that in order to get them the adequate \nresources they need to fight this war, we should send their children a \nbill for $1 billion so we get a public policy that we can go back to \nour automobile dealers with and say: Hurray, we got you this $1 billion \nof spending. Of course not. That is not right, it is not fair, it is \nnot appropriate.\n  Okay, Cash for Clunkers may make sense if it is paid for. The way it \nwas structured, it cannot be paid for. You cannot amend this bill in \nits present form, and therefore, if it passes with the Cash for \nClunkers in it, a $1 billion price tag in it, we basically pass that \ndebt on to our children.\n\n[[Page S6705]]\n\n  I will at the appropriate time offer an amendment which will \nessentially be a pay-go amendment. It will be a point of order that \nsays essentially--it will not be under pay-go because if I did that it \nmight bring the whole bill down and I have no interest in bringing the \nwhole bill down--it will be a targeted point of order which will \nessentially be a pay-go point of order. Anybody voting against this \npoint of order will be voting against pay-go, which will say this \nlanguage, which is unpaid for, this $1 billion, should not stay in this \nbill in this form. Does that mean this bill goes down? No. You will \nhear a lot of moaning going around saying this will destroy the bill. \nNo, it will not. This bill can be sent back to the House and passed \nwithout the Cash for Clunkers language in it, unpaid for, or it could \nbe sent back to the House and they can put back in the Cash for \nClunkers language, paid for. It can all happen within about a 6-hour \nday, 6-hour legislative day, maybe even less. Maybe even a half hour, \nknowing the rapidity of the Rules Committee in the House.\n  It seems this will be one of the first tests of whether we as a \nCongress mean what we say. Do we mean that when we say we are not going \nto create a new program that we are not going to pay for, we actually \nwill stand behind those words? This should be an easy one for us \nbecause this plan can be paid for rather easily by moving money around \nin the original stimulus package. It is fairly obvious this plan should \nnot be in the war supplemental to begin with, but if it is going to be \nin the war supplemental, it should not be in the form that passes \nmassive debt on to our children. It is a chance to make a $1 billion \nstatement that we are going to start getting serious about the debt \naround here.\n  I hope I will be joined in this point of order by my colleagues who \nare interested in the integrity of the pay-go process and in not \npassing on to our kids a $1 billion bill they do not deserve.\n  I make a point of order that a quorum is not present and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Cash For Clunkers\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I come to the floor to respond to my \nfriend, the distinguished ranking member on the Budget Committee, who \njust spoke a moment ago about the supplemental and one provision, a \nvery small provision, in this very large bill. I hope that when there \nis an effort to waive all the budget points of order, colleagues will \nsupport doing that while remembering thousands of small businesspeople \nacross this country who are asking that we support them at this time of \nreal crisis as it relates to automobile sales, not just in the United \nStates but all across the world.\n  We have a global crisis right now. We know in our credit markets it \nhas resulted in people not being able to come in and buy an automobile. \nIt is compounded by the huge losses in jobs that we have seen where \npeople cannot afford to come in and buy a new automobile.\n  My colleague spoke about small but symbolic measures. I would hope \nthat our colleagues, who I know care deeply about dealers--we have \nheard this from Republican and Democratic colleagues; we have had bills \nheld up on the floor to work on efforts that I was proud to join in \nhelping our auto dealers.\n  I would certainly hope that colleagues would not decide for symbolism \nto focus on what is less than 1 percent of this supplemental--less than \n1 percent of the supplemental--focused on helping America's auto \ndealers at this critical time. In terms of this supplemental, it is a \nvery small amount of money. It has received a lot of focus from a lot \nof concerns, which I appreciate, on how things are written or how \ncolleagues would do things differently. I appreciate that.\n  But the reality is we are in a crisis, not just in my State but all \nacross the country and, frankly, around the world when we look at what \nhas been happening to small businesses and communities across America. \nI know what this feels like. My father and grandfather had the \nOldsmobile dealership in the small town where I grew up in northern \nMichigan. When I grew up, the first job I had was washing cars on the \ncar lot. I know what has happened to small businesses across America \nright now that have played by the rules and, through no fault of their \nown, find themselves in a very difficult circumstance.\n  We have a small provision that has been given a lot of different \nnames. One version of it has been called cash for clunkers. It is based \non a bill on which I was proud to join with House Members that is \ncalled Drive America Forward. But it would incentivize people to go \ninto these small dealerships across America and give them an \nopportunity, an incentive, or support to be able to buy a new car.\n  Why is this important? Well, we have seen from January to May of this \nyear, compared to January to May of last year, across-the-board \nreductions in auto sales: 41.8 percent for GM; 39 percent for Toyota; \n36.8 for Ford; Chrysler, 46.3 percent; Honda, 34.4 percent. It is \npretty rough if you are an auto dealer and you see your sales going \ndown month after month--30 percent, 40 percent--to be able to make the \npayroll every week for your employees. It is pretty tough to do that.\n  Around the world, we have seen efforts to help automakers, to help \nauto dealers, to help communities, to help middle-class consumers and \nthose who want to be able to purchase a vehicle to be able to do that.\n  Our dealers, on average, employ 53 people each, over 116,000 people \ndirectly. That is the entire combined workforce of GM and Chrysler \ntogether. We are talking about a large number of people who have come \nin a number of ways to ask us to help them. This is one opportunity. \nThis is it. This is what is in front of us.\n  We know how hard it is to move legislation through the House and the \nSenate. We are the last place, the last vote standing between helping \nthe dealers of America and turning our backs on them. This is the last \nvote. This is the one vote as to whether we are going to be able to \nstep forward and be able to help them.\n  Every other industrialized country, small and large, understands what \nhas been happening, and they are fighting for their middle class. They \nare fighting for their jobs. They are looking for every class they can \nto help.\n  The question is, Will we? Germany began a program similar to the one \nthat we are talking about that is funded through this bill in January. \nBy the end of the first month, sales were up 21 percent, 21 percent. \nThat is money in the pockets of small businesses and large dealerships. \nAcross Germany it was so successful they extended it and had sales \ncontinue to go up as a result. When our auto sales were going down 41 \npercent, Germany's--during the same period--went up 21 percent because \nthey said: You know what. We have to stop the bottom from falling out \nof this. It is too important for our economy. We want to do something \nabout it. And they did. Now similar programs exist in a number of \ncountries: China, Japan, Korea, Brazil, Great Britain, Spain, France, \nItaly, Australia, Portugal, Romania, and Slovakia--Slovakia. If \nSlovakia can help their auto industry and their car dealers, I think \nthe United States of America ought to be able to step up and help.\n  This is a small effort, a few months, to give a boost, a stimulus, to \na group of small businesses, an industry that has been talked about on \nthe floor many times and that we need to care about. This particular \nprogram is not only supported by Ford and domestic auto companies, but \nit is also, of course, supported by the National Auto Dealers very \nstrongly, the United Auto Workers, the National Association of \nManufacturers, the Steel Workers, the Automotive Recyclers Association, \nthe Specialty Equipment Market Association, the Motor and Equipment \nManufacturers Association, the AFL-CIO, the Business Roundtable, and \nthe U.S. Chamber of Commerce.\n\n[[Page S6706]]\n\n  All have come together to ask us to do something and to support this \neffort. We are now at a point where we have to decide if we want to \nhelp. It is not just about the automakers. You know, we know that \nhelp--and a lot of it--is going to GM and Chrysler, and those of us who \nrepresent them appreciate that very much. But this is much broader than \nthat. This is all kinds of dealers, all kinds of automakers. Not only \nthose who work in the plants, whom I care about deeply, but it is \npeople who work in offices, the engineers, the designers. This is an \neconomic tsunami that has hit every part of the economy when we look at \nthis entire industry: the clerks, the office managers, the sales \npeople, the mechanics, the car washers, up and down.\n  The global credit crunch has had a devastating effect on everyone in \nour economy who relies on the sale of automobiles: Printers, \nadvertisers, local newspapers, television stations, radio stations. \nThey are all asking us to act.\n  This is a reasonable, focused, short-term effort to help those who \nhave been having an extremely difficult time just holding their heads \nabove water. We know this effort can make a difference.\n  I thank our House colleagues who have done a tremendous amount of \nwork on this matter. I want to thank Congressmen Markey and Waxman and \nStupak and Dingell and Boucher and others who were involved in putting \nthis together and putting it into the energy and climate change \nlegislation reported out of the Energy Committee in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I thank every one of the 298 Members of the House on a bipartisan \nbasis. Over two-thirds of the House of Representatives voted for this \nlegislation, and it was put into the supplemental in an emergency \ndocument, an emergency piece of legislation. It was put in there \nbecause of what has happened with the bottom falling out of the economy \nfor dealers, dealers that have found themselves in very difficult \ncircumstances because of bankruptcies, and dealers that are trying to \nmove forward and trying to be able to survive during this economy.\n  I know there are colleagues who would like to see this have more \nenergy efficiency provisions. I believe in the context of what we do \ngoing forward in the energy bill and climate change we can work \ntogether to fashion something that has a focus, an input, from everyone \nwho cares deeply about these issues.\n  At this time and place, this legislation is a balance between those \nof us who are concerned about an immediate stimulus while meeting the \nneeds and concerns about increased fuel efficiency. We are making \namazing strides on fuel efficiency. The President of the United States, \nnot long ago, announced increased fuel efficiency standards. No one in \nthe industry objected. I did not hear objections. I certainly did not \nobject. This is not about whether we need to increase fuel efficiency. \nWe do and we are. We will continue to do that.\n  This bill, while being a short-term stimulus, also helps in that \nregard because it will give a voucher of either $3,500 or $4,500 toward \nthe purchase of a new, more fuel-efficient vehicle.\n\n  When you look at your own home situation, anyone who is going to want \nto be a part of this is going to make sure their car, that automobile, \nis worth $3,500 or less or $4,500 or less. Someone is not going to turn \nin a $15,000 used vehicle to get a $4,500 voucher.\n  So, by definition, we are talking about older cars. Some people have \nsaid ``clunkers,'' and people have kind of thrown that around, and \n``what does all of this mean''?\n  But we are not talking about a $50,000 vehicle with a resale value of \n$20,000 or $15,000. We are talking about older vehicles that are worth \n$4,500 or less.\n  The legislation requires, as has been done in other countries, when \nyou turn it in, that the engine is scrapped, the parts of it that we do \nnot want to continue to use--because of the lack of fuel efficiency--\nare scrapped. We can recycle some of the other parts, but the basic \ntransmission system is scrapped.\n  So we are talking about older vehicles worth $4,500 or less, the \npolluting pieces of the automobile are scrapped, and then we are \ntalking about the ability to purchase a vehicle that is more fuel \nefficient. In the case of automobiles, you need a minimum fuel economy \nof 22 miles per gallon or more, you get a $3,500 voucher for a 4-mile-\nper-gallon improvement, and a $4,500 voucher if the new vehicle you \npurchase is 10 miles per gallon or more fuel efficient.\n  So there is a benefit from a fuel efficiency standpoint. There is \nbenefit. I appreciate that for some it is not enough. I do appreciate \nthat. There are those who would like to see something different, and \ncertainly we will have opportunities to continue to work together in \nthat regard.\n  But I go back to my original premise. At this time, in our economy, \nat this time with what has been happening on unemployment, what has \nbeen happening to businesses, large and small, because they cannot get \ncapital, because of the ripple effect in the auto industry, of what is \nhappening to suppliers, to dealers, to anyone involved in this \nindustry--and 1 out of every 10 persons in America is in some way \nrelated to the auto industry--at this time we need to be prudent and \nbalance what we are doing in a way that makes sure that all parts of \nthe auto industry, domestic and foreign, can participate and that we \nare doing this as quickly as possible. It will not help as a stimulus \nif this is done 6 months or a year from now.\n\n  I don't know how much longer the car dealers in Clare, MI, where I \ngrew up, can hold on, if they are losing 40 percent a month in sales. I \ndon't know how much longer they can hold on. I don't know what happens \nto the Chrysler dealer and the GM dealer trying to turn over inventory \nnow as they wind down. I don't know what happens. But I do know we will \nsee more dealerships close. We will see more people lose their jobs. We \nare going to see more mainstays of local communities finding they \ncannot make it.\n  This is the moment. We won't get another chance. We will not get \nanother chance. This is the moment to help. We have other opportunities \nto work together on other policies. I say to my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, for all of the dealers who have been calling and \nasking for help, this is the moment. This is the vote. There won't be a \nsecond vote. So when you go home, think about what you want to say to \nthe small business people, the auto dealers, office managers, \nmechanics, people who are involved in that business in your community, \nwhen you had a chance to help. I hope we will take it. I hope we will \ntake it as the House did. I hope we will see overwhelming bipartisan \nsupport, as we saw in the House of Representatives for this particular \npolicy.\n  I strongly urge colleagues to vote to override the budget points of \norder. All of them will be asked to be overridden. I encourage \ncolleagues to do that. I hope we will show that we get it. Do we get \nwhat is going on in communities across America? This vote will say \nwhether we get what is happening and have a sense of urgency about \nstepping up to help.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6706-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6706-S6710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRAVEL PROMOTION ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, my amendment, No. 1336, would provide \nimproved and expanded opportunities for small businesses and attract \nforeign tourists. Tourism is a vital service export, generating $142 \nbillion in international receipts last year, which accounts for 27 \npercent of all services exports and 8 percent of exports overall.\n  As ranking member of the Senate Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, and as a senior member of both the Senate Finance and \nCommerce Committees, one of my top priorities is to ensure that small \nbusinesses get the promised benefits of our international trade \nrelationships, including the benefits of increased business from \ntourists that visit the United States. Tourism is particularly \nessential for small businesses, which comprise more than 90 percent of \nemployers in the tourism industry. In fact, 95 percent of travel \nagencies, 84 percent of tour operating companies, 93 percent of \nsightseeing bus companies, and 99 percent of souvenir shops are small \nbusinesses.\n  Small businesses are a vital source of economic growth and job \ncreation, generating approximately 75 percent of net new jobs each \nyear. Small firms are essential to our economic recovery, and we must \nhelp them take advantage of all potential opportunities, including \nthose created by international travel and tourism.\n  My amendment will increase support for small businesses seeking to \nattract more foreign tourists. First, the amendment creates an \ninnovative new export development grant program that provides small \nbusinesses with matching grants, of up to $5,000, for expenses relating \nto activities that help them start or expand export activity. These \ngrants can be used to create foreign-language marketing material, \ntranslate websites in order to reach foreign tourists, and develop \nother marketing materials in order to attract more international \nvisitors.\n  In addition to enabling small businesses to attract international \ntourists, my amendment also benefits small businesses who seek to sell \ntheir products and services in international markets. Although \nglobalization has created new opportunities, less than 1 percent of \nU.S. small businesses currently sell to international buyers.\n  Small businesses face particular challenges in exporting. It can be \ndifficult for small exporting firms to secure the working capital \nneeded to fulfill foreign purchase orders, for instance, because many \nlenders won't lend against export orders or export receivables. \nAdditionally, small business owners may not have the time or resources \nnecessary to understand other countries' rules and regulations.\n  Currently, Federal programs are grossly inadequate at helping small \nbusinesses overcome these challenges of exporting. This amendment gives \nsmall businesses the resources and assistance they require to explore \npotential export opportunities and to expand their current export \nbusiness.\n\n[[Page S6710]]\n\n  The amendment would also bolster the SBA's technical assistance \nprograms, and will improve export financing programs so that small \nbusinesses have access to capital needed to support export sales.\n  Small businesses can survive, diversify, and compete effectively in \nthe international marketplace by developing an export business. But, as \nI mentioned, too few small businesses are expanding into international \nmarkets. This amendment will help small business owners take the \ncrucial steps of attracting foreign tourists and finding international \nbuyers for their goods and services.\n  This investment could yield tremendous returns for our economy. The \nUnited States spends just one-sixth of the international average among \ndeveloped countries in promoting small businesses exports. Every \nadditional dollar spent on export promotion results in a fortyfold \nincrease in exports, according to a World Bank study.\n  As we work to promote tourism in the United States, we cannot \noverlook small businesses. An investment in small business exporting \nassistance is an investment in our economy. This amendment will ensure \nthat this legislation helps small businesses stay competitive, helps \nthem grow, and speeds the recovery of our economy as a whole. I \nrespectfully ask all of my Senate colleagues to support this vital \namendment.\n  Mr. President, my amendment No. 1337 to the ``Tourism Promotion Act \nof 2009 is a commonsense amendment that would ensure that small \nbusinesses are properly represented on the new ``Corporation for Travel \nPromotion Board'' and would clarify that small businesses, as defined \nby the Small Business Administration, are exempt from the annual \nassessment created by this act.\n  As ranking member of the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship, I am keenly aware of the critical role that small \nbusinesses play as our Nation's primary job creators. Robust tourism is \nvital to the success of countless small businesses, and I see no better \nway to improve this bill than by ensuring that our Nation's small \nbusinesses have a seat at the table as our tourism policy is revamped. \nOne of the more vital components of this act is the creation of the \ntravel promotion board, which includes 11 key representatives from \ndifferent industries involved in tourism, and will be tasked with \npromoting travel to America. Unfortunately, the underlying bill does \nnot require a member of that board specifically represent small \nbusinesses. My amendment will correct this oversight.\n  Travel and tourism generates approximately $1.3 trillion in economic \nactivity each year in the United States and it also supports 8.3 \nmillion travel-related jobs. According to the Department of Commerce, \nreceipts from international trade and tourism were more than $142 \nbillion last year, and there is no doubt that small businesses were a \nvital part of this statistic. In fact, they represent nearly the entire \ntourism industry. More than 90 percent of employers in the tourism \nindustry are small businesses; and more specifically, 95 percent of \ntravel agencies, 84 percent of tour operating companies, 93 percent of \nsightseeing bus companies, and 99 percent of souvenir shops are owned \nby small entrepreneurs. It is therefore imperative that this act \nguarantee that small businesses are provided with a representative on \nthe Corporation for Travel Promotion Board.\n  Tourism is a vital source of growth for these small businesses and \nthis act will provide critical assistance to entrepreneurs struggling \nduring these difficult economic times. This amendment will improve the \nunderlying bill by ensuring that small businesses continue to play a \nkey role in bolstering and strengthening our nation's essential tourism \nindustry. For this reason I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6710-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nMAKING SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING SEPTEMBER \n                      30, 2009--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise to call the attention of the Senate \nto the 40th anniversary of the National Association of Minority \nContractors, NAMC. NAMC is a national organization that has gone to \ngreat lengths over the last 40 years in helping minority contractors \nrealize the American dream. Additionally, NAMC has aided contractors \nacross the United States by fostering relationships and building \nbridges in the construction industry that have helped minorities to \nremain competitive. Currently, NAMC has over 5,000 memberships in all \n50 States and the District of Columbia.\n  NAMC was established as a nonprofit organization in 1969, in order to \nprovide education to African Americans, Asian Americans, Hispanic \nAmericans, and Native Americans employed as construction contractors. \nThis magnificent organization has helped to ensure equal opportunity \nemployment and procurement opportunities in all areas of this industry. \nNAMC has led the way in the integration of various ethnic groups, \ncreeds, and colors in the construction industry. We recognize this \norganization's hard work to initiate and operate training programs for \npeople desiring employment and procurement in the building trades.\n  Thanks to the fine leadership of the local board of the Silver \nState's NAMC's Chapter, NAMC is making a successful transition to green \nbuilding. NAMC has been ensuring that its members certify in green \nbuilding by involving them with Green Advantage and the U.S. Green \nBuilding Council. It is specifically this type of program that will \nhelp America become more environmentally friendly and responsible and \nlead us to an improved quality of life.\n  The Nevada Chapter is one of 22 chapters across the United States. I \ncommend the National Association of Minority Contractors for their 40 \nyears of support to the minority community and to the affiliates in \nNevada and around the United States. It is through\n\n[[Page S6711]]\n\nthe relentless work of this organization that minority construction \ncontractors have been able to achieve equality, opportunity, and \nprosperity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6711-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statements were ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          IN PRAISE OF FATHERS\n\n Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, Sunday is Father's Day. The third \nSunday in June is a lovely time of year, and a perfect time for any \ncelebration. This year, it is also the first day of summer--the best \nday of summer, before the weather is too hot, before bugs mar the \nbeauty of fresh green leaves and weeds threaten to smother the garden, \nbefore we are tired of marveling at the smooth green of a freshly mown \nlawn. On this Sunday, we thank both our heavenly Father and our earthly \nfather for all that is good and strong and vibrantly beautiful in our \nlives.\n  Although scientists say that some smells can trigger strong memories, \nI think that there are certain sounds that many people instantly \nassociate with fathers. The keening whine of a power tool, the droning \nbuzz of a lawn mower on a Saturday morning, the grunt and clank of \ntools in tight places, the quiet scrape of a razor over a stubbled \nchin, the slow tread of a tired man coming home in the evening, or even \nthe nighttime chorus of snores--these are the everyday sounds of \nfathers that provide the quiet sounds during a peaceful childhood. \nOther father sounds may have occurred less frequently, but still \ntrigger their own quick smiles of recall--the slap of a baseball into a \nworn glove, perhaps, or the gentle splash of a fishing lure hitting the \nwater, that remind us of pastimes enjoyed together.\n  On Sunday, fathers will be feted with brunches or barbeques. They may \nopen a few gifts and some funny cards. Mother's Day might warrant more \nsentimentality, but Father's Day seems to call for a more humorous \napproach--perhaps so that fathers will not be embarrassed by any teary-\neyed show of emotion. It is enough, for many fathers, to get a card at \nall, and to have all the attention focused on him. Most fathers are not \nmuch given to displays of emotion or sentimental speeches.\n  A father's love is expressed through his presence and the endless \nlabor that he expends to care for his family. His love is expressed \nthrough his actions, and all the sounds that accompany them. My own Dad \nwas a quiet man, but he saved his cake from lunch to give to me. He \nlistened attentively to my recitations and my fiddle playing, and he \nmade sure that I had paper and pencils to draw with as a child. Without \nwords, he showed me how much he cared.\n  An untitled poem by an unknown poet captures the unspoken love that \nfathers find easier to express:\n\n     Fathers seldom say, ``I love you''\n     Though the feeling's always there,\n     But somehow those three little words\n     Are the hardest ones to share.\n     And fathers say, ``I love you''\n     In ways that words can't match--\n     With tender bedtime stories--\n     Or a friendly game of catch!\n     You can see the words ``I love you''\n     In a father's boyish eyes\n     When he runs home, all excited,\n     With a poorly wrapped surprise.\n     A father says, ``I love you''\n     With his strong helping hands--\n     With a smile when you're in trouble\n     With the way he understands.\n     He says, ``I love you'' haltingly,\n     With awkward tenderness--\n     (It's hard to help a four-year-old into a party dress!)\n     He speaks his love unselfishly\n     By giving all he can\n     To make some secret dream come true,\n     Or follow through a plan.\n     A father's seldom-spoken love\n     Sounds clearly through the years--\n     Sometimes in peals of laughter,\n     Sometimes through happy tears.\n     Perhaps they have to speak their love\n     In a fashion all their own.\n     Because the love that fathers feel\n     Is too big for words alone!\n\n  Mr. President, we can all remember times in our own lives when our \nfathers let us know that they were proud of us. We remember the words \nof praise, the thumbs up, the smile or simply his quiet presence at \nsome long ago event. An occasion was important, if our father made the \ntime to be there. This Sunday is our chance to return the favor and \nmake the occasion important for him, by our presence at brunch, or by \nthe grill, or on the phone. He will appreciate the effort, even if he \nmay find it difficult to show just how much it means to him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6711-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6711-S6712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           WEST VIRGINIA DAY\n\n Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on June 20, 1863, West Virginia \nbecame the 35th State in our great Union. This coming Saturday, West \nVirginia will celebrate those 146 years of statehood, so I say, ``Happy \nBirthday, West Virginia!'' I might also add, `` and many more!'' It is \na happy day.\n  West Virginians will celebrate the State's birthday in many different \nways. In the myriad State parks and forests, special programs may be \nenjoyed amid the majestic scenery, views of endless, rolling hills, and \nrushing, tumbling white water with which the Creator has blessed us. At \nthe Haddad Riverfront Park in Charleston, an outdoor concert will \nentertain the crowds with music and fun. Blenko Glass, in Milton, has \nproduced another stunning artwork in molten, hand blown glass in honor \nof West Virginia Day. Across the State, local arts festivals and \nhistoric reenactments will celebrate the history and talents of West \nVirginia.\n  West Virginia Day is a wonderful day to celebrate all that is unique \nabout our great State. Of her 55 counties, 47 were named after notable \nindividuals. Some counties derive their names from Revolutionary War \nheroes like Francis Marion and the Marquis de Lafayette. Others are \nnamed after U.S. Presidents and Vice Presidents, including Jefferson, \nJackson, Lincoln, and Grant; or notable politicians such as Senator \nHenry Clay of Kentucky. Just three county names reference the State's \nEnglish heritage--Hampshire County, named after the county in England; \nBerkeley County, named after the Royal Governor of Virginia, Norborne \nBerkeley; and Raleigh County, named after the English explorer Sir \nWalter Raleigh.\n  Several counties are named after prominent Virginians, reflective of \nWest Virginia's origins as a part of the Commonwealth of Virginia. \nStill other county names commemorating frontiersmen like Daniel Boone \nand Lewis Wetzel remind us of West Virginia's time at the fringes of \nthe American union, when the Nation was still young and growing. \nCounties named after Native Americans like the Mingo Chief Logan, \nPowhatan princess Pocahontas, and the Mingo tribe, however, speak to \nWest Virginia's even earlier history. Five county names celebrate \nnatural features like rivers or the minerals that are West Virginia's \ngreat natural treasure.\n  The stories of all these people, places, and things help to tell the \nhistory of West Virginia. It is a rich, complex and fascinating tale \nfull of hope and hardship, triumph and tragedy. From the Native \nAmericans who lived and hunted these rich woodlands, to the hearty \nsettlers who built new lives in the hollows and along the rivers, West \nVirginia is full of unwritten history marked only by trails, mounds, \ncampsites, and old homesteads. Modern history is built of soft red \nbrick and bright limestone, iron rail lines and asphalt highways \npainstakingly carved through the hills. Every county is full of scenic \ndrives, history, natural wonders, beautiful handcrafted goods and \nfoods, and--most of all--welcoming people.\n  Throughout her history, the State's motto has shone through: \n``Mountaineers are always free.'' West Virginians value grit and hard \nwork put forth by individuals. Populated by hardworking families and \nindividuals, West Virginians also value their close-knit communities. \nYou can see that spirit whenever natural disasters bring neighbors \ntogether to work together in the aftermath of storm or flood. The same \nfriendly atmosphere fills the many festivals and celebrations held \nthroughout the State virtually every weekend.\n  I urge those listening to come and explore West Virginia. We are \ncloser than you think, but thanks to the mountains that have shaped our \nhistory, still quiet and unspoiled. I know that I may be a little bit \nbiased, but West Virginia is my favorite State, full of never ending \nvariety and great beauty in every season. From the colonial and Civil \nWar history in the eastern panhandle's Harper's Ferry and Berkeley \nSprings, to the whitewater adventures offered on the Gauley and other \nrivers,\n\n[[Page S6712]]\n\nWest Virginia offers something for every taste. You can sample true \nluxury at the Greenbrier resort or ski and snowboard in the Canaan \nValley. You can hunt game or the works of great artisans; listen to \nbluegrass music or to the wind blowing through the trees. West Virginia \nhas been waiting for you for 146 years--come and celebrate with \nher.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6712-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6712]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CHANGES TO S. CON. RES. 13\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 311(a) of S. Con. Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the allocations of a committee or committees, the \naggregates, and other appropriate levels in the resolution for \nlegislation that authorizes the Food and Drug Administration to \nregulate products and assess user fees on manufacturers and importers \nof those products to cover the cost of the regulatory activities. \nAdditionally, section 307 of S. Con. Res. 13 permits the chairman to \nadjust the allocations of a committee or committees, aggregates, and \nother appropriate levels in the resolution for legislation that, among \nother things, reduces or eliminates the offset between the Survivor \nBenefit Plan annuities and veterans' dependency and indemnity \ncompensation. The adjustments under both reserve funds are contingent \non the legislation not increasing the deficit over either the period of \nthe total of fiscal years 2009 through 2014 or the period of the total \nof fiscal years 2009 through 2019.\n  On June 3, I made revisions to S. Con. Res. 13 pursuant to sections \n311(a) and 307 for an amendment in the nature of a complete substitute \nto H.R. 1256, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. \nThe complete substitute to the House-passed bill was passed by the \nSenate on June 11 and by the House on June 12, clearing it for the \nsignature of the President.\n  The adjustment on June 3 was based on information provided by the \nCongressional Budget Office. Since that time, CBO has revised its \nestimate of the cost of H.R. 1256 to reflect an earlier date of \nenactment. Even with the changed date of enactment and revised \nestimate, H.R. 1256 still qualifies for reserve fund adjustments \npursuant to sections 311(a) and 307. As a consequence, I am revising \nthe adjustments I made on June 3 to reflect CBO's updated estimate. \nThese revisions affect the aggregates in the 2010 budget resolution, as \nwell as the allocation to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to S.

CON. RES. 13\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 401(c)(4) of S. Con. Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the section 401(b) discretionary spending limits, \nallocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, and aggregates for legislation making appropriations for \nfiscal years 2009 and 2010 for overseas deployments and other \nactivities by the amounts provided in such legislation for those \npurposes and so designated pursuant to section 401(c)(4). The \nadjustment is limited to the total amount of budget authority specified \nin section 104(21) of S. Con. Res. 13. For 2009, that limitation is \n$90.745 billion, and for 2010, it is $130 billion.\n  On May 19, I made two adjustments pursuant to section 401(c)(4) for \nH.R. 2346, a bill making supplemental appropriations for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 2009, and for other purposes. H.R. 2346 \npassed the Senate on May 21.\n  I find that the conference report for H.R. 2346, which was filed on \nJune 12, 2009, also fulfills the conditions of section 401(c)(4). As a \nresult, for fiscal years 2009 and 2010, I am further revising the \nadjustments made on May 19 to the discretionary spending limits and the \nallocation to the Senate Committee on Appropriations for discretionary \nbudget authority and outlays. When combined with those previous \nrevisions, the total amount of the adjustment pursuant to section \n401(c)(4) for 2009 is $90.73 billion in discretionary budget authority \nand $27.029 billion in outlays, and the total amount of the adjustment \nfor 2010 is $11 million in discretionary budget authority and $34.239 \nbillion in outlays. In addition, I am also further revising the \naggregates consistent with section 401(c)(4).\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following revisions to S.

Mr. President, I am pleased that today President Obama \nissued a Presidential Memorandum on Federal Benefits and Non-\nDiscrimination that will extend a number of benefits to same-sex \npartners that are afforded to spouses of Federal employees. I applaud \nthe President for this effort to promote fairness in the workplace. It \nis a step in the right direction towards equalizing benefit coverage \nfor all Federal employees.\n  The memorandum will enable domestic partners of civil service Federal \nemployees to be added to their long-term care insurance program, and \nenable employees to use their sick leave to take care of domestic \npartners and nonbiological, nonadopted children. The memorandum also \nextends a number of benefits to same-sex partners of Foreign Service \nemployees, including the use of medical facilities at posts abroad, \nmedical evacuation from posts abroad, and inclusion in family size for \nhousing allocations.\n  Equal pay for equal work is a cornerstone of our country's bedrock \nprinciples, and equal access to important benefits should share that \nimportance. Insurance benefits, work incentives, and retirement options \ncomprise a significant portion of all employee compensation. By not \noffering domestic partnership benefits to its employees, the Federal \nGovernment is unfairly withholding these valuable options from \ndedicated employees across the country. President Obama's Memorandum is \na step forward towards having a fair and consistent policy.\n  This step by the President brings the Federal Government in line with \nmany of America's largest and most successful companies, as well as \nState and local governments and educational institutions, which already \nextend benefits to same-sex couples. Over half of all Fortune 500 \ncompanies provide domestic partner benefits to their employees, up from \njust 25 percent in 2000. Offering domestic partnership benefits to \nFederal employees improves the quality of its workforce and \ndemonstrates the Federal Government's commitment to fairness and \nequality for all Americans.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of the Domestic Partnership Benefits and \nObligations Act of 2009, introduced by Senators Lieberman and Collins, \nwhich would provide domestic partners of Federal employees all of the \nsame protections and benefits afforded to spouses of Federal employees, \nincluding participation in applicable retirement programs, compensation \nfor work injuries, and health insurance benefits. I am also a cosponsor \nof the Tax Equity for Health Plan Beneficiaries Act of 2009, which \nwould end the taxation of health benefits provided to domestic partners \nin workplaces that provide domestic partner health benefits to their \nemployees.\n  Providing benefits to domestic partners of Federal employees is long \noverdue. I look forward to working with the Obama administration and \nMembers on both sides of the aisle to continue to make progress towards \nequality in the workplace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6713-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6713-S6714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           175TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF FORT LARAMIE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 175th \nanniversary of the founding of Fort Laramie, the first permanent \nsettlement in what would become the State of Wyoming.\n  In the spring of 1834, William Sublette led a supply caravan to the \nannual fur trappers' rendezvous held on the Ham's Fork of the Green \nRiver. On May 30, 1834, Sublette and his men paused to camp at the \nconfluence of the Laramie and North Platte Rivers. It was here that \nSublette and his partner, Robert Campbell, agreed to build a new \ntrading post. Their intent was to dominate the central Rocky Mountain \nfur trade. William Marshall Anderson wrote in his diary, ``This day we \nlaid the foundation log of a fort.'' That log would be the cornerstone \nof the first permanent settlement in the future State of Wyoming. \nSublette's trading post was officially named Fort William, although it \nwas commonly referred to as the fort on Laramie's Fork or Fort Laramie.\n  Fort William was humble in size, measuring only 100 feet by 80 feet. \nThe palisade was formed by 15-foot hewn cottonwood logs. There were log \nblockhouses located at diagonal corners. A third blockhouse, with \nmounted cannon, was over the main gate. Inside the fort was a series of \ncabins and storehouses with flat tops that nearly reached the top of \nthe fort's walls. The fort's small size was in contrast to the large \nrole it would play in American history.\n  The fort eventually became one of the principal trading centers with \nthe Indian tribes of the Northern Plains, especially the Oglala and \nSicangu Lakota. The beaver trade was already in decline at the time of \nFort William's construction. Campbell and Sublette recognized that the \nfuture of the fur trade lay not in trapping, but in trading with the \nnative peoples of the plains for buffalo robes. Each spring, caravans \narrived at the fort with trade goods. In the fall, tons of buffalo \nhides and other furs were shipped east.\n  By 1841, the cottonwood log walls of Fort William had already begun \nto deteriorate and were in need of replacement. The owners of the fort \nerected a new adobe walled trading post nearby, naming it Fort John. \nLike its predecessor, however, it was popularly referred to as Fort \nLaramie. As the buffalo robe trade declined, the number of emigrants \npassing on their way to California, Oregon, and Utah grew from a \ntrickle to a torrent. The fort rapidly became a major weigh station \nalong the emigrant trails. As a result, the U.S. Government purchased \nthe fort in 1849 and officially named it Fort Laramie.\n  Over the years, Fort Laramie filled a variety of roles as one of the \nlargest and most important military post on the Northern Plains. The \nNorthern Plains tribes fiercely defended their homeland against \nsettlement by an ever-expanding Nation. Numerous military campaigns \nwere launched from the fort. Important treaty negotiations with Indian \ntribes were also conducted at the fort. The most famous of these were \nthe Horse Creek Treaty of 1851 and the still contested Treaty of 1868.\n  Eventually, Fort Laramie became a center of commerce for local \nhomesteaders and ranchers. Fort Laramie saw rapid advances in \ncommunication and transportation technology. The Pony Express, the \nTranscontinental Telegraph, and stage lines passed through the fort. \nFort Laramie truly became the ``Crossroads of a Nation Moving West.''\n\n[[Page S6714]]\n\n  With the end of the Indian wars, Fort Laramie's usefulness to the \ngovernment rapidly faded. The fort was abandoned in 1890 and sold at \npublic auction. Fort Laramie slowly deteriorated over the next 48 years \nand nearly succumbed to the ravages of time. On July 16, 1938, \nPresident Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a proclamation creating the Fort \nLaramie National Monument. With the determined efforts of local \ncitizens and Wyoming State legislators, the preservation of the site is \nsecure. The fort was redesignated a National Historic Site by an act of \nCongress on April 29, 1960. It was listed on the National Register of \nHistoric Places in 1966. In 1978, it was expanded to its present size \nof 835 acres by an act of Congress.\n  The Fort Laramie National Historic Site is administered by the \nNational Park Service and is open to the public throughout the year. \nInterpretive programs are offered with living history talks and \ndemonstrations available in the summer months. These programs offer \nvisitors a chance to experience life on the frontier.\n  The site has an intensive preservation program to ensure the \nintegrity of the historic structures for generations to come. Ten \nhistoric buildings have been completely restored and refurnished. These \nallow visitors a rare glimpse into the daily workings of a 19th century \nIndian Wars military post. The ruins and foundations of numerous other \nbuildings are also preserved at this nationally significant historic \ntreasure.\n  In celebration of the 175th anniversary of the founding of Fort \nLaramie, I invite my colleagues to visit the Fort Laramie National \nHistoric Site. I congratulate the staff and volunteers whose dedication \nmakes this piece of our history available to visitors from all over the \nworld.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6714-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6714]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PRAGUE CONFERENCE ON HOLOCAUST ASSETS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am delighted the Senate is poised to \nconsider and pass S. Con. Res. 23 in support of the goals and \nobjectives of the Prague Conference on Holocaust Era Assets.\n  The Prague Conference, which will be held June 26 through June 30, \nwill serve as a forum to review the achievements of the 1998 Washington \nConference on Holocaust Era Assets. That meeting brought together 44 \nnations, 13 nongovernmental organizations, scholars, and Holocaust \nsurvivors, and helped channel the political will necessary to address \nlooted art, insurance claims, communal property, and archival issues. \nThe conference also examined the role of historical commissions and \nHolocaust education, remembrance, and research. While the Washington \nConference was enormously useful, more can and should be done in all of \nthese areas. Accordingly, the Prague Conference provides an important \nopportunity to identify specific additional steps that countries can \nstill take.\n  The Holocaust left a scar that will not be removed by the Prague \nConference. But this upcoming gathering provides an opportunity for \ngovernments to make tangible and meaningful progress in addressing this \npainful chapter of history. I commend the Czech Republic for taking on \nthe leadership of organizing this meeting and welcome the appointment \nof Ambassador Stuart E. Eizenstat, former Treasury Deputy Secretary and \nformer Department of State Under Secretary for Economic Affairs, to \nhead the U.S. delegation to the Prague Conference. Ambassador Eizenstat \nis uniquely qualified to represent the United States at this historic \ngathering.\n  I would like to express my gratitude to Senators Kerry and Lugar, the \nchair and ranking member, respectively, of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee, for cosponsoring and reporting this resolution \nexpeditiously.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6714-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6714-S6715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING ABRAHAM LINCOLN\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, born in a log cabin west of the \nAppalachians, Abraham Lincoln grew up in an average family with modest \nmeans. Yet despite only 18 months of education and family hardships, \nLincoln's strength of character, persistence, and drive are among the \nmany reasons he remains relevant to Americans today. Lincoln's legacy \ncontinues to impact the young and old alike even as our country changes \nand grows.\n  In an attempt to celebrate the life of the great Abraham Lincoln, an \nessay contest was held in Illinois, ``The Land of Lincoln.'' Students \nacross the State answered the question: Why is Abraham Lincoln still \nimportant today? The following essays celebrate the life and legacy of \nLincoln and at the same time showcase the talent of young people across \nthe great State of Illinois. I congratulate Megan Hendrickson, Ahsan \nJiva, and Hannah Binnion for their extraordinary essays, and I \nencourage all students to continue to explore the history and lessons \nof our remarkable 16th President.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the following three essays printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             Why Is Abraham Lincoln Still Important Today?\n\n          (By Megan Hendrickson, Sixth Grade, Miss Jaskowiak)\n\n       At the beginning of creation God created mankind in his own \n     image with the intent that all would be treated equally. On \n     January 1, 1863 President Abraham Lincoln established a \n     document called the Emancipation Proclamation freeing the \n     African American slaves from their slave owner's farms. But \n     still, why is Abraham Lincoln still important today? First, \n     Abe Lincoln abolished slavery. Next he kept the nation as one \n     so we would act as one nation not two, and remain strong. \n     Last but not least, Abe led the nation through the Civil War \n     as Commander in Chief.\n       President Abraham Lincoln put slavery to a halt when he \n     signed the Emancipation Proclamation to abolish slavery. \n     Today, this has had a huge impact on us. The slavery halt is \n     one of the reasons we have our 44th President Barrack Obama. \n     If we still had slavery, we might be two separate nations, \n     the North and the South, and many of the opportunities for \n     African Americans that we have today, simply would not have \n     been possible. When Abe stopped slavery it still didn't stop \n     people from doing horrible things to people. Slavery had \n     ended, but segregation and racial discrimination started. \n     That was the worst part. Many of these things have taken more \n     than a century to bring about change. We went through a time \n     when African American people couldn't even go to school or \n     ride on the bus with others, or they had to sit in the back. \n     I believe if it weren't for Abraham Lincoln, some of these \n     changes might not have even come about and we might still \n     have segregation in schools and public transportation. I \n     believe that Lincoln's feelings regarding race and equality \n     were summed up when he said, ``but there is only one race, \n     the human race.''\n       President Lincoln kept the country together at a time when \n     the southern half of the nation was trying to separate from \n     the Union over the issue of slavery. Lincoln said, ``This \n     nation cannot exist half slave and half free'' and that ``A \n     house divided against itself cannot stand.'' The quote is \n     relative to Abraham Lincoln holding the nation in one or in \n     other words us being one with each other as a nation. Had \n     Lincoln not taken such a strong stand against slavery, and \n     had the strength and courage to hold this country together, \n     our country might not be what it is today. Lincoln held \n     strong to his faith and beliefs even though he knew it would \n     bring about the Civil War.\n       Abe led the country through war as Commander in Chief, \n     leading with pride and hope for our country. He had entered \n     his Presidency with a task before him greater than he felt he \n     himself could handle, but felt that with God's help and for \n     the sake of our nation, he could not fail. Had Lincoln not \n     had the courage to lead us into and through the Civil War, \n     for the cause that he believed was right, where would our \n     country be today?\n       Our nation and the world only have one race, the human \n     race. I believe that President Lincoln believed this, and \n     took a stand on his beliefs that have had more than a hundred \n     years of changes in our nation. We all can see why Abraham \n     Lincoln is important today by looking at history and seeing \n     the changes that have taken place over time regarding race \n     and equality. We should all work together as one nation to \n     continue President Abraham Lincoln's legacy and belief that \n     all men are created equal.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Why Is Abraham Lincoln Still Important Today?\n\n               (By Ahsan Jiva, Grade 5, Mrs. L. Anderson)\n\n       Abraham Lincoln lived a great life. I don't think there \n     will ever be a person as special and important as him. He \n     helped stop slavery, he had famous speeches, and served as \n     president. The list goes on and on. And that is why he still \n     means so much to us today.\n       Abraham Lincoln grew up in Hardin Country, Kentucky in \n     1809. As a child, Abraham Lincoln didn't go to school much, \n     which to me is really hard to believe. When Lincoln grew \n     older, the chopped rails and fences for a living. Even though \n     he didn't go to college, he was still able to be a lawyer. \n     After that he tried for the senate. But he didn't make it. \n     Those are just some of the reasons why Lincoln is honored and \n     respected today.\n\n[[Page S6715]]\n\n       After working a lot, Abraham Lincoln finally became the \n     sixteenth president of the United States. He married Mary \n     Todd Lincoln and had four children. He went against slavery \n     and tried to prove that to people who didn't believe slavery \n     should be stopped. He has once said, ``Whenever I hear anyone \n     arguing for slavery, I feel a strong impulse to see it tried \n     on him personally.'' He fought for the slaves' freedom in the \n     Civil War and won. He signed the Emancipation Proclamation \n     and set all the slaves free. But during the Civil War, \n     Lincoln gave one of the most brilliant speeches of all time. \n     It wasn't very long but it had tons of meaning. It was called \n     the Gettysburg Address. He gave it after the brutal battle of \n     Gettysburg, Pennsylvania. That speech made him famous back \n     then and what makes him important today.\n       Even though he is not with us today, he is very hard to \n     forget. He is on the penny and fiver dollar bill. He also has \n     famous monuments made for him, such as the Lincoln Memorial \n     and Mount Rushmore. He will especially remembered in \n     Illinois, because he spent a lot of his time here. He's known \n     for his tall hat and the first president with a beard. He was \n     also fond of pets. He is known for his many quotes, such as \n     ``I leave you, hoping that the lamp of liberty will burn in \n     your bosom, until there shall no longer be doubt, that all \n     men are created equal''. There are many more credentials of \n     Abraham Lincoln, but I think I'll stop right there because I \n     don't think there are enough pieces of paper to list all of \n     Lincoln's accomplishments.\n       Abraham Lincoln was living a great life but sadly it had to \n     end because while he was enjoying a play at Fords Theater, he \n     was assassinated by John Wilkes Booth in 1865. He lived to be \n     fifty-six years old. Lincoln's death broke the heart of many \n     people. He was buried in Springfield, Illinois.\n       Abraham Lincoln will be missed a lot. His death was very \n     unfortunate, especially since he was in his second term as \n     president. He was important in so many ways. Although he is \n     not with us today he will be remembered forever.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             Why Is Abraham Lincoln Still Important Today?\n\n                (By Hannah Binnion, Grade 3, Miss Alday)\n\n       Abraham Lincoln is still important today because he was \n     honest. He had a customer that paid too much so he ran miles \n     to give her extra change back. Abe didn't like slavery so he \n     made a law when he was the president stating ``There was to \n     be no more slaves.'' This law helped free slaves. It seemed \n     that he cared not only for himself but for others as well. He \n     wanted to avoid war at any cost it was difficult.\n       President Lincoln liked to be funny and kind. He loved \n     books for fun and to learn. Lincoln set an example that if we \n     helped others even if their from different cultures we'll get \n     along better.\n       I feel this is why Abraham Lincoln is still important \n     today. I feel that it is important for us to be honest and \n     not think of people from different cultures as bad and \n     different then we are because of who they are, we should be \n     treated equal.\n       Lincoln set an example that if we follow his example, it \n     would make us and our community better. He helped us regain \n     our freedom for our countries rights.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6715-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                              REMEMBERING\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Luke Cole, a leading environmental attorney and \nfounder and executive director of the Center on Race, Poverty and the \nEnvironment. Mr. Cole passed away on June 6th as the result of a car \naccident in Uganda. He was 46 years old.\n  Luke Cole was born in North Adams, MA, on July 15, 1962. He spent \nparts of his childhood in New York and Santa Barbara, where his father \nwas an art historian at the University of California at Santa Barbara. \nDuring this period, Mr. Cole often accompanied his father on research \ntrips to Nigeria. He graduated from Stanford University and Harvard Law \nSchool.\n  Mr. Cole decided against potentially more lucrative career paths in \nfavor of one that allowed him to follow his heart and enable him to \nmake an impact on issues that he cared about most deeply: social \njustice and the environment. As a result of Mr. Cole's determination \nand vision, what began with a desk and a phone at a friend's office \nbecame the San Francisco-based nonprofit law center, the Center on, \nRace, Poverty and the Environment. Today, the center has a staff of 20 \nand offices throughout central California.\n  Mr. Cole's accomplishments as the executive director of the Center on \nRace, Poverty and the Environment were numerous and significant. From \nthe rural communities of California's San Joaquin Valley to a 4,000-\nyear-old Inupiat Eskimo village in Kivalina, AK, his legacy can be seen \nin the traditionally underserved communities that he worked so hard to \nsave from the effects of harmful pollutants. His unyielding commitment \nto environmental justice inspired and empowered many people from \nminority communities to take a more active role in combating \nenvironmental racism.\n  In addition to his leadership of the Center on Race, Poverty and the \nEnvironment, Mr. Cole also served on the United States Environmental \nProtection Agency's National Justice Advisory Council and taught \nenvironmental justice seminars at Stanford Law School and UC Berkeley's \nBoalt Hall School of Law. A man of many interests, he was also a \ndedicated bird watcher and root beer connoisseur, and possessed an \nextensive collection of miniature spy cameras and bobblehead dolls. He \nwill be missed.\n  Mr. Cole is survived by his wife Nancy Shelby; father Herbert; mother \nAlexandra Cole, and stepmother Shelley Cole; two brothers Peter and \nThomas; sister, Sarah; stepbrother Daryn; and son Zane.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6715-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6715]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING TOM MASTERSON\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On \nJune 18 to 21, the residents of Bottineau will gather to celebrate \ntheir community's history and founding.\n  Originally founded in 1883 as Oak Creek, the town was designated the \ncounty seat in 1884. It changed its name to Bottineau, taking its new \nname from Pierre Bottineau, a pioneer, hunter, and frontiersman. 3 \nyears later, the town relocated 1\\1/2\\ miles so that it would be along \nthe newly installed railroad tracks. The town lies in north-central \nNorth Dakota and is now home to over 2,000 residents.\n  Today, Bottineau has many things to be proud of. The Bottineau County \nFair is North Dakota's oldest county fair. The county also houses \nBottineau Winter Park, often called the Jewel Above the Prairie, which \nremains a perennial attraction. And the town of Bottineau is known for \n``Tommy Turtle,'' the world's largest turtle, which stands 30 feet tall \nand is said to have been built as a symbol of the Turtle Mountains.\n  The citizens of Bottineau clearly value education, as their town is \nhome to Minot State University's Bottineau Campus. Apart from its \nacademic success, the campus has also seen athletic success in recent \nyears, with the Lumberjacks hockey team claiming three consecutive \nnational championships in the last 3 years. Both the Lumberjacks and \nthe Ladyjacks have had accomplished seasons in the past several years. \nAdditionally, the campus has added new sports teams in recent years--\nsomething that bodes well for the future of the school.\n  In honor of the city and county's 125th anniversary, officials have \norganized a vibrant celebration that includes basketball and golf \ntournaments, art and quilt shows, class and city gatherings, games for \nthe young and old, a dance, and a centennial parade.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating \nBottineau, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in \nwishing them well in the future. By honoring Bottineau and all other \nhistoric small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering \nfrontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as \nBottineau that have helped shape this country into what it is today, \nwhich is why this fine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Bottineau has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n[[Page S6717]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6717-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              125TH ANNIVERSARY OF BRADDOCK, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased today to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On \nJune 25 to 28, the residents of Braddock will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's history and founding.\n  Settlers first came to the area in 1883 and founded Braddock shortly \nthereafter, making it the oldest existing town in Emmons County. \nLocated in south-central North Dakota, Braddock was established as the \nfirst railroad town in the county. Frederick Underwood, president of \nthe Soo Railroad, named the town in honor of his good friend, County \nAuditor Edward Braddock.\n  Today, Braddock remains a close-knit community. Though small, \nBraddock is known across the State for the popular Johnny Holm concerts \nit hosts every year, as well as for the excellent hunting grounds in \nthe area. The citizens of Braddock are very involved in their community \nand have many active organizations, including Saint Katherine's Altar \nSociety, the Lions Club, the Senior Citizens Organization, and the \nSouth Central Threshers Association.\n  The people of Braddock have planned a lively celebration in honor of \nthe town's 125th anniversary. Activities include a beard-judging \ncontest, duck race, tractor trek, fashion show, outdoor concerts, and a \nparade.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating \nBraddock, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well in the future.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize a community in \nNorth Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On June 11 to \n14, the residents of Napoleon gathered to celebrate their community's \nhistory and founding.\n  Founded in 1884, Geo H. Cook from Steele, ND, first surveyed and \nplatted the Napoleon town site. The city was named after the president \nof the Napoleon Townsite Company, Napoleon Goodsill. This company \nconstructed the first building in Napoleon. It soon became the county \nseat, a title the city still holds today despite numerous challenges \nover the years. In 1914, Napoleon became incorporated as a village and \nlater was recognized as a city in 1947.\n  Located in south central North Dakota, Napoleon's beautiful parks and \nrecreation provide its residents with great enjoyment. Napoleon Country \nClub is a picturesque nine-hole golf course located just 1 mile outside \nof the city. The Napoleon City Park has 12 campsites along with \nbasketball, tennis, and volleyball courts. Beaver Lake State Park is \nalso nearby which provides fantastic hunting, fishing, and boating.\n  Today, Napoleon is a rural agricultural community that is excited to \ncelebrate its quasquicentennial. Currently, Napoleon is building an \nelevator which will provide improved service to a unit train for grain \nhauling, and wind farm projects are beginning in the city.\n  To celebrate its 125th anniversary, Napoleon held a number of \nexciting events. The Opening Ceremony included music, city hall \ndignitaries, and a fly over. The festivities continued all weekend with \nentertainment such as a softball tournament, 4-H and Future Farmers of \nAmerica livestock show, craft vendor show, 3 on 3 basketball tournament \nand a magician, followed by street dances at night. The events \nconcluded on Sunday with a demolition derby.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating \nNapoleon, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well in the future. By honoring Napoleon and all the other \nhistoric small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great tradition of \nthe pioneering frontier spirit alive for future generations.

Mr. President, Washington is a city of big \nnames and big personalities, many of whom are used to the recognition \nand praise that comes with a high-profile career in public service. \nBut, as we all know, hundreds of thousands of unsung public servants \nwork behind the scenes every day to secure the future of America and \nimprove the lives of its citizens. Today, I want to pay tribute to one \nof those public servants, who is as deserving of the public's gratitude \nand recognition as any officeholder with a household name: Erma Mary \nPaliani.\n  On July 3, Ms. Paliani, who currently works for Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement, ICE, Office of Investigations, will retire after \nserving her country for over 67 years. Ms. Paliani, or ``Ms. Erma'' as \nshe is affectionately referred to by her coworkers at ICE, is the \nlongest serving employee in the Department of Homeland Security and the \neighth longest serving employee in the Federal Government. Her \ndedication to public service is truly an inspiration and should serve \nas an example to us all.\n  Born in Ambridge, PA, in 1917, Ms. Paliani entered public service as \na student at Ambridge Senior High School, serving as a youth worker for \nthe National Youth Administration of the War Department in 1936. In \n1940, she officially began her Federal career working for the War \nDepartment's Museum Project. In March 1947, Ms. Paliani joined the \nImmigration and Naturalization Service, INS, Philadelphia office. And 2 \nyears later, she was transferred to the INS headquarters in Washington \nDC, where she has spent the last 60 years working to make our Nation's \nimmigration system work more efficiently.\n  At the INS, Ms. Paliani quickly gained a reputation for her friendly \ndemeanor, gentle smile, and steadfast commitment to government service. \nShe is now retiring from her job as secretary to the deputy assistant \ndirector for the Critical Infrastructure and Fraud Division. Her long \nand productive tenure has been honored by many top government \nofficials, including Attorney General Janet Reno, INS Commissioner \nDoris Meissner, Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff, and \nPresident Bill Clinton, who, in a note written to Ms. Paliani on the \noccasion of her 80th birthday, wrote that her devotion to her work ``. \n. . serves as an example of caring and leadership to which we can all \naspire.'' I couldn't agree more.\n  I extend to Ms. Paliani my sincerest thanks for her years of service \nand her dedication to this country that we love, and I wish her all the \nbest on a well deserved retirement. I know that her friends and \ncoworkers at ICE will miss her greatly, but I am confident that she \nwill continue to serve as a model of hard work and commitment for all \npublic servants to emulate.\n  Thank you, Ms. Erma Mary Paliani. The country is a better place \nbecause of you. We are all grateful for your selfless dedication to \nyour government and your Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6717-4", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6717-S6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  COMMENDING ALLAGASH BREWING COMPANY\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, in today's uncertain and difficult \neconomic climate, countless small businesses are seeking new tools and \nresources to stay afloat. That is why we passed the American Recovery \nand Reinvestment Act--to get our economy on the right track, and to \nhelp those business owners in need of a lifeline to outlast this \nrecession. I rise today to recognize a small brewer from my home State \nof Maine that is making use of a critical provision that was included \nin the bill.\n  Allagash Brewing Company is a small brewery based in Maine's largest \ncity, Portland. Founded in 1995 by owner Rob Tod, Allagash's mission \nwas to fill a missing niche in American craft brewing movement--Belgian \nstyle\n\n[[Page S6718]]\n\nbeers. Mr. Tod noticed the prevalence of British and German style \nbeers, but felt that consumers were missing out on a quality product. \nAnd so, he began producing Allagash White, his version of the \ntraditional Belgian white beer. It was an immediate hit in the Portland \narea, and Mr. Tod soon began shipping the beer across Maine. He also \nhired two additional brewers and embarked on the production of a new \nAllagash Double Ale, modeled after another Belgian style established by \nTrappist monks centuries ago, and still popular to this day. Over time, \nAllagash's line of beers has grown to include roughly 20 exquisite \nstyles available in over 20 States nationwide, including a ``Reserve'' \nline of distinctive beers that have been fermented twice, through a \ntime-honored process known as the methode champenoise.\n  As a unique way to give back to the greater Portland community, the \nbrewery has established an Allagash Tribute Series, whereby the company \ndonates $1 from the sale of every bottle of specific beers to local \nnonprofits, charities, and other civic organizations. For example, sale \nof the Fluxus variety helps the Allagash Pediatric Scholarship, \nestablished to support the training of nurses at the Maine Medical \nCenter. Additionally, the sale of Hugh Malone Ale assists the Maine \nOrganic Farmers and Gardeners Association, America's oldest and largest \ncoalition of State organic farmers with over 5,500 members. And \nVictoria Ale benefits the restoration of downtown Portland's Victoria \nMansion, a national historic landmark.\n  In addition to caring for its neighbors, Allagash takes care of its \nown employees. Mr. Tod offers health care to all 20 of his employees. \nFurthermore, to invest in his company's--and, therefore, his \nemployees'--future, Mr. Tod has already taken advantage of a small \nbusiness expensing provision that was part of the Recovery Act signed \ninto law earlier this year. The measure provides an extension for 2009 \nof enhanced section 179 small business expensing at a level of \n$250,000, allowing small businesses in Maine and throughout the Nation \nto make investments in plant and equipment that they can deduct \nimmediately instead of depreciating over a period of 5, 7, or more \nyears. This offers entrepreneurs like Rob Tod the ability to grow and \nbolster their businesses despite the troubling economic picture.\n  A small brewery with a big heart, Allagash Brewing Company's \ncommitment to community and employees is impressive, and a model for \nother small businesses. Additionally, Allagash is working in smart and \neffective ways to emerge from this recession stronger than before. I \ncommend Rob Tod and everyone at Allagash for their stellar work ethic \nand their fine products, and wish them much success in crafting a solid \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6718-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6718-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6718-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the bill (H.R. 2346) making supplemental \nappropriations for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, and for \nother purposes.\n                                  ____\n\n  At 11:14 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, without amendment:\n\n       S. 614.

A bill to establish the Consumers Choice Health Plan, a \npublic health insurance plan that provides an affordable and \naccountable health insurance option for consumers; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, there is a stark choice looming \nbefore Congress. It is the choice between enacting a comprehensive \nreform bill that truly improves our health care system for the American \npeople or enacting a mediocre reform bill that largely maintains the \nstatus quo--which is an ineffective and costly health care system run \nby the insurance industry. I know that most of my colleagues want the \nformer--a 21st Century health care system that provides meaningful and \naffordable coverage for all, improves health outcomes, and brings \naccountability and responsibility back into health care.\n  I am absolutely convinced that the inclusion of a strong public \nhealth insurance plan option is the only way to guarantee that all \nconsumers have affordable, adequate, and accountable options available \nin the insurance marketplace. It is for this reason that I rise today \nwith my good friend, Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, to introduce the \nConsumers Health Care Act of 2009--legislation to provide a strong \npublic plan option in the National Health Insurance Exchange.\n  One of the most contentious, yet critical, pieces of the national \nhealth care reform effort is whether or not Americans should have the \noption to buy their health insurance from a publicly run organization. \nIn other words, in addition to choosing among numerous health plans run \nby private insurers, should consumers also have the option of choosing \nan affordable, stable, and transparent public plan when they are \ndeciding what is best for them and their families? I believe consumers \nshould have the option of choosing a public plan.\n  Opponents of giving Americans a public option regularly use alarmist \nrhetoric such as ``big government'' and ``socialized medicine.'' And, \nsomehow, protecting the rights of private health insurers to make \nprofits has become more important to some than offering Americans the \nchoice of a plan that seeks to insure everyone, no matter how sick, \nthat is less expensive, and that is responsible to the American \npeople--not to private profit-seeking stockholders.\n  I'm not sure when the word ``public'' became such a bad word in the \neyes of some of my colleagues. Public means acting in the interest of \nthe general public--which is exactly what we should aspire to in \ncomprehensive health reform.\n  The private health insurance market has significantly contributed to \nthe broken nature of our health care system, with a long history of \ncutting coverage off or charging too much for too little. A public plan \noption--repeat, option--is an effective way to bring competition to the \ninsurance market, hold down costs, and encourage innovation and quality \nimprovements. To deny this option is not only shortsighted, but \ndownright harmful.\n  Everyone knows the sobering statistics that have highlighted the need \nfor comprehensive health reform. More than 45 million Americans are \nuninsured and another 25 million are underinsured. Since 1909, the \naverage health insurance premium for a family has increased by 119 \npercent, from $5,791 in 1999 to $12,680 in 2008. Yet, Americans have \nseen their benefits decrease and have faced substantially larger out-\nof-pocket expenses. An estimated 62 percent of all personal \nbankruptcies involve medical expenses and 78 percent of the individuals \nwho cited medical expenses in their bankruptcy claims had health \ninsurance. Health care costs already consume 17 percent of the United \nState's gross domestic product, which everyone can agree is \nunsustainable.\n\n  However, representing the great state of West Virginia has shown me \nthat the need for health reform is far more essential and personal than \nfrightening statistics could ever show. I have listened at roundtable \ndiscussions where West Virginians described how the current health care \nsystem has failed them. One woman was really struggling to care for \nboth herself and her son. She was uninsured because her son, who had a \nserious brain disorder, needed 24 hour a day, seven day a week, \nassistance. Another family wrote to me because their son, who was born \nwith serious congenital heart defects, had reached the $1 million limit \non his mother's insurance policy within the first nine months of his \nlife. They were unsure of how to obtain lifesaving treatment for their \nson, now that the insurance company would no longer pay for his care. I \nhave heard from countless other West Virginians who have been unable to \nfind affordable health care, or have figured out too late that the \nhealth insurance they had was inadequate for what they needed.\n  As Congress works to achieve the transformative reform necessary to \ncreate a sustainable health care system, a vital component of this \nreform is the inclusion of a strong public plan option like the \nConsumer Choice Health Plan included in the Consumers Health Care Act. \nA public plan will help establish a new insurance framework, one that \ncompels insurers to provide Americans with the best value for their \nhealth care at the best price, rather than the current insurance \nframework, which is focused on avoiding risk and increasing profits. \nThe Consumer Choice Health Plan will be available for all individuals \nand small businesses, regardless of health status, and will not be \nconcerned with paying a CEO salary or broker commissions.\n  The Consumers Health Care Act will increase transparency and \naccountability throughout the health insurance market, as well as give \nindividuals guaranteed access to health care coverage should they be \ndenied or priced out of affordable private insurance coverage. \nCurrently, insurers are allowed to operate in a black box, with little \noversight of their coverage and payment decisions. Individuals with \npre-existing conditions are routinely denied access to affordable care. \nFor years, United Health was able to underpay providers and overcharge \npatients for out-of-network services. The Consumers Health Care Act \nwill address this and other issues by bringing greater transparency to \nthe private health insurance market.\n\n[[Page S6723]]\n\n  Consumer Choice Health Plans will serve as a vital safety-net of \ncoverage for individuals and families that have been unable to obtain \naffordable and comprehensive health care coverage through the private \nmarket. A private insurance company's desire to earn greater profits \nwill always trump over the need to make health care coverage affordable \nand accessible to all Americans, and greater insurance regulation is \nnot enough. The Consumers Health Care Act is necessary in order to \nachieve the sustainable change that the health care system in this \ncountry needs.\n  I trust the good sense of the American public to choose the health \ncoverage they want, and they deserve the choice of a public plan with \nlower costs and the guarantee of always being there when they need it. \nThe American people trust us to get this right and deliver the best \ncoverage options that will keep their families healthy and safe. The \ndays of packaging half-baked legislation into a bill and calling it \ntransformative reform when it is not have to end now, or the shame is \non all of us:\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1278\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

DEFINITION OF NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE EXCHANGE.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``National Health Insurance \n     Exchange'' means a mechanism established or recognized under \n     Federal law for coordinating the offering of health insurance \n     coverage to individuals in the United States through the \n     establishment of standards for benefits, cost-sharing, and \n     premiums for such health insurance coverage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORKER (for himself, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Bennett):\n  S. 1280. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to \ndelegate management authority over troubled assets purchased under the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program, to require the establishment of a trust \nto manage assets of certain designated TARP recipients, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak, briefly, about a bill \nSenator Warner from Virginia and I are introducing today. The title of \nthe bill is the TARP Recipient Ownership Trust Act of 2009.\n  This bill intends to deal with the issue that our government finds \nitself in a position of large ownership in companies--something I think \nnone of us ever imagined would be the case some time ago.\n  This piece of legislation only deals with TARP recipients. But what \nit does is solve the unease in the problem that many of us have in the \nSenate and in the Congress with the fact that we have such large \ngovernment ownerships in companies.\n  What this bill would do would be to set up a trust for all TARP \ncompany ownership to be put in when stakes are larger than 20 percent \nof the company. What it would do is give the administration the ability \nto appoint three trustees to have a fiduciary obligation to the \ntaxpayers of this country. It would be my hope that these trustees \nwould be people such as Warren Buffett or Jack Welch or people similar \nto them, whom we--all of us in our country--respect and consider to \ncertainly be knowledgeable market participants.\n  These trustees will be paid no money. They would do this as a duty to \nour country. While their objective would be to look at these companies \nwith a fiduciary responsibility to the taxpayers, they also would be \ngiven the direction to unload these ownerships by December 24, 2011. I \nthink this would go a long way toward giving all of us more comfort \nthat there was not a political agenda with any of these companies, that \nthese companies were being dealt with in a way that is fair and \nappropriate to the taxpayers. I think this is something that, while it \nis not perfect, would do what is necessary to make us all feel a lot \nmore comfortable about where we are.\n  No. 1, we would have three neutral, well-respected businesspeople \nlooking after our taxpayers' interests. Hopefully, that would shield as \nmuch as possible any kind of political involvement in those companies. \nSecondly, obviously, they would be given the directive to unload this \nownership by December 24, 2011, as I have mentioned. They can come back \nat that time. If they feel, for some reason, this is not in the \ntaxpayers' interest, they can come back to us at that time and seek \nadditional time, should they think it is in our interest as taxpayers \nto extend that period of time.\n  This is a bipartisan piece of legislation. This is not done with any \nkind of ax to grind. This legislation is being offered, truly, just to \nsolve this rub we all find ourselves in, that the American citizens \nfind themselves in, where we have large ownership stakes.\n  Specifically, today, because of the ownership stakes that exist, the \nthree companies that would be affected would be AIG, Citigroup, and, of \ncourse, the automobile company, General Motors. There could be \nadditional companies that, through conversions to common equity, might \nbe affected by this.\n  I think this is a very commonsense piece of legislation that I hope \nwill have broad bipartisan support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1280\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Commission on Congressional Budgetary \nAccountability and Review of Federal Agencies; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I want to follow up on what my \ncolleague from North Dakota said regarding the financial regulatory \nissue. This is a huge problem.\n  In my office, I have a debt clock running. I put it there purposely \nso people can see what it is, and it is running at $11.5 trillion. At \nthis point in time, it has a dizzying amount of numbers that are \nrunning on it. Usually my constituents come in and say: Good, I wanted \nto get out of the waiting room. That clock is driving me crazy, the \nnumbers are going so fast. It is so huge, the numbers and the rate we \nare going.\n  What troubles me as well, as a member of the baby boomer generation, \nis that I look at this and I feel as though we are following on the \nheels of the ``greatest generation''--the World War II generation, with \nall the sacrifices and the things they did to make this country what it \nis. My predecessor in the seat I am in, Bob Dole, I think epitomizes \nthe ``greatest generation''--the World War II generation--that \nsacrificed so much so the rest of us could live and do so well, and I \nam deeply appreciative of that. But I look at my generation, sometimes \ncalled the ``me generation.'' I don't know that that is particularly an \napplauding sort of title, saying it is more focused that way, but I \nthink we need to, ourselves, step up a lot more for the country, for \nthe people in this Nation, and deal with the problems we have.\n  One of the biggest ones, as far as the legacy we leave, is the \nmortgage that is growing on this country, this $11.5 trillion I started \noff talking about. When I first started in Congress in 1994, it was \nroughly 50 percent mandatory spending and 50 percent discretionary \nspending. This year, we are looking at 70 percent mandatory spending--\nbetween 60 and 70 percent mandatory spending, depending on what ends up \nin the final package--and 30 to 40 percent discretionary spending. And \nof that discretionary, half of that is military. So we have this huge \ngrowth in entitlement programs and spending programs that are on \nautopilot and that are setting that clock to going faster and faster, \nat $11.5 trillion and up.\n  We are looking at a $1.8 trillion deficit this year alone. This is \nunsustainable and it is irresponsible. And it is irresponsible of the \nbaby boomer generation, which has inherited and been given so much, not \nto step up and to start to deal with this. I feel very strongly about \nthis, that it is something we need to start dealing with as a \ngeneration. I am not talking about from a party perspective, or even \nfrom a legislative perspective, but I am talking about it from a \ngenerational perspective. This is the sort of thing we need to start \ndealing with for our children's future and our grandchildren's future, \nso that when future generations come up and they look back and see the \n``greatest generation'' of World War II, they don't then look at the \nbaby boomer generation and say: Well, that is the generation that used \na lot of it up. Rather, they say: No, that was the generation that used \na lot, but then got it together and started to address the problems of \nfiscal irresponsibility--the fiscal irresponsibility that is taking \nplace in this country and in this government today.\n  We have program spending that is out of control. Everybody is against \nwaste, fraud, and abuse, but I have not found that line in the budget \nyet which allows us to X it out. What I am talking about here--and I \nwill introduce at the end of my speech--is a bill that actually does \nstart to get at that, and it does it via a mechanism that is a proven \nmechanism we have used before in this body which actually reduced \ngovernment spending. It is called the Commission on Accountability and \nReview of Federal Agencies, CARFA. We have 20 original cosponsors, and \nit is a very simple concept that we have used before.\n  It is based on the BRAC Commission--the Base Realignment and Closure \nCommission--only it applies to the rest of government, not just \nmilitary bases. You create a commission, and the commission says 300 \nbases should be closed. They send that to the administration to check \noff on that, and then it sends it to the Congress, requiring an up-or-\ndown vote within a limited timeframe, no amendments and a set amount of \ntime to debate. Yes or no, deal or no deal: Are we going to keep the \nbases or close the bases, which way is it?\n  That is the only mechanism I have ever seen us come up with in this \nbody to actually cut Federal spending and to do the things we talk \nabout all the time but in the trading nature of the legislative body \nnever gets done. This one has actually done it, the BRAC Commission, on \nmilitary bases, which is a substantial but certainly not all of our \nbudget. So I am saying, let's take that mechanism and apply it to the \nrest of the budget, mandatory and discretionary spending, both pockets \nof this.\n  I am fully open to suggestions and ideas for amendment on this bill, \nbut I would break the Federal Government into four different \ncategories, to where every fourth year there is a CARFA commission \nwhich reviews one-fourth of the budget, and then that recommendation is \nsent to the Congress to either eliminate these pieces or to keep them.\n  I have a scorecard up here. It turns out that the OMB does a regular \nscoring of the effectiveness of Federal Government programs and then \nthey assign a percentage out of 100 to each. I put the grade equivalent \non it, and you can see the programs that were reviewed here: State \nDepartment has the highest score that I have up here, of C+ for \neffectiveness, at which the OMB scored it. The Education Department--\nand I don't know what that says here--has scored below 50 percent and \ngets an F--the Education Department--on its scorecard. You can look \nthrough and these are the programs that are reviewed: 51 for the State \nDepartment; 93 for the Education Department.\n  So I am saying you would have this CARFA commission go through to do \na similar type of review for effectiveness. Those programs that would \nfail would be put in an overall bill which would say: Okay, Congress, \nkeep this entire package or eliminate this entire package.\n  If you eliminate them, the same year you can come back and \nreauthorize that bill and reappropriate the program if you believe it \nis effective. But this gives you an automatic culling process. It is a \nculling process that takes place on programs that have been put in the \nbudget year after year and have somehow been sustained or have gotten \nsupporters around them. Most programs have a number of different \nsupporters around them, so they keep going on and on. Even though they \nare not particularly effective, the supporters like them, so they keep \ngetting in the budget, even when we do an objective review of them and \nfind out these are failed programs by our own standards.\n  This is something we need to do. It is something I would hope that \nthe baby boomer generation could stand up and\n\n[[Page S6729]]\n\nstart to say it is time for us to take fiscal responsibility for the \nsituation that is being created and that is unsustainable in this \ncountry. We are already starting to see interest rates move up. That is \nlikely to continue. We are seeing people beside themselves when looking \nat the level of Federal spending, and the waste in it, and saying: What \nis going on? Can't you guys get ahold of it?\n  Here is a way to actually get ahold of it and deal with it and be \nable to say to generations in future years that, yes, we stood up and \ntook ownership and we dealt with the problem.\n  There was an article in the Wall Street Journal a week ago where a \ngentleman was saying that the unfunded obligations of the Federal \nGovernment today--these are things such as the entitlement programs, \nwhether it is Medicare, Social Security, veterans' benefits, and \npension guarantees that we have--are getting close to $100 trillion. \nThose are unfunded obligations existing on the part of the Federal \nGovernment today. That number seems high to me, but I know if you look \nat Medicare and a couple of other ones, we are looking at nearly $60 \ntrillion in that category. To give some perspective, the total economy \nis $14 trillion, or thereabouts.\n  This is irresponsible to the highest degree, and it is irresponsible \nto future generations, and it is time to put a mechanism in place for \nus to deal with it. I urge my colleagues to join us in cosponsoring \nthis bill. I am submitting it now to the desk, with 20 cosponsors. This \nis an idea whose time has come.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1284. A bill to require the implementation of certain \nrecommendations of the National Transportation Safety Board, to require \nthe establishment of national standards with respect to flight \nrequirements for pilots, to require the development of fatigue \nmanagement plans, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to join with my colleague, \nSenator Boxer, to introduce the One Level of Safety Act. We have all \nbecome familiar with the events surrounding the terrible tragedy near \nBuffalo, New York--an accident that the National Transportation Safety \nBoard categorized as the worst such incident since late 2001--that cost \nfifty lives, and shattered countless others. In the wake of the crash \nof Flight 3407, we have identified failures on a multiplicity of \nlevels. For an agency that has consistently cited its commitment to \n``one level of safety'' for all carriers as far back as 1995, this \naccident showcases that when it comes to regional carriers, the Federal \nAviation Administration has done a poor job of enforcing that \nphilosophy.\n  During its preliminary investigation of Flight 3407, the National \nTransportation Safety Board pointed out a number of issues specific to \nthis accident that could be directly attributable to fatigue, with many \npilots traveling all night over great distances just to reach their \nbase of operations. For example, almost a quarter of Colgan Air pilots \nwho operate out of Newark, New Jersey travel over one thousand miles \nsimply to reach their designated duty station. At the same time, as \nwe've witnessed with a number of regional carriers, pilots are often \npaid meager salaries--the first officer in Flight 3407 made barely \ntwenty thousand dollars annually.\n  With such low pay, it is difficult for these pilots to provide for \nthemselves and their families, much less afford a restful place to \nspend an evening; at a hotel, or an apartment in close proximity to \ntheir base of operations--as a result, they doze in airport lounges--\ntechnically against most airline regulations--and subsequently are \ngetting into the cockpit fatigued, with insufficient rest and, \npotentially, reduced situational awareness. With little oversight \nconcerning the amount of rest these pilots receive, we face the \nterrible potential for another incident in the near future.\n  I was greatly encouraged by the efforts that the new Federal Aviation \nAdministrator Babbitt undertook on Monday; his announcement to initiate \nrulemakings on fatigue management, the relationship between major and \nregional carriers, and training discrepancies, were all positive, \nproactive steps to help remedy a situation that for too long has gone \nignored, and I commend his willingness to take the reins so early in \nhis tenure. Unfortunately, as a recent series of hearings at the Senate \nCommerce Committee has shown us, rulemakings are typically long, drawn-\nout processes that in some cases are never completed. Simply put, this \nis insufficient.\n  In fact, a National Transportation Safety Board recommendation \nconcerning pilot fatigue--clearly an underlying cause of the Flight \n3407 crash--has been outstanding for nearly 2 decades! This \nrecommendation was no small suggestion; it has been on the NTSB's \nhighest profile publication, their Most Wanted List, for nineteen \nyears! Given that four of the last six fatal accidents involving \ncommercial carriers included fatigue as a contributing cause, I am \nstunned that this issue has not been addressed. But only one effort to \ntackle this issue has been made in the past 2 decades, and after \nencountering some resistance, that proposed rulemaking was shelved in \n1995, and no second attempt was forthcoming. So, while the Federal \nAviation Administration's comments yesterday were laudable, there are \nno guarantees when it comes to rulemakings. I believe it is incumbent \non Congress to act and act now.\n  That is why Senator Boxer and I joined together to develop \nlegislation that we believe will close many of the loopholes that \njeopardize safety, those same loopholes spotlighted by the findings of \nthe National Transportation Safety Board, the Department of \nTransportation Inspector General's office, and the victims' families of \nFlight 3407. Requiring the Federal Aviation Administration to complete \na number of long-overdue rulemakings on issues as wide-ranging as \nfatigue management, minimum training standards for all carriers, and \nremedial training for deficient pilots is the first step. Ensuring the \nFederal Aviation Administration will perform adequate, unannounced \ninspections to guarantee these new rules are enforced, and requiring \nmore rigorous inspections of flight schools like the Gulfstream \nAcademy--whose parent company was recently assessed a civil penalty of \n$1.3 million for safety violations, and where many regional pilots \nreceive their training--will go a long way towards closing the \nloopholes that still exist in our aviation safety network. In my view, \nthese are all positive steps that will prevent another incident like \nthe crash of Flight 3407.\n  Before I close, I would like to say a word to the families of the \ncrash victims. I deeply empathize with your loss, and in large part, \nyour efforts have been essential in the drafting of this legislation. \nThank you for all your perseverance and invaluable contributions during \nwhat I know must be difficult times for all of you.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, like many of my colleagues, I was shocked \nand saddened by the commuter plane crash last February outside of \nBuffalo, NY. Sadly, Clay Yarber, a resident of Riverside, CA, was one \nof the 50 victims of this tragic crash.\n  I would like to offer my deepest condolences to the family and \nfriends of Mr. Yarber and to all of the families dealing with such \nhorrific loss.\n  The crash of Continental flight 3407 has had a significant impact on \nhow Americans across the country view air travel and has raised serious \nquestions about the safety and oversight of our Nation's aviation \nsystem.\n  Initial hearings held this past May by the National Transportation \nSafety Board, NTSB, brought to light many unsettling revelations about \npilot training, hours of experience, fatigue, and the FAA's oversight \nrole of regional airlines.\n  I was greatly disturbed by what appeared to be a lack of proper \ntraining for the pilots on how to recover from a stall, how to proceed \nin icing conditions, and reports of the crew commuting cross country \nwithout proper rest prior to the flight.\n  Although regional airlines account for one-half of all of the \nscheduled flights in the U.S., five of the last seven fatal commercial \nplane crashes involved these airlines.\n  As more Americans rely on commuter airlines for air service, the FAA \nmust take aggressive action to ensure that there is no difference in \nthe level of safety provided by these air carriers.\n\n[[Page S6730]]\n\n  The National Transportation Safety Board, NTSB, hearings also made \nclear that the FAA must be more proactive when it comes to safety. We \nmust not wait until the next disaster to make long overdue changes in \nsafety regulation at the FAA.\n  It is unacceptable that the NTSB recommendations designed to address \nsome of the most serious aviation safety deficiencies continue to go \nunaddressed by the FAA today.\n  Last May, I joined Senator Snowe in sending a letter to the \nDepartment of Transportation urging the agency to take immediate action \nto address NTSB recommendations that languished on its Most Wanted list \nfor years and other pressing safety concerns.\n  In some instances, recommendations such as those meant to address \npilot fatigue, have been on the NTSB Most Wanted list since its \ninception 19 years ago. We must take immediate action to ensure that no \nother family must endure a similar tragedy because of unmet safety \nrecommendations and a lack of agency oversight.\n  I was encouraged by recent announcements from the FAA about the \nagency's initiative to revise work hour rules to address pilot fatigue \nand to conduct emergency inspections at pilot training facilities. I \nbelieve this is a step in the right direction, but we must do more.\n  That is why I am proud to join Senator Snowe in introducing the \nEnsuring One Level of Aviation Safety Act of 2009, to address some of \nthe more egregious aviation safety deficiencies. Our bill requires the \nFAA to implement unfulfilled NTSB recommendations and to do more \noversight of regional airlines and pilot training academies. The bill \nalso requires the FAA to update minimum training standards and hours of \nexperience requirements for pilots.\n  Finally, this legislation mandates continuing education training for \npilots, requires the development of airline fatigue management plans, \nand allows carriers immediate access to pilot performance records.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the FAA to implement \nthis legislation and to take additional steps to ensure that there \ntruly is no difference in safety between major carriers and regional \nairlines.\n  We cannot wait for the next airline tragedy to take action. The \nflying public must be assured that the FAA and the airlines are doing \ntheir part to make safety the No. 1 priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/17/senate-section/article/S6730-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 187--CONDEMNING THE USE OF VIOLENCE AGAINST PROVIDERS \n                    OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO WOMEN\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself, Ms. Klobuchar, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Murray, \nMr. Durbin, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. \nLandrieu, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Harkin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Sanders, Mr. \nKaufman, Mr. Wyden, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, \nMr. Levin, Mr. Brown, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr. Burris, Mr. Udall of \nColorado, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Cantwell, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. \nInouye, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Specter, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Leahy, \nMr. Tester, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Begich, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Bennet, Mrs. \nFeinstein, Mr. Warner, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Reed, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. \nMerkley, and Mrs. Lincoln) submitted the following resolution; which \nwas referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Wartime Treatment Study \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 102. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) During World War II, the United States Government \n     deemed as ``enemy aliens'' more than 600,000 Italian-born and \n     300,000 German-born United States resident aliens and their \n     families, requiring them to carry Certificates of \n     Identification and limiting their travel and personal \n     property rights. At that time, these groups were the two \n     largest foreign-born groups in the United States.\n       (2) During World War II, the United States Government \n     arrested, interned, or otherwise detained thousands of \n     European Americans, some remaining in custody for years after \n     cessation of World War II hostilities, and repatriated, \n     exchanged, or deported European Americans, including \n     American-born children, to European Axis nations, many to be \n     exchanged for Americans held in those nations.\n       (3) Pursuant to a policy coordinated by the United States \n     with Latin American nations, thousands of European Latin \n     Americans, including German and Austrian Jews, were arrested, \n     relocated to the United States, and interned. Many were later \n     repatriated or deported to European Axis nations during World \n     War II and exchanged for Americans and Latin Americans held \n     in those nations.\n       (4) Millions of European Americans served in the Armed \n     Forces and thousands sacrificed their lives in defense of the \n     United States.\n       (5) The wartime policies of the United States Government \n     were devastating to the German American and Italian American \n     communities, individuals, and their families. The detrimental \n     effects are still being experienced.\n       (6) Prior to and during World War II, the United States \n     restricted the entry of Jewish refugees who were fleeing \n     persecution or genocide and sought safety in the United \n     States. During the 1930s and 1940s, the quota system, \n     immigration regulations, visa requirements, and the time \n     required to process visa applications affected the number of \n     Jewish refugees, particularly those from Germany and Austria, \n     who could gain admittance to the United States.\n       (7) The United States Government should conduct an \n     independent review to fully assess and acknowledge these \n     actions. Congress has previously reviewed the United States \n     Government's wartime treatment of Japanese Americans through \n     the Commission on Wartime Relocation and Internment of \n     Civilians. An independent review of the treatment of German \n     Americans and Italian Americans and of Jewish refugees \n     fleeing persecution and genocide has not yet been undertaken.\n       (8) Time is of the essence for the establishment of \n     commissions, because of the increasing danger of destruction \n     and loss of relevant documents, the advanced age of potential \n     witnesses and, most importantly, the advanced age of those \n     affected by the United States Government's policies. Many who \n     suffered have already passed away and will never know of this \n     effort.\n\n     SEC. 103.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to H.R. 2344.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 2344) to amend section 114 of title 17, United \n     States Code, to provide for agreements for the reproduction \n     and performance of sound recordings by webcasters.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Webcaster Settlement Act of 2009 will \nprovide the recording industry and webcasters the additional time they \nneed to reach a mutually beneficial agreement on webcasting rates. I am \npleased that Congress has acted swiftly on this legislation.\n  I have long championed the development of new business models for \ntransmitting music to the public. Webcasters are able to offer a range \nof music to consumers in a form that can compete with traditional \nbroadcast radio and satellite radio. As webcasting and webcasters \nflourish, the performers whose music is attracting listeners deserve \ncompensation.\n  In March 2007, the Copyright Royalty Board determined the rates \napplicable to webcasters through 2010. Webcasters large and small \nexpressed serious concerns that the new rates would threaten their \nviability. I encouraged all parties at that time to negotiate and reach \nan agreement on rates that would compensate recording artists while \nallowing webcasters to prosper. The Copyright Royalty Board process is \nintended as a backstop when parties cannot reach agreements. All \nparties, and the listening public, benefit when private sector \nagreements are reached.\n  Last year, Congress passed an extension similar to the one we pass \ntoday. It paved the way for agreements between SoundExchange, on behalf \nof the recording industry, and the National Association of \nBroadcasters, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and a group of \nsmall webcasters.\n  I am pleased that both webcasters and the recording industry are \npromoting this legislation. I have said before that I would not \nsanction a legislative readjustment of rates because one party is \ndissatisfied with the results. By passing this extension today, \nCongress is returning the authority to set rates to the creators and \ndistributors of the music we all enjoy.\n\n[[Page S6741]]\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate today will \npass the Antitrust Criminal Penalty Enhancement and Reform Act of 2004 \nExtension Act, ACPERA. I have long supported vigorous enforcement of \nthe antitrust laws. Passage of this legislation ensures that the \nDepartment of Justice will retain the tools it needs to prosecute \ncriminal antitrust violations effectively and efficiently.\n  Since its inception 5 years ago, ACPERA has bolstered the Department \nof Justice's ability to uncover and prosecute criminal antitrust \nviolations through its leniency program. The act provides incentives \nfor corporations to self-report antitrust violations by limiting \ncriminal liability and the civil damages recoverable to actual damages \nagainst a party that comes forward and cooperates with the Department \nof Justice.\n  The incentives in this program are critical to the success of the \nAntitrust Division's criminal antitrust enforcement. The 1-year \nextension will allow the Department of Justice to continue this \nsuccessful program while Congress assesses the long-term direction of \nthe Department of Justice's leniency program.\n  Mr. REID.
