There are \nvery few things that need to be worked out in conference, but that \nshould be done in a few days, and we will complete this when we get \nback. We have checked with the Pentagon, and they are satisfied that if \nwe finish this when we get back, there will be adequate time to fund \neverything our troops need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5767-7", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5767]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, a little later this morning, the \nPresident will discuss his decision to close Guantanamo by an arbitrary \ndeadline that is now only 8 months away. It is clear to both \nRepublicans and Democrats in Congress that the administration does not \ncurrently have a plan for closing Guantanamo and that closing it \nwithout a plan is simply unacceptable. So I hope the President uses his \nremarks this morning to present a concrete plan that demonstrates how \nclosing Guantanamo will keep Americans as safe as Guantanamo has.\n  We know the FBI has serious concerns about any plans to release or \ntransfer other detainees into the United States. Just yesterday, FBI \nDirector Mueller said detainees who are sent to U.S. soil, even if they \nare only sent to secure detention facilities, might still be able to \nconduct terrorist activities, much like gang leaders who have been able \nto run their gangs from prison. Director Mueller also stated that \ndetainees released or transferred\n\n[[Page S5768]]\n\ninto the United States could endanger the American people by \nradicalizing others or providing financial support for terrorism. \nDirector Mueller's testimony appears to undermine the claim that \nsending detainees to the United States is a safe alternative to \nGuantanamo.\n  Yesterday, the Senate spoke with near unanimity, by a vote of 90 to \n6, against sending terrorist detainees to U.S. soil--a vote that \nmirrored a vote 2 years ago on the same question. The Senate also \nexpressed its view yesterday that Congress expects its relevant \ncommittees to be briefed on the threat posed by the terrorists at \nGuantanamo. So it is clear that Senate Democrats do not believe \ncircumstances have changed over the last 2 years in such a way that \nwould warrant releasing or transferring terrorists into America.\n  If the President believes circumstances have changed, then he has an \nopportunity to explain those changes this morning. The American people \nare asking the administration to guarantee that any terrorist it \nreleases or transfers will not return to the battlefield. This is \nparticularly urgent in light of a New York Times report this morning \nthat says one in seven detainees already released has returned to \nterrorism. The President has an opportunity to reassure the American \npeople that future releases will not lead to the same result. If he is \nnot able to provide specifics about his plan for terrorist detainees at \nGuantanamo, he could still provide this assurance by simply revising \nhis policy. The President has already shown adaptability on military \ncommissions, on prisoner photos, on Iraq, on Afghanistan, and on \nPakistan. Here is an opportunity to show more of that flexibility on \nGuantanamo.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5768-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5768]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 ENERGY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, Americans have noticed a steady \nuptick in the price of gasoline over the past few weeks, and it is only \ngoing to get worse during the summer driving season. The economic \ndownturn may have caused gas prices to fall from last summer's record \nhighs, but as the economy recovers, $4 gasoline could well return and \nAmericans will want answers.\n  Fortunately, many of us have been busy putting together a balanced, \nsensible solution that gets at the root of our energy crisis and \naddresses the concerns of everyone involved in this debate, including \nsome who traditionally have been at odds. We believe it is possible to \nbuild a bridge to the clean energy future all of us want without \nintroducing crippling taxes on consumers or on industry. So this \nmorning, with Memorial Day fast approaching, I would like to briefly \noutline this balanced approach.\n\n  The first step is to admit we have a serious problem. Something must \nbe done to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil. America uses \nmore than a fifth of the world's supply of oil, much of it from \ncountries that do not like us. If we start by using less, we will need \na lot less from other countries. So conservation and increased \nefficiency are certainly necessary. It is something on which everyone \ncan agree. We need to use less.\n  But conservation is only half the equation. Even as we use less \nenergy, we need to produce more of our own. America sits on an ocean--a \nliteral ocean--of untapped oil and natural gas and vast stores of coal \nand oil shale. Our geography also makes us rich in renewable energy \nsources such as wind, solar, and geothermal. Taken together, these \nresources are the perfect complement as we move toward the day when \ncars and factories can run on cleaner, more efficient fuels. But we \nhave to be realistic about how far off that day is. We have to admit \nthere is a gap between the clean renewable fuel we want and the \nreliable energy we need. So as we invest in technologies that will \nbring us cleaner, more efficient energy, the only way we can expect to \ntruly reduce our dependence on foreign sources of oil is to produce \nmore American energy and use less. This may sound like a simple \nproposal. The best solutions usually are. Unfortunately, the idea of \nfinding more energy at home and using less is needlessly controversial \nbecause some are unwilling to admit that a gap exists between the \nenergy we need now and the energy we want, and still others do not like \na number of our proposals for finding more domestic energy.\n  Here is what we have proposed. We propose building 100 new clean \nnuclear energy plants as soon as possible. We propose offshore \nexploration for natural gas and oil. We propose making plug-in electric \ncars and trucks half of all new vehicles sold in 20 years. And we \npropose doubling research and development on energy to make all of this \npossible. These and other proposals, including the development of clean \ncoal and coal-to-liquids technologies, constitute a balanced, \ncomprehensive approach that would do all the things we need to reduce \nour dependence on foreign oil, help reduce our consumption, and build \nthe bridge to a cleaner, more efficient energy future.\n  This approach would strengthen our economy by preserving jobs in \nexisting industries even as we create new jobs by investing in new \ntechnologies. It would enhance our security by reducing our dependence \non foreign suppliers. And it would help the environment by embracing \nthe cleaner, more efficient energy sources of the future.\n  All of us recognize we should reduce the amount of energy we use. We \nalso recognize the energy we use should be as clean as possible, as \nreliable as possible, and as inexpensive as possible. Our balanced \napproach of finding more American energy and using less would bring \nabout all these things without hurting the economy or disrupting our \nlives or hindering security.\n  So as the summer driving season continues, Americans will be \nreminded, once again, that our Nation's energy crisis has not gone \naway. But the approach I have outlined addresses that crisis head-on. \nRepublicans will continue to speak out about the produce-more, use-less \nmodel. We hope our friends on the other side recognize it is the only \nsensible approach to a crisis that must be addressed.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I wish to give sort of a progress \nreport on the amendment I introduced yesterday and is pending still, \nbut after cloture it will be in a different category, of course. I wish \nto say I have had a very productive opportunity to talk to the \npresident of Chrysler and the people at Chrysler to try to make headway \nfor the Chrysler dealers, the 789 that have gotten the notice they will \nbe shut down as of June 9. I think there is a way forward here. It is \nnot set in concrete, but I think there is going to be a result that I \nbelieve will make it a much better situation. That is what I am working \nfor because these dealers right now are facing bankruptcy themselves--\nevery one of them. We are talking about 40,000 employees in these \ndealerships. So as the Government is certainly backing the automobile \ncompanies and they are trying to have as soft a landing as possible for \nall those involved in this very serious situation we are in, I want the \ndealers to be part of the soft landing.\n\n[[Page S5769]]\n\n  I don't think it is Government's position to go in and change the \ndecisions that have been made by Chrysler, but I do think it is our \nresponsibility to assure that those dealers have the ability to have \nsome accommodation for all the inventory they have--the cars, the \nspecial equipment, the parts--that after June 9, they will not be able \nto use. They will not be able to sell a Chrysler car or use the \nChrysler logo. Although General Motors has given notice to its dealers, \nthey have given them until the end of 2010 to work things through. But \nChrysler I think is trying to stay as strong as they can going into the \nmerger that has been approved, so they want a quick ending, which we \nall understand and support. I do. I want Chrysler to emerge in a \nstronger situation. I think we all do. But I also want the dealers that \nare suffering all over this country right now, having had 3 weeks' \nnotice to shut down, sometimes a dealership that has been in business \nfor 90 years or 50 years or 25 years--we can't walk away from that. \nChrysler can't walk away from that. I believe, from talking to the \npresident today, they agree with that.\n  We are trying to get something definitive. I will report, again, on \nthis. I am going to support cloture because we must provide the \nsupplemental funds for our troops who are in harm's way. That is the \npremier purpose of this supplemental appropriation. I am very pleased \nthis Senate has acted decisively to stop the funding for moving \nprisoners from Guantanamo Bay into our country or letting them go into \nother countries, where we fear we might see them again on the other \nside of an IED or some other disruption. I am very pleased with the \naction the Senate took yesterday on that. We must fund our troops who \nare in harm's way and their families and their quality of life, giving \nthem the equipment and the training and the support they need to do \ntheir jobs.\n  At the same time, the reason I brought this amendment forward is \nbecause it, too, is an emergency. While it is not a taxpayer expense, \nit is a situation that I think is untenable and that is the people who \nare under the gun until June 9. My message is that I believe the \nChrysler people are going to try to do the right thing. I believe the \nWhite House can help us make that happen. We are going to work with the \nWhite House and the task force. The Senators from Michigan, I think, \nare also being very proactive here. I wish to say I appreciate the \ncosponsors of my amendment. Senator Mikulski, on the floor last night, \nwas added as a cosponsor, along with Senator Menendez and Senator \nBrown.\n  I ask unanimous consent, at this time, that Senator Casey and Senator \nLautenberg be added as cosponsors of amendment No. 1189.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. We were adding sponsors just about every few minutes \nas people began to see the plight of these dealers and hear from them.\n  My message is we need to vote for cloture. We need to go forward with \nthis supplemental appropriation for our troops, but we must--we must--\ntake care of these dealers in the best possible way and not leave them \nstranded in a situation which was not their doing. Yet they are paying \nthe highest of all prices.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that Senate \namendment No. 1144 be considered in order postcloture in addition to \nthe requirements under rule XVI, rule XXII, and the adoption of the \nInouye amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, this amendment from my \nfriend, Senator Chambliss, would preclude the U.S. Attorney General \nfrom allowing detainees at Guantanamo to even be tried for crimes in \nthe United States. I think it goes too far, and I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, the assistant majority leader is \nexactly right. My amendment is going to prohibit any Guantanamo \ndetainee from being brought to the United States. The assistant \nmajority leader made a comment yesterday that he thought it was \nsomewhat foolish on the part of the minority to think this President \nwould even allow terrorists to be brought into the United States. The \nfact is, this administration is already proposing that some of the \nterrorists who are held at Guantanamo be brought into the United States \nand be freed because the court has determined that 17 Uyghurs ought to \nbe free. The administration is talking about freeing those Uyghurs \ninside the United States.\n  The press reported this morning that President Obama intends to bring \na Gitmo detainee, Ahmed Ghailani, to New York to be tried in our \ncriminal courts. I fear this is the start of a long process of \ntransferring detainees to the United States where, I believe, legal \ntechnicalities will ultimately allow some of them to be freed into the \nUnited States.\n  The Senate voted yesterday to prevent any detainees from being \nbrought here and has been very outspoken on this issue this week. \nDespite this, the President has chosen to ignore the will of Congress \nand bring Ghailani to the United States. Instead, he is acting quickly \nto bring him here before he signs the supplemental bill into law.\n  I don't know how the President thinks he can try this detainee in our \ncourts. Ghailani is not just any terrorist. He was a high-value \ndetainee in the CIA's detention. Bringing him into a U.S. courtroom \nwill open a floodgate to challenges on his detention, his treatment, \nand any evidence obtained from him.\n  Additionally, if we were able to obtain any evidence on Ghailani from \nany other terrorists, that information would likely not be admitted in \nU.S. courts because it would be considered hearsay. If not, the \nprosecution would be required to bring additional terrorists to New \nYork just to testify in Ghailani's trial. This alone will make a \nconviction much more difficult.\n  There is too much at stake to grant the unprecedented benefit of our \nlegal system's complex procedural safeguards to foreign nationals who \nwere captured outside the United States during a time of war. Allowing \nthese terrorists to escape conviction or, worse yet, to be freed into \nthe United States by our courts because of legal technicalities would \ntarnish the reputation of our legal system as one that is fair and \njust.\n  Prohibiting the detainees from entering the United States, as my \namendment does--the assistant majority leader is exactly right--is one \nsmall step in the right direction.\n  Further, if these individuals, such as Ghailani, were to be brought \nto the United States by President Obama to be tried in our article III \ncourts and not convicted, the only mechanism available to our \nGovernment to continue to detain these individuals would be via \nimmigration law. However, current immigration laws on our books are \ninsufficient to ensure these detainees would be mandatorily detained \nand continue to be detained until they can successfully be removed from \nour borders.\n  Although I am adamantly opposed to bringing any of these detainees to \nthe United States, and I do not believe the President has independent \nauthority to do so, I do believe we need legislation to safeguard our \ncitizens and our communities in the event they are brought here. To \nthat end, my amendment makes mandatory the detention of any Gitmo \ndetainees brought to the United States.\n  It is imperative the Senate consider my amendment before the final \nadoption of this supplemental bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, in response to my friend, the Senator \nfrom Georgia, he has obviously forgotten the name Zacarias Moussaoui. \nHe was accused of being the 19th or 20th\n\n[[Page S5770]]\n\nhijacker on 9/11. He was successfully prosecuted in the courts of the \nUnited States. He has been convicted, is serving time in a prison of \nthe United States, and we are not less safe because of it. Our system \nof justice worked.\n  The Senator from Georgia and many on his side of the aisle have no \nconfidence in our system of justice. They do not want to even consider \nthe possibility that people could be charged with a crime and \nsuccessfully prosecuted here. We have proven otherwise.\n  There are 347 convicted terrorists now serving time in U.S. prisons. \nI have not heard a hue and cry from anyone saying let's get them all \nout of the country, because we know they are being safely and securely \nheld.\n  America is not at risk. For the Senator to argue that once they are \ntried they have to be released as American citizens or in the general \npopulation defies logic. If these people are brought in for the purpose \nof trial and found not guilty, they are certainly not going to be \nallowed to stay in the United States. There is no requirement for that. \nThere is no way they could ask for citizenship, having just been found \nnot guilty, being a resident of another country. That is not even in \nthe realm of possibility.\n  What the Senator is arguing is about a possibility that I think is \nfarfetched, and he ignores the obvious. Madam President, 347 terrorists \nconvicted in American courts are currently serving time in American \nprisons right now.\n  I might also add that at the end of the day, it will be the President \nof the United States who will propose what we do, and the President \nwill make his recommendations soon. I am anxious to hear them. But for \nus to foreclose the possibility of bringing a detainee to justice for \ncrimes committed, for acts of terrorism, by saying we would not \nconsider ever trying them in the United States, what would we do with \nthem? Hold them indefinitely without charges? Export them to some other \ncountry?\n  If they can be charged and prosecuted successfully in our courts, \nthey should be. They should be held securely until they are resolved in \ncourt, and if they are resolved in a guilty fashion, they could be \nincarcerated as the other 347 terrorists in our prisons. If found not \nguilty, they can leave the country, as they should not be welcomed as \ncitizens.\n  The President will be making an announcement today. I am anxious to \nhear it. For us to anticipate what that is and foreclose possibilities \nI don't think is a wise policy for keeping this country safe.\n  The bottom line is this President--no President--is going to release \nterrorists into Georgia, Mississippi, Illinois, or New York. It is not \ngoing to happen. Presidents accept their responsibility to keep our \ncountry safe, and to suggest otherwise I don't think is consistent with \nour experience.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, what the Senator from Illinois, who \nis a lawyer, neglects to mention is the fact that all 347 of the \ncurrent incarcerated people who have been tried for terrorist acts were \narrested under U.S. law. They were investigated by the FBI. They were \nprosecuted because they were arrested and investigated with that end in \nmind. Not one single one of those 347 individuals was arrested on the \nbattlefield.\n  What the Senator is now proposing is that we take all 240 of the \nconfined detainees at Gitmo and give them all of the rights that are \nguaranteed to every criminal who is investigated and arrested inside \nthe United States as opposed to being arrested on the battlefield. That \nhas never happened before in the history of the United States, and we \nhave had an awful lot of captives on the battlefield.\n  For there to be any correlation between the 240 detainees at \nGuantanamo who are the meanest, nastiest killers in the world, getting \nup every day thinking of ways to kill and harm Americans, and to \ncompare them to the 347 who are now confined after being arrested \ninside the United States is somewhat ludicrous.\n  Again, I regret the Senator is objecting to my amendment which would \nkeep those 240 individuals at Guantanamo outside the United States and \nwould ensure that forever and ever they could never be released into \nthe United States. I simply regret he sees fit to object to it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I am not suggesting that the detainees \nat Guantanamo all be tried. I know of one, for example, who has been \nheld for 7 years and was notified a year ago there are no charges \nagainst him. The question is where he will be sent. He still languishes \nin prison because of that. It would be unjust for us to continue to \nkeep him in Guantanamo without any charges against him beyond 7 years. \nI don't think he needs to be tried. We need to find a safe place to put \nhim once we are certain he is not going to engage in acts of terrorism.\n  This morning, President Obama is going to make a statement on this \nissue. The statement by the White House in advance of his speech at the \nNational Archives--I think part of this press announcement bears \nrepeating into the Record. It says:\n\n       The President also ordered a review of all pending cases at \n     Guantanamo. In dealing with the situation, we do not have the \n     luxury of starting from scratch. We are cleaning up something \n     that is--quite frankly--a mess that has left in its wake a \n     flood of legal challenges that we are forced to deal with on \n     a constant basis and that consumes the time of government \n     officials whose time would be better spent protecting the \n     country. To take care of the remaining cases at Guantanamo \n     Bay, the President will, when feasible, try those who have \n     violated American criminal laws in Federal courts; when \n     necessary, try those who violate the rules of war through \n     military commissions; when possible, transfer to third \n     countries those detainees who can be safely transferred.\n\n  President Obama is calling for an orderly, sensible review of cases \nat Guantanamo. For us to continue to keep voting on ways to foreclose \nthe possibilities of bringing Guantanamo to a close in a responsible \nfashion I don't think is responsible conduct. I hope we will stop this \nand allow the President to show his leadership. He inherited this mess \nat Guantanamo. He is doing his best to find solutions in keeping with \nour values and keeping in mind his primary responsibility to keep us \nsafe.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I simply close by saying the Senator \nis exactly right. There are military tribunals set up in Guantanamo \ntoday. In fact, those military tribunals had convicted three separate \ndetainees, and the current administration, when they came into office, \ndropped the pending charges of twenty-some others awaiting trial, thus \nsuspending the military commissions. These individuals can be tried by \nmilitary tribunals at Guantanamo. They are in place and ready to go. I \nwould simply urge that is the way these individuals need to be \nprosecuted and not to be brought to the United States and tried here.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5770-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5770]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \n2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act. My vote today does not indicate a \nblank check for the administration. But it is indicative of a strong \ndesire on my part to begin to change to a new approach in Iraq and \nAfghanistan.\n  We all know about the challenges President Obama inherited from 8 \nlong years of the Bush administration. He was left with an economy and \nrecession, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, diminished U.S. standing \naround the globe, a country more dependent on foreign oil, and a \nresurgent al-Qaida.\n\n[[Page S5772]]\n\n  Today, we have a new administration with clear priorities and \nrealistic foreign policy objectives. We must give President Obama and \nhis administration the resources and flexibility they need to move U.S. \nforeign policy in a new direction. If we were to walk away from this \nchange in policy that is reflected in this supplemental, I think the \nmessage we are sending is for the status quo. The status quo does not \ndeserve a vote.\n  Again, I repeat, my vote is not a blank check. I am voting for this \nbill not because I want the United States to remain bogged down in two \nwars, but because I want to give this administration--the Obama \nadministration--the resources it needs to successfully end these wars, \nstarting with the war in Iraq. Furthermore, I don't support an open-\nended commitment of American troops to Afghanistan; and if we do not \nsee measurable progress, we must reconsider our engagement and strategy \nthere.\n  In particular, we must do more to sharply reduce the numbers of \nheartbreaking civilian casualties. As ADM Mike Mullen, Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, recently said:\n\n       We cannot succeed in Afghanistan, or anywhere else . . . by \n     killing Afghan civilians. . . .\n\n  In a reference to a U.S. airstrike in the Farah Province, Admiral \nMullen said:\n\n       We can't keep going through incidents like this and expect \n     the strategy to work.\n\n  I could not agree more. President Obama promised the American people \na new way forward in Iraq and a new way forward in Afghanistan. The \npassage of this bill will allow him to put the pieces in place to keep \nhis promises by finishing the mission in Afghanistan, which was \nshortchanged because of the Iraq war. I want to talk about that for a \nminute.\n  I voted, after 9/11, to go after al-Qaida, to go after the Taliban, \nto go after Osama bin Laden. The administration, instead of doing that, \nturned around and went into Iraq under the false premise that Iraq had \nsomething to do with 9/11. We still have former Vice President Cheney \nout there trying to convince the people that was the right thing to do. \nThat was the wrong thing to do. There have been so many needless deaths \nin Iraq. We left Afghanistan, and the Taliban returned in force; and \nthe people there are under the yoke of the Taliban in many parts of \nthat country. What a tragedy, because of a mistaken policy. What a \nterrible legacy, because of a mistaken policy. Yet the debate rages on. \nSo I am going to engage in that debate.\n  I believe we need to tackle this mission in Afghanistan, which was \nshortchanged. I believe we must increase the role of the State \nDepartment and our civilian agencies in working toward peace. I know my \ncolleague in the chair, Senator Kaufman, has been very eloquent on this \npoint--a new way to allow the Afghan people to, in essence, take back \ntheir country. We need to train Afghan security forces so we can \nultimately change the nature of our mission there and bring our troops \nhome. That is the goal.\n  I have heard my Republican friends say they don't know what the goal \nis in Afghanistan. That is OK. I don't think there is any problem \nexplaining what it is. We want to go after al-Qaida. We want to \ndecrease the influence of the Taliban and defeat them, if we have to. \nHopefully, we can, in fact, work with some of them. I am not convinced \nof that, but it may be possible. We need to give the Afghan security \nforces the ability to defend their own people.\n  There is a lot more we have to do over there to protect the most \nvulnerable Afghans, and that means the women and the children of \nAfghanistan. I will talk more about that because this supplemental \ntakes a huge step forward in protecting the women and children there.\n  It seems to me we have to give President Obama an opportunity to \nbring about the change he promised. If I see that change is not coming, \nI am not going to be there. But today, I believe we should give him \nthat chance.\n  To think that we actually had Osama bin Laden cornered at one time, \nbut the obsession with Saddam Hussein drove us away in those Bush years \nfrom that mission and brought us into a situation where we have lost so \nmany of our young men and women, many of them--30,000--were injured, \nsome with horrific injuries, and many more are suffering from post-\ntraumatic stress and brain injury.\n  President Bush took his eye off Afghanistan, and so did Vice \nPresident Cheney. Frankly, sadly, we come to this day. I understand why \nsome colleagues might just say: I don't want to hear about it. I don't \nwant to spend any more money on it. Just forget it.\n  I don't think that is the way to go. I think President Obama said \nvery clearly that he is going to bring change. I think this is the day. \nWe either stand for change or for the status quo. That is my belief.\n  In the Bush years we never really had enough resources to fight al-\nQaida in Afghanistan because we were waging an open-ended war in Iraq. \nRemember, there were no benchmarks for progress. It was day after day, \ndeath after death after death. Frankly, because the Iraq war fueled \nrecruitment by al-Qaida, our Nation's security has been compromised. \nOur standing in the world has suffered. Again, most heartbreaking, \nAmerican servicemembers and their families have paid the price.\n  In my view, there are four provisions in the supplemental that will \nhelp to correct our course.\n  First, the bill provides funding to get our troops home from Iraq. \nThese provisions are essential for President Obama to meet his date of \nAugust 31, 2010, to remove combat brigades from Iraq and remove all of \nour troops by the end of 2011.\n  For those of us who want to bring the troops home, the funding to do \nthat is in this supplemental. So, clearly, when we vote for this, we \nvote to begin that process. The responsibility for security must be \nturned over to the Iraqis--and quickly. U.S. forces cannot continue to \nshoulder the burden there anymore. The people there have to decide if \nthey want to live together or die together. They have to look at these \nethnic divisions and make their own decisions. We will help. We will \nalways help. But it is their decision.\n  So the first part of the bill is funding to begin bringing the troops \nhome from Iraq.\n  Second, this bill seeks to turn things around in Afghanistan by \nproviding a significant investment in diplomacy and development, \nincluding, very importantly to me and to a lot of my colleagues, for \nthe Afghan women. A military solution alone will not solve the problems \nin Afghanistan. We need a strategy that helps the Government provide \nfor its people and invest in the civil society and those programs that \nare crucial to the long-term security and prosperity of that country.\n  Development is very important to the people of Afghanistan. I am very \nproud that this bill takes critical steps to support Afghan women and \ngirls. Today, more than 7 years after the international community \nhelped free Afghan women from the prison of life under the Taliban, the \nsituation for women in Afghanistan remains dire.\n  I want to say to Senator Leahy and his staff: Thank you. Thank you \nfor listening. Thank you for working with us. Thank you for working \nwith the women-led nongovernmental organizations.\n  Without Senator Leahy and his staff, we would not have this language \nin the bill. I wanted to make that point.\n  More than 80 percent of the women in Afghanistan are illiterate. More \nthan one in six die in childbirth. These are the voices that have been \nforgotten. We cannot return to the days when Afghan women had to be \ndraped in burqas against their will. If you have never tried on a \nburqa--and I am sure most people haven't--let me tell you what it feels \nlike, because I did. You disappear. You become nothing. Remember when \nwomen were murdered in cold blood by the Taliban in soccer stadiums? \nThose days must be over.\n  It seems to me that walking away from this supplemental at this time \nsays we are walking away from those women. We need to help them. We \nneed to do everything we can to give them a chance because to not do so \nwould be tragic.\n  This bill specifically appropriates $100 million for programs that \ndirectly address the needs of Afghan women and girls. In addition to \nSenator Leahy and his staff, I thank Congresswoman Nita Lowey and her \nstaff. In the House bill, they also put in quite a few resources for \nthe women-led NGOs. In our bill, we do even more to directly address \nthe\n\n[[Page S5773]]\n\nneeds of women and girls, including funding for the Afghan Human Rights \nCommission and Afghan Ministry of Women's Affairs.\n  I wrote a bill called the Afghan Women Empowerment Act. Specifically, \nthe supplemental appropriates $30 million for Afghan women-led \nnongovernmental organizations, which is a key component of that bill. \nThe international community cannot stay in Afghanistan indefinitely. We \nknow that. So this funding will help empower those organizations that \nwill provide for the needs of the Afghan community long after the \ninternational community has left.\n  The supplemental includes $10 million to train and support Afghan \nwomen investigators, police officers, prosecutors, and judges with \nresponsibility for investigating, prosecuting, and punishing crimes of \nviolence against women and girls.\n  This is particularly important in a country where women have been so \nmarginalized. No female victim of violence will ever come forward if \nshe believes there is no system in place or resources to help her. What \nhappens if she comes forward is that she becomes a target. I don't know \nhow you feel about it--I think I can guess--when any of us sees little \ngirls being attacked with acid when they are going to school. There is \nsomething deeply wrong if America turns away from that. We cannot, it \nseems to me, in good conscience not give this one more chance, which is \nwhat this supplemental is doing because it is taking a major step to \ngive the Afghan people the chance to stand up for their women, \nchildren, and families.\n  Third, this bill recognizes the importance of Pakistan, a \ndysfunctional, nuclear-armed nation that has some of the most notorious \nal-Qaida terrorists within its borders. Pakistan is one of the greatest \nthreats to international security that we face today. This danger is \nsuch a concern that Bruce Riedel, a Brookings Institution scholar who \nserved as the coauthor of the President's review of our Afghanistan-\nPakistan strategy, said that the country--this is Pakistan--``has more \nterrorists per square mile than any other place on Earth, and it has a \nnuclear weapons program that has grown faster than anyplace else on \nEarth.'' It seems to me to walk away from that threat is the wrong \ncourse. This bill provides funds for nonmilitary aid and \ncounterinsurgency training to enable the Pakistani Government to defeat \nthe growing extremist threat within its borders.\n  Fourth, this bill provides funding to help our servicemembers and \ntheir families deal with the wounds of war and to improve their quality \nof life. It provides funding to increase the number of soldiers and \nmarines to help ease some of the burdens on servicemembers and families \nwho have served three, four, and five deployments to combat zones. How \ncan we walk away from giving those soldiers relief at this point when \nthey have served three, four, and five times? We see some of the \nfallout on the mental health of our soldiers. We have seen some tragic \nthings happen, including a soldier who actually turned on his own \ncolleagues and killed them. We cannot have servicemembers under this \namount of stress from three, four, five, or six deployments. Some of \nthem can handle it. Not all of them can handle it. This bill will \nincrease the number of soldiers and marines, so we can help ease the \nburden of those who have given and given.\n  This bill includes funding to keep our servicemembers safer, \nincluding funding for mine-resistant vehicles in Afghanistan to combat \nthe dangers of roadside bombs. It helps ease the childcare needs of our \nmilitary families by funding the construction of 25 child development \ncenters to serve 5,000 children. It provides $230 million to complete \nconstruction of the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, and \nit provides funds for the construction of nine warrior support \nfacilities across the United States. Our soldiers need help. They \ncannot be expected to travel across the country to get medical care, \neither for physical wounds or mental wounds. We need to make sure we do \nthis.\n  Finally, this bill provides funding for domestic programs that will \nsafeguard our security. It includes $1.5 billion to prepare and respond \nto a global disease pandemic, such as the H1N1 influenza virus we are \ncombating today. A lot of people say: Maybe you are overreacting. We \njust don't know because in other flu epidemics, we think we have \nconquered it, and then it comes back in a more virulent form. We need \nto vaccinate our citizenry. This is expensive and a must-do. I am very \npleased it is in this bill. Just this week, two lives were lost in New \nYork City to the virus. One victim was only an infant, and the other \nwas an assistant principal of a school. Yes, we lose people to the flu \nevery year. We know that. But we want to make sure we are not facing \nsomething for which we are unprepared. Better to be prepared, and this \nbill gives us the funds to prepare.\n  There is significant investment in shoring up our southwest border \nand also combating drug traffickers who operate there. We keep seeing \nhorrific violence along the border. It is deplorable. The drug cartels \nmust be stopped and the perpetrators brought to justice. That is also \nin this bill. This is an emergency spending bill.\n  It also includes $250 million for emergency firefighting activities. \nCalifornia has suffered devastating wildfires over the last few fire \nseasons. I know all of you have watched in horror at the recent \nwildfire in Santa Barbara. We know we are facing terrible challenges. \nWe are facing warmer temperatures. We are facing more drought \nconditions. The funding will help ensure resources are on hand when \nthey are needed.\n  I have to say that this bill should be a must-pass. I have to also \nreiterate that my vote indicates my support for a change in our foreign \npolicy, a change in Iraq to bring this war to an end, a change to \nfinally do what we have to do in Afghanistan so we do not walk out and \nwalk away as we did before. The Taliban allowed al-Qaida to thrive, and \nwe have to work in Afghanistan so that the people turn away from the \nTaliban toward something else that is positive. And we can provide \nthat.\n  Strong diplomacy is in this bill. A change in policy is in this bill. \nIt is our best opportunity to achieve these objectives. If it does not \nwork, I will be the first one to stand up here and say so because, \nfrankly, I believe too many of our brave soldiers have been put in \nharm's way.\n  I think this is the last use of a supplemental appropriation, \naccording to the administration, to fund military operations in Iraq \nand Afghanistan. I welcome that. It says that our President is going to \nhold true to his commitment to an open and transparent government that \nis held accountable to the people. We are going to have these policies \nfunded through the regular budget process. I understand why we need \nthis now. To bring about the change in Iraq and Afghanistan, we cannot \ndo it on the cheap. We have to do it right. I think President Obama's \nquote--and I am not quoting him exactly--was that we have to get out of \nthere very carefully even though we did not get in there very \ncarefully. That is what we are doing. We are getting out of Iraq \ncarefully. We are doing it right. We are funding the way to do it \nright. We are helping our soldiers. And we are changing course in \nAfghanistan, first of all, by paying attention to it, going after al-\nQaida, trying to make sure the Taliban is not an option people choose \nthere, and being very strong in our help toward the women of \nAfghanistan.\n  I will be voting yes for all those reasons and watching closely.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the next hour, this \nbill be open to debate only.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that upon the \ncompletion of my statement, Senator Isakson be recognized for 5 \nminutes, and then that Senator Brown be recognized for 10 minutes. That \nwill allow all of our statements to be completed prior to a unanimous \nconsent agreement which will shortly be entered into.\n\n[[Page S5774]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I ask unanimous consent that no Budget Act points of order \nbe in order to H.R. 2346, as amended; that at 1 p.m., Senator Cornyn be \nrecognized for debate only for up to 40 minutes; that at the conclusion \nof Senator Cornyn's remarks, the time until 2 p.m. be equally divided \nand controlled between the leaders or their designees; that at 2 p.m. \ntoday, there be 40 minutes of debate with respect to the DeMint \namendment No. 1138, with the time controlled as follows: 20 minutes \nunder the control of Senator DeMint, 10 minutes under the control of \nSenators Gregg and Inouye or their designees; that upon the use or \nyielding back of the time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to \nthe amendment; that no intervening amendment be in order to the \nlanguage proposed to be stricken by the DeMint amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, President Obama said in his campaign and \nhas repeated it since the first days of his Presidency that we must \nkeep our Nation safe and secure, but we have to do it in ways \nconsistent with our values. That is a sentiment I share, and one that I \nhave voiced in hearings and statements for years as well.\n  To President Obama's credit, to the benefit of the Nation, he has \nworked since his first day in office to turn these words into action to \nmake our national security policy and our detainee policy consistent \nwith American laws and American values. That, in turn, makes us more \nsecure. I have supported President Obama in these steps, and I will \ncontinue to do so. That is why I have voted against amendments to \nwithhold funding to close the Guantanamo detention facility, and to \nprohibit any Guantanamo detainees from being brought to the United \nStates. These amendments undermine the good work the President is \ndoing, and they make us less safe, not safer.\n  I believe strongly, as all Americans do, we have to take every step \nwe can to prevent terrorism. Then we have to ensure severe punishment \nfor those who do us harm. As a former prosecutor, I have never shied \naway from harsh sentences for those who commit atrocious acts. I point \nto the times I have requested and gotten for people I have prosecuted \nlife sentences, life sentences that they served without the possibility \nof parole.\n  I also believe strongly we can ensure our safety and security and \nbring terrorists to justice in ways that are consistent with our laws \nand values. When we have strayed from that approach--when we have \ntortured people in our custody, or sent people to other countries to be \ntortured, or held people for years without even giving them a chance to \ngo to court, to argue we were holding the wrong person, they are being \nheld in error--we have hurt our national security immeasurably.\n  Our allies have been less willing to help our counterterrorism \nefforts, and that has made our military men and women more vulnerable \nand our country less safe. Terrorists have used our actions as a tool \nto recruit new members, which means then we have to fend off more \nenemies.\n  Worse still, we have lost our ability to respond with moral authority \nif other countries should mistreat American solders or civilians.\n  Guantanamo has become the symbol of the severe missteps our country \ntook in recent years. Changing our interrogation policies to ban \ntorture was an essential first step. But only by shutting the \nGuantanamo facility and restoring tough but fair procedures can we \nrepair our image in the world. We have to do that if we hope to have a \ntruly strong national security policy.\n  To close Guantanamo, we need our national security and our legal \nexperts working hard to come up with a comprehensive plan for its \nclosure. We should be funding those efforts. By cutting off that \nfunding, we have hamstrung the President's initiative, and no matter \nwhat we intended to do, I believe we have made our Nation less safe.\n  Much debate has focused on keeping Guantanamo detainees out of the \nUnited States. In this debate, political rhetoric has entirely drowned \nout reason and reality. Our criminal justice system handles extremely \ndangerous criminals, and it has handled more than a few terrorists, and \nhas done so safely and effectively. We try very dangerous people in our \ncourts and we hold very dangerous people in our jails in Vermont and \nthroughout the country. We have the best justice system in the world.\n  We have spent billions of dollars on our detention facilities, on our \nlaw enforcement, and our justice system. Are we going to say to the \nworld, oh, my goodness gracious, we are not good enough to be able to \nhandle criminal cases of this nature? I do not believe so.\n  We try those dangerous people and we hold those dangerous people in \njails in Vermont and throughout our country. We are showing the world \nthat we can do it. I know; I have put some of them there. We do it \nevery day in ways that keep the American people safe and secure. I have \nabsolute confidence we can continue to do it.\n  The Judiciary Committee has held several hearings on the issue of how \nto best handle detainees. Experts and judges from across the political \nspectrum have agreed that our courts and our justice system can handle \nthis challenge. Indeed, it has handled it many times already.\n  What I am saying is, after all of those billions of dollars, after \nall of the superb men and women we have working in our justice system, \nafter all that we spend on maximum security facilities, are we going to \nsay to the world, America is not strong enough to try even the worst of \ncriminals?\n  When we were hit with one of the worst terrorist attacks ever in this \ncountry, Oklahoma City, did we say we cannot try the people we have now \ncaptured? We cannot have them in a courtroom where it is secure, we \nwill not be able to punish them? Of course not. We went ahead, and we \nalso established for the rest of the world that we follow a system of \njustice in America. And having been horribly damaged in Oklahoma City, \nwe followed our system of justice. The rest of the world looked at it, \nand they learned from us.\n  Let's not step back from that. Republican luminaries such as GEN \nColin Powell have agreed with this idea. One Republican member of the \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Graham, said, ``The idea that we cannot \nfind a place to securely house 250-plus detainees within the United \nStates is not rational.''\n  So let's let reality come in and overwhelm rhetoric. It is time to \nact on our principles and our constitutional system. Those whom we \nbelieve to be guilty of heinous crimes should be tried. They should be \npenalized severely, and our courts and our prisons are more than up to \nthe task. Our courts and our prisons are more up to this task than \nthose in any other country in the world. But we also could have people \nwho are innocent or where we captured the wrong person. If so, they \nshould be released.\n  There are going to be tough cases. Instead of cutting out the money \nthe administration needs to dispose of those cases responsibly, knowing \nhow tough they will be, we ought to be doing just the opposite and give \nthem the resources they need.\n  Let's put aside heated, distorted rhetoric. Support the President in \nhis efforts to truly make our country a safe and strong Republic worthy \nof the history and values that have always made America great.\n  I believed that when I was a young lawyer in private practice. I \nbelieved that when I was a prosecutor. I believe that even more today \nas a Senator.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Bill Shipp\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I know most Members on the floor \nremember a song of about 25 years ago called: ``The Night the Lights \nWent Out in Georgia.''\n  Well, on Tuesday of this week, a beacon of light in journalism did go \nout in Georgia, when Bill Shipp, a gifted political writer, announced \nhis retirement after 50 years of reporting in the South.\n  Bill Shipp is a remarkable character. It is said that all of us are \nreplaceable. I am not sure Bill Shipp is replaceable. He began his \nwriting in Georgia as a political columnist for the Atlanta \nConstitution.\n  Starting in the late 50s, he covered the late Ivan Allen and the late \nDr. Martin Luther King and the Governors\n\n[[Page S5775]]\n\nand the politicians of that era from George Wallace to Lester Maddox, \nto Jimmy Carter, to Carl Sanders.\n  He wrote about the transition of the old South to the new South. And \nin Washington, he covered the Civil Rights Act in the middle and late \nseventies. He was a writer whose perception was keen, whose wit was \nsharp, and whose pen was even sharper.\n  For 32 of his 50 years I was in elected office in Georgia. I can make \na true confession: When he wrote a column, you went to the paper and \nyou read Bill Shipp first. There was a reason for that. If you were \ngoing to be the victim of the day, you might as well go out and find \nout what he was going to say about you. But if you were not the victim \nof the day, you could relish in seeing some other politician being \nskewered by that pen.\n  Bill Shipp had a profound effect on journalism in our State. For \nyears he reported for the Atlanta Journal and Constitution, but after a \nnumber of years he started his only publication whose title was: ``Bill \nShipp's Georgia.'' Never has there been a more appropriate name for a \nnewsletter, because, in many ways, Georgia's politics was Bill Shipp's \npossession.\n  Bill Shipp wrote about politics in such a way that he changed \npolitics in the South. While I would never accuse Bill of having \neditorialized in a news article, the tone and tenor of the direction of \nBill Shipp's perception of what was right and wrong could help to lead \ndebates to a positive conclusion in an otherwise period of discourse \nand trouble.\n  I love Bill Shipp for many reasons--one, because he and I have had \nthe pleasure of living in the same county for the last 40 years. The \nother is, I have learned a lot from him. I always appreciated him. In \npolitics, Bill Shipp is the equivalent of Helen Thomas at a \nPresidential press conference. When a Georgia politician has a press \nconference, Bill Shipp is there. When it is time for questions, he \nalways has one. And when it comes time to roll the grenade in the \nmiddle of the room, Bill Shipp will do it. He did it to me and to \nothers.\n  Bill Shipp is a gifted friend, a man for whom I wish the best in his \nretirement. I think, finally, of those days on Ivy Grove and Cherokee \nRoad in Marietta where he and Tom Watson Brown and George Berry would \nsit at 5 in the afternoon, have a libation, and discuss the next day's \ncolumn that Bill would write. Bill Shipp is a treasured asset of our \nState, a man who has contributed greatly to the growth of the new South \nand the new Georgia, a man whose contributions to journalism are \npreeminent in our State, and a friend to whom I wish the very best in \nhis retirement.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown pertaining to the submission of S. Res. 156 \nare located in today's Record under ``Submitted Resolutions.'')\n  The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n Samuel L. Gravely, Jr., First African-American U.S. Navy Flag Officer\n\n  Mr. WICKER. Madam President, this past weekend, at the Northrop-\nGrumman shipbuilding facility in Pascagoula, MS, the USS Gravely, the \n57th Arleigh Burke class Aegis Guided Missile Destroyer, was christened \nin honor of the late VADM Samuel L. Gravely, Jr.\n  Vice Admiral Gravely was born in 1922, in Richmond, VA. In 1942, \nGravely interrupted his education at Virginia Union University and \nenlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve. He attended officer training camp \nat the University of California in Los Angeles after boot camp at the \nGreat Lakes Naval Training Station in Illinois, and then midshipman \nschool at Columbia University. When he boarded his first ship in May of \n1945, he became its first African-American officer.\n  Gravely was the first African-American to command a fighting ship, \nthe USS Falgout, and to command a major warship, the USS Jouett. As a \nfull commander, he made naval history in 1966 as the first African-\nAmerican commander to lead a ship, the USS Taussig, into direct \noffensive action. He was the first African-American to achieve flag \nrank and eventually vice admiral. In 1976, Gravely became the commander \nof the entire Third Fleet, commanding over 100 ships, 60,000 sailors, \nand overseeing more than 50 million square miles of ocean.\n  Gravely's tenure in the naval service was challenged with the \ndifficulties of racial discrimination. As a new recruit, he was trained \nin a segregated unit; as an officer, he was barred from living in the \nbachelor's officers' quarters. In 1945, when his first ship reached its \nberth in Key West, FL, he was specifically forbidden entry into the \nofficers club on the base. Gravely survived the indignities of racial \nprejudice and displayed unquestionable competence as a naval officer.\n  Gravely exemplified the highest standards and demanded very high \nstandards from his crew. Throughout his career, he stressed the \nrudiments of professionalism--intelligence, appearance, seamanship and, \nmost importantly, pride.\n  Vice Admiral Gravely was a trailblazer for African-Americans in the \nmilitary arena. He fought for equal rights quietly but effectively, \nletting his actions and his military record speak for him. Gravely died \non October 22, 2004, at the naval hospital in Bethesda, MD. In a \nfitting tribute, the obituary on the U.S. Department of Defense Web \nsite quoted Gravely's formula for success: ``My formula is simply \neducation plus motivation plus perseverance.''\n  Samuel L. Gravely, Jr.'s performance and leadership as an African-\nAmerican naval officer demonstrated to America the value and strength \nof diversity. He was a true professional with superb skills as a seaman \nand admirable leadership attributes.\n  The USS Gravely, christened in Pascagoula, will reflect his \ncharacter, his forthrightness, and his steadfastness and will stand for \nand deliver his legacy wherever it serves. His spirit aboard the USS \nGravely will be an inspiration to its crew, the U.S. Navy, and \nAmericans for generations to come.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I understand there is a previous--let me \nask unanimous consent that I be allowed to speak for up to 40 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is the standing order.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I appreciate it. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1139\n\n  Mr. President, I want to address the Senate on two subjects this \nafternoon--first of all, on the subject of various memos and \ninterrogation techniques, notably enhanced interrogation techniques, \nthat were carried out in response to Office of Legal Counsel memos that \nwere written by lawyers there, designed to provide guidance to our CIA \ninterrogators after 9/11 to help them protect the country against \nfuture terrorist attacks.\n  I have an amendment that, because of technical reasons, we will not \nbe able to vote on this week. But I want to assure my colleagues this \nissue is not going away, and we will be back to talk about it more \nlater. But I think it is of sufficient gravity and importance that I \nwant to highlight it here for the next few minutes.\n  First of all, this amendment I am referring to is a sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment. Let me summarize what it does because I think it is \nimportant to put it in context.\n  The sense-of-the-Senate amendment reads as follows. It says:\n\n       In the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks, there \n     was bipartisan consensus that preventing further terrorist \n     attacks [against] the United States was the most urgent \n     responsibility of the United States Government.\n       A bipartisan joint investigation by the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the House of Representatives concluded \n     that the September 11, 2001 attacks demonstrated that the \n     intelligence community had not shown ``sufficient initiative \n     in coming to grips with the new transnational threats''.\n\n[[Page S5776]]\n\n       By mid-2002, the Central Intelligence Agency had several \n     top al Qaeda leaders in custody.\n       The Central Intelligence Agency believed that some of these \n     al Qaeda leaders knew the details of imminent plans for \n     follow-on attacks against the United States.\n       The Central Intelligence Agency believed that certain \n     enhanced interrogation techniques might produce the \n     intelligence necessary to prevent another terrorist attack \n     against the United States.\n       The Central Intelligence Agency sought legal guidance from \n     the Office of Legal Counsel of the Department of Justice as \n     to whether such enhanced interrogation techniques, including \n     one that the United States military uses to train its own \n     members in survival, evasion, resistance, and escape \n     training, would comply with United States and international \n     law if used against al Qaeda leaders reasonably believed to \n     be planning imminent attacks against the United States.\n\n  This amendment further notes that:\n\n       The Office of Legal Counsel is the proper authority within \n     the executive branch [of the Federal Government] for \n     addressing difficult and novel legal questions, and providing \n     legal advice to the executive branch in carrying out [its] \n     official duties.\n\n  It further notes that:\n\n       Before mid-2002, no court in the United States had [ever] \n     interpreted the phrases ``severe physical or mental pain or \n     suffering'' and ``prolonged mental harm'' as used in sections \n     2340 and 2340A of title 18, the United States Code.\n       The legal questions posed by the Central Intelligence \n     Agency and other executive branch officials were--\n\n  This amendment notes--\n\n     a matter of first impression, and in the words of the Office \n     of Legal Counsel, ``substantial and difficult''.\n       The Office of Legal Counsel approved the use by the Central \n     Intelligence Agency of certain enhanced interrogation \n     techniques, with specific limitations, in seeking actionable \n     intelligence from al Qaeda leaders.\n\n  The amendment further notes that:\n\n       The legal advice of the Office of Legal Counsel regarding \n     interrogation policy was reviewed by a host of executive \n     branch officials, including the Attorney General, the Counsel \n     to the President, the Deputy Counsel to the President, the \n     General Counsel of the Central Intelligence Agency, the \n     General Counsel of the National Security Council, the legal \n     advisor of the Attorney General, the head of the Criminal \n     Division of the Department of Justice, and the Counsel to the \n     Vice President [of the United States].\n\n  Further, the amendment notes that:\n\n       The majority and minority leaders in both Houses of \n     Congress,--\n\n  Both in the Senate and in the House, as well as--\n\n     the Speaker of the House of Representatives, and the chairmen \n     and [ranking members] of [both] the Select Committee on \n     Intelligence of the Senate and the Permanent Select Committee \n     on Intelligence of the House of Representatives received \n     classified briefings on [both the proposed techniques and the \n     Office of Legal Counsel advice] as early as September 4, \n     2002.\n\n  The amendment further notes that:\n\n       Porter Goss, then-chairman of the Permanent Select \n     Committee on Intelligence of the House of Representatives, \n     recalls that he and then-ranking member Nancy Pelosi \n     ``understood what the CIA was doing'' [and] ``gave the CIA \n     our bipartisan support'' [and] ``gave the CIA funding to \n     carry out its activities'', and ``On a bipartisan basis . . . \n     asked if the CIA needed more support from Congress to carry \n     out its mission against al Qaeda''.\n\n  The amendment further notes that:\n\n       No member of Congress briefed on the legal analysis of the \n     Office of Legal Counsel and the proposed interrogation \n     program of the Central Intelligence Agency in 2002 objected \n     to the legality of the enhanced interrogation techniques, \n     including ``waterboarding'', approved in legal opinions of \n     the Office of Legal Counsel.\n\n  The amendment further notes that:\n\n       Using all lawful means to secure actionable intelligence \n     based on the legal guidance of the Office of Legal Counsel \n     [of the Department of Justice] provides national leaders a \n     means to detect, deter, and defeat further terrorist \n     [attacks] against the United States [of America].\n\n  The amendment further notes that:\n\n       The enhanced interrogation techniques approved by the \n     Office of Legal Counsel have, in fact, accomplished the goal \n     of providing intelligence necessary to defeating additional \n     terrorist attacks against the United States.\n\n  It further notes that:\n\n       Congress has previously established a defense for persons \n     who engaged in operational practices in the war on terror in \n     good faith reliance on advice of counsel that [such] \n     practices were lawful.\n\n  This amendment further notes that:\n\n       The Senate stands ready to work [on a bipartisan basis] \n     with the Obama Administration to ensure that leaders of the \n     Armed Forces of the United States and the intelligence \n     community continue to have the resources and tools required \n     to prevent additional terrorist attacks on the United States.\n\n  This amendment concludes with this finding or sense of the Senate:\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that no person who provided \n     input into the legal opinions by the Office of Legal Counsel \n     of the Department of Justice analyzing the legality of the \n     enhanced interrogation program, nor any person who relied in \n     good faith on [that legal advice], nor any member of Congress \n     who was briefed on the enhanced interrogation program and did \n     not object to the program going forward should be prosecuted \n     or otherwise sanctioned.\n\n  This is the amendment I sought to offer that for technical reasons is \nnot going to be voted on now. But, I assure my colleagues, we will \nrevisit this at a later date.\n  I want to take issue with some of the comments by my distinguished \ncolleague from Illinois, the majority whip, who I believe--it was \nyesterday, or maybe the day before--said there was no basis for my \nassertion that there was actionable intelligence gained from the so-\ncalled enhanced interrogation techniques, and questioned what my source \nwas.\n  I would remind the distinguished Senator from Illinois that the \nsource is President Obama's Director of National Intelligence, Dennis \nBlair, who wrote, on April 16, 2009, that ``high-value information came \nfrom interrogations in which these methods were used, and provided a \ndeeper understanding of the al Qaeda organization that was attacking \nthis country.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter in which the \nDirector of National Intelligence made those statements be printed in \nthe Record following my comments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. CORNYN. Nor was this special information available to only a few. \nThe New York Times reported it on April 21, under the headline ``Banned \nTechniques Yielded `High-Value information', Memo Says.'' That is a \nstory in the New York Times which basically recounts what the Director \nof National Intelligence said.\n  I would remind my distinguished colleague from Illinois that it is, \nin fact, the Director of National Intelligence for President Obama who \nhas affirmed not just the need but the usefulness of the information \nand intelligence derived from these enhanced interrogation techniques \nthat were approved by the legal authority for the executive branch of \nthe Federal Government, the Office of Legal Counsel.\n  My colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin, argues that we need to \nallow prosecutors to follow the facts and the law wherever they may \nlead--certainly, a relatively harmless assertion; one I would generally \nagree with. But here, we know enough about the facts and the law to \nknow there is no evidence that anyone acted with the intent required to \nprosecute under the law. I won't bore the Senate with an analysis of \nwhat the criminal law requires in this context, but I would say that \nthe facts, as we know them, are to give our public servants the benefit \nof the doubt. As detailed in the Office of Legal Counsel memoranda, \nsignificant efforts were made to minimize significant harm that could \narise from these techniques. Who could question the desire of both the \nintelligence community as well as the Department of Justice and the \nleaders responsible for protecting our national security--who could \nquestion the good-faith need to get information that would actually \nhelp prevent follow-on terrorist attacks?\n\n  We know al-Qaida, on September 11, 2001, used crude weapons to attack \nour country. Yet they were able to kill 3,000 Americans, roughly. Our \nintelligence community and our national leadership knew al-Qaida was \nnot satisfied with such primitive weapons but, indeed, was seeking \nbiological, chemical or nuclear weapons. We know how important it was \nfor our intelligence officials to get the information they needed. We \nknow the lawyers at the Office of Legal Counsel who rendered this legal \nadvice were doing what they thought was their responsibility in good \nfaith. Indeed, the Members of Congress who had the responsibility to \nperform congressional oversight on these activities, I believe, \ndemonstrated their good-faith desire to do what was necessary to \nprotect our country. I believe we know enough to\n\n[[Page S5777]]\n\nsay these people--all of them--acted in good faith.\n  It has been suggested the standard we apply is whether the advice \nfell within the range of legitimate analysis and within the range of \nreasonable disagreement common to legal analysis of important statutory \nand constitutional questions. I believe that has been demonstrated, and \nbut for this technical objection to the amendment, I am confident we \nwould receive an overwhelming bipartisan vote of support for this \nsense-of-the-Senate resolution.\n  The distinguished Senator from Illinois, Senator Durbin, says we \nshould allow prosecutors and the Department of Justice to decide \nwhether to bring a case against these officials: The intelligence \ncommunity, the lawyers who drafted the legal advice, and perhaps even \nthe Members of Congress who acquiesced and facilitated these enhanced \ninterrogation techniques following a classified briefing. But I would \nsuggest there is no case to be brought against these individuals. Any \nprosecution that arises out of this interrogation program would clearly \nbe based upon politics and not on the law.\n  I would submit the amendment I have offered--and that I described and \nwhich I will reoffer again at an appropriate time--is a call for \nreasonableness and national unity. The calls for prosecution of good-\nfaith patriots has simply gone too far. When bloggers and others--not \nto single out bloggers but even Members of this body--have suggested \nthat we somehow need a truth commission and have suggested that \nprosecutions might be the appropriate outcome, when they are suggesting \nthat prosecutions under these circumstances occur, then I think our \npolitical environment has changed in a dangerous way and one which will \ncertainly chill our intelligence officials in gathering actual \nintelligence necessary to keep us safe and certainly discourage \npatriots who want to serve and who are willing to serve in Government. \nWhen policy differences become criminalized in ways that some have \nsuggested, it is not helpful to our country. Indeed, I think it is \ndangerous to our national security.\n  We know there is an unfortunate history of hysterias, panics, and mob \nrule from time to time that occurs, whether it is from Salem through \nthe McCarthy era. When justice is steered by passion and politics \nrather than by reason and the rule of law, it is not worthy of the name \n``justice.'' Once you stir up an angry mob, we know it is unpredictable \nwhere that mob might lead or who might get caught up in the mob's \naction. But we know already too many patriotic Americans have been \ntargeted by the present hysteria. This amendment calls for an end to \nthe hysteria and a return to reason, civility, national unity, and the \nrule of law.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                       Director of\n\n\n                                        National Intelligence,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 16, 2009.\n       Dear Colleagues: Today is a difficult one for those of us \n     who serve the country in its intelligence services. An \n     article on the front page of The New York Times claims that \n     the National Security Agency has been collecting information \n     that violates the privacy and civil liberties of American \n     citizens. The release of documents from the Department of \n     Justice's Office of Legal Counsel (OLC) spells out in detail \n     harsh interrogation techniques used by CIA officers on \n     suspected al Qa'ida terrorists.\n       As the leader of the Intelligence Community, I am trying to \n     put these issues into perspective. We cannot undo the events \n     of the past; we must understand them and turn this \n     understanding to advantage as we move into the future.\n       It is important to remember the context of these past \n     events. All of us remember the horror of 9/11. For months \n     afterwards we did not have a clear understanding of the enemy \n     we were dealing with, and our every effort was focused on \n     preventing further attacks that would kill more Americans. It \n     was during these months that the CIA was struggling to obtain \n     critical information from captured al Qa'ida leaders, and \n     requested permission to use harsher interrogation methods. \n     The OLC memos make clear that senior legal officials judged \n     the harsher methods to be legal, and that senior policymakers \n     authorized their use. High value information came from \n     interrogations in which those methods were used and provided \n     a deeper understanding of the al Qa'ida organization that was \n     attacking this country. As the OLC memos demonstrate, from \n     2002 through 2006 when the use of these techniques ended, the \n     leadership of the CIA repeatedly reported their activities \n     both to Executive Branch policymakers and to members of \n     Congress, and received permission to continue to use the \n     techniques.\n       Those methods, read on a bright, sunny, safe day in April \n     2009, appear graphic and disturbing. As the President has \n     made clear, and as both CIA Director Panetta and I have \n     stated, we will not use those techniques in the future. I \n     like to think I would not have approved those methods in the \n     past, but I do not fault those who made the decisions at that \n     time, and I will absolutely defend those who carried out the \n     interrogations within the orders they were given.\n       Even in 2009 there are organizations plotting to kill \n     Americans using terror tactics, and although the memories of \n     9/11 are becoming more distant, we in the intelligence \n     services must stop them. One of our most effective tools in \n     discovering groups planning to attack us are their \n     communications, and it is the job of the NSA to intercept \n     them. The NSA does this vital work under legislation that was \n     passed by the Congress. The NSA actions are subject to \n     oversight by my office and by the Justice Department under \n     court-approved safeguards; when the intercepts are conducted \n     against Americans, it is with individual court orders. Under \n     these authorities the officers of the National Security \n     Agency collect large amounts of international \n     telecommunications, and under strict rules review and analyze \n     some of them. These intercepts have played a vital role in \n     many successes we have had in thwarting terrorist attacks \n     since 9/11.\n       On occasion. NSA has made mistakes and intercepted the \n     wrong communications. The numbers of these mistakes are very \n     small in terms of our overall collection efforts, but each \n     one is investigated, Congress and the courts are notified, \n     corrective measures are taken, and improvements are put in \n     place to prevent reoccurrences.\n       As a young Navy officer during the Vietnam years, I \n     experienced public scorn for those of us who served in the \n     Armed Forces during an unpopular war. Challenging and \n     debating the wisdom and policies linked to wars and \n     warfighting is important and legitimate; however, disrespect \n     for those who serve honorably within legal guidelines is not. \n     I remember well the pain of those of us who served our \n     country even when the policies we were carrying out were \n     unpopular or could be second-guessed.\n       We in the Intelligence Community should not be subjected to \n     similar pain. Let the debate focus on the law and our \n     national security. Let us be thankful that we have public \n     servants who seek to do the difficult work of protecting our \n     country under the explicit assurance that their actions are \n     both necessary and legal.\n       There will almost certainly be more media articles about \n     the actions of intelligence agencies in the past, and as we \n     do our vital work of protecting the country we will make \n     mistakes that will also be reported. What we must do is make \n     it absolutely clear to the American people that our ethos is \n     to act legally, in as transparent a manner as we can, and in \n     a way that they would be proud of if we could tell them the \n     full story,\n       It is my job, and the job of our national leaders, to \n     ensure that the work done by the Intelligence Community is \n     appreciated and supported. You can be assured the President \n     knows this and is supporting us. It is your responsibility to \n     continue the difficult, often dangerous and vital work you \n     are doing every day.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Dennis C. Blair.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I am going to turn to another subject, but \nmay I inquire how much time is remaining under the unanimous consent \nagreement?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 27 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I assure the Chair I will not use all that time.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to discuss another very serious challenge in \nour country and that is how to reform our broken health care system to \nserve the needs of the American people and to help bring down the costs \nof health care, which now prices many people out of the market and \ncontributes to the too large number of Americans who don't have health \ninsurance.\n  I am a relatively new member of the Senate Finance Committee, and \nunder the leadership of Senator Baucus and Senator Grassley, we have \nbeen discussing our various policy options for some time. There has \nbeen some discussion on the floor about the subject. Indeed, my \ncolleagues from Oklahoma and North Carolina, Senator Burr and Dr. \nCoburn, have introduced a bill which they believe addresses the need \nfor health care reform in a significant way.\n  On Monday, I am going to return to my State of Texas and travel \naround the State to basically talk about commonsense solutions to this \nhealth care crisis. Last Monday, I spent some time in Houston, TX, with \nthe Houston Wellness Association and others concerned about how we can \nspend more of\n\n[[Page S5778]]\n\nour energy and effort on keeping people healthy and preventing disease \nwhich will, of course, avoid unnecessary human suffering but also help \nus contain the too high price of health care.\n  We know what is at stake in the health care reform debate. I believe \nmy constituents in Texas--and I believe the American people, \ngenerally--don't want to be served up a fait accompli in Washington. \nThey don't want to wake in July or August and find that Congress has \ntaken a blank sheet of paper and basically deprived them of the \nopportunity to keep the health care they presently have and instead \npresent them with something else which they don't want and which does \nnot promise to make health care more accessible but, rather, will make \nit more expensive and less accessible. I know my constituents in Texas \ndon't want elites in Washington to make decisions for them. They want \nto be informed about the debate, and they want to then discuss with me \nand their other elected representatives what they want--not what is \ndictated to them from Washington inside the beltway.\n  Whether you are putting together a family budget or a business plan, \nwe all see the same problem, and that is the rising cost of health \ncare. We know health care costs have risen faster than inflation in \nboth good times and bad times. Health care costs, we know, force many \nself-employed workers and small businesses into the ranks of the \nuninsured. We also know that health care costs in America are twice as \nmuch per capita than they are in most of the developed world. In fact, \nwe spend roughly 17 percent of our gross domestic product on health \ncare. I believe the next highest country to us is Japan, an \nindustrialized country, which spends roughly 9 percent of GDP.\n  But we also know there are a lot of hidden costs--there are not just \nthe obvious costs--on families and businesses. These hidden costs show \nup in smaller paychecks for working men and women all across this \ncountry. All things being equal, one would think that rising \nproductivity of the American worker would lead to higher wages, but \ninstead, for many workers, more compensation takes the form of higher \nhealth care premiums, when they could be receiving greater compensation \nin terms of wages that they could then spend on other purposes. But \nbecause of rising deductibles, copays, and the rising costs, we see \nrising health care costs actually squeeze worker pay in America such \nthat, in many instances, that pay is stagnant, if not declining.\n  Hidden costs also show up in the $36 trillion of unfunded liabilities \nin the Medicare Program, as well as other entitlements. Our people are \nconcerned about the hidden costs of all the borrowing we are doing in \nWashington and the unprecedented spending. Nearly 50 cents on every \ndollar spent in Washington is borrowed, leaving the fiscal \nresponsibility for our children and grandchildren and not taking it \nupon ourselves.\n  In fact, as we know, the Federal deficit in 2009 will be nearly as \nlarge as the entire Federal budget was in 2001. Let me say that again. \nThis is staggering. The Federal deficit in 2009 will be nearly as large \nas the entire Federal budget in 2001. As the distinguished occupant of \nthe chair, who is the former chief executive of his State, the \nCommonwealth of Virginia, knows, that kind of growth cannot be \nsustained indefinitely. Indeed, we are cruising for a disaster when it \ncomes to unrestrained health care costs, both for individuals and for \nsmall businesses but also for the Government when it comes to \nentitlement spending.\n  I agree with what President Obama said last week. He said our current \ndeficit spending is unsustainable. I agree with that. He said we are \nmortgaging our children's future with more and more debt. I think all \nAmericans agree with what President Obama said, but we have yet to see \nthe hard decisions that would lead us back to a path of fiscal \ndiscipline. It is the contrary: more spending, more borrowing, with no \nfiscal discipline. As we look at health care reform, our people want \nsolutions that will lower the costs of health care, without increasing \nthe debt, without raising taxes, and without reducing quality or access \nto care.\n  I have heard a lot of discussions in the context of the Finance \nCommittee, talking about what options are available to the Congress in \ndealing with this health care crisis and, honestly, most of them deal \nwith how we can empower the Government to make more and more decisions \non behalf of patients. I think that is the opposite direction from \nwhich we ought to go to approach this problem. We ought to look at what \nputs patients back in charge; what gives individuals the power to \nconsult with their own private physician and make a decision; what is \nin the best interests of themselves and their family when it comes to \nhealth care. Let's not put barriers in the way of that sacred \nrelationship between a patient and a doctor, and for sure let's not use \nrationing--denying and delaying access to care--as government-run \nprograms abroad use in order to control costs.\n  Let's put patients back in charge. That ought to be our battle cry as \nwe approach this current crisis.\n  Patients should have more control, not less control, over their own \nhealth care. One way we can do that is giving them more and better \ninformation on cost and quality of their care. How in the world can we \nhave an effective market for health care, which will provide lower \ncosts, if, in fact, patients are denied access to information about \ncost and outcomes? They not only want to know how much it is going to \ncost them; they want to make sure it is a good, quality service, and we \nought to be in the business of providing them that information. We \nought to be insisting, as their elected representatives, that we have \naccess to that information in deciding how to spend their money in \nentitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Patients should \nalso, I believe, have a choice of providers who compete for their \nbusiness. We know that competition produces higher quality, better \nservice, and a lower price. We can see that across the board. When the \nmarket helps discipline spending, it improves quality and lowers price. \nWe can do that in health care by empowering individuals and giving them \nmore access to information, greater transparency, quality, and price, \nmaking them better informed consumers.\n  We also know our tax and our legal system need reform so all \nAmericans are treated fairly. We have to end the cost shifting that now \ngoes with too low reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid, which \nmeans it is harder and harder for an individual to find a doctor who \nwill actually accept those submarket rates to care for them.\n  I was in Dallas a couple years ago. I was in an emergency room at a \nhospital, while touring the hospital, and there was this wonderful \nwoman who came into the emergency room and someone asked her what she \nwanted. She said: I need my prescriptions refilled--in the emergency \nroom at a hospital in Dallas. She couldn't find a doctor who would \naccept her as a new Medicare patient, so the only place she knew where \nto go was to the emergency room to get a prescription, to refill her \nmedications. That is incredibly inefficient and an incredibly costly \nway to deliver health care. We have to find a way to do it better.\n  Right now we know that for private health insurance, the costs are \nshifted in order for health care providers to provide care to \neverybody. That cost shifting results in higher premiums, smaller \npaychecks, tax increases, and more public debt, and we ought to attack \nit head-on.\n  We also know from experience that putting patients in charge can \nlower health care costs. At the Federal level, believe it or not, we \nactually have a Federal program that, contrary to intuition and some \npeople's skepticism, actually demonstrates this.\n  This is a success of Medicare Part D, the prescription drug program. \nMedicare Part D gives seniors choices among entirely private plans, \nwith no government-run plan at all, no ``public option'' at all. As a \nresult of the successes of Medicare Part D, seniors have seen program \ncosts that are 37 percent less than anticipated, and more than 80 \npercent of seniors are satisfied with the program.\n  I think this example proves the point I was making earlier--that \ngreater access to information about quality and cost gives people more \nchoices, creates competition in a market that disciplines cost, and \nultimately brings down those costs and increases satisfaction.\n\n[[Page S5779]]\n\n  At the State level, good ideas for Medicaid reform have come from \nFlorida, South Carolina, Indiana, and other States. These programs have \ngiven some of the lowest income Americans more choices and more control \nover the dollars spent on their behalf. Again, costs are lower and \nparticipants are generally satisfied with these programs.\n  The private sector has some very good ideas as well. Steve Burd, of \nSafeway, has talked to many of us on both sides of the aisle about \ntheir successful experimenting with health care costs at their company \nby providing financial incentives to quit smoking, lose weight, \nexercise, control blood pressure and cholesterol, and get the \nappropriate diagnostic tests at a reasonable price.\n  There is also another successful program, and I am going to meet with \nexecutives and employees at Whole Foods, which is located in Austin, \nTX, where I live. Whole Foods has conducted a successful experiment \nwith high-deductible insurance plans with personal wellness accounts \nthat each employee controls. Whole Foods has seen fewer medical claims, \nlower prescription drug claims, and fewer hospital admissions through \nthis program.\n  So why in the world would we want to dictate a single-payer system \nout of Washington for 300 million people when we have seen successful \nexperiments and innovation across the country that we can learn from \nand adopt to empower patients and consumers, not Washington \nbureaucrats? Some, though, in Washington have simply given up on the \nprivate sector when it comes to delivering health care needs. They want \nto shift more power and control to the Federal Government. I think that \nis a terrible mistake.\n  We have heard ideas about how to increase spending to pay for more \nGovernment control, at a time when we already spend 17 percent of the \nGDP on health care--again, nearly twice as much as our next closest \ncompetitor in an industrialized nation, Japan--17 percent in the United \nStates compared to 9 percent in Japan, and other countries are far \nlower.\n  Raising taxes is simply a terrible idea, especially during a \nrecession. Raising taxes would also break the President's pledge he \nmade in the campaign last year when he assured Americans that no family \nmaking less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase--not \nyour income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital gains taxes, \nnot any of your taxes. But we can help the President keep his pledge--\nnot help him break it--by empowering patients and consumers, ordinary \nAmericans, to make their decisions and not empower bigger and bigger \ngovernment to take those decisions away from them and dictate them.\n  In the Finance Committee, we have heard a number of proposals that \nmay improve care but are not going to contain costs--at least according \nto the CBO. These proposals include what I would consider to be \ncommonsense approaches that I think are good, such as more health care \ntechnology and prevention initiatives. We have even seen a number of \ninterest groups, provider groups, appear with the President last week, \npledging they would cut the growth of health care costs, over the next \n10 years, $2 trillion. That all sounds good until you start looking at \nit and realize there is actually no enforcement mechanism at all. It is \na meaningless pledge, and there is going to continue to be upward \npressure on health care costs across the board unless we do something \nabout it.\n  Only in Washington, DC, would people embrace the notion that to save \nmoney, you have to spend more money. It is not just counterintuitive, \nit is unproven. I don't think there is any justification for that \nsuspicion. If there is, I would just love to see it. I don't think we \nought to take as a matter of blind faith that by spending over a \ntrillion dollars more of tax money on top of the 17 percent of GDP we \nare already spending now, that somehow miraculously, with the wave of a \nwand, by suspending our powers of disbelief, we are going to bend the \ncurve on the growth of health care costs, which are bankrupting the \ncountry when it comes to Medicare and putting health insurance and \nhealth care out of the reach of many hard-working Americans.\n  We have heard about some interesting ideas, such as comparative \neffectiveness research, which sounds good at first blush. In the \nstimulus plan, the Federal Government spent, or pledged, more than a \nmillion dollars on that. It sounds pretty good. Let's finds out what \nworks. Well, I am concerned that the Government will use this research \nto delay treatment and deny care. The way the Government contains \nhealth care costs is by rationing, pure and simple. That is what \nhappens in Medicare. I mentioned the woman in Dallas who couldn't find \na doctor to accept her as a new Medicare patient. It is because the \nGovernment reimburses at such a low rate. So we have a promise of \ncoverage, which everybody applauds, but it denies people access because \nthe Government denies and delays care by using rationing as a way to \ncontrol costs. We don't need that. Certainly, we don't need that, based \non the ``cookbook'' medicine prescribed by Government bureaucrats, who \nwill say: We will pay for this procedure but not that other procedure \nbecause it is not in our ``cookbook.'' Last week, Medicare refused to \npay for less-invasive colonoscopy procedures. I don't think the \nAmerican people are crying out for more Government control of their \nhealth care decisions based on cost-based decisions. That is what they \nwould get if the proponents of the so-called public plan get their way.\n  Again, I don't know who it is in Washington, DC--there must be a \nlittle group, a cabal of individuals sitting behind closed doors, that \ntries to think up innocuous names, such as ``public plan,'' for some \nreally scary stuff. A ``public plan'' is simply a Washington takeover \nof health care; it is plain and simple. It is not an option. In the \nend, it will be the only place you can go under a single-payer system.\n  We should take this pledge, too, Mr. President. We should guarantee \nthat Americans who currently have health insurance that they like ought \nto be able to keep it--that is about 85 percent--as we look for ways to \nincrease access for people who don't have health insurance. One think \ntank that looked at this so-called public plan--or Washington takeover \nof health care, which would drive all private competitors out of the \nmarket by undercutting them--estimated that 119 million Americans will \nlose their private health insurance if this Washington takeover, under \nthe title of ``public plan,'' is embraced.\n  We know the Federal Government is not a fair competitor. While it \nserves also as a regulator and a funder, the Federal Government says: \nTake it or leave it. It is price fixing. Nobody else can compete with \nthe Federal Government. The public plan, so-called, would simply shift \ncost to taxpayers and subsidize inefficiency, as Medicare and Medicaid \ndo today. They are broken systems that we don't need to emulate by \nmaking Medicare for all. Why would we emulate Medicare when it is \nbroken and on an unsustainable financial path? We need new ideas and \ninnovations that put the people in charge and will help bring down \ncosts. Greater transparency, more choices, and market forces will \nincrease satisfaction while bringing down costs.\n  There is another scary concept out there that is called a ``pay or \nplay'' mandate for employers. When I talk to small businesses in Texas, \nthey tell me one of their most difficult decisions is how do they \nprovide health care for their employees in small businesses? It is hard \nto get affordable health insurance. Some in Washington are proposing \ntaking this to what I would call a ``mandate on steroids.'' Basically, \nit would say that if a small business doesn't provide health insurance \ncoverage for its employees, it is going to have to pay a punitive tax. \nThat is why they call it ``pay or play.'' New mandates on job creators \nwould do nothing but head us in the wrong direction during a recession, \nwhere we are fighting the best we can in the private sector to create \nnew jobs and retain the ones we have. We know the costs of this ``pay \nor play'' mandate are going to ultimately be passed down to the workers \nin the form of lower wages, just as they are today under a broken \nsystem.\n\n  I have heard good ideas about health care reform. I hope we will have \na robust debate about the options available to the American people to \nfix this broken system. I have to tell you that many proposals out \nthere that seem to be gathering momentum are deeply troubling. As I \nhave said, I believe the\n\n[[Page S5780]]\n\nbest way to approach health care reform--indeed, governance generally--\nis from the bottom up, not the top down.\n  We need to take our time and get this right and not, in our haste, \nproduce a bad bill that will even deny people the choices and coverage \nthey have now. We need to listen to the people who are running small \nbusinesses and raising families across this country. That is what I \nplan to do in Texas next week. I hope my colleagues will take advantage \nof the next week's recess to do likewise.\n  This is too important to get done wrong. Let's take our time and \nlisten to the stakeholders and people who will suffer the negative \nconsequences if we get it wrong, and let's work together with President \nObama and the administration to try to get it right.\n  I thank the Chair. I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent that the time be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1189\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I now have 20 cosponsors of amendment \nNo. 1189. I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Klobuchar, Senator \nCardin, Senator Ben Nelson, Senator Brownback, Senator Roberts, Senator \nGrassley, Senator Burr, Senator Johanns, and Senator Schumer as \ncosponsors of amendment No. 1189.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I add these cosponsors because more \nand more of our Senators are learning what has happened to these \ndealerships that have been notified by Chrysler that they have 3 weeks \nto completely dissolve a business that has been part of a community for \n20 years, 30 years, up to 90 years. The oldest car dealership in Texas \nis 90 years old--a grandfather, father, and now a son running that car \ndealership. They were noticed 3 weeks from May 14 that dealership will \nbe closed.\n  Just to give a view of what the dealers received on May 14 and why \nthese 789 who received this notice are so concerned is because the \nletter they were sent says:\n\n       As a result of its recent bankruptcy filing, Chrysler is \n     unable to repurchase your new vehicle inventory. As a result \n     of the recent bankruptcy filing, Chrysler is unable to \n     purchase your Mopar parts inventory. And furthermore, as a \n     result of the bankruptcy filing, Chrysler is unable to \n     purchase your essential special tools.\n\n  After 90 years of operating a Chrysler dealership, a company is now \ntold they will have no ability after 3 weeks to sell a Chrysler \nautomobile, nor will there be a guarantee for repurchase.\n  What my amendment does, which now has 20 very bipartisan cosponsors, \nis to say: Give these dealers 3 more weeks. Give them 3 more weeks to \nhave an orderly transition out of a company. There are estimated to be \n40,000 employees of these Chrysler dealerships who received 3 weeks' \nnotice--40,000. We are dealing with so many issues in these auto \nmanufacturer closings, the bankruptcies. We all want the auto \nmanufacturers to stay in business. We do. The Government is making a \nhuge investment in that hope. But the group that is getting nothing \nright now is the dealers.\n  The dealers also are the group that has done nothing that caused this \nproblem in the first place. They did not design the cars, they did not \nmanufacture the cars, but they did buy them. There is no cost to the \ncompany that manufactures because these dealerships have purchased \nthese cars. They have purchased the parts. They have purchased the \nspecial tools to do the repairs. Yet now they are being told they \ncannot sell, they cannot repair and, oh, by the way: We are not going \nto guarantee you will have your parts and inventory bought. This is \njust not right. That is why there are 20 cosponsors to this amendment, \nand it is growing by the hour.\n  I submit for the Record a letter that Senator Rockefeller wrote to \nthe chief executive officer, Robert Nardelli, in which he, too, is \nprotesting the egregious timeframe and terms of these franchise \nterminations which he said ``seem unprecedented to me.''\n  As you know, most auto dealers have a few months of inventory of new \nvehicles on their lots, though some may have up to 6-months' worth. \nThis means if the dealers stopped adding cars to their inventories last \nweek when GM and Chrysler announced their decisions, they would still \nbe able to sell cars for 6 months before they run out.\n  But Chrysler is saying they will not buy back this inventory or even \nparts and instead has arranged for the remaining dealers to buy the \nunsold cars from dealers set to lose their franchises. But there is no \nguarantee of that. Right now it is just a hope.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n           Transportation,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 2009.\n     Robert Nardelli,\n     Chief Executive Officer, Chrysler LLC, Auburn Hills, MI.\n     Fritz Henderson,\n     Chief Executive Officer, General Motors Corporation, Detroit, \n         MI.\n       Dear Mr. Nardelli and Mr. Henderson: I am writing to \n     express my deep concern with Chrysler's and General Motors' \n     (GM) recent announcements to terminate franchise agreements \n     with 789 and roughly 1,100, respectively, automobile \n     dealerships across this country and to urge both of you to \n     reconsider these decisions. It is my belief that we must work \n     to keep as many of these businesses open as possible, and at \n     the very least assist these dealerships, the employees, and \n     their loyal customers transition as we move forward in this \n     process.\n       Between Chrysler and GM, it appears that approximately \n     100,000 jobs nationally are at risk as a result of the \n     dealership closings. In West Virginia, 17 of 24 Chrysler \n     dealerships have been told their franchises will end on June \n     9, 2009, while a publicly undisclosed number of GM franchises \n     were notified that their agreements will stop in October \n     2010. This puts hundreds, if not thousands, of employees' \n     jobs at risk and will have a crippling impact on local \n     communities across the State as less tax revenue will likely \n     translate into cuts in important and much needed government \n     services, especially during these challenging economic times.\n       The egregious timeframe and terms of these franchise \n     terminations seem unprecedented to me. As you both know, most \n     auto dealers have a few months of inventory of new vehicles \n     on their lots, though some may have up to six-months worth. \n     This means if the dealers stopped adding cars to their \n     inventories last week when GM and Chrysler announced their \n     decisions, they would still be able to sell cars for six \n     months before they run out. From what I have been told, \n     Chrysler will not buy back this inventory of vehicles or even \n     parts and instead has arranged for the remaining dealers to \n     buy the unsold cars from dealers set to lose their \n     franchises. So come June 10th, terminated dealers will only \n     be able to sell that inventory to remaining dealers, likely \n     at substantial losses since they may well have backlogs of \n     inventory themselves. While GM has at this point agreed to \n     allow its terminated dealers to continue to sell vehicles \n     until October 2010, I am concerned that this deadline will be \n     moved up if GM enters bankruptcy as many expect.\n       Such franchises face a similar situation when it comes to \n     large inventories of parts and manufacturer-related tools. \n     From discussions with these dealership owners, it appears \n     that some of this inventory may have been accepted as a \n     result of manufacturer pressure to purchase additional, \n     unneeded stock, possibly in order to help the companies avoid \n     bankruptcy. Now these dealerships will likely have no other \n     alternative but to sell their stock of parts and tools to \n     surviving dealers for pennies on what they paid.\n       I am also worried about the negative impacts of your \n     companies' decisions on consumers who have warranties and \n     service contracts, especially in rural areas like West \n     Virginia. Many families have consistently bought cars from \n     the same dealership in their local community and have built \n     long-term relationships with the dealership's owner. Now \n     these West Virginians will be forced to travel unreasonable \n     distances due to the local dealership having their franchise \n     agreement terminated. In some cases, customers will be in the \n     untenable position of having to drive over an hour to simply \n     have their cars serviced and their warranties honored.\n       While I understand that as part of GM's and Chrysler's \n     restructurings you may need to examine your dealership \n     contracts, I urge you to reconsider your decisions to \n     terminate these franchise agreements. As two companies that \n     have received billions of dollars in Troubled Assets Relief \n     Program (TARP) funding, I would hope at the very least that \n     Chrysler will establish a more reasonable transition period \n     that will allow its terminated franchises to stay open beyond \n     June 9th. I would also hope that regardless of whether it \n     enters bankruptcy, GM will honor its commitment to allow \n     terminated dealers to remain open until October 2010.\n\n[[Page S5781]]\n\n     Both of these actions would permit dealerships to sell most \n     of the inventory of their vehicles, parts, and tools; \n     maintain their used vehicle businesses and service and repair \n     centers; allow consumers to continue to have access to \n     quality service and the honoring of warranties and service \n     contracts; and keep job losses to an absolute minimum.\n       Thank you for your urgent attention to these important \n     matters. I look forward to receiving prompt responses from \n     you both.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           John D. Rockefeller IV.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Senator Rockefeller is concerned, as many of us are, \nthat the dealers are the roadkill in this, and they are also the people \nwho have run successful businesses. They have sold the cars. They have \nemployees. They have investments in the community. In many instances, \nthese are the largest employers in the community. They support the high \nschool football program. They support the community charitable events. \nWe are not only knocking out 40,000 employees, we are not only knocking \nout the people who have given their faith and loyalty to this brand, \nbut we are knocking out a huge chunk of community activism and \nvolunteer service to the many communities affected by these closings.\n  I talked with the president of Chrysler this morning, and I believe \nhe sincerely is trying to save the company, and we want him to do that. \nBut it has been half a day, and I have not seen a progress report that \nwe will be able to come back to the floor and say these dealers are \ngoing to get some help from Chrysler.\n  The President says he wants to help. But I think it is time now that \nwe get some sense of what help is. If it is purchasing the inventory, \ngetting the financing for the new and ongoing dealerships that will \nstay in business, we need to know that. These dealers need to know it \nso they can plan. My goodness, it is now probably 2 weeks or so, until \nJune 9, and these people are having to plan for the orderly transition \nof their companies, hopefully not into bankruptcy, but many of them are \ngoing into bankruptcy.\n  I have been told some of these are Chrysler dealers, but they have \nother dealerships as well. The Chrysler dealership could bring down the \nongoing one. I think it is time for the Government that is trying to \nhelp the manufacturers to say we need to help the dealers too. We do \nnot need to have a bailout for the dealers, but we do need to give them \ntime to have their orderly transition or give them credit possibilities \nwith the dealerships that are going to stay in business and have them \ntake the inventory. That would be the logical thing to do. But we need \na commitment.\n  The 20 cosponsors of this amendment, when they hear from their \ndealers and they hear what is happening, want answers and they want \nanswers before this bill leaves the floor. I hope I can give a better \nresult than I have gotten so far today from the White House and from \nChrysler that something is coming together. I think everyone has the \nright goal. We need to work together to achieve that goal.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arkansas.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Honoring Our Military\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I think a lot of folks are looking \ntoward the weekend. It is a holiday weekend. I know I am reflecting on \nthat holiday weekend. I hope others are as well because on this \nMemorial Day, families in communities throughout Arkansas, our great \nState, and across our great Nation will gather to recognize the service \nof our men and women in uniform and to honor those who have paid the \nultimate sacrifice in the name of freedom.\n  My father and both of my grandfathers were infantrymen who proudly \nand honorably served our Nation. They taught me from a very early age \nabout the sacrifices of our troops, their experiences, the sacrifices \nof our troops and their families and what they have done to keep our \nNation free.\n  Throughout my Senate career, I have consistently fought for \ninitiatives that provide our military servicemembers, our veterans, and \ntheir families the benefits they have earned and deserve. That is why \nin advance of Memorial Day, which is right before us, I have authored a \nseries of bills to honor our troops and their families.\n  My first legislative proposal calls for educational benefits that \nbetter reflect the service and commitment of our guardsmen and \nreservists. This legislation is endorsed by the Military Coalition, a \ngroup of about 34 military veterans and uniformed service \norganizations, with over 5.5 million members. I am pleased that my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Crapo of Idaho, with whom I routinely \njoin in a bipartisan way on a whole host of issues--we came to the \nHouse together, and we came to the Senate together. He is a good friend \nand good working partner on behalf of substantive issues. He has joined \nme in cosponsoring this bill.\n  Unfortunately, educational benefits for the members of our Selected \nReserve have simply not kept pace with their increased service or the \nrising cost of higher education. These men and women serve a critical \nrole on our behalf, and we must make an appropriate investment in them.\n  In Arkansas and across the country, Americans are well aware of the \nreality that our military simply could not function without the \nthousands of men and women at armories and bases in our communities who \ncontinually train and prepare for future mobilizations and who work to \nensure other members of their units are qualified and ready to deploy \nwhen called upon.\n  My legislation would tie educational benefit rates for guardsmen and \nreservists to the national average cost of tuition standard that is \nalready applied to Active-Duty educational benefit rates. This builds \nupon my total force GI bill, first introduced in 2006, which was \ndesigned to better reflect a comprehensive total force concept that \nensures members of the Selected Reserve receive the educational \nbenefits that are more commensurate with their increased service.\n  The final provisions of this legislation became law last year with \nthe signing of the 21st-century GI bill. In addition, the National \nGuard and Reserve have been and will continue to be an operational \nforce serving overseas, and as such they require greater access to \nhealth care so that members can achieve a readiness standard demanded \nby current deployment cycles.\n  Far too many men and women are declared nondeployable because they \nhave not received the medical and dental care they need to maintain \ntheir readiness before they are called up. This can cause disruption in \ntheir unit by requiring last-minute replacements from other units or \nrequiring treatment during periods that are set aside for much needed \ntraining and experience they need to gain before they are deployed.\n  Compounding the challenge is the fact that short-notice deployments \noccur regularly within the National Guard. The Department of Defense \ncan and should do more to bring our Selected Reserve members into a \nconstant state of medical readiness for the benefit of the entire \nforce.\n  My bill, the Selected Reserve Continuum of Care Act, would better \nensure that health assessments for guardsmen and reservists are \nfollowed by Government treatment to correct any medical or dental \nreadiness deficiencies discovered at their health screenings.\n  This legislation is endorsed by the National Guard Association of the \nUnited States, the Association of the United States Army, the \nAssociation of the United States Navy, the Enlisted Association of the \nNational Guard of the United States, the Reserve Officers Association, \nthe Retired Enlisted Association, the U.S. Army Warrant Officers \nAssociation, and the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States.\n  I also thank Senators Landrieu and Burris for their support in \ncosponsoring this bill as well.\n  Lastly, a bill I have introduced today, the Veterans Survivors \nFairness Act, would enhance dependency and indemnity compensation \nbenefits of survivors of severely disabled veterans and increase access \nto benefits for more families. In doing so, it would address inequities \nin the VA's DIC program by doing three things. First, it would increase \nthe basic DIC rate so it is equivalent to the rate paid to survivors of \nFederal civilian employees. It also would provide a graduated scale of \nbenefits so many survivors are no longer\n\n[[Page S5782]]\n\ndenied benefits because of an arbitrary eligibility restriction. \nLastly, it would allow surviving spouses who remarry after the age of \n55 to retain their DIC benefits.\n\n  This legislation, cosponsored by my good friend, Senator Herb Kohl of \nWisconsin, is endorsed by the Disabled American Veterans, the \nAssociation of the United States Navy, the Military Officers \nAssociation of America, the National Guard Association of the United \nStates, the National Military Family Association, and the Reserve \nOfficers Association. It is not coincidental that these two measures \nare supported so heavily by our military associations. It is because \nthey are much needed and it is because they are so deserved. Beyond \nthese three bills, veterans health care continues to be on the top of \nmy priority list. I have worked with my colleagues to make substantial \ninvestments to increase patient travel reimbursement, improve services \nfor mental health care, and reduce the backlog of benefit claims.\n  Access to the Veterans' Administration health system is absolutely \ncritical, but too often it is quite challenging, particularly for our \nveterans who live in the rural areas of our Nation. For these veterans, \namong the other initiatives I have championed, I have championed \nlegislation with my friend and colleague, Senator Jon Tester of \nMontana, that will increase the mileage reimbursement rate for veterans \nwhen they go to see a doctor at a VA medical facility and will \nauthorize transportation grants for Veterans Service Organizations to \nprovide better transportation service in rural areas.\n  I have been to areas in southern Arkansas, very far from Little \nRock--3, 3\\1/2\\ hours' travel--visiting with veterans down there who \nare in dire need of access to that VA medical care. Yet their ability \nto get there was hampered by the fact that they were only reimbursed \none way; not to mention the fact that their reimbursement was so low--\nso far below what a Federal employee gets reimbursed--it was \nuneconomical and almost prohibitive in getting them there.\n  As Memorial Day approaches, I hope all my colleagues will remember, \nand I would like to encourage them and all Arkansans, to take the time \nto honor our servicemembers, veterans, and their families. Never miss \nan opportunity to thank someone in uniform. Our troops are worthy of \nour appreciation, and we should come together as a nation to show them \nwith our words and our deeds that we stand with them as they serve our \ninterests at home and abroad. As we all gather in preparation of a \nrecess break, I hope we will all remember the reason we have this \nbreak, the reason we celebrate this holiday.\n  Those of us who have military in our family, those of us who do not, \nit doesn't matter, we all enjoy the freedoms of this great country, and \nit is critically important that we show that not only on Memorial Day \nbut each day of the year. The opportunity we have as legislators to \nhonor our men and women in uniform, to support them with legislation \nthat is meaningful to their lives, to their service, and to their \nfamilies is absolutely essential. I encourage all my colleagues to look \nat the legislation I have offered, along with several of our \ncolleagues, and encourage them to join me as we begin this Memorial Day \nbreak coming up next week and to remember why we celebrate, why we \ncelebrate this Nation and these freedoms. It is because of the men and \nwomen in uniform who have served so bravely, and for those who have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice, that we enjoy this great land and these \nfreedoms and rights that we do enjoy in this great country.\n  Before concluding, I would like to add a couple other notes. I \ncouldn't help but hear the comments of my colleague from Texas, and I \nwish to join her in her frustration for so many of our small and \nfamily-owned businesses across our State--our automobile dealers--that, \nfor generations and generations, have passed down in their families a \nsmall business that they have worked very hard to keep afloat, to keep \nbusy, to keep healthy, and to keep alive for future generations. My \nhope is that we will have the assistance and the working relationship \nwith both the Treasury and the Chrysler Corporation and GM and others \nto better understand how we make that transition as reliable and \ncertainly as palatable to those individuals and their families and \nsmall businesses as we possibly can. I look forward to working with the \nSenator from Texas and with other Senators as well as we move forward \nin that effort.\n  Last, but not least, I would like to also mention and extend my \ncongratulations to our newest ``American Idol,'' Arkansas' own Kris \nAllen, who represented our State so well over the past few months in \nthe ``American Idol'' television show, which has been so popular among \nso many people in this country.\n  Kris is a talented young man with a bright future ahead of him, and I \nlook forward to watching him build a very successful career. I join all \nArkansans when I say how proud we are of Kris, not only as a talented \nperformer but as a humble young man who embodies our Arkansas values of \nhard work, integrity, and conviction. We wish him all the best as we \nbegins this new phase of his life and career.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1138\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, do we need to set aside a pending \namendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. It is my understanding, Mr. President, that I have 20 \nminutes to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I would like to say a few words now and then reserve the \nremaining time.\n  Mr. President, I am going to speak on my amendment to S. 1054, and it \naddresses a large amount of money that has been added to the war \nsupplemental bill. In these times, it is, first of all, somewhat \nsurprising that we would take $108 billion and add it, unrelated to war \nsupplemental, to this spending bill. My amendment would strike $108 \nbillion from the current spending bill, and I would like to take a few \nminutes to explain exactly what my amendment does and what we are \nstriking.\n  The Chair and all my colleagues know these are very challenging \ntimes. We often refer to it as one of the worst economic crises we have \nhad. I think we and many Americans are concerned about how much we are \nspending, how much we are borrowing, and what that might mean in the \nnot-too-distant future as it relates to inflation and interest rates \nand higher taxes. I am hearing very often when I go back home: Enough \nis enough.\n  We have to remember, as we look at this amount of money that has been \nrequested, what happened to what we called the TARP funds. The last \nadministration asked us to come up with $700 billion to be used for a \nfinancial bailout because we were in a crisis, and the money was going \nto be used--and this was very clear--to buy toxic assets, nonperforming \nloans, here and around the world. It had to be done immediately or the \nworld financial system would collapse. Under that duress, Congress \napproved $700 billion--really, a trillion with interest, over time--but \nnone of the money was ever used as it was supposed to be used. We never \nbought any toxic assets. In fact, the money was used in different ways: \nto inject money into banks--even some banks that didn't want it; it has \nbeen used to make loans to General Motors and to Chrysler; and now we \nare talking about converting those loans to common shares so that the \nGovernment is owner of General Motors and Chrysler, as well as the AIG \ninsurance company and possibly part owners of many banks.\n  But the interesting part of this that relates to my amendment is that \nthis week I asked Secretary Geithner: What is going to happen when this \nmoney is repaid? Well, if it is repaid, he said, it will go into the \ngeneral fund, but the Treasury will maintain an authorization to take \nup to $700 billion from the\n\n[[Page S5783]]\n\ngeneral fund anytime from now on. It becomes a permanent slush fund for \nTreasury. So what we have done is made the Treasury Department \nappropriators. Anytime they want, they can appropriate up to $700 \nbillion.\n  That is, in effect, what we are doing with the International Monetary \nFund. Let me explain to my colleagues a lot of things I didn't know \nuntil I looked into this. The International Monetary Fund was set up to \nmake loans to nations; to help nations that might need money to get \nthrough a financial crisis. Many nations are involved, but we give them \n$10 billion as a kind of deposit to the fund. Currently, the IMF has \nthe authority to use that money continuously. But we also give them the \nright to draw another $55 billion from our Treasury at any time. In \neffect, the International Monetary Fund can appropriate $55 billion \nfrom the U.S. Treasury anytime it wants. They now have over $60 billion \nof our money that they can use all over the world.\n  We can debate whether that is a good thing, but what the President \nhas asked for, and this bill provides, is an additional $100 billion \ncredit line, in effect, to the International Monetary Fund, and it ups \nour deposit another $8 billion. We are going to take another $8 billion \nand put it in the International Monetary Fund to be used. But then we \nmake appropriators out of the International Monetary Fund. We give them \na permanent credit line of an additional $100 billion that they can \nappropriate anytime they want around the world.\n  There are a lot of good things we would like to do as a country, as a \nCongress. We would love to improve our education system. There are a \nlot of challenges in health care. We have talked about our roads and \nbridges decaying. There are so many good things we would like to do \nthat we don't have the money for. How can we possibly tell an \nInternational Monetary Fund that they can take $100 billion anytime \nthey want from the U.S. Treasury if there is an emergency somewhere in \nthe world?\n  There will be emergencies in these times. The interesting issue we \nare not thinking about is we are going to have more and more crises \nhere at home. We know California is heavily in debt--over $20 billion. \nThey are talking about a financial collapse, as is New York and other \nStates. But the size of California's debt is only one-fifth of what we \nare giving the International Monetary Fund.\n  I don't think we have added up all of this. I am very concerned we \nare not considering how much money we are talking about. Let's put $108 \nbillion in context. I know some will come and say we are not spending \nthat amount of money, we are just authorizing it, which means it can be \nappropriated anytime, but we are not spending it. In fact, they took \nthe effort to get CBO to change the way it normally scores so this is \nnot spending. They are saying the risk is only like $5 billion. But the \nInternational Monetary Fund can take $100 billion out of our Treasury \nanytime it wants.\n  With the world situation the way it is, I think we are being very \nnaive to think it will not come out. We were told most of the TARP \nfunds would not be used. We used most of the TARP funds.\n  But let's think about this $100 billion. That is more than we spend \nas a Federal government on transportation all year. The 2010 budget for \ntransportation is $5 billion. It is more than we spend on education for \na whole year--$94 billion in our country. It is more than we spend on \nveterans' benefits. It is a lot of money. But very often we are talking \nabout our own services to our own people in this country for which we \ndo not have enough money. We need to remember the International \nMonetary Fund, while it may serve in theory a good purpose, people on \nthe board who decide how this money is used include countries that we \nsay are terrorists, such as Iran. Do we think Iran is going to help the \nUnited States when we are in trouble?\n  Let's look at our current situation. Our current national debt as a \ncountry is $11.2 trillion--more than any other country in the world. We \nare the most indebted country in the whole world. Our per capita debt \nis $37,000. Every man, woman and child in this country owes $37,000, \nbased on what we have already borrowed. But if you include Social \nSecurity and Medicare liabilities, our current expenditures will exceed \ntax revenues by $40 trillion over the next 75 years. Our debt is now 80 \npercent of our gross domestic product--80 percent of our total economy, \nwhich is the highest level since 1951.\n  The President's budget estimates that total debt relative to our \ntotal economy will rise 97 percent by 2010 and 100 percent thereafter. \nWe are going to have debt that is larger than our total economy in the \nnext year or two.\n  We currently owe $740 billion to the People's Republic of China and \nwe owe $635 billion to Japan and $186 billion to the oil exporters. \nKeep in mind, if the IMF does access this $108 billion, we will have to \nborrow it in order for them to get it, and we will have to pay interest \non that money. We will be told we will earn interest on any money that \nis borrowed, but we will likely pay even a higher interest rate in \norder to make that money available. When we do, we increase our debt \neven further.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I appreciate that. Let me ask the Senator, I think the \nSenator said this is a permanent fund, that we would be permanently \nreduced from this amount of money. Is the Senator aware this expires \nand is renewable every 5 years? That there is no permanency at all?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Does the Senator have that? I have the bill with me. It \nwould be a great help to point this out. Of course, 5 years, the \ndrawing of $100 billion anytime in the next 5 years is something we \nshould not even consider.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield further?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Is the Senator also aware it is not $100 billion, that CBO \nscored it at $5 billion and, in fact, the experience of our country is \nwe earn interest, we make money, and this is a winning proposition for \nthe country?\n  Mr. DeMINT. That is a little smoke and mirrors. If the Senator will \nallow me to read from page 104 of the bill, on line 4 it says:\n\n       Any payments made to the United States by the International \n     Monetary Fund as a repayment on account of the principal of a \n     loan made under this section shall continue to be available \n     for loans to the International Monetary Fund.\n\n  You may have a date somewhere on this, but that is pretty clear, that \nit will continue to be a draw.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if I could proceed further? In point of \nfact, it is limited, and it has to be repaid at the end of 5 years if \nit is not renewed.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Do you have the cite?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will further get that for the Senator.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I will answer the Senator on how much this costs. I think \nthe Senator is aware, as I said, our normal way of measuring costs was \nchanged for this bill. We are saying that, OK, if the International \nMonetary Fund accesses this money, it is just a loan so it is not a \ncost. But we have no guarantees it will get back. We say the \nInternational Monetary Fund has never lost money, but we have never \nbeen in these economic times before. We have never been in as much debt \nas a country. Can we afford, even if it is for the next 5 years, to \nhave an international group that can draw $100 billion from our \nTreasury at any point they want? Do we want to be in that position? We \nhave already given the Treasury Department a lot of credit to the \ngeneral fund for $700 billion--which the Secretary has basically said \nis going to continue--and now we are going to give another line of \ncredit to an international group in case there is a crisis around the \nworld when we are facing crises here at home?\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator further yield? I appreciate it.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, we need to equally apply the time now \nagainst both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nSouth Carolina has the floor.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I will yield the time in a minute and reserve the \nremainder of my time. I appreciate the comment of the Senator. I think \nwe should have open debate about this. I would like to talk a little \nbit more about this idea that a line of credit is not spending. We use \nthat a lot around here. We say we have authorized it but have not \nappropriated it yet. But what the language\n\n[[Page S5784]]\n\nof this bill does is it not only authorizes $108 billion of new money \nfor the International Monetary Fund, it gives them the power to \nappropriate it at any time. We may not call that spending around here, \nbut that is just political talk. If that money is taken from our \nTreasury, we have to borrow money to give it to them, and they may or \nmay not pay it back. We may say the International Monetary Fund has \nbeen stable for years, but part of the bill that is going through here \ntoday--the other side will say we have collateral, they have gold--but \npart of the bill here, and what my amendment strikes is, giving the \nInternational Monetary Fund the ability to sell over $12 billion worth \nof their gold, which is collateral supposedly for our money, in order \nto create more cash for them to lend around the world.\n  I am not saying the International Monetary Fund does not have a \nfunction. But we have already put at risk over $60 billion at a time \nwhen our country is struggling, at a time when it looks like we are \ngoing to triple the national debt over the next years, at a time when \nmany of our States are near bankruptcy, and at a time when we do not \nhave the money to fund the priorities such as health care and \ntransportation, energy research, health research that we are always \ntalking about. We need more money to do those things that are essential \nhere in America. How can we possibly, on a war supplemental bill, add \n$108 billion that is unrelated, basically extort the votes out of the \nMembers by forcing us to either vote against our troops or vote against \nthis reckless risk we are talking about taking?\n  It makes absolutely no sense in this crisis that we have talked about \nin this country to put ourselves at risk for another $108 billion, when \nwe don't even know how we are going to pay the interest on the money we \nhave already borrowed.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question on equal time?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I yield and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I will speak off the leader's time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I heard the Senator suggest that this is a \nreckless effort to put American money at risk somewhere else. I would \nlike to share with colleagues a letter written to the Speaker of the \nHouse and to the majority leader, saying:\n\n       We are writing to express support for the Administration's \n     request for prompt enactment of additional funding for the \n     International Monetary Fund.\n\n  This very fund. Let me tell you who the signatories are: former \nSecretary of State, Republican, Jim Baker; former Secretary of the \nTreasury, Republican, Nicholas Brady; former Secretary of Defense Frank \nCarlucci; former Republican Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson; \nformer Secretary of State Colin Powell; former chair of the Foreign \nRelations Committee in the House and now at the Woodrow Wilson \nInstitute, Lee Hamilton; former Secretary of State, Republican, Henry \nKissinger; former National Security Adviser Robert McFarlane; former \nTreasury Secretary, Republican, Paul O'Neill; General Brent Scowcroft, \nsecurity adviser to two Presidents. I mean, are these people reckless? \nAre they suggesting we do that because this is a reckless expenditure? \nLet's not be ridiculous.\n  The fact is, the Chamber of Commerce--I have a letter here and will I \nask unanimous consent the letter be printed in the Record.\n\n       To the Members of the United States Senate.\n       The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing more than 3 million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector and region, supports \n     legislation to strengthen the International Monetary Fund \n     included in . . . the supplemental appropriations bill \n     currently being considered by the full Senate. . . .\n       The worldwide economy is experiencing its worst downturn in \n     more than half a century. While American workers and \n     companies have been hit hard, the U.S. economic recovery may \n     be undermined by even more severe difficulties in some \n     emerging markets. It is squarely in the U.S. national \n     interest to support efforts to help these countries as they \n     confront the financial crisis.\n\n  They go on to say:\n\n       These U.S. commitments could leverage as much as $400 \n     billion from other countries and thus ensure the IMF has \n     adequate resources to mitigate ongoing financial crisis.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                              of the United States of America,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 20, 2009.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector, and region, supports \n     legislation to strengthen the International Monetary Fund \n     (IMF) included in H.R. 2346, the FY 2009 supplemental \n     appropriations bill currently being considered by the full \n     Senate, and urges Congress to reject amendments that would \n     strike the provisions from the bill.\n       The worldwide economy is experiencing its worst downturn in \n     more than half a century. While American workers and \n     companies have been hit hard, the U.S. economic recovery may \n     be undermined by even more severe difficulties in some \n     emerging markets. It is squarely in the U.S. national \n     interest to support efforts to help these countries as they \n     confront the financial crisis.\n       With leadership from the United States, the G20 committed \n     to increase the IMF New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB) by up to \n     $500 billion. The Administration is seeking Congressional \n     approval to (1) increase U.S. participation in the NAB by up \n     to $100 billion and (2) raise the U.S. quota in the IMF by $8 \n     billion.\n       These U.S. commitments could leverage as much as $400 \n     billion from other countries and thus ensure the IMF has \n     adequate resources to mitigate ongoing international \n     financial crises. Pre-crisis IMF lending resources ($250 \n     billion, more than half of which has been committed) are \n     clearly insufficient. Without adequate IMF support, currency \n     crises in especially troubled economies could trigger broader \n     economic and financial problems. Not only is the IMF the \n     appropriate multilateral institution to take preventive \n     action against such crises, its labors help the U.S. and \n     other national governments avoid costlier, ad hoc responses \n     after crises have escalated.\n       In addition, these measures will signal to the world that \n     the United States is prepared to lead efforts to help \n     emerging market economies overcome the financial crisis. \n     Without adequate IMF support, financial crises in foreign \n     markets may negatively impact U.S. jobs and exports and \n     undermine the U.S. economic recovery. The Chamber encourages \n     you to support the provisions relating to the IMF included in \n     H.R. 2346, the FY 2009 supplemental appropriations bill.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                                               Government Affairs.\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the fact is, this is a loan over which the \nUnited States keeps control. We are part of the decision-making of any \nlending that might take place under this. It is renewable under the New \nArrangements for Borrowing Agreement, renewable every 5 years. If we do \nnot renew it, it comes back. Moreover, it is only used in emergency if \nthe other funds of the IMF run down.\n  This is for American workers. We have a lot of people in America \nwhose jobs depend on their ability to export goods. The fact is, if \nthose emerging markets start to fade, not only do we lose the economic \nupside of those markets but we also run the risk that governments fail. \nWe have already had four governments that failed because of the \neconomic crisis. The fact is, if they continue to in other places that \nare more fragile, then you wind up picking up the costs in the long run \nin potential military conflict, failed states, increased capacity for \npeople to appeal to terrorism and the volatility of the politics of \nthose regions. This is not something we are doing without American \ninterests being squarely on the table--economic interests and national \nsecurity interests.\n  I repeat, it has broad-based bipartisan support. I hope colleagues \nwill take due note of that.\n  With respect to the economics of this, let me share one other quote, \nwhich is a pretty important one. Dennis Blair, Admiral Blair, the \nDirector of National Intelligence, was recently quoted as saying, about \nthe first crisis the United States faces today, the most significant \ncrisis we face today, ``the primary, near-term security concern of the \nUnited States is the global economic crisis and its geopolitical \nimplications.''\n  This is not just an economic vote, this is a national security vote. \nWhen you have a group from Jim Baker to General Scowcroft, to Henry \nKissinger, and others all suggesting this is in our\n\n[[Page S5785]]\n\nlong-term and important interest, I think we ought to listen pretty \ncarefully.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I have listened to some of the comments by \nthe junior Senator from South Carolina about the President's request to \nparticipate in the expansion of the new arrangements to borrow and \nincrease the U.S. quota at the International Monetary Fund.\n  This authority, incidentally, is requested in order to implement \ndecisions that were made by President Bush.\n  It is easy to confuse people about this issue, as the Wall Street \nJournal editorial page confused itself and probably most of its readers \nearlier this week.\n  If you are opposed to giving the Treasury Department this authority, \nthe best way to scare people into voting against it is to say that it \nis a giveaway of $100 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds to foreign \ncountries. That would scare anyone. If it were true I would vote \nagainst it myself.\n  But it is not true. Our contribution is backed up by huge IMF gold \nreserves, so the cost to the taxpayers is $5 billion over 5 years, not \n$100 billion. OMB and CBO agree on that, and so does the Senate Budget \nCommittee. And besides being false, it detracts from the legitimate \nquestion of why should we do this?\n  The simple answer is because our economy, and millions of American \njobs, depends on it.\n  Between 2003 and 2008, U.S. exports grew by 8 percent per year in \nreal terms. A key reason for that was the rapid growth of foreign \nmarkets. Our exports show a 95-percent correlation to foreign country \ngrowth rates since 2000.\n  During that period, the role of exports in driving growth in the U.S. \neconomy steadily increased. The share of all U.S. growth attributable \nto exports rose from 25 percent in 2003 to almost 70 percent in 2008.\n  Because of the global financial crisis our exports peaked in July of \nlast year and have been falling since then. In the first quarter of \n2009, our real exports were 23 percent lower than in the first quarter \nof 2008.\n  Our export decline is now contributing to recession in the United \nStates.\n  With an export share in GDP of 12 percent, a 23-percent decline, if \nsustained over the course of a year, would make a negative contribution \nto GDP of almost 3 percent.\n  The stimulus plan we passed is boosting domestic demand. But the \nbenefits of the stimulus are at risk of being wiped out by the decline \nin exports.\n  We need to help foreign countries lift themselves out of recession. \nIt will benefit them, but it will also restore our exports as their \neconomies recover and they begin to buy more of our goods and services.\n  Some foreign countries can take care of themselves with stimulus of \ntheir own, and by cleaning up their own banking sectors.\n  But many others, especially emerging market economies, have been hard \nhit. Some countries have been cut off abruptly from capital markets and \nshut out of credit markets by the banking problems originating in the \nUnited States and Europe.\n  Those countries need to fix their own problems and get temporary \nfinance to avoid a prolonged period of economic decline.\n  Providing temporary finance and policy fixes is the job of the IMF.\n  But as the world economy grew in the last decade, the financial \nresources available to the IMF did not keep up. It has been caught \nshort by the suddenness, severity, and scope of this global crisis.\n  The request for a quota increase, and the authority to participate in \nthe new arrangements to borrow, will replenish the IMF's resources so \nit can fight this crisis.\n  With this money, the IMF will be able to help many foreign economies \nrevive. With this money, the IMF will be ready in case the crisis \ndeepens and takes more victims.\n  As foreign economies recover, so will ours. We will be spared an even \nworse decline in our exports, with greater job loss. As our exports \nresume, people in export industries in every State will be able to go \nback to work.\n  This may seem like an arcane issue, but it is of vital importance to \nthe jobs of millions of Americans across this country. I, Senator \nKerry, Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby, Senator Lugar, and others have \nagreed on substitute language which provides for prior consultation and \nreports to Congress, as well as greater transparency and accountability \nat the IMF. It also provides guidelines for the use of the proceeds of \nsales of IMF gold.\n  The real choice here is not whether or not we should provide Treasury \nwith the authority that both former President Bush and President Obama \nhave called for.\n  Rather, it is how we should do it. After we vote on the DeMint \namendment, and assuming it is defeated, I will seek consent for the \nadoption of substitute language that is supported by the chairman and \nranking member of the Foreign Relations Committee and the chairman and \nranking member of the Banking Committee.\n  It also has the support of the chairman and ranking member of the \nState and Foreign Operations Subcommittee of the Appropriations \nCommittee.\n  The true cost of the authority requested by the President is not the \n$100 billion the Senator from South Carolina wants you to believe. That \nis a scare tactic. It is $5 billion over 5 years, and that is a drop in \nthe ocean compared to cost to our economy, and to American jobs, by not \nacting.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I \nask unanimous consent that the time be charged to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KERRY. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina has 4 minutes, \nthe Senator from Massachusetts has 4 minutes, the Senator from New \nHampshire has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this is one of those issues which looks \neasy on its face because it is politically simple to synthesize and \nstate, but it is not easy; it is a complex issue.\n  Obviously, anything that has an initial around here in a foreign \norganization can be easily attacked. The idea of American dollars going \nto support organizations which have initials, and they are foreign \norganizations, often gets attacked. But in this instance our national \ninterest is of our concern, our primary concern, and is benefitted by \nthe decision made to carry out our responsibilities relative to the \nIMF.\n  How does this work? The International Monetary Fund is essentially an \norganization set up by the United States during the Bretton Woods \nConference in the post-World War II period, the purpose of which was, \nand is, to have a backstop for countries that get into very deep fiscal \nproblems and to have a place where the rest of the world can go \ntogether in the industrialized world and basically meet and support \nindividual countries which have problems. It is actually an opportunity \nfor us as a nation to share the burden which, in the post-World War II \nperiod, has fallen primarily to us, to try to stabilize the world \neconomy.\n  That obviously benefits us a lot. We are the biggest trader in the \nworld. We export massive amounts of goods. Dramatic proportions of \nAmerican jobs are tied to our capacity to export, and having a stable \nworld economy is critical to our capacity to keep our economy going. \nThat is why we set this up. It was pure, simple self-interest, to set \nup an international organization to help us stabilize other Nations \nthat run into trouble.\n  We are now in the midst of, obviously, a worldwide recession that is \ndeep, it is severe, and we felt the brunt of it in the United States, \nand other nations across the world are feeling it also. Some are in \nmuch more dire shape than we are.\n  The issue is, how can we try to avoid an international meltdown, \ncountries failing and bringing down other countries with them, and how \ncan we benefit ourselves by maintaining stable economies around the \nworld?\n  Well, one way to do that is to have an international organization \nsuch as the IMF which steps up and essentially tries to catch the \ndominoes before they fall.\n  There are countries in this world that are going through deep \neconomic\n\n[[Page S5786]]\n\nproblems, even more severe than ours, which is hard to believe because \nours is so severe. If those countries fail to be able to maintain their \ndebt, their sovereign debt, and the leveraged debt of their banking \nsystems, and if they fail as nations, then other nations that have lent \nto those nations will follow them into failure.\n  A lot of these nations are in Eastern Europe, a few of them are in \nthe Western Hemisphere. We have already seen two instances of this in \nIceland and Ireland, and we know the situation is tentative.\n  In fact, just today it was reported that even the British debt, the \nUnited Kingdom debt, may be downgraded. So the IMF is sort of our \nprimary backstop in the international community to try to avoid that \ntype of event occurring, where one Nation fails on its sovereign debt, \nor its major banking debt, and it brings down a series of other nations \nthat have lent to it.\n  The IMF has said, and it was agreed to by all of the countries \nparticipating in the IMF, that it needed more resources to be able to \nbe sure--although nobody can ever be sure in this economy--in order to \nbe reasonably sure that if a fairly significant nation has very serious \nproblems, it can step in and try to help stabilize that country's \nsituation, so that country does not take a lot of other countries with \nit as it defaults on its debt. This agreement was reached in concert, \nnot by us alone but by a whole group of nations. So rather than the \nUnited States, for example, having to step in and unilaterally take \naction in, say, one of our neighboring countries, as we did in the late \n1990s, this allows us as a nation to join with other nations and pool, \nbasically pool a large amount of resources, to have them available \nhere, for the opportunity to avoid such a meltdown.\n  We put in about 20 percent, other nations--Japan, Germany, England, \nother industrialized countries--put in the balance. The IMF is calling \nfor $500 billion essentially. Actually, it works out to $750 billion \nwhen you put in the special drawing rights, $750 billion of capacity to \nbe able to have that type of resources available to stabilize various \nnations around this world should they get into serious, severe trouble.\n  You can follow the proposal of this amendment as essentially saying, \nthe United States does not want to be part of this effort. We are going \nto back out of this responsibility or this--you do not even have to \nclaim it as a responsibility, this action, because we basically are \ngoing to retrench from here within the United States and not \nparticipate in this sort of international effort to try to stabilize \nother economies because we need our money. We need it here, now, and we \ncannot afford to do that.\n  That, in my opinion, is extraordinarily shortsighted. That is like \ncutting off your nose to spite your face because let's face it, if an \nEast European economy goes down and it takes with it two or three other \nEast European countries, and that leads to even some major Western \nEuropean economies going down, who is the loser? Well, those economies \nobviously. But I can tell you a lot of American jobs are going to be \nthe losers.\n  That type of economic disruption, that type of economic Armageddon as \nit was described by one of my colleagues who actually supports the \nDeMint amendment, would come back to affect us dramatically.\n  So what is the price of avoiding that, or hopefully avoiding it? What \nis the price of at least having in place an insurance policy to try to \navoid that? Well, the price is, for us to put up no money, we are not \nputting up any money. We are putting up what amounts to a letter of \ncredit to the IMF that says: All right, you now have a letter of credit \nfrom the United States for $100 billion. You have a letter of credit \nfrom a variety of other nations around the world for another $400 \nbillion. You have $500 billion of letters of credit, so if you have to \ngo into a nation, because their banking system is on the verge of \nfailure, and because they do not have the ability to monetize their \ndebt the way we do--in other words, they do not have a central bank \nthat can print money because they do not have a world currency--you are \ngoing to have this type of support to try to stabilize that country so \nit does not become a domino affect on all of those other nations that \nmay have lent to it, including us.\n  That is an insurance policy. Does it mean even if the IMF had to take \nthat step and go into that country and invest that we would lose those \ndollars? No, we would not. In fact, we will not lose those dollars. We \nhave never lost a dollar through the IMF. We have always been repaid \neverything.\n  Not only will we not lose them because the country they are lending \nto is a nation, and probably a fairly sophisticated nation because they \ndo not do too many nations that are not sophisticated, we will not lose \nit because the IMF has a massive gold reserve that essentially backs up \nall of the dollars, all of the money that is there. So it is not a \nrisky exercise.\n  That is why this effort does not score as $108 billion. There is no \ngame being played about the $108 billion number. The simple fact is, \nthe $108 billion number does not score because there has never been an \noutlay to the IMF.\n  You can make an argument that even the $5 billion--that is what CBO \ncame up with as a number, and I think that was based on the assumption \nthat there might be some interest costs, but even the $5 billion is \nwrong. Zero is the right number. Certainly a representation that $108 \nbillion is what it is going to cost the American taxpayers is totally \ninaccurate. It is playing with facts fast and loose because we never \nhad lost any money.\n  All the lending of IMF is basically securitized, either by the debt \nof the nation they are lending it to or by their own gold, the gold of \nwhich they have a huge accumulation.\n  So this is not a cost of any significance to the American taxpayer. \nWhat it is, however, is an extraordinarily cheap way for us as a nation \nto lay off the burden to other nations, other industrialized nations; \nlay off the burden of making sure that countries which would represent \na very serious problem to us and to the world community should they \nfail financially, a very cheap way of trying to have in place a system \nto avoid that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. So, from my opinion, this is an amendment which is not \nconstructive either for our economy or for the international situation. \nI would hope it would be defeated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? If no one yields time, the \ntime will be equally charged to both sides.\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I objected to that. I was allowed 4 \nminutes. The other side is not showing up. I do not think that is right \nto take my 4 minutes. If the other side would like to yield back, I \nwill be glad to close with my 4 minutes.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I reserve my 4 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If the Senator puts us in a quorum call, the \ntime will be charged to him, absent consent.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Let me simplify this. I will go ahead and speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments that we have \nheard today. I want to make it clear we are not trying to minimize or \nchange our commitment to the IMF at all. We are already committed for \nabout $65 billion. We are the largest contributor to the IMF, and that \nwill continue.\n  What I am opposing is a massive increase in our commitment of $108 \nbillion at a time this country cannot afford it. We have also heard \nthis is not really any spending, that no money will really come out of \nour Treasury. If that were true, we would not need to ask for it; it \nwould not need to be in the bill. If that were true, it could be $200 \nor $300 billion, and it still would not cost us anything.\n  This is just political speak here in Washington. We are giving a \ncredit line to an international agency where we do not control the \nvote, where they can take $108 billion more than they already have, 108 \nin addition to the $65 billion we have committed to this agency, to use \nin a way that they would like. I object to this because I have \nbusinesses in South Carolina that can't get a loan, a small loan from a \nbank that has taken Federal money. They can't continue their business \nbecause the bank says these are difficult\n\n[[Page S5787]]\n\neconomic times and that is a high risk. So we are going to take $100 \nbillion and give it to countries that are high risk because supposedly \nthat helps our economy. Enough is enough. We have spent more than we \ncan pay back already. It is wrong to attach this type of spending to a \nbill that supports our troops. This should be taken out of the bill \nright now. That is what my amendment does. It strikes a section that \nwould give an additional $108 billion of appropriation authority to the \nIMF.\n  It also strikes a section that allows them to begin to sell off the \ngold reserves that we just heard are a so-called security for this \nloan. This makes no sense.\n  I urge colleagues to say enough is enough. There are many good things \nwe can do, but we, frankly, don't have the money anymore. This is more \nthan we spend on education every year, more than we spend on veterans \nbenefits, more than we spend on transportation. It is real money, \nbecause it will be drawn upon, because there are countries all over the \nworld in difficulty. We will set a precedent. Notice that in the \ncriticism of the bill, they are not using this to criticize it, because \nnot only does this create a permanent amount of authority to withdraw \nmoney, it gives the Secretary of the Treasury the ability to make \namendments to the law. We are giving the authority of this Congress \nover to the Secretary of the Treasury and the International Monetary \nFund. None of this makes any sense. Enough is enough. No more spending. \nNo more borrowing. It is time to let it go.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this makes all the sense in the world. In \nfact, Senator Gregg, former chairman, now ranking member of the Budget \nCommittee, gave an excellent summary of exactly what this is. It is not \nan expenditure. It is a letter of credit. It stabilizes countries. It \nis an insurance policy. It has always been repaid. As Senator Gregg \nsaid, even the $5 billion which the CBO scores this at is not accurate \nbecause the money is never laid out. This is not a risky exercise \nbecause we make money through the interest. This is an asset that we \ncreate that is traded against the letter of credit.\n  Let me answer my colleague. He asked the question about the 5 years. \nParagraph 17 of the IMF Articles of the New Arrangements to Borrow has \na provision for withdrawal from membership. A participating member can \nwithdraw. At that time, the money comes back to you. You cease to have \nyour commitment on the line. Paragraph 19 of the IMF Articles of the \nNew Arrangements to Borrow states:\n\n       This decision shall continue in existence for five years \n     from its effective date. When considering a renewal of this \n     decision for the period following the five-year period \n     referred to in this paragraph 19 . . . the Fund and the \n     participants shall review the functioning of this decision.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. KERRY. I will yield on his time.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Are you reading from----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts has the floor.\n  Mr. KERRY. I am reading from the current Articles of the IMF's New \nArrangements to Borrow. This is the operative agreement for the NAB, on \nwhich this lending takes place. Let me make it clear, why this is \nfurthering our interests. The fact is, in South Carolina, they have a \nlot of businesses that export. From the beginning of this year exports \nin the U.S. were down 23 percent. They were down 23 percent because \ncountries' economies around the world are hurting. As Secretary \nKissinger, General Scowcroft, and the Chamber of Commerce all agree, \nthis is important for American business. The fact is, between 2003 and \n2008, exports grew by 8 percent per year in real terms. We have a \ncorrelation in our exports to the growth of other countries. There has \nbeen a 95-percent correlation in that growth.\n  The fact is, the share of all U.S. growth attributable to export \ngrowth went from 25 percent in 2003, to 50 percent in 2007, to 70 \npercent in 2008. We benefit. That rise of exports from 25 percent to 70 \npercent is to the benefit of American business. Unfortunately, those \nexports peaked in July of last year. Most of our partners are now in \nrecession. Real exports are now 23 percent lower. You are looking at a \nreduction in American GDP, if you don't provide this line of credit.\n  President Obama went to London. He led the world in getting a $500 \nbillion agreement to help support these countries to revive their \neconomies. When you consider the money we have spent in the Cold War to \nbreak the Eastern Bloc away from the Soviet Union and, ultimately, they \nhave adopted our economic system, they are working as partners now, \nmany of them members of NATO. Their economies are hurting. We benefit \nif those States don't go into an economic implosion.\n  This is a national security issue for the United States. It is a \nplain and simple, self-interest economic issue for the United States. \nMost importantly, we don't spend money. This is a deposit fund in an \naccount which is interest bearing to the United States. It is a good \ninvestment. Historically, we have not lost money. I know Senator Lugar \nwill vote against this amendment. Senator Gregg and others. I hope \ncolleagues will resoundingly reject this ill-advised amendment.\n  Mr. DeMINT. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 39 seconds.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I wish to make sure the Senator understands that the bill \nwe vote on today amends what he just read about our ability to get out \nof this in 5 years. Sometimes it is hard to get the straight scoop \nhere.\n  It is real money or we wouldn't be asking for it. This is not a time \nin our country's history that we can afford to put another $108 billion \non the line, when we can't get our own businesses enough money. We have \nto stop this reckless spending. I encourage colleagues to support my \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1138.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I would point out that there are now \n26 cosponsors of the amendment that would have tried to give the \nChrysler car dealers extra time to get their affairs in order rather \nthan a June 9 deadline. It would just give them 3 more weeks. I am \nstill hoping the White House and the Chrysler company will come forward \nwith something that will give some help to these dealers.

Mr. President, we are still working on language that \nI very much hope we can get agreement on before the end of the day. I \nthink everyone is working in good faith. That is my hope, and I will \nremain optimistic that we can have something definitive for the dealers \nin this country who are facing bankruptcy or dissolution in 2 weeks.\n  As of now, 28 Senators have signed on to agree that we need to be \nhelpful to them. I think we have a way forward, but we have to get \neveryone signed off on it. I hope all of the parties will do that, so \nthere can be a definitive announcement, because these dealers need to \nbe able to plan going forward. They need to know what the rules of the \ngame are. I think it is the least we can do for them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I asked the managers of the bill if I \ncould have some time to discuss this bill for a moment. I offer a lot \nof amendments around here and, quite frankly, there are several \namendments I should have offered, or should call up, but I am not going \nto call up because, quite frankly, I am not prepared to do it.\n  I wanted to talk about this bill because it has been described in a \nlot of ways as funding for our troops, as things that we have to do. I \nwant to put a few holes in that for a minute.\n  There is funding for our troops in this bill, there is no question. \nWe need to do that. One of the promises of the President--and I hope it \ncomes about this next year--is we will never see another one of these \nto fight the wars. It will be incorporated, as it should have been in \nthe past.\n  I am on record of voting against three of these requests from the \nBush administration for the fact that it should be incorporated into \nthe regular budget. We know we have these expenses. When we do a \nsupplemental or an emergency--that is what we are calling this--there \nis something that happens most people do not realize. Mr. President, \n100 percent of this bill will be borrowed by the Treasury when we start \nspending the money. This is not money we have. It is money we are going \nto borrow from the next two generations because the Congress refuses to \nmake priorities of what we need to do, and we continue to spend money \non things that we should not be or do not have to do, which are not a \npriority, and the money we are going to spend is borrowed money.\n  We have not heard much of that in the entire debate on this bill. \nEvery dollar will be stolen from the future of the next two generations \nto come, and most of the people who are hearing my voice today will not \npay the cost of this significantly large bill.\n  It was not all that long ago that the entire Federal budget wasn't \nthe size of this, less than 45 years ago. Yet we are going to pass, in \nvery short order, with very few amendments, a bill that does a lot of \nthings besides fund our troops.\n  Of course, there is another thing most Americans don't know. It is \nthat all the things that are in this bill that go to other executive \nbranch agencies will be utilized to raise the baseline next year for \nthe starting point of the budget process. In other words, we are \nraising the baseline. So when we look at it, when it comes through the \nbudget next year, and the appropriations cycle, it will not be what we \nactually appropriated under the budget. It will be under the budget \nplus what we spent on the supplemental. We do not go back to where we \nshould be. We go back to an elevated area because we had an emergency \nspending bill.\n  There is money in here for the United Nations Development Program, \nPeacekeeping Operations, $721 million. Here is a fact that most \nAmericans don't know. Forty percent of every dollar spent by the United \nNations on peacekeeping operations is absolutely defrauded or wasted. \nSo in this case, $300 million of the $720 million that we are going to \nappropriate, some shyster connected with the United Nations, either in \nNew York or in some foreign country, is going to steal that money. It \nis not going to go to help anybody keep the peace. It is not going to \ngo to clothe and feed someone. It is not going to go to protect the \nrights of those who are discriminated against, those who are living not \nunder the rule of law; that, in fact, $300 million out of the $720 \nmillion isn't going to do anything except line the pockets of crooks.\n  Yet we have that report, which we had to get from the U.N. because we \ndon't have transparency on where our money is going. That is the U.N.'s \nown report. Yet there is nothing in this bill that requires them to \ngive us an audit of how they are spending it. There is no metrics on \nhow it is going to be spent, and there is nothing in this bill that \nsays they are going to have to tell us and show us that they didn't let \nit get defrauded or get stolen. We are not paying attention. We are \nrunning like there isn't an economic crisis.\n\n[[Page S5789]]\n\n  There is another area in this bill that is extremely disturbing to \nme, which is that we are going to give a $1.3 billion pay raise to all \nthe Foreign Service officers in this country.\n  They hire 500 to 600 new ones each year. They have 25,000 \napplications for these jobs without this pay raise. This is called a \nlocality pay differential, and it started because it is so expensive to \nlive in Washington that we give a 21-percent increase to all Foreign \nService officers who get stationed in the United States, but we are now \ngoing to give it to them no matter where they live.\n  So what we are talking about is a $15,000-a-year pay raise on the \nbasis of nothing, to people who, on average, make more than $75,000 a \nyear. Ask yourself a question: When we send a colonel to South Korea, \ndo we give him a locality pay increase? No. When we send a sergeant to \ntake care of the troops who are stationed around the world, do we give \nhim a pay increase or her a pay increase? No. And they just happen to \nmake a third of what our Foreign Service officers make. Yet with one \nbroad stroke we are going to add $1.5 billion over the next 4 years, \nand then at least $400 million a year to everyone who works for the \nState Department.\n  Why are we doing that? Why are we saying Foreign Service officers are \nmore important than our men and women in uniform? Why are we creating a \ndifferential when, in fact, there is no hardship, and we are having no \ntrouble getting employees. By the first data I put out there, we are \nnot. There are no statistics to suggest they have a greater loss than \nthey are capable to reproduce. Yet in this bill, $400 million a year, \njust as a gift--just as a gift.\n  Think how demoralizing that is to the men and women who wear the \nuniform of the United States. We have decided that technocrats are more \nimportant than the people on the front lines. We have decided that, not \nbased on merit, not based on performance, we are just going to give \nthem a raise.\n  I don't have any objections due to the cost of living in DC that we \nmight have a differential pay for that. But why would we say no matter \nwhere you live--if you live in Muskogee, OK, where I am from--and you \nhappen to work for the State Department; that because you work for the \nState Department and not because you produce more or do a better job, \nyou are going to get a 21-percent pay increase that is never going to \nget rescinded.\n  What are we doing? And why are we doing it?\n  Also in here is $.5 billion for the start of--and they have a \nlegitimate claim, the State of Mississippi--a hurricane prevention \nprogram. We asked the Corps to do a study. We are putting money in. It \nis unauthorized money. It has never been through the committee, and I \nam not saying that we may or may not want to do this. But the Corps \nhasn't even finalized their evaluation of the study on whether it is \nviable. Yet this is the first $.5 billion in a $2 billion to $7 billion \nproject that I am not sure right now, without authorization of the \nappropriate committee, we are going to jump in line ahead of every \nother priority program that the Corps of Engineers has just because we \ncan do it. And the Corps hasn't even accepted the premise of the study \non which the money is going to be spent.\n  America, wake up to what we are doing. This ship has a lot of holes \nin it, and we are taking on water faster than those with common sense \ncan bail it out. These are just three prime examples of things in this \nbill that ought not be handled the way they are handled in the bill.\n  The No. 1 thing we are not doing is we are not being honest with \nourselves about where this money is coming from and how much more it is \ngoing to cost the people in this country who are struggling every day \njust to pay their mortgage, just to put groceries on the table, and to \npay their utility bills.\n  We are going to give $108 billion to the IMF. We had an amendment \nthat got defeated. The fact is--and pay attention to this--it may not \nhelp. The assumption is we will get paid back because they have never \nnot paid us back in the past. Well, this is a different day, and there \nis a high likelihood that, even though we only charge $5 billion for \nthe cost of this $108 billion loan, we will never see a penny of it \ncome back--a very high likelihood--especially if you look at the total \ndebt and money assets of all the European countries compared to their \nGDP ratio.\n  We wring our hands and say: Well, we have to do this. We have to do \nthis. What we have to do is preserve America first. What we have to do \nis defend America first. What we have to do is restore confidence in \nAmerica. The way we are doing it with this bill does just the opposite.\n  I am sorry I haven't had time to go after the issues in this bill. \nThere are tons of things we ought to be doing differently, and if we \nare not going to do them differently, we ought to hold the Members \naccountable on a vote to say why we are not doing them differently. \nBorrowing this money against our children's future and not making hard \nchoices on some of the $350 billion worth of fraud and waste that we \nknow the Federal Government has, not even looking at it, not making an \nattempt to pay for any of it, to me, is a tragedy.\n  It is not just a tragedy of the moment because what it clearly spells \nout is that there has been no change. There is no change in behavior. \nThere is no recognition of the difficulty we are in. There is no set of \npriorities that says we do what is most important for the country \nfirst, and if it is not really that important, we don't do it at all \nnow so that we can protect the way of life we have come to know. I am \ndisappointed in us because we have failed to grasp the seriousness of \nwhere we are today in this country. And where we are is not far from \nlosing the essence of what America stands for.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Will the Senator withhold his \nrequest?\n  Mr. COBURN. I will. I withdraw my request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I rise to speak about the supplemental \nthat is before the Senate in terms of the appropriations. Much of this \nbill is about supporting the men and women wearing the uniform of the \nUnited States who are serving this country around the world and acting \nas sentinels for America's freedom around the world.\n  The question is, Will we appropriate the resources necessary to match \nthe challenge we have given them and the call to service we have asked \nof them? That is what this appropriations supplemental bill is largely \nall about.\n  In that context, there is one particular area of funding that doesn't \ngo to where we have troops but where we, in fact, care about what is \nhappening in part of the world, and that is Pakistan. We care about it \nbecause it is along the Afghanistan-Pakistan border; the area where, in \nfact, Osama bin Laden likely exists; the area al-Qaida is operating in, \ncrossing back and forth along that border in order to attack our troops \nin Afghanistan; and also because of the Taliban. So we have clear \nnational security interests as it relates to that part of the world.\n  We all agree the situation in Pakistan is probably at the top of the \nlist of our most serious national security challenges because this is \nwhere al-Qaida has reconstituted itself, and this was the entity, along \nwith bin Laden, that struck us on that fateful day of September 11.\n  Late last month, the Secretary of State warned us that Pakistan's \ngovernment is facing an ``existential threat'' from Islamist militants \nwho have established operations dangerously close to the capital city \nof Islamabad. These are militants who wish to do us harm, plot new \nterrorist attacks or, God forbid, seize control of that country's \nnuclear arsenal. There are plenty of reasons for the United States to \nbe engaged. Since 2001, Pakistan has received more than $12 billion in \nassistance from the U.S. Government. The idea behind the assistance has \nbeen to support democratic institutions, human rights, economic \ndevelopment, along with counterterrorism operations to fight the \nTaliban and al-Qaida and create the conditions for stability in the \ncountry.\n  Unfortunately, under the lax oversight of the Bush administration, \nthat assistance had very few strings attached to it, and under that \nadministration it is hard to see what kind of results we actually \nachieved for the money we spent. Democracy and institutions of civil \nsociety are as fragile as\n\n[[Page S5790]]\n\never, the Taliban is expanding its reach, and we have heard reports \nabout the Pakistani Government expanding its nuclear arsenal. So $12 \nbillion later, the way we sent assistance may or may not have worked \nfor Pakistan, but it certainly didn't work for us.\n  So, Madam President, we have to constantly ask ourselves: How are we \nusing our money in pursuit of our national interests and our national \nsecurity interest, and what type of benchmarks and progress are we \nmaking so that we can, in fact, respond both as fiduciaries to the \ntaxpayers of the country and, at the same time, in measuring benchmarks \ntoward our national security goals?\n  It is our responsibility to see that there is transparency and \naccountability in whatever assistance we are providing, and as the \nadministration makes the case to reverse what it acknowledges are \n``rapidly deteriorating security and economic conditions'' there, we \nhave to make sure the funding we are sending over is actually doing its \npart to make the situation better.\n  We have to ask those questions about the Pakistan funding in this \ncurrent supplemental bill as well. For starters, in this supplemental, \nI think when we look at it, it is pretty significant. There is over \n$1.6 billion in the supplemental for Pakistan, including $400 million \nfor the Pakistan Counterinsurgency Capability Fund, $439 million in \neconomic support funds, and $700 million in coalition support funds.\n  I am concerned about the funding, but I want to specifically talk \nabout the $700 million in coalition support funds. Those funds are used \nto reimburse the Pakistani Government for the logistical and military \nexpenses of fighting Islamist militants.\n  As the Pakistani military increases these activities--and we have \nseen those military activities finally take place in a way that we \nthink is moving in the right direction--those coalition support funds \nare expected to increase substantially as well. So if we are going to \nhave a shot at the militants, we are going to need to provide support. \nAnd we are agreed on that, I think. But that does not mean we should be \nsending out blank checks.\n  Along with my distinguished colleague from Iowa, Senator Harkin, and \nseveral colleagues in the House, we suggested the Government \nAccountability Office look into the assistance we provided to Pakistan, \nincluding the $6.9 billion in coalition support funds it received. In a \nJune 2008 report, the GAO found that the Pentagon did not consistently \nverify Pakistani claims for reimbursement, and additional oversight \ncontrols were needed.\n  Here is an example from that report. The United States was \nreimbursing the Pakistani Government $19,000 per month for each of \nabout 20 passenger vehicles, about $9 million in total, even though we \nlater found out that we were paying for the same 20 vehicles over and \nover.\n  A February 2009 report that we also asked for echoed and confirmed \nthose findings and said that the Pentagon needed to improve oversight \nof coalition support funds reimbursements.\n  Earlier today at a Foreign Relations hearing I asked Admiral Mullen, \nand he acknowledged we have not had good controls in the past on \ncoalition support funds, but he assured the committee the controls have \nimproved and additional steps are being taken to make sure the funds \nare being used wisely.\n  The Deputy Secretary of Defense outlined these steps in a letter to \nChairman Kerry last month, including new guidelines, additional face-\nto-face meetings with Pakistani counterparts, and additional visits by \nthe Department of Defense to Pakistan to refine the coalition support \nfund claim processing and validate procedures.\n  Personally, I have met with Ambassador Holbrooke, our special envoy \nto this region, as well as questioned Secretary Clinton yesterday \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee, and they both assured me this \nadministration is developing metrics to measure success and change the \nway we engage in Pakistan so we can defeat the militants and bring \nstability to the country and the region. I am pleased to see these \nsteps being taken and I look forward to closely monitoring them as we \nmove forward.\n  Let me conclude by saying we all realize that conditions on the \nground make detailed reporting and accountability a major challenge. We \ncannot expect to be getting daily comprehensive spreadsheets e-mailed \nfrom every remote mountain region. But as best as we can, it is the \nresponsibility of this Congress to ensure that all of our funds are \nbeing used in a manner that is advancing our national interests and our \nnational security interests.\n  With these changes that have taken place, I think--partly because we \nhave asked for these reports, partly because of the questioning at \nthese hearings, partly because of the new leadership of the \nadministration--I plan to vote for the supplemental. In doing so, \nhowever, I want to send a very clear message that it is not and should \nnot be construed as a blank check. I have concerns with the coalition \nsupport fund program and concern about Pakistan's nuclear program. \nMoney is fungible, and I am concerned as we send money to Pakistan for \none purpose that frees up their money to be buying nuclear weapons, \nsomething that is not in our interest or in the interest of that part \nof the world. I am glad the Obama administration is taking steps to \nensure accountability and in the future we need to do even more. We \nneed to be sure we do not wind up right back here a year from now, \nhaving to say the same things. We cannot afford to yet again take one \nstep forward and two steps back, and above all we cannot afford to be \nsending such resources without achieving the national goals of security \nand the interests we have. That is the best way to make sure we do not \nlose sight of our goal here and that is also the best way we keep \nAmerica safe.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                   Christening of the USS ``Gravely''\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Madam President, as we prepare to return home to our \nconstituents and to celebrate the Memorial Day weekend, remembering all \nthose who have served and sacrificed in the name of the United States, \nI would like to single out one veteran in particular.\n  It is with deep and abiding pride that I rise to salute the late VADM \nSamuel Gravely, and to mark the christening of a new and remarkable \nU.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Gravely.\n  At a ceremony last weekend, the Gravely became the first Navy ship in \nU.S. history to bear the name of an African American officer.\n  When she receives her commission, the vessel will be the most \ntechnologically advanced warship on the planet.\n  It is a fitting honor for the destroyer's namesake, the late VADM \nSamuel L. Gravely, Jr., who was the first African American to become a \nNavy officer.\n  Beginning his career as a seaman apprentice in 1942, amid the chaos \nof the Second World War, Admiral Gravely first knew a segregated U.S. \nNavy in which people of color served mainly as cooks and waiters.\n  Only one ship had a black crew.\n  That vessel was the USS Mason, whose 160 men served under the command \nof white officers, In 1944, the brave crew of the Mason escorted \nsupport ships to England during a vicious storm.\n  They completed this daring mission with valor, even when cracks in \nthe hull threatened to tear their ship apart.\n  Because of the racial politics of the age, and despite the \nrecommendation of their commander, it took more than 50 years for these \nbrave sailors to receive official commendation.\n  It was in this climate that Samuel Gravely began his naval career. He \nretired from a very different U.S. military 38 years later.\n  Admiral Gravely's years of service included many notable firsts.\n  He was the first African American to command a combatant ship, the \nfirst to command a major warship, the first to achieve flag rank, and \nthe first to command a numbered fleet.\n  These are remarkable accomplishments by any account, but they are\n\n[[Page S5791]]\n\nmade all the more impressive when they are considered in the context of \nthe U.S. Navy at the time.\n  This exemplary sailor achieved greatness in a time when the policies \nof our Armed Forces too often limited the opportunities available to \npeople of color.\n  He understood the obstacles he was facing, but he was determined not \nto bow to the limits imposed by others. He did not let those \ndifficulties stand in his way.\n  Instead, he turned each challenge into an opportunity to excel.\n  We should all learn from the example set by this great American hero, \nwho started as an enlisted sailor and overcame extraordinary odds to \nfinish his career as a three-star admiral.\n  His accomplishments should resonate with all Americans.\n  Admiral Gravely proved that respect will come to those who work hard \nto earn it.\n  His legacy serves as an example for countless young men and women \nserving bravely in the Armed Forces. Soon, the destroyer USS Gravely \nwill stand guard on the high seas, a striking symbol to the world of \nthe remarkable and enduring truth of the American dream.\n  Generations of sailors will serve on her decks, and as they stand \naboard the Gravely, they also stand on the shoulders of the man for \nwhom it was named.\n  Thankfully, the divided society of years past has given way to a new \nAmerica built on equality, a Nation more free, more fair and more \nequal, a Nation that cherishes the contributions of all men and women \nregardless of race, creed or color.\n\n  A Nation built through the hard work and bravery of real life \ntrailblazers like Admiral Gravely.\n  I am extremely proud of Admiral Gravely's achievements, and I am \ndeeply moved by the Navy's tribute to his service.\n  Like many, I share in the joy that Mrs. Gravely must have felt as \nthis state-of-the-art destroyer was christened with her husband's name.\n  When this warship is commissioned, it will be more than a fighting \ntribute to its accomplished namesake.\n  It will ensure that the outstanding legacy of Samuel L. Gravely, Jr., \nlives on in the service of the U.S. Navy for years to come.\n  I can think of no better way to memorialize a true American hero.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to speak for a few moments \nregarding the President's remarks on national security today and about \nsome national security issues in general.\n  At the outset, let me note that there are some points in the \nPresident's message I do not agree with and some points of plain fact \nhe made that should help us clarify some of the issues that have been \nraised in recent debates over national security. President Obama \nendorsed the continued use of military commissions with some minor \nchanges. These commissions are historic and certainly appropriate and \nhave been used by nations all over the world. I will reserve judgment \non those changes until I see the details, but the President is right \nwhen he states that military commissions are ``an appropriate venue for \ntrying detainees for violations of the laws of war,'' though some have \nnot agreed with that.\n  The President correctly noted: ``Military commissions have a history \nin the United States dating back to George Washington and the \nRevolutionary War.''\n  As the President also noted, military commissions ``allow for the \nprotection of sensitive sources and methods of intelligence \ngathering.'' That is absolutely true, and it is an important principle \nin defending America. He also noted that the commissions allow ``the \npresentation of evidence gathered from the battlefield that cannot be \neffectively presented in a Federal court.''\n  In other words, we have strict rules of evidence in Federal courts. \nOur soldiers are in a life-and-death struggle on the battlefield. They \nare not police investigators. They are not homicide investigators. They \ncan not be expected to be able to comply with every rule regarding the \ncollection of evidence. Military commissions account for that \ndifference.\n  It is also reassuring to see that President Obama has stated he will \nexercise his power as Commander in Chief to detain as war prisoners \nthose al-Qaida members who continue to pose a danger to the United \nStates, but who cannot be tried by a military commission. Some \ndetainees may not be able to be tried by military commissions for legal \nreasons. For years, we have heard criticism from some of the fringe \ngroups on the left--criticisms that have been echoed occasionally in \nthis Chamber--that we must either try every enemy war prisoner or \nrelease them. That has never been the practice in the history of war, \nand that is not what our law says. This is a notion that cannot be \nsustained and one that would pose a threat to us if it were ever \nadopted as policy.\n  I am glad to see President Obama rejected that notion. As he noted in \nhis remarks today:\n\n       There may be a number of people who cannot be prosecuted \n     for past crimes, but who nonetheless pose a danger to the \n     security of the United States. Examples of that threat \n     include people who have received extensive explosives \n     training at al-Qaida training camps, commanded Taliban troops \n     in battle, expressed their allegiance to Osama bin Laden, or \n     otherwise made it clear they want to kill Americans. These \n     are people who, in effect, remain at war with the United \n     States.\n       As I said, I am not going to release individuals who \n     endanger the American people. Al-Qaida terrorists and their \n     affiliates are at war with the United States and those we \n     capture--like other prisoners of war--must be prevented from \n     attacking us again.\n\n  That is fundamentally true, but some people have a confused notion \nabout that.\n  Under the Geneva Conventions, even lawful combatants can be detained \nthroughout the duration of a war. When illegal combatants conduct a war \noutside the laws of the Geneva Conventions and other treaties and laws \nthat deal with the conduct of civilized warfare by deliberately and \nintentionally bombing innocent men, women and children who are \nnoncombatants, those people are not entitled to be released.\n  President Obama also stated this morning that:\n\n       We are not going to release anyone if it would endanger our \n     national security, nor will we release detainees within the \n     United States who endanger the American people.\n\n  Well, that is hard to know for certain. Attorney General Holder has \ntalked about releasing the Uighurs, a terrorist group focused primarily \non China. I don't believe the administration has the legal authority to \nrelease these detainees. Recently, according to the Los Angeles Times, \nsome of the Uighurs were watching a soccer game--they allow them to \nwatch television at the Guantanamo Bay facility--and a lady came on \nwith short sleeves. This offended one of the Islamic Uighurs and they \njumped up and grabbed the television and threw it on the floor. I point \nthat out simply to say it is difficult to know for certain who is a \nthreat. Many may well harbor a secret determination to attack America \nas soon as they are released.\n  I think the President has made clear that he does not have the full \nand free discretion to simply release al-Qaida members and their fellow \ntravelers into the United States. Federal law expressly bars admission \nto the United States of anyone who is a member of a foreign terrorist \norganization. A Federal law we passed some years ago bars admission of \nany person who is a member of a foreign terrorist organization--pretty \ncommon sense, right? If you are going to have lawful immigration \npolicy, you don't want terrorists to be able to immigrating into the \ncountry. The law bars admission of anyone who has provided material \nsupport to a foreign terrorist organization, and it also bars from this \ncountry anyone who has received military-style training at a camp \noperated by one of these terrorist organizations. The United States \nCongress decided that these individuals, ones who have ties to or have \nassisted or who have been trained by groups such as al-Qaida pose a \ndanger to the American people and should not be admitted into this \ncountry. That congressional enactment is now the law. It is binding \nupon the President and the Attorney General, who is charged by the \nConstitution with enforcing the law.\n\n[[Page S5792]]\n\n  So when the President states he will not release detainees within the \nUnited States, I can only state that I would expect no less. The law \nrequires the President to bar admission to al-Qaida members or material \nsupporters or those who trained in a terrorist camp, and I think he \nwill follow that.\n  I note his speech also is rather selective, however, in how it cites \nto: ``The court order to release 17 Uighur detainees that took place \nlast fall.''\n  The President referred to a court order to release these Uighurs, but \nhe inexplicably failed to acknowledge what happened to that case on \nappeal. A lower district court judge ordered that they must be \nreleased, but the Federal appellate court reversed that order which \nwould have allowed these terrorist to be released into the United \nStates. This February, a couple of months ago in Kiyemba v. Obama, the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that \nthe district court did not have legal authority to order the release of \nthe Uighur detainees into this country. These are individuals who have \ntrained in a terrorist camp, a terrorist group that is connected to al-\nQaida. A month ago, the U.S. Department of Treasury reaffirmed the \ndetermination that they are a terrorist organization. The appeals court \ncould not have been more clear when it wrote:\n\n       Never in the history of habeas corpus has any court thought \n     it had the power to order an alien held overseas brought into \n     the sovereign territory of a Nation and then released into \n     the general population. As we have also said, in the United \n     States, who can come in and on what terms is the exclusive \n     province of the executive branches.\n\n  There are other things the President said today that I disagree with. \nFirst, President Obama committed himself to banning the enhanced \ninterrogation of al-Qaida detainees. I certainly oppose torture of any \ndetainees. But he went on to state: ``Some have argued'' that these \ntechniques ``were necessary to keep us safe,'' and he said he ``could \nnot disagree more.''\n  Well, that is not exactly accurate, I have to tell my colleagues.\n  On September 6, 2006, when President Bush announced the transfer of \n14 high-value al-Qaida detainees to Guantanamo, he also described \ninformation that the United States had obtained from these detainees as \na result of these enhanced interrogation programs. Most people agree \nmany of these enhanced techniques clearly are not torture. Some argue \nthat a few of the techniques may amount to torture; but many say they \nare not torture. We have a statute that prohibits torture and it \ndefines it pretty clearly.\n  President Bush noted then that Abu Zubaydah was captured by U.S. \nforces several months after the September 11 attack. Several months \nlater he was captured. Under interrogation he revealed that Khalid \nShaikh Mohammed was a principal organizer of the September 11 attacks. \nZubaydah also described a terrorist attack that al-Qaida operatives \nwere planning to launch inside this country--an attack of which the \nUnited States had no previous knowledge. Zubaydah described the \noperatives involved in this attack and where they were located. This \ninformation allowed the United States to capture these terrorists, one \nwhile he was traveling in the United States. Under enhanced \ninterrogation, Zubaydah also revealed the identity of another September \n11 plotter, Ramzi bin al Shibh, and provided information that led to \nhis capture. U.S. forces then interrogated him. Information that both \nhe and Zubaydah provided helped lead to the capture of Khalid Shaikh \nMohammed, the person who orchestrated the 9/11 attacks.\n  Khalid Shaikh Mohammed also provided information to help stop another \nplanned attack on the United States when he was interrogated. KMS \nprovided information that led to the capture of a terrorist named \nZubair, and KMS's interrogation also led to the identification and \ncapture of an entire 17-member Jemaah Islamiya terrorist cell in \nSoutheast Asia.\n  According to President Bush, information obtained as a result of \nenhanced interrogation techniques also helped stop a planned truck bomb \nattack on U.S. troops in Djibouti. Interrogation also helped stop a \nplanned car bomb attack on the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan, and it helped \nstop a plot to hijack passenger planes and crash them into Heathrow \nAirport in London. On September 6, President Bush said:\n\n       Information from terrorists in CIA custody has played a \n     role in the capture or questioning of nearly every single al-\n     Qaida member or associate detained by the United States and \n     its allies.\n\n  He concluded by noting that al-Qaida members subjected to \ninterrogation by U.S. forces have painted a picture of al-Qaida's \nstructure and financing, communications and logistics. They identified \nal-Qaida's travel routes and safe havens and explained how al-Qaida's \nsenior leadership communicates with its operatives in places such as \nIraq. They provided information that has allowed us to make sense of \ndocuments and computer records that have been seized in terrorist \nraids. They have identified voices in recordings of intercepted calls \nand helped us understand the meaning of potentially critical terrorist \ncommunications. Were it not for the information obtained, our \nintelligence community believes that al-Qaida and its allies would have \nsucceeded in launching another attack against the American homeland. By \ngiving us information about terrorist plans we would not get anywhere \nelse, this program has saved innocent lives.\n  Well, this was information obtained in the last administration as a \nresult of the enhanced interrogation techniques of al-Qaida detainees. \nIt allowed us to stop terrorist attacks. It allowed us to learn about \nal-Qaida communications, how it responded and operated. It even allowed \nus to capture Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the organizer of 9/11. I don't \nthink anybody here can reliably contend that this information was not \nvaluable. It was valuable.\n  We have to be careful how we conduct interrogations. I believe the \ndebate over this has helped us clarify the responsibility we have to \nnot participate in torture. But it does not mean that we cannot used \nenhanced techniques to move a person to the point they are providing \ninformation that can help protect this country. We have to be careful \nthat we don't go too far. We have a history of going too far in \nreaction to matters like this.\n  One of the things we did is we put a wall between the CIA and the \nFBI. We said the CIA should not deal with dangerous thugs around the \nworld to get information. After 9/11 it was clearly determined that \nboth of those were bad ideas, and we reversed them immediately.\n  Nobody in this Congress should suggest that we are incapable of \nmaking a mistake. But we have gone 8 years without an attack. That is \nsomething of significance. We should be proud of that. We have men and \nwomen in the CIA, in the FBI, and in the U.S. military, who are putting \ntheir lives on the line right now. I remember being, several years ago, \nin a foreign country with a history of some violence and terrorism. A \nman from the CIA met with us. He worked 7 days a week. He had dinner \nwith us at 8 o'clock. He said that was the earliest he had been off \nduty since he had been there.\n  They are putting their lives at risk for us, and we need to back them \nup when we can. If they make a mistake, they need to be held to account \nfor it.\n  Madam President, I see my colleague from Texas. I assume she would \nlike to make some remarks. I am not sure what the expectation is, but I \nwill just wrap up and say a few more things. This is an important \nissue. I just don't believe this issue has only one side. I have to \ntell you, I believed that the President's remarks today reflected a \nview that only he had the correct view of how these matters should be \nconducted, and that everybody else who disagreed had less decency than \nhe. I don't think there is any doubt that the work this Nation did \nafter 9/11 stopped further attacks and saved the lives of Americans. It \ncan and should be done, consistent with the laws of this country. But \nthat doesn't mean that unlawful terrorists--not legitimate prisoners of \nwar--cannot be subjected to interrogation. They can be and they have \nbeen. I trust that they will be in the future.\n  The President argued today that releasing the Office of Legal Counsel \nmemos from the Department of Justice and exposing the details of the \ninterrogation and actually tricks that CIA has used will not harm \nnational security because this President has decided not to use those \ntechniques. I simply point out that the war with al-Qaida will not\n\n[[Page S5793]]\n\nend with this administration, and future administrations--and even this \nadministration--may need to have access to reasonable interrogation \ntechniques, and providing this information is not the right thing.\n  It is odd that of all the material released, we have not had further \ninformation released from the intelligence agencies that would provide \nevidence of interrogations that have enabled us to stop other attacks \non our country. I don't know why they would not want to release that; \nthey want to release the techniques and a lot of other things.\n  When the President released the legal counsel's interrogation memos, \nhe excised certain information from the memos and left out other memos \nentirely. These other memos describe in detail the information that was \nobtained as a result of the enhanced interrogation of al-Qaida \ndetainees.\n  If the President really believes these interrogations don't work, I \nurge him to release these other memos, the ones Vice President Cheney \ncalled on to be released. If he believes in full transparency, why \ndon't we see that? We know some of it because it was in President \nBush's September 2006 remarks.\n  Madam President, to sum up, we are in a great national effort. We are \nnow sending 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan. I think President Obama \nstudied that carefully. I know he, like myself and most of us, doesn't \nlook forward to having to send more troops there. He decided it was \nimportant for America and our allies and stability in the region and \nthe world that they be sent there. This Congress supported that. So we \ncontinue the struggle. It is going to be a long time.\n  Intelligence is a critical component of our success against the war \nagainst the terrorists. That is what the 9/11 Commission told us. That \nis what the American people understood with clarity. Good intelligence \nprevents attacks and saves lives. Good intelligence is so valuable, it \nis almost invaluable. We have to be careful when we set about passing \nmore and more rules that chill the willingness of our investigators and \nmilitary people to do their job. As we have found from previous spasms, \nharm to our intelligence community can be the result of irrational, \nreactionary decisions. We didn't wisely consider this when we put a \nwall between the FBI and we limited the CIA in these dangerous areas of \nthe world in getting information. I share a deep concern about that.\n  There is one more thing I will conclude with. The President talked \nrepeatedly in his speech, in a most disparaging manner, about \nGuantanamo. I think inadvertently, and I am sure unintentionally, I \nbelieve he has cast a shadow over the fabulous men and women who serve \nus there, who participate in running a very fine facility. I would have \nappreciated it if he had taken the opportunity to clear the air about \nGuantanamo, our military prison.\n  Do you know that not one single person was subjected to waterboarding \nat Guantanamo? Actually, there were only three instances of it, all \ndone by our intelligence agency in a different place. None of that \noccurred there. I wish he had said that. I wish he had quoted from one \nof the investigative reports of what happened at Guantanamo.\n  This is what the finder found: They found one incident in which a \nseries of techniques were used during interrogation, not one of which \nwould have amounted to torturing that person, but all together they \nconcluded it put too much stress on that individual and that it \nviolated the law against torture. Well, that should not have been done.\n  But to hear the talk about Guantanamo, you would think we are \nwaterboarding people and torturing people constantly. That is just not \nwhat happened there. I have been there twice. These are great men and \nwomen down there trying to serve our country. They are absolutely \ncommitted to trying to extract as much good information as they could \nto protect America. They are not abusing detainees nor are they \nviolating the law. If they cross that line, they should be disciplined \nfor it. But it is not the kind of thing that is or was systematically \noccurring.\n  I wish the President had taken the opportunity--as Commander in Chief \nof our men and women who sends them into harm's way--to defend and \nexplain that a lot of the allegations about Guantanamo were exaggerated \nand false.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to add more \ncosponsors to amendment No. 1189. They are Senators Collins, Specter, \nKohl, Dorgan, Webb, Wicker, and Cornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, we are up to 35 Members, over one-\nthird of the Senate, who are saying we need to help the Chrysler \ndealers who got the blow on May 14 saying they had 3 weeks to basically \nshut down an entire dealership.\n  I have been talking to so many of my colleagues on the floor since I \noffered this amendment who have had stories of friends and people they \nknow, people who sometimes own the largest employer in a city or a \ncounty, and the hardship these people are facing. They are facing the \nlikelihood--unless we can get some closure--that they are going to \nlose, perhaps, their dealerships, and many are going into bankruptcy. \nThey all have big real estate investments, we know that. A car \ndealership has large amounts of real estate. Usually, it is very \nexpensive real estate. They still owe money, and they are in dire \nstraits right now.\n  What the negotiation is right now is this: I talked to the president \nof Chrysler this morning at 8:30. I have talked to the people at the \nWhite House who are the task force, the people overseeing the Chrysler \nand General Motors project, and to Senator Stabenow from Michigan, who \nhas been so helpful in trying to put this together and work with me in \na bipartisan way because while she has a Chrysler manufacturing plant, \nshe also has dealers in Michigan, as does Senator Levin. So the 35 \ncosponsors of the amendment are completely bipartisan because we all \nhave these stories, and we know these dealers are not getting a fair \nchance.\n  I talked to the President of Chrysler, and he said there would be a \nletter forthcoming where he would lay out how Chrysler is going to help \ntake the inventory off the books of these dealers that are being shut \ndown--789 across the country. We are talking about 40,000 people \nworking in these dealerships.\n  We are talking about a lot of lives that are being affected. He said \nthey would put out a letter today--he didn't say close of business, but \nwe agree we both want something out today--that would give these \ndealers a definitive plan so they would know what they could count on. \nNot having to worry about inventory was No. 1 on the list. These \ndealers buy these cars and trucks. They buy them. It is their expense. \nThey buy the parts. They buy the equipment that is unique for the \nrepair of these cars. So they have the risk. Yet they could be stuck \nwith 30 cars or 100 cars. This is sinking them.\n  I said: I hope you are going to give us something definitive. He said \nand I believe he is trying to do just that without in any way delaying \nor disrupting the exit out of bankruptcy, which is in everyone's \ninterest because the taxpayers are paying for the exit out of \nbankruptcy, and the quicker the better, that is for sure. But these \ndealers are about to go bankrupt too. We are talking about 40,000 \nemployees of these dealers. I think it is important that we look at \nthem as effective people.\n  It is now a quarter of six. I just talked again with the president of \nChrysler. He says we will have a letter within minutes. Actually, it \nwas 15 minutes ago that I talked with him. He said it would be just a \nfew minutes and they would get something to me.\n  I am going to tell you right now, Madam President, and I am going to \ntell all of my colleagues, we are not passing this bill. We are not \ngoing to shorten the time. We are not going to have a unanimous consent \nagreement until I have a letter that will assure these dealers of what \nthey can expect from Chrysler that will, hopefully, give them the \nclarity they need to be able to say: OK, I don't have to worry about \ncars and trucks and parts and specialized equipment. I can now worry \nabout making the payments on my real estate. I can worry about my \nemployees\n\n[[Page S5794]]\n\nwhom we are having to let go and worry about the effect on the \ncommunity. I can worry about all those things, but the big things that \ncan be handled by Chrysler and the task force will be handled. That is \nwhat I am looking for.\n  I am putting everyone on notice that this bill is not going to have \nany shortened time period under a UC until I can see that letter. \nSenator Stabenow stands with me to try to make sure we are doing \nsomething that will be adequate.\n  I will say, Senator Rockefeller, too, is very concerned. He and \nSenator Byrd sent a letter to the CEO of Chrysler and General Motors to \nobject strongly to the handling, the treatment of the dealers. Senator \nRockefeller as the chairman and I as the ranking member of the Commerce \nCommittee are now talking about having a hearing with those CEOs and \nrepresentatives of the dealership group as soon as we get back. That \nwill be the week after next.\n  I am waiting, hoping, with all of the good-faith efforts that have \nbeen made today by the White House, by the president of Chrysler and \nhis team, and all of the Senators who have signed on as cosponsors of \nthis amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Lincoln be added as a cosponsor \nof this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I think the Senator from Arkansas, \nwho is working very hard on trying to get an amendment into this bill \nas well. She is in the Chamber. I appreciate her also coming in and \nsaying: We are a bipartisan team, and we want results for these dealers \nwho have been so badly treated up to this point. I am hoping that will \nchange in the next few minutes and we will see a light at the end of \nthe tunnel for these dealers.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I state for the record that the \nCommerce Committee hearing on the auto dealerships has been set for \nJune 2 at 2:30 p.m. This is a very important hearing where we are going \nto have representation from the automobile manufacturers, as well as \nthe automobile dealers. I hope that will shed some light on what we can \ndo to help these dealers.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, we have an emergency situation \nall over, in about 20 or 25 States, that I explained to the Senate \nyesterday, involving imported Chinese drywall which, when exposed to \nheat and humidity, is emitting gases that are making people sick in \ntheir homes, that is in fact corroding all of the metal, that is going \nafter the copper tubing in the plumbing and the air conditioners--so \nmuch so that they are having to replace the air conditioners--in some \nhomes, over the course of the last 3 or 4 years, having to replace the \nair conditioner three times.\n  We had, in front of Senator Inouye's former committee, the Commerce \nCommittee, of which he obviously is still a member but he is now the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee--we had in front of the \ncommittee a panel of the people from the various agencies, and the \nrepresentatives from the Consumer Product Safety Commission as well as \nthe EPA wanted to do the next test. They did the first test and they \ncompared Chinese drywall to American drywall and they found out that \nwhat was different is that the Chinese drywall had sulfur, it had \nstrontium, and it had elements found in acrylic paint. But they drew no \nconclusions, so they want to do the next test.\n  The next test would be under controlled conditions, to put it in a \nsituation where they simulate heat of the United States summer, and \nhumidity, and then see the gases that are emitted from it and determine \nto what degree, then, are they harmful to people who are having all \nthese effects of respiratory problems, they can't breathe--it is \nexacerbating their allergies, it is exacerbating things such as \nasthma--and in some cases their pediatricians have said to the mom and \nthe daddy: Get these children out of the house. Yet they still have a \nmortgage payment and where are they going to go? If they don't have \nother family to move in with, they have to rent, yet still pay on the \nmortgage. And oh, by the way, the bank is not working with them to give \nthem some relief on their mortgage. So we have homeowners who, as we \nsay in the South, are in a fix; they do not know what to do.\n  We need to go to the second test. That second test is estimated to be \n$1.5 million.\n  Senator Landrieu, Senator Vitter, and a whole bunch of us had offered \nan amendment that was going to say it had to come out of the CPSC's \nfunds, no new appropriation, but we can't get this passed here since we \nare in gridlock over this supplemental appropriations bill and we are \ndown to the wire.\n  What I would like to do--and only by the gracious generosity of the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee--he has offered to indicate \nhis interest and willingness to make sure that the EPA and the CPSC are \nbeing directed by the Congress to do this test so we can get it to the \nnext step without wasting any more time.\n  The CPSC told us today, in the Commerce Committee, they have plenty \nof money to do it. The EPA said they have funds to do it. And they are \nboth willing to do it. The problem is we don't know, since they are \nmidlevel managers, if the head of the CPSC is going to be willing to do \nthis, since the head is a short termer and she has not been that \ncooperative in the past.\n  So I invite the very distinguished Senator from Hawaii, the chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee, to state if he, as he indicated so \ngraciously, would be willing to pour the full weight of the \nAppropriations Committee behind this effort not to waste any time and \nto have the EPA and CPSC do this test for the sake of the health of our \npeople.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I shall be honored and privileged to join the Senator in \nhis mission. It is a valid one and I hope one this full Senate can \napprove at some later date. I will be most pleased to join him in any \nsort of letter he will be writing to the authorities. I can assure my \ncolleague that the full impact of my office will be at his disposal.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. The Senator is so gracious, and he always has \nbeen, I say to my colleague, Senator Inouye.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Florida yield?\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Yes, absolutely, to the distinguished Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I happen to chair the subcommittee responsible for the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission and I have listened to the Senator's \npresentation. The Senator told me last night that some of this suspect \nChinese drywall may be in my home State so I want to get ahead of the \ncurve and join him in this effort. Let's get this analyzed as quickly \nas possible, and if it poses any danger we ought to know it. I put the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission on notice, with Senator Inouye and \nyourself and many others, that we expect them to take this very \nseriously on a timely basis.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. With those very generous assurances by these \nesteemed Senators, I am grateful, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n\n[[Page S5795]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Human Rights\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, for the past year, I have been working to \nbring attention to the human rights abuses occurring around the world, \nincluding little-known political prisoners who are languishing in \nprisons in farflung reaches.\n  Too many jails still overflow with prisoners of conscience whose only \ncrime is to expect basic freedom, human rights, and due process. I \nundertook this effort with the understanding that it would not be easy. \nI have dealt with these governments in the past, and many times they \nare unresponsive. Few repressive regimes want to address human rights \nrecords, and in some of the smaller countries where these human right \nabuses are taking place, it takes quite an effort to get their \nattention.\n  Through our annual human rights reporting at the State Department, \nour diplomacy and steady public pressure on basic human rights, the \nUnited States has traditionally been a champion and source of hope \naround the world for those suffering human rights violations.\n  I might add, parenthetically, that I wish to thank Senator Patrick \nLeahy for, again, this morning reauthorizing my Subcommittee on Human \nRights and the Law, a subcommittee which I chaired over the last 2 \nyears.\n  I worried that in recent years America has not raised its voice \nenough in these kinds of cases, and we should not forget that for some \npeople whose lives seem so desperate, a little effort on our part can \nmake a dramatic difference.\n  Take, for example, the appeal made by Burmese Nobel Prize winner Aung \nSan Suu Kyi, who has remained under house arrest in Burma for most of \nthe last 19 years. She is in deteriorating health and was apparently \nmoved to a notorious prison this week.\n  I think this is clearly a situation where we know she needs our \nattention and help. Most people have read the account in the newspapers \nabout her problems and understand she was victimized by an American who \nsomehow managed to get into her home, and in entering her home and \nstaying overnight, violated the law, or apparently violated the law.\n  I certainly hope, at the end of the day, that her house arrest will \ncome to an end and this poor woman will be given a chance to have \nfreedom which she richly deserves. I am not going to read this entire \nstatement, as it contains many names of foreign origin that may be \ndifficult for me to pronounce and for our reporter to keep up with.\n  Today, I am pleased to report the release of one of the first of the \npolitical prisoners my efforts have focused on, specifically a case in \nTurkmenistan.\n  Earlier this year I raised my concerns with the Government of \nTurkmenistan about four Turkmen political prisoners. These prisoners \nhave languished in jail for years after being convicted of spurious \ncharges at trials that failed to meet minimum international standards. \nSome have families with children; some are of advanced years and \nreportedly in poor health.\n  I had hoped that the new government in Turkmenistan would take \nimportant and forward-thinking steps toward releasing political \nprisoners from an earlier era.\n  Earlier this month, one such political prisoner in fact, the longest \nserving political prisoner in Turkmenistan Mukhametkuli Aymuradov, was \nunconditionally released after 14 long years of confinement.\n  I want commend this decision and strongly encourage the Government of \nTurkmenistan to take similar actions for all other remaining political \nprisoners, including: Gulgeldy Annaniyazov, a long-time political \ndissident who was arrested, apparently on charges that he did not \npossess valid travel documents, and sentenced to 11 years imprisonment; \nand Annakurban Amanklychev and Sapardurdy Khadzhiev, members of the \nhuman-rights organization Turkmenistan Helsinki Foundation, who were \nsentenced to 6-to-7 years in jail for reportedly ``gathering slanderous \ninformation to spread public discontent.''\n  The freeing of Mr. Aymuradov is an important first step, but more are \nneeded.\n  I want to conclude by returning to the still unresolved case with \nwhich I started this effort, that of journalist Chief Ebrima Manneh \nfrom the small west African Nation of The Gambia.\n  Mr. Manneh was a reporter for the Gambian newspaper, the Daily \nObserver. He was allegedly detained in July 2006 by plainclothes \nNational Intelligence Agency officials after he tried to republish a \nBBC report mildly critical of President Yahya Jammeh.\n  He has been held incommunicado, without charge or trial, for 3 years. \nAmnesty International considers him a prisoner of conscience and has \ncalled for his immediate release.\n  Three years without the government even acknowledging it took one of \nits own citizens, without telling his family where he is being held, \nthis is reprehensible. It is outrageous.\n  The Media Foundation for West Africa, a regional independent \nnongovernmental organization based in Ghana, filed suit on Mr. Manneh's \nbehalf in the Community Court of Justice of the Economic Community of \nWest Africa States in Nigeria. This court has jurisdiction to determine \ncases of human rights violations that occur in any member state, \nincluding The Gambia.\n  In June 2008 the Court declared the arrest and detention of Mr. \nManneh illegal and ordered his immediate release. A petition has also \nbeen filed on his behalf with the United Nations Human Rights Council's \nWorking Group on Arbitrary Detention, and a decision from this body is \nexpected soon.\n  Yet despite the judgment of the court, as well as repeated requests \nby Mr. Manneh's father, fellow journalists, and me, the Gambian \nGovernment continues to deny any involvement in his arrest or knowledge \nof his whereabouts.\n  Mr. President, America has been wrongly defined by our critics since \n9/11. We need to define our values as a caring Nation, dedicated to \nhelping improve the lives of others overseas, including those living \nunder repressive governments. Doing so is an important statement of who \nwe are as a Nation.\n  Five other Senators, including Senators Feingold, Casey, Murray, \nLieberman, and Kennedy, joined me in a letter last month to Gambian \nPresident Jammeh about the detention of a Mr. Manneh. Our request was \nsimple, and I hope the Gambian leadership will respond to it.\n  We are in contact with them in an effort to try to come to some \nreasonable conclusion to this situation. Doing so is so important for \nthe people whose lives are at risk and for our reputation in the world.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Trade Policies\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, our economy, as we know so well, struggles \nwith massive job losses, a shrinking middle class, and an economic \ncrisis that undermines the pursuit for far too many Americans and the \nAmerican dream.\n  In 2006, voters in my State of Ohio, from Marietta to Cleveland, from \nVan Wert to Youngstown, spoke out with one voice demanding a change in \nour Nation's trade policy. In 2008, they reaffirmed that call with good \nreason, as Senator Obama, again, pointed out the problems with Bush \ntrade policy that our trade deficit was literally $2 billion a day \nduring the last 2 years in the Bush administration.\n  Ohio has suffered more than 200,000 manufacturing job losses since \n2001. The first President Bush pointed out that a billion dollars in \ntrade deficit translates into 13,000 lost jobs. Do the math. For too \nlong we have been without a coherent trade strategy with no real \nmanufacturing policy.\n  Most of our trade deficit is due to a manufacturing deficit. Current \npolicies have failed to deliver on good jobs and on stability.\n  Today, in committee, the Senate Finance Committee held a hearing on \nthe\n\n[[Page S5796]]\n\nPanama Free Trade Agreement. I do not think the American people are \ndemanding a trade agreement with Panama. What I hear people in Ohio \ndemanding is a new direction. I hear people demanding change on trade, \nchange on our economic policy, change on our Nation's economic \nstrategy. I hear people asking lots of questions about the economic \ncourse we are on.\n  I hear people worried about our manufacturing base. I hear Ohioans \nsay that for every day not spent enforcing trade law and not reforming \nour trade policy, there are manufacturers eliminating jobs.\n  Since 2000, the United States has lost 4 million manufacturing jobs, \nnot all because of trade but for a lot of reasons--but much because of \ntrade. In the last decade, some 40,000 factories have closed \nnationwide, 40,000 factories have shut down.\n  A continuing loss of U.S. manufacturing means more unsafe imports, a \ngreater dependence on foreign factories to produce both our everyday \nconsumer goods and for our national security and military hardware.\n  A 2008 EPI study found the United States has lost more than 2.3 \nmillion jobs since 2001 just as a result of our trade deficit with \nChina. Again, our trade deficit with China is over $200 billion. The \nfirst President Bush said that a billion-dollar trade deficit was \n13,000 lost jobs.\n  China uses illegal trade practices, such as dumping, such as \nsubsidies, such as currency manipulation, to undercut U.S. \nmanufacturers.\n  When Congress approved China's PNTR, Permanent Normal Trade \nRelations--when Congress approved the legislation to start the ball \nrolling on China's inclusion into the World Trade Organization, then it \nmade commitments, China made commitments to gain greater access to U.S. \nmarkets. They got the access to the U.S. markets, but, unfortunately, \nChina has not been held to those commitments.\n  Think about toxic toys, think about the toys with lead-based paint on \nthem that came into the United States, think about the ingredients made \nin China put in Heparin, the blood thinner that killed several people \nin Toledo, OH, and others around the Nation.\n  These are the trade issues people want action on, on jobs, on safety, \non consumer protection. These are the trade issues I hope the Obama \nadministration is focused on, not the trade agreement with Panama.\n  Let's talk for a moment about the Panama agreement. It is, of course, \nan agreement negotiated under the Bush administration's fast-track \nnegotiating. This is not an Obama trade agreement, this is a Bush trade \nagreement. As we remember, Senator Obama in his campaign was very \ncritical of the Bush administration's trade policy.\n  The Presiding Officer was in the House of Representatives in those \ndays, as I was, in 2002, when fast track--the negotiating authority \nextended to President Bush to give him more power to negotiate trade \nagreements--passed the House by three votes in the middle of the night, \nand the rollcall was kept open for over 2 hours in the last week before \nthe August recess.\n  The Panama agreement was one of the last deals negotiated and signed \nby President Bush. Under the fast-track authority given to him that \nnight in 2007, there were important improvements to the labor and the \nenvironment chapters of the Panama agreement. This reflected the work \nof many in Congress, including the Finance Committee in the Senate, the \nWays and Means Committee in the House.\n  Yet there remains serious concerns about this agreement. Many in \nCongress have expressed concerns about the safe haven Panama affords to \ncompanies looking to skip out on their taxes. What does that mean? It \nmeans there is a way to evade taxes by moving business activity \noffshore.\n  Yesterday, Congressman Sander Levin and Congressman Lloyd Doggett \nwrote the Panama's serious tax evasion issues require a serious remedy \nbefore Congress can even consider the Panama trade agreement.\n  The issues about tax evasion are even more serious when the Panama \nFree Trade Agreement includes rules on corporate investor protections. \nThese are rules that shift more power to corporations and away from the \ndemocratic process. In other words, these trade agreements have loaded \nup in them all kinds of protection for the drug companies, the \ninsurance companies, the energy companies, not so many protections for \nworkers, for the environment, for consumer protection, for food safety.\n  It is part of the old model that gives protections to the large \ncompanies, protections to large corporations, protections to Wall \nStreet, while not ensuring protections for workers and food and product \nsafety.\n  Panama and the free-trade agreement, as it is written, means more of \nthe same failed trade policies rejected by working families across the \nNation. For too long we have seen the pattern: the North American Free \nTrade Agreement, NAFTA; the Central American Free Trade Agreement, \nCAFTA; China PNTR, the Panama Free Trade Agreement.\n\n  We need to stop the pattern where the only protectionism in free-\ntrade agreements are protecting the drug companies, protecting the oil \nindustry, protecting the financial services companies, many that have \ncreated the economic turmoil we now face.\n  Let me explain it another way. This is not actually the Panama Free \nTrade Agreement, but it is about this length. It looks about that much. \nIf we were concerned with tariffs, which is what they always say when \nthey talk about the Panama trade agreement, this trade agreement, to \neliminate tariffs on American products in Panama, this trade agreement \nwould only need to be about three or four pages.\n  But it is much longer. You know why? You have to have this section \nfor protection for oil companies. You have to have this section for the \nprotections for the insurance companies. You have to have this section \nfor the protection for the banks. You have to have this section for the \nprotection for the drug companies.\n  But there is nothing left protecting consumers, protecting food \nsafety, protecting workers, protecting the environment. These are \nprotectionist trade agreements, all right, but they are protecting \nagain the drug companies, the insurance companies and other financial \ninstitutions and others.\n  If this trade agreement were solely about trade and tariffs, \nliterally, it would be only this long. It would simply be a schedule of \nhow you eliminate these tariffs, just repeal the tariffs that apply to \nAmerican goods that are sold in Panama.\n  When people say Panama has access to the U.S. market, all we are \nasking is to eliminate the tariffs so we have access to the Panama \nmarket. People who tell you that are the same lobbyists around here who \nrepresent the drug companies and the insurance companies and the banks \nand the oil companies. Remember that.\n  For too long we have seen the status quo in trade policy that gives \nprotections to big oil and big business. That is not acceptable.\n  A status quo trade policy that suppresses the standards of living for \nAmerican workers, and I would also say suppresses the standard of \nliving of what we should do in the developing nations for workers, that \nis not acceptable. A status quo trade policy that fails to effect real \nchange on how we do business in China is not acceptable.\n  For 8 years, the Bush trade policies were, in fact, protectionist--\nprotecting the oil industry, protecting the insurance companies and the \nbanks and the drug companies. They were protectionist and they were \nwrong-headed.\n  We should not continue these Bush trade policies. That is what is \ndisturbing about this body. Even considering the Panama Free Trade \nAgreement, we know the Bush economic policies did not work and look at \nthe damage to our economy. Look at our trade deficit. Look at our \nbudget deficit. Why would we adopt a Bush trade agreement when we know \nits trade policies failed us abysmally?\n  In November 2008, voters from Toledo to Athens, from Lorain all the \nway down south to Ironton demanded real change, not symbolic change. We \nneed agreements to be reshaped by the Obama administration, not just \ntinkered with around the edges and then stamped ``approved.'' Make no \nmistake, as Senator Dorgan from North Dakota says, we want trade, and \nwe want plenty of it. But we don't want trade under rules that protect \ninsurance companies, drug companies, financial institutions, and the \noil industry. We want agreements that work for workers and\n\n[[Page S5797]]\n\nconsumers, for children, with safer toys. It is not a question of if we \ntrade but how we trade and who benefits from trade. We must create a \ntrade policy that helps workers and businesses thrive, especially small \nbusinesses and manufacturing, that will raise standards abroad, \nincrease exports, and rebuild middle-class families in Ohio \ncommunities.\n  Our new trade policy must provide critical solutions to the Nation's \neconomic recovery strategy. Reforming trade policy starts with a \ncomprehensive review of the overall trade framework. We need a review \nof trade negotiating objectives. That is what I am bringing to the \nfloor in legislation. We need a review of the programs responsible for \nenforcing trade rules and promoting exports. I am asking the GAO to \nlook at many of these questions as we prepare for the trade act and \nother legislation we will consider. It is only one step.\n  We have a responsibility to deliver on the demand to change trade \nstrategy. Recycling of Bush-negotiated trade agreements such as that \nwith Panama is not a first step. It is the wrong step. The Obama \nadministration, I hope, will join with Congress in review and reform of \nour trade strategy. The days of turning away from our responsibility \nare over.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1189\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the Senator from Michigan, Ms. \nStabenow, and I have been working all day with the Chrysler president \nand his team and with the White House and their team and the task force \nand their team to try to give the assurances to the 789 dealers who are \ngoing to be put out of business across our country by Chrysler--with \nthe 3-week notification--that they will be able to recoup the cost of \nthe inventory that has been left on their property and in their \ndealerships.\n  I said I was going to hold up any shortening of time period for this \nbill to be considered until I got a letter of assurance. The original \namendment, for which we have 37 cosponsors, was to extend the time by 3 \nweeks to allow the dealers to be able to sell more inventory, have a \nmore orderly transition.\n  In fact, what we have done, in consultation with the dealers, I think \nis going to be much better. It is not everything they had hoped for, \nbut if there is good faith in this effort, it is going to be good for \nthe dealers. But it will take good faith.\n  Here is the letter the president of Chrysler, James Press, has sent \nto me. And Senator Stabenow as well has been one of the people who has \nbeen talking about this and negotiating.\n  The letter says:\n\n       Dear Senator Hutchison:\n       I assure you that our process for redistributing the \n     product from OldCo dealers--\n\n  Who are the old company dealers who are going to be put out of \nbusiness--\n\n     to NewCo dealers--\n\n  Who are the dealers who will survive--\n\n     is designed to assure that products flow quickly and \n     efficiently from every OldCo dealer. As part of this process, \n     we will ensure that the OldCo dealers receive a fair and \n     equitable value for virtually all of their outstanding \n     vehicle and parts inventory. We have more than 200 \n     representatives in the field that are working to ensure that \n     we make good on this commitment as quickly as is practical. \n     We have a very robust system in place to manage the sales to \n     NewCo dealers as well as the inspection and shipment to the \n     new dealer.\n       Thanks to your input today we have added a new set of \n     assurances and information for the OldCo dealers, with the \n     intention of removing some of the uncertainty that naturally \n     surrounds this process. Each OldCo dealer will receive a \n     daily report which specifically outlines each unit of \n     inventory and its place in the transition process.\n       We share the objective of selling these vehicles as quickly \n     as possible to protect residual values. We are committed to \n     sell every unit possible by June 9, prior to resumption of \n     production [of the company].\n       Thank you for your time and interest today. Our goal is to \n     ensure that every dealer realizes a soft landing and is able \n     to transition smoothly.\n\n  Senator Stabenow and I called Mr. Press for a clarification of some \nof the parts of this letter. The biggest concern, of course, that the \ndealers have is getting the inventory they have paid for off their \nbooks. That is their biggest concern.\n  We were assured that the 200 representatives who are going out to \nhelp this orderly and quick transition will make every effort to \nexpedite the transition to the surviving dealerships as quickly as \npossible. This will include specialized tools, as well as parts, \ninventory, and outstanding vehicles.\n  I said: What happens after June 9? Because the June 9 deadline is \ngood when you are trying to expedite, but then you are not saying that \nyou will not keep helping after June 9. They said: Absolutely not. Mr. \nPress said they will certainly continue to help until every part of \nthis transition of this inventory is disposed of. And the help will be \nthere after June 9. That was the assurance that was given.\n  The major thing that has happened that has been helpful is that GMAC \nhas received--as we all know because it is public--in the range of $7.5 \nbillion for financing, which will be available to the new surviving \ndealerships--Chrysler, and I am sure General Motors as well--and so the \nnew dealers will have the ability to finance the taking of the \ninventory off of the dealers who are going to be put out of business.\n  So that is probably one of the most important components here because \nthere had to be a lending source for the new dealers to absorb the new \ninventory.\n  I think the biggest concern left for the dealers is the floor plan \nloans they have for the inventory that is there and how that would \nchange after June 9. I asked that question. And basically the answer \nis: We are going to try to do everything possible to get these \ntransitions out before June 9 so you will not have, hopefully, the \nproblem of loans being modified.\n  So that is the essence of the conversation and questions I asked for \nclarification. I ended by saying that I think we are much further ahead \nnow than we were when the letter arrived on May 14 to the dealers \nsaying: We are not going to buy inventory, we are not going to buy \nparts, and we are not going to buy the specialized tools, and you have \n3 weeks to deal with this. We have come a long way from there.\n  I said to Mr. Press, and to his team, that I did appreciate this \neffort and the better clarification, but we will know in 2 weeks if the \ngood faith that is represented in this letter is, in fact, implemented. \nAnd they agreed with that.\n  I think we have made a step in the right direction--when my dealers \ncall and say: Under the circumstances, it is not what we had wanted, \nbut we have been treated as fairly as possible and have certainly \ngotten the relief from the burden of inventory so we can deal with the \nemployees who will not be with us anymore, and the land and the real \nestate and the other costs of closing an ongoing business.\n  So I will say to my colleague from Michigan, I do not think any of \nthis would have happened without her stepping in. And hands-on efforts \nwere made to bring the White House in, Chrysler in, my staff, her \nstaff. So it was certainly a team effort.\n  I want to thank the 37 cosponsors of my amendment because I think \nthat was a clear indication that over one-third of this Senate was not \ngoing to let this go the way it had been left at the time. So if there \nis good will in this whole effort for the next 2 weeks, then I am \noptimistic it will have a good result.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter written to me \nby James Press today be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     Chrysler,\n\n                                                     May 21, 2009.\n     Hon. Kay Bailey Hutchison,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Hutchison: I assure you that our process for \n     redistributing the product from OldCo dealers to NewCo \n     dealers is designed to assure that products flow quickly and \n     efficiently from every OldCo dealer. As part of this process, \n     we will ensure that the OldCo dealers receive a fair and \n     equitable value for virtually all of their outstanding \n     vehicle and parts inventory. We have more than 200 \n     representatives in the\n\n[[Page S5798]]\n\n     field that are working to ensure that we make good on this \n     commitment as quickly as is practical. We have a very robust \n     system in place to manage the sales to NewCo dealers as well \n     as the inspection and shipment to the new dealer.\n       Thanks to your input today we have added a new set of \n     assurances and information for the OldCo dealers, with the \n     intention of removing some of the uncertainty that naturally \n     surrounds this process. Each OldCo dealer will receive a \n     daily report which specifically outlines each unit of \n     inventory and its place in the transition process.\n       We share the objective of selling these vehicles as quickly \n     as possible to protect residual values. We are committed to \n     sell every unit possible by June 9, prior to resumption of \n     production.\n       Thank you for your time and interest today. Our goal is to \n     ensure that every dealer realizes a soft landing and is able \n     to transition smoothly.\n       Please feel free to contact me anytime.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   James E. Press,\n                                        Vice Chairman & President.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I yield for Senator Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Of course I want to thank Senator Hutchison. Without her leadership, \nwithout her effort and her amendment, we would not have what I believe \nand am very hopeful will be an important, positive solution to help our \ndealers rather than leaving them on their own in the middle of what has \nbeen a very horrible time as it relates to Chrysler and General Motors \nand actually the auto industry around the world in terms of what has \nbeen happening.\n  I thank Senator Hutchison because she has been very tenacious and \nvery effective, and it has been my pleasure to partner with my friend \nfrom Texas to achieve something that I believe is positive.\n  Before we started this process, the dealers were on their own. That \nwas wrong. As a result of working together, and I should say working \nwith Chrysler--and I appreciate all of their efforts in, obviously, an \nextremely difficult time for them. I appreciate their working with us. \nI appreciate President Obama and the auto task force for being the \nlinchpin in terms of giving us a solution in terms of what they were \nable to do around financing. And I thank all of our colleagues who have \nbeen involved.\n  But we basically have two things. We have the dealers being able to \nget floor plan financing, which we have been working on for a long \ntime--to be able to get that so, as Senator Hutchison said, the 75 \npercent of the dealers who will remain in business will have the \nopportunity to finance the purchase of the acquisition of inventory \nfrom the dealers who are going to be going out of business.\n  The second thing is there is now a plan and a commitment to work \nthrough this process in terms of inventory and being able to support \nthe dealers in a very difficult time.\n  I feel very close to this issue, not just because I represent \nMichigan, an automobile State, but my father and grandfather were car \ndealers in a small town in northern Michigan. I grew up on a car lot. \nMy first job was washing the automobiles on the dealership lot. I know \nwhat this is about: small businesses all across Michigan, all across \nthis country, folks who do sponsor the Little League teams. Senator \nHutchison and I were talking about the ads in the paper, and the \nsupporting the community, and all that goes on. I lived it. I saw \nit. It is absolutely critical we do everything we can in this \nincredibly difficult time to support them.\n\n  So I am very pleased we have been able to come together with this. I \ndo wish to put in one little plug for when we come back from this next \nweek. Senator Brownback and I are offering a bipartisan effort in the \nform of an amendment to incentivize purchasing vehicles which, I \nbelieve, is really the second stage to helping these dealers. It has \nbeen dubbed the ``cash for clunkers'' or fleet modernization. The \nbottom line is we want to be able to incentivize getting people back \ninto those dealerships to be able to buy automobiles. I am going to put \na big sign out saying ``Buy American'' because that is what we want \neverybody to do.\n  So I am hopeful phase 2 will come after the break. This is very \nimportant. I would again say it would not have happened without Senator \nHutchison and all of her leadership. It has been my great pleasure to \nwork with her in crafting this solution.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to thank again the Senator from \nMichigan. It was certainly a difficult position for her to, of course, \nhave the manufacturers--GM and Chrysler--but also to have the dealers \nthat are all over Michigan. I think the tireless efforts we had all day \ntoday will hopefully end in the next 2 weeks with the implementation of \nas fair as possible dealings with the dealers that we could possibly \nhave.\n  Mr. President, I wish to add Senator Thune as a cosponsor of \namendment No. 1189.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague, and I so \nappreciate the 39 cosponsors of this amendment who stepped up to the \nplate and said this has to be fixed. In the end, that made a big \ndifference. I wish to thank my colleagues who have been very \nbipartisan.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask it be in order to make a point of \norder en bloc against the pending amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Therefore, Mr. President, I make a point of order en bloc \nthat all pending amendments are not in order postcloture except the \nfollowing: Leahy, No. 1191; Brown, No. 1161; Corker, No. 1173; Kaufman, \nNo. 1179, as modified; McCain, No. 1188; and Lieberman-Graham, No. \n1157; further, that amendments No. 1161, No. 1173, No. 1188, and No. \n1157 be modified with changes at the desk, and once those are modified, \nthe above six amendments, as modified if modified, be agreed to en \nbloc; that the motions to reconsider be laid on the table en bloc; and \nthe following amendments be considered and agreed to in the order \nlisted: Lincoln, No. 1181 and Hutchison amendment No. 1176, as \nmodified; and that the motion to reconsider be laid on the table; \nfurther, that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and the Senate \nproceed to vote on passage of the bill; that upon passage, the Senate \ninsist on its amendment, request a conference with the House, and that \nthe Chair be authorized to appoint conferees, with the Senate \nAppropriations Committee appointed as conferees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, regretfully I have to reserve the right \nto object. I have to check on one thing. Shall we enter a quorum call?\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. I renew my unanimous consent request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Amendments Nos. 1167, 1189, 1143, 1147, 1156, 1164, 1144, and 1139 \nare non-germane, and they fall for that reason.\n  Amendment No. 1185 is ``sense of the Senate'' language and is \ntherefore dilatory under cloture.

Mr. President, this week, Senator Cornyn insisted on \noffering an amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill \nthat is most unfortunate. It is an amendment that is so broad in scope \nand, I believe, wrongheaded, that I felt I should note my disagreement. \nAs a former prosecutor, I am troubled that the Senate is being called \nupon to prejudge matters that have yet to be fully investigated. This \namendment is a classic example of putting the cart before the horse.\n  I have proposed a Commission of Inquiry in order to move these \ndebates outside of partisan politics. An independent and nonpartisan \npanel taking a comprehensive approach is better positioned to determine \nwhat happened. Before the Senate starts pontificating about who should \nand should not be investigated, sanctioned, ethically disciplined or \nprosecuted, would it not be a good idea to know what took place?\n  I was encouraged to hear Senator Cornyn call for ``an end to the \npoisonous environment that has overtaken the debate about detention and \ninterrogation policy in the aftermath of September 11th, 2001.'' I \nagree and that is why I proposed taking the matter out of partisanship \nand away from political institutions. That is not what the amendment \ndoes, however. First, Senator Cornyn styled this as a sense of the \nSenate making overly broad findings, now he has stripped those findings \nfrom this amendment, and is doing something even more nonsensical, \ntrying to prohibit the use of funds for something that funds are not \neven provided for in the emergency supplemental.\n  An amendment politicizing decisions about investigations and \nprosecutions is not the right approach. We should have closed the book \non efforts to have partisan interests infect Federal law enforcement \ndecisions when we lifted\n\n[[Page S5800]]\n\nthe veil on the Bush White House's manipulation of U.S. attorney \nfirings. Some of us have worked very hard to restore the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice to be an institution worthy of its name and to \nagain command the respect of the American people.\n  Senator Cornyn spoke on the floor this week about learning together \nfrom our past mistakes. I, again, invite all Senators from all parts of \nthe political spectrum to join my call for a nonpartisan investigation \nto do just that.\n  The Justice Department has yet to finish a 5-year inquiry regarding \nwhether some of the lawyers responsible for the Office of Legal Counsel \nopinions that justified brutality acted in ways that failed to meet \nprofessional and ethical standards. It was a Republican ranking member \non the Judiciary Committee who earlier this year said that if the news \nreports of how those memoranda came to be generated are true, there may \nhave been criminal conduct involved. President Obama and the Attorney \nGeneral have been very forthright in saying that those who relied on \nand followed the legal advice in interrogating prisoners would not be \nprosecuted.\n  What needs to be determined, and has not, is how we came to a place \nwhere the United States of America tortured people in its custody in \nviolation of our laws. Those legal opinions have been withdrawn. One of \nthe earliest was withdrawn by the Bush administration in advance of the \nconfirmation hearing on Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General, and \nothers were limited in the final days of the Bush administration. What \nwe do not know and what this amendment is geared toward covering for, \nis the role of the former Vice President and his staff, the role of the \nBush White House in generating those opinions legalizing brutal \ninterrogations.\n  Last week, the Judiciary Committee held our most recent hearing into \nthese matters. I thank Senator Whitehouse for chairing the hearing \nbefore the Subcommittee on Administrative Oversight and the Courts. \nPhilip Zelikow testified about how dissent over the legal \njustifications and implementation of these practices was stifled and \noverridden. Ali Soufan, the FBI interrogator of Abu Zubaydah, testified \nabout his success using traditional interrogation techniques, and about \nhow ineffective and counterproductive the use of extreme practices was \nin that case. And Professor David Luban critiqued the released \nmemoranda as legally and ethically dishonest.\n  Last week also evidenced, yet again, why the approach of an \nindependent, nonpartisan review is the right one. Partisans defending \nthe Bush-Cheney administration's actions chose not to look for the \ntruth, but to mount partisan attacks. They have succeeded in fulfilling \nthe prophecy they created--that any effort to consider these matters \nwould break down into partisan recriminations--by themselves doing just \nthat. They elevated the minor role of a former minority member of the \nHouse Committee on Intelligence into their principle concern, thereby \nignoring the driving force of the former Vice President, other \nofficials in the Bush-Cheney administration, and the complicity of the \nRepublican congressional officials who were in control of both the \nHouse and the Senate. They raised straw men, went on witch hunts, and \nsought to distract from the fundamental underlying facts. All they \nreally succeeded in demonstrating is that they will continue to view \nthese matters through a partisan lens, and that they have yet to show \nany willingness to join in a fair, nonpartisan inquiry. Their recent \nactions reinforce why we need the independent, nonpartisan inquiry for \nwhich I have been calling over the last several months.\n  For those who have reflexively opposed my proposal for a \ncomprehensive, nonpartisan, independent inquiry, I ask these questions: \nIf we never find the truth and understand the mistakes we have made, \nwhat incentive is there to avoid them in the future? What guarantee is \nthere that the Government will not repeat the same mistakes? What \nincentive will future administrations have to respect the very rule of \nlaw that distinguishes us as a nation? The risk that the past will \nagain be prologue is too great to take simply because it is not easy to \nface the truth.\n  I continue to believe that we must know what happened, and why, to \nensure that America does not go down this dark road, again. Before we \nturn the page, we need to read the page. We should proceed without \npartisanship, not as Republican or Democratic politicians, but as \nAmericans who recognize, as Philip Zelikow testified last week, that \ntorture was ``a collective failure and it was a mistake.''\n  During the last several weeks, we have seen the release of the Senate \nArmed Services report documenting the complicity of top Bush-Cheney \nadministration officials. News reports have indicated that in April \n2003, after the invasion of Iraq, the U.S. arrested a top officer in \nSaddam Hussein's security force, and that some acting on behalf of then \nVice President Cheney urged the use of waterboarding in an effort to \ncoerce a ``confession'' supporting the link between al-Qaida and Iraq. \nThat link, of course, has proven to be an illusory justification for \nthe war, as were the nonexistent stockpiles of nuclear weapons and \nothers weapons of mass destruction. Likewise, COL Larry Wilkerson, \nformer chief of staff to President Bush's first Secretary of State, has \nwritten that these brutal interrogations, conducted in the spring of \n2002 before the legal authorizations of the OLC memoranda were crafted, \nwere aimed at the ``discovery of a smoking gun linking Iraq and al \nQaida.'' Perhaps these reports help explain why former Vice President \nCheney continues to adamantly support these discredited practices. \nPerhaps they explain why the proposed amendment's language is so vague \nwith regard to those who, in its words, ``provided input into the legal \nopinions.''\n  There are strong passions on all sides. It is not only former Vice \nPresident Cheney and his apologists who feel strongly. There are those \nwho will not be satisfied by anything less than prosecutions for war \ncrimes. I have always believed that there is a fundamental middle \nground, one that focuses on the most important issue at stake--finding \nout what happened and why.\n  I appreciate the support of so many who have rallied to this idea of \na nonpartisan commission and a comprehensive review of what took place. \nAmbassador Thomas Pickering and Philip Zelikow, the executive director \nof the 9/11 Commission and a former State Department counselor, have \nboth testified in favor of this idea. Former Bush administration \nofficial Alberto Mora, and the former FBI Director under President \nReagan, Judge William Sessions, have both recognized the need for \naccountability. Distinguished former military officers, who are \nfamiliar with commissions of inquiry, have been supportive. These \nofficers include ADM Lee Gun and MG Antonio Taguba, as well as the \nNational Institute of Military Justice. Senators Feingold and \nWhitehouse, both members of the Senate Judiciary and Intelligence \nCommittees, have strongly endorsed the idea, as has Senator Robert \nByrd. The Speaker of the House has spoken favorably about getting to \nthe bottom of these matters, and she has shown her willingness to \ncooperate with such an inquiry.\n  Human rights leaders and organizations have endorsed the approach, \nincluding Amnesty International, the Constitution Project, the \nInternational Center for Transitional Justice, Human Rights Watch, \nPhysicians for Human Rights, the Open Society Institute, the Brennan \nCenter, Human Rights First, and others. Prominent religious leaders \nsuch as those represented by the National Religious Campaign Against \nTorture, which is composed of a broad spectrum of religious \ndenominations, support this idea.\n  Thoughtful commentators like Jon Meachem, Nicolas Kristof, Tom Ricks, \nFrank Rich, and Maureen Dowd have come to endorse a nonpartisan \ncommission. Editorials in support of a nonpartisan commission have \nappeared over the last several weeks in The New York Times, The \nWashington Post, the Los Angeles Times, Newsweek, and in Vermont's \nRutland Herald.\n  Last week, the Attorney General of the United States testified that \nthe Justice Department would, of course, cooperate with such a \ncommission were Congress to establish one. The President of the United \nStates has said that he, too, feels that such a pursuit would be better \nconducted ``outside of the typical hearing process'' by a bipartisan \nbody of ``independent participants who are above reproach and have \ncredibility.''\n\n[[Page S5801]]\n\n  I urge those Republicans who truly believe, as Senator Cornyn said, \nthat in looking at these matters we must ``maintain our sense of \nperspective and objectivity and fairness'' to join in a bipartisan \neffort to provide for a nonpartisan review by way of a commission of \ninquiry. Such a commission would allow us to put aside partisan \nbickering, learn from our mistakes and move forward.\n  Just as partisan Republicans were wrong to try to hold up the \nconfirmation of Attorney General Holder to extort a pledge from him \nthat he would not exercise independent prosecutorial judgment, it is \nwrong to shoe horn this amendment onto this emergency spending bill. I \nopposed the effort by some Republican Senators who wanted the Nation's \nchief prosecutor to agree in advance that he would turn a blind eye to \npossible lawbreaking before investigating whether it occurred. \nRepublican Senators asked for such a pledge, a commitment that no \nprosecutor should give. To his credit, Eric Holder did not.\n  Similarly, passing a broad and unrelated amendment on an emergency \nappropriations bill that seeks to instruct the Attorney General how to \nfulfill his constitutional responsibilities is not the path forward. \nBefore we even know how these legal opinions were generated and who was \nresponsible for what, this amendment calls for the Senate to usurp the \nJustice Department's role in determining whether and, if so, who to \ninvestigate or prosecute. Any former prosecutor, any lawyer and any \ncitizen should know that it is not the decision of or an appropriate \nrole for the U.S. Senate.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1156\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I support Senator Lieberman's amendment \nrelating to Army end strength. By clarifying existing law contained in \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2008 and \nproviding $400 million for personnel and O costs, it ensures soldiers \nalready on Active Duty or who are about to be enlisted are able to \nserve. It does not create new authority for more Active-Duty soldiers, \nrather it corrects an erroneous legal interpretation about which end \nstrength number should be used to calculate percentages for additional \ntroops. I applaud Senator Lieberman's commitment to this goal.\n\n\n                      Status of Forces Agreements\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I commend the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee for all of the great work he has done to put \nthis supplemental together.\n  It is my understanding that the House version of the bill includes a \nstudy aimed at examining how the terms of the Status of Forces \nAgreement will be met, specifically as the agreement relates to \nwithdrawal timelines.\n  As the conferees work to resolve the differences of the two bills, I \nlook forward to working with the gentleman to ensure this report \nremains in the final bill language.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I thank the gentleman from Oregon for his request. I \nappreciate his concerns and look forward to working with him on this \nmatter.\n\n\n                       MRAP-All Trerrain Vehicle\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Chairman, I was very pleased to see that the committee \nprovided more than $3 billion for smaller, more agile, but still highly \nprotective vehicles know as the MRAP-all-terrain-vehicle. That is $1.55 \nbillion above what the administration requested in the fiscal year 2009 \nsupplemental. We received a lot of testimony on this armored vehicle \nprogram from witnesses before our subcommittee, including the Chief of \nStaff of the Army, and I had a personal conversation with Secretary of \nDefense Gates. Everyone said that the MRAP-ATV, as it is known in \nshort, is absolutely critical to achieving our goals in Afghanistan.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I appreciate that comment from my good friend and \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Vermont. The MRAP-all-terrain-\nvehicle is very important to protecting our forces in Afghanistan. \nSince 2005, the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee has allocated well \nover $25 billion to purchase MRAP vehicles, which have a V-shaped \nbottom and several unique features that deflect energy from roadside \nbomb blasts, prevent fragments from penetrating, and, in turn, save \npeople from attack.\n  The original versions of the MRAP have saved thousands of lives in \nIraq; however, they are very large, and this array of vehicles does not \nfully suit the more rugged environment our deployed forces faces in \nAfghanistan. There, we see very few paved roads. Many are simple dirt \nroads, slit through the sides of mountains at higher altitudes. Our \nforces need a vehicle that possesses a lower center of gravity and that \ncan go off-road, but possesses the same level of protection as the \noriginal version of the MRAP.\n  Mr. LEAHY. The Senator is so right, and I appreciated the way the \nsubcommittee thoroughly looked at the administration's budget request, \nscrubbed the numbers, and listened to what our senior defense leaders \nhad to say. The 86th Infantry Brigade Combat Team of the Vermont \nNational Guard--the only Army brigade in the Army with a ``Mountain'' \nfighting designation, comprised of upwards of 1,800 proud citizen-\nsoldiers from Vermont--will begin a yearlong deployment to Afghanistan \nnext year. They will help train the Afghan National Army, which is \ncritical to our success there. We want all our deployed forces--from \nVermont, Hawaii, and every State, and every armed service--to have the \nbest protection from roadside bomb attacks. That need is reflected in \nthe urgent request from Central Command, in the so-called Joint Urgent \nOperational Needs Statement.\n  Mr. INOUYE. We have seen a rise in roadside bomb attacks in \nAfghanistan this year, and it was very clear that, as we went through \nthe request, we had to accelerate this critical force protection \nprogram. The administration's request in the fiscal year 2009 \nsupplemental includes $1.5 billion for approximately 1000 vehicles. The \nfiscal year 2010 overseas contingency operations budget request \nincluded roughly $1.5 billion for about the same number of vehicles. \nThe Defense Subcommittee added $1.55 billion for the MRAP ATV to \naccelerate the procurement of these critical vehicles.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I think it is tremendous that the subcommittee has shown \nsuch leadership on working to secure funds that we all know is \nessential to protecting our brave men and women deployed abroad. I look \nforward to continuing to work with my good friend and colleague from \nHawaii to hold this funding in our conference negotiations with the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I thank the esteemed chairman.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I intend to vote against the current \nemergency supplemental spending bill--the second one of this fiscal \nyear--and I would like to briefly list my concerns before explaining \nthem in more detail. For years I have been fighting to bring an end to \nour involvement in the misguided war in Iraq. While I am pleased that \nPresident Obama has provided a timeline for redeployment of our troops, \nI am concerned that he intends to leave up to 50,000 of the United \nStates troops in Iraq. I am also concerned that this supplemental may \npad the defense budget with items not needed for the war. We should be \npaying for such items through the regular budget, not running up the \ndeficit to purchase them. Finally, while the President clearly \nunderstands that the greatest international security threat to our \nNation resides in Pakistan, I remain concerned that his strategy \nregarding Afghanistan and Pakistan does not adequately address, and may \neven exacerbate the problems we face in Pakistan, problems made even \nmore clear by the current rising tide of displaced civilians.\n  I do want to make clear, however, that there are a number of \nprovisions in the bill I support, including funding for humanitarian \nand peacekeeping missions. In addition, I am pleased that the bill \naddresses the increased demand for direct farm loans through the USDA's \nFarm Service Agency, FSA. As of May 7, the FSA reports backlogs of \nnearly 3,000 loans, including $250 million in ownership loans and over \n$100 million for operating loans. With many States having already \ncompletely utilized their initial fiscal year 2009 allocations of \ndirect loan funds, the emergency addition of $360 million for direct \nfarm ownership loans and $225 million for direct operating loans in the \nsupplemental will help ensure that credit is available to farmers and \nranchers. I was also encouraged that an additional $49.4 million was \nincluded for the costs associated with modifying existing\n\n[[Page S5802]]\n\nFSA farm loans, which will help ensure that FSA is able to work with \nfarmers who are viable to avoid foreclosure.\n  Let me start by focusing on Iraq. President Obama has taken a \nnecessary and overdue step by outlining a schedule to safely redeploy \nour troops from Iraq. This will help us focus on al-Qaida and its \naffiliates elsewhere, which continue to be the main threat to U.S. \nnational security. I was disappointed, however, that the President \ndecided to draw out the redeployment over 3 years. Furthermore, recent \npress reports indicate that in order to meet the June 30 deadline for \nU.S. combat troops to be out of Iraqi cities, certain military \nofficials may redraw city borders instead of relocating nearly 3,000 \nAmericans, as required under the Status of Forces Agreement. This kind \nof fluidity is troubling as it would further delay an already too long \nschedule for redeployment. While we have an obligation to help \nstabilize the region over the long term, we must not lose sight of the \nfact that our very presence has a destabilizing impact and the vast \nmajority of Iraqis support a prompt withdrawal of U.S. troops. I am \nconcerned that if the United States does not appear to be moving to \nredeploy consistent with the bilateral agreement negotiated with Iraq, \nthere could be a surge in violence against the troops of the United \nStates.\n  Finally, I note that the Bush administration chose to negotiate that \ndeal as an executive agreement when its scope clearly exceeds that of \nany previous Executive agreement and extends far beyond the kinds of \nissues addressed in a mere status-of-forces agreement. It should have \nbeen submitted to the Congress as a treaty and been subjected to the \nrequirement of approval by two-thirds of the Senate. The Congress \nalways retains the ultimate authority to determine whether to continue \nto fund military operations abroad so it is in the interest of the \nPresident to seek Senate approval. Our national security is best served \nwhen the two branches work together to determine our policy on matters \nof such profound importance to the United States. The Congress should \nmake clear that, in the future, any such agreements must be submitted \nfor ratification.\n  President Obama's strategy review for Afghanistan and Pakistan \nfinally focuses the Government's attention and resources where they are \nmost needed. After years of our country being bogged down in Iraq, \nPresident Obama has brought to the White House an understanding that \nthe key to our national security is defeating al-Qaida, and that to do \nso we must refocus on this critical region.\n  But while the President clearly understands that the greatest threat \nto our Nation resides in Pakistan, I am concerned that his announced \nstrategy has the potential to escalate rather than diminish this threat \nwithout making things better in Afghanistan. According to credible \npolls, the majority of Afghans do not support a surge in U.S. forces \nand a majority in the south even oppose the presence of U.S. troops. \nFor years, the Bush administration shortchanged the mission in \nAfghanistan, with disastrous results. But we cannot simply turn back \nthe clock. Sending significantly more troops to Afghanistan now could \nend up doing more harm than good--further inflaming civilian resentment \nwithout significantly contributing to stability in that country.\n  Furthermore, sending 21,000 additional troops to Afghanistan before \nfully confronting the terrorist safe havens and instability in Pakistan \ncould very well make those problems even worse. And don't just take my \nword for it. When I raised this point with Ambassador Holbrooke during \na recent hearing, he replied:\n\n       [Y]ou're absolutely correct that . . . an additional \n     [number] of American troops, and particularly if they're \n     successful in Helmand and Kandahar could end up creating a \n     pressure in Pakistan which would add to the instability.\n\n  By providing additional funds for our troops in Afghanistan, this \nsupplemental may actually undermine our national security as increasing \nnumbers of the Taliban could seek refuge in Pakistan's border region. \nAlready, the Taliban's leadership has safe haven in Quetta, while the \nPakistani military fights militants in the north. Without a concurrent \nplan for Pakistan, the movement of Taliban across the border could \nfurther weaken local governance and stability, while a flood of \nrefugees from Afghanistan would compound Pakistan's already dire IDP \nproblem. And let's not forget, we are talking about instability in a \ncountry with a nuclear arsenal that according to the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff is being expanded.\n  The emergence of a new civilian-led government offers the United \nStates an opportunity to develop a balanced and sustained relationship \nwith Pakistan that includes a long-term counterterrorism partnership. I \nam pleased that this administration, unlike the last, has extended its \nengagement to a broad range of political parties and encouraged the \ndevelopment of democracy. I am also pleased that there are efforts to \nsignificantly increase nonmilitary aid and to impose greater \naccountability on security assistance. After years of a policy that \nneglected Pakistan's civilian institutions and focused on short-sighted \ntactics that were dangerous and self-defeating, this is a refreshing \nstep in the right direction. Make no mistake about it, the threat of \nmilitant extremism has been and continues to be very real in Pakistan, \nbut by embracing and relying on a single, unpopular, antidemocratic \nleader we failed to develop a comprehensive counterterrorism sustained \nstrategy that transcended individuals. As a result, we must now recover \nfrom a policy that led Pakistanis to be skeptical about American \nintentions and principles.\n  While I support efforts to build a sustained relationship with \nPakistan, I remain concerned that, even as we continue to provide \nsupport to the Pakistani military, elements of the Pakistani security \nforces remain unhelpful in our efforts to cut off support for the \nTaliban. During a recent hearing before the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Senator McCain asked Admiral Mullen if he still worries \nabout the ISI cooperating with the Taliban. Admiral Mullen responded \nthat that he did. This bill contains over $1 billion for the Pakistani \nmilitary, and while we must not over generalize or take an all or \nnothing approach, it would be unwise and very dangerous to convey to \nthe Pakistani military that it has our unconditional support.\n  That would be especially dangerous now as recent fighting between \nmilitants and Pakistani forces has reportedly displaced nearly 1\\1/12\\ \nmillion people--the greatest displacement there since 1947. This is \nvery troubling, and has potentially grave strategic implications for \nU.S. national security. As General Petraeus has said, ``We cannot kill \nour way to victory.'' As we continue to provide assistance to \nPakistan's military, we must ensure they--and we--have the support of \nthe Pakistani people. No amount of civilian aid after the fact can make \nup for military operations that are not tailored to protect the \ncivilian population in the first place.\n  We must also recognize that, while the Pakistani security forces are \nundertaking operations in the Swat Valley, there are individuals in \nBaluchistan who also present a significant threat to our troops in \nAfghanistan. When I asked Ambassador Holbrooke if he knew whether the \nPakistani Government was doing everything it could to capture Taliban \nleaders in Baluchistan, he replied that he did not know and that while \nthey have ``captured . . . killed and eliminated over the years a good \nnumber of the leaders of the Taliban and al-Qaida [while] others have \nbeen under less pressure.'' I encourage the Obama administration to \nengage in tough negotiations with the Pakistani Government on this \nissue and to prepare contingency plans in the event that we continue to \nsee members of the security services supporting militants.\n  We must continue to ensure al-Qaida and the Taliban are the key \ntargets in Pakistan, but strategic success will also depend in part on \nthe ability of the Pakistani military to demonstrate they are pursuing \na targeted approach that seeks to protect the civilian population. For \nexample, we should work to ensure that the Pakistani Government has \ntaken steps to detain known militant leaders and is providing \nassistance to those who have been displaced by the ongoing violence. On \nthe civilian side, working to help reform and strengthen vital \ninstitutions, including\n\n[[Page S5803]]\n\nthe judiciary and education and health care systems, is essential. We \nmust also work to reform the police, whose permanent presence in the \ncommunity is less likely to engender hostility than the military's. In \nshort, we must focus on helping to build the civilian institutions that \nare part of a responsive, accountable government needed to ensure al-\nQaida and militant extremists do not find support among the Pakistani \npeople.\n  Lastly, I would like to address an issue that has received much \nattention. A number of my colleagues have spoken on the floor in \nopposition to the President's commitment to close the detention \nfacility in Guantanamo bay. I believe it is time for Guantanamo to be \nclosed. Senator McCain, Senator Graham, Colin Powell and James Baker \nshare this view. The facility has become a rallying cry and recruiting \ntool for al-Qaida. It contributes to extremism, anti-American sentiment \nand undermines our ability to build the international support we need \nto defeat al-Qaida.\n  Secretary Gates has testified that ``the announcement of the decision \nto close Guantanamo has been an important strategic communications \nvictory for the United States.'' The Director of National Intelligence, \nAdmiral Blair, has stated that:\n\n       The detention center at Guantanamo has become a damaging \n     symbol to the world and that it must be closed. It is a \n     rallying cry for terrorist recruitment and harmful to our \n     national security, so closing it is important for our \n     national security.\n\n  And, former Navy General Counsel Alberto Mora testified to the Senate \nArmed Services Committee in June 2008 that\n\n       There are serving U.S. flag-rank officers who maintain that \n     the first and second identifiable causes of U.S. combat \n     deaths in Iraq--as judged by their effectiveness in \n     recruiting insurgent fighters into combat--are, respectively \n     the symbols of Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo.\n\n  There are many unresolved questions about the process we will use to \nprosecute these detainees. We need to resolve those tough questions, \nbut we should not use them as an excuse to avoid taking a step that is \nso important to our national security.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wanted to make a brief statement today \non the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's \nconsideration of S. 692, a bill to ensure that a valuable collection of \nhistorical papers pertaining to President Franklin Roosevelt, known as \nthe Grace Tully Archive, can be transferred to the Roosevelt \nPresidential Library in Hyde Park. NY.\n  The Grace Tully Archive is considered the most important collection \nof documents and memorabilia related to President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt currently in private hands. The collection was directly given \nto and/or gathered by FDR's personal secretary for decades, covering \nboth his private and public career as Governor of New York and \nPresident. The donation of the collection to the Roosevelt Presidential \nLibrary has been supported by the National Archives--NARA--and \ndescribed as a matter of ``overwhelming public interest.''\n  The acting Archivist of the United States, Adrienne Thomas, wrote to \nChairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins about this bill earlier \nthis month, and I will ask that a copy of that letter be printed into \nthe Record at the conclusion of my remarks.\n  After Grace Tully died in 1981, her collection was sold into private \nhands, and it has since changed hands several times. The current \nprivate owner obtained the collection in 2001 from a well-known New \nYork rare book dealer in a widely publicized sale.\n  Although no previous claims had been made after other sales, the \nArchives stepped forward in 2004 to make a claim of ownership to \ncertain specific documents contained in the larger Tully collection. \nThey claimed that certain documents were ``Presidential papers'' and \nshould have originally been given to the Archives, not Grace Tully yet \nthe laws governing such documents and the establishment of Presidential \nlibraries was not passed until after the death of President Roosevelt. \nSo there are some legal ambiguities. But for several years, this \ndispute over the ownership of a small portion of the collection has \nprevented the donation of the entire collection.\n  Both sides wish to avoid litigation, since the collection is being \ndonated to the FDR Library anyway indeed, the collection is already at \nthe Roosevelt Library in sealed boxes waiting for the matter to be \nresolved. Both sides prefer that the matter be solved via Federal \nlegislation that will clarify the ownership issue and ensure that the \nArchives and the American people receive this important historical \ncollection.\n  Since the papers are already at the FDR library, my bill seeks only \nto clarify the ownership issue in order to facilitate the completion of \nthe donation of a collection of immense value to historians. The \ncurrent owner of the collection will have to abide by current tax rules \ngoverning such donations, including obtaining appropriate appraisals. \nAll my bill seeks to accomplish is to allow the donation to move \nforward without the time and expense of litigation.\n  Last year, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee \nalso reported out this bill, but it was stalled by year-end disputes \nover unrelated unanimous consent requests. Since there is no objection \nto this bill, I am hopeful that the Senate can take it up and pass it \nunanimously very soon, so the gift of the papers can be completed this \nyear.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous cnsent to have the letter to which I \nreferred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                             National Archives and\n\n\n                                       Records Administration,\n\n                             College Park, Maryland, May 18, 2009.\n     Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. Susan M. Collins,\n     Ranking Member, United States Senate, Committee on Homeland \n         Security and Government Affairs, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins:\n       Last September, former Archivist of the United States Allen \n     Weinstein wrote to Senator Schumer to express NARA's strong \n     support for his effort to facilitate the donation of the \n     ``Tully Archive'' to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential \n     Library (located in Hyde Park, NY), a part of the National \n     Archives and Records Administration, through legislation that \n     was pending in the last Congress. I write now to express \n     NARA's continuing support of this effort in the current \n     Congress, as encompassed in S. 692 (introduced by Senator \n     Schumer).\n       As we have explained, the Tully Archive is a significant \n     collection of original FDR-related papers and memorabilia \n     that had been in the possession of President Roosevelt's last \n     personal secretary, Miss Grace Tully. Due to the efforts of \n     your committee to move the issue along, we are now very close \n     to resolving this matter after several years of uncertainty.\n       Successful resolution of this case through a donation to \n     the National Archives, as facilitated by this legislation, \n     would culminate several years of serious discussion between \n     the Government and the private parties involved. It will also \n     result in substantial savings to the government, by obviating \n     the need for a lawsuit to claim and assert government \n     ownership over a small portion of the collection--an action \n     that would take years, require substantial resources, and \n     result in our obtaining only a limited portion of the Tully \n     Archive. I recognize that there are complex issues involved \n     in this case and consider the Committee's approach to be the \n     best available under the circumstances.\n       The entire Tully Archive includes some 5,000 documents, \n     including over 100 FDR letters with handwritten notations; \n     dozens of speech drafts and carbons; hundreds of notes (or \n     ``chits'') in FDR's handwriting; letters from cabinet \n     officials and dignitaries, including a letter from Benito \n     Mussolini congratulating FDR on his 1933 inaugural; Eleanor \n     Roosevelt family letters; and photographs, books, framed \n     items, etchings, and other memorabilia.\n       Although Miss Tully died in 1984, the extent of the \n     collection only came to the attention of the National \n     Archives in 2004 when a team from the Roosevelt Library and \n     NARA's Office of General Counsel had the opportunity to \n     examine the materials. Although there has been a minor \n     dispute over ownership of a small portion of the collection, \n     this is very close to being resolved. The entire collection \n     is currently in sealed boxes at the Roosevelt Library waiting \n     for the gift to be completed. I believe that the National \n     Archives and the American people are best served by receipt \n     of the entire collection.\n       It is very important to NARA, and for future historians \n     that might want to study these papers, for the Tully Archive \n     to be kept intact and made fully accessible to the American \n     people in a public government archives. This result will \n     increase the ability of scholars to learn about our 32nd \n     president and his extraordinary life and times.\n       There is an overwhelming public interest in making this \n     collection available to the\n\n[[Page S5804]]\n\n     public. I personally thank you for your efforts to ensure \n     that the issue is finally resolved in the 111th Congress.\n           Sincerely yours,\n                                                  Adrienne Thomas,\n                            Acting Archivist of the United States.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today to speak \nabout the National Guard and the need for this Federal Government to \nbetter equip our Guard and Reserve units. Senate amendment No. 1143, \nwhich I offered to the supplemental appropriations bill, would have \ndone just that. Although the Senate did not adopt this sensible \nmeasure, I will continue to seek creative ways to support the National \nGuard and pursue this responsible and reasonable expenditure.\n  Simply put, my amendment would have appropriated $2 billion to the \nNational Guard and Reserve equipment account. This money would have \ncome from unobligated funds made available by the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act of 2009. The rescissions would not have applied to \namounts relating to the Department of Defense, the Department of \nHomeland Security, Military Construction, or the Veterans \nAdministration.\n  In recent years, our National Guard and Reserve forces have faced \nsubstantial shortfalls in equipment, and the military budget requests \nhave been insufficient to remedy the problem. Even prior to 9/11, our \nNational Guard and Reserve forces had equipment deficiencies. Since 9/\n11, due to an especially high operational tempo in the Iraqi and Afghan \nTheaters of Operations, our National Guard and Reserve equipment is \nbeing worn out and exhausted more quickly than anticipated. Combat \nlosses are also contributing to shortfalls. Compounding the problem, in \norder to provide deployable units, the Army National Guard and the Army \nReserve have had to transfer large quantities of their equipment to \ndeploying units, exacerbating shortages in nondeploying units. Also, \nsome National Guard and Reserve units, at the end of their deployments, \nhave had to leave significant quantities of equipment overseas. If \nthese equipment shortfalls are not remedied, our National Guard and \nReserve forces run the risk of further deterioration of readiness \nlevels and capability.\n  In my estimation, it seemed reasonable to move $2 billion in \nunobligated stimulus spending to fund necessary procurement of new \nNational Guard and Reserve equipment, which was tragically overlooked \nduring the stimulus debate. The National Guard and Reserve equipment \naccount is a critical resource for funding procurement of new equipment \nfor our National Guard and Reserve forces. This $2 billion increase in \nequipment funding would have provided much-needed modern equipment for \nour National Guard and Reserve forces, better enabling them to meet \nmission and readiness requirements. In addition, this funding, which \nwould have to have been spent by the end of fiscal year 2010, would \nhave provided a stimulative effect to the U.S. economy.\n  New equipment would also directly benefit our Nation's homeland \nsecurity missions and disaster response efforts, both of which are \nfrequently assigned to National Guard forces. The Guard's ability to \ncarry out these responsibilities depends on the availability of \nnecessary equipment. Much of the equipment that would otherwise be used \nin these missions remains deployed overseas and is therefore \nunavailable.\n  In closing I want to reiterate my commitment to the National Guard \nand Reserve. Going forward, I will continue to fight to ensure that our \nGuard and Reserve units have the resources and equipment necessary to \ncomplete their missions. They make every American proud, and I am \ncommitted to maintaining a healthy and well-equipped National Guard and \nReserve for years to come.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I met briefly this week with the actress and \nactivist Mia Farrow, who has dedicated so much time lately--and even \nput her own health at risk--to raise awareness of the atrocities in \nDarfur.\n\n[[Page S5805]]\n\n  Like Ms. Farrow, my good friend Pam Omidyar--the founder and chair of \nthe Board of Humanity United--has also fasted for more than a month in \nsolidarity with the Darfurian refugees.\n  Mia Farrow and Pam Omidyar enjoy liberty and wealth. They do not need \nto do this. But through their actions, they both so generously speak \nfor those the world ignores.\n  The terrible situation in Darfur deteriorates with each passing day. \nBut we don't hear much about it. It has long since faded from the front \npages in the face of everything else going on in our economy and the \ntwo wars we wage in the Middle East.\n  We cannot ignore this crisis. The United States has officially and \nappropriately recognized that what is happening in Darfur is genocide. \nFor the more than 2.4 million people who have been displaced against \ntheir will, we cannot look the other way and cannot stand idly by.\n  Most of the people of Darfur depend on international aid to survive \nday-to-day. The United Nations has agreed to send 26,000 peacekeepers \nto Darfur, but they face an uphill fight--they have struggled to get \nthe resources they need to ensure the safety of those who live in \nDarfur and to end this crisis.\n  Making matters worse, when the International Criminal Court recently \nissued a warrant to arrest the President of Sudan--President Bashir--\nfor war crimes and crimes against humanity, he responded by expelling \n13 non-governmental organizations that had been distributing food and \nmedicine to the people in Darfur.\n  Because of its economic investments, China has unique leverage with \nSudan. It is important that China uses that influence to help the \npeople of Darfur.\n  I appreciate the work of Major General Jonathan Scott Gration--the \nPresident's special envoy to Sudan--but we must do more to put Darfur \nat the forefront of our foreign-policy agenda. And we must be clear \nabout our objectives.\n  The Sudanese government has repeatedly proven untrustworthy at the \nnegotiating table. As the administration and our special envoy develop \na new policy, we must consider how we can get Khartoum to change its \nbehavior.\n  There have been too many people in too many camps for too many \nyears--and the world has been silent for far too long.\n  We have no excuse to do anything short of all we can do to ensure aid \ngroups are on the ground in Darfur, and that they can do their jobs--to \nensure a political process is in place, and that it can work--and to \nhelp save the lives of millions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5805-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO HONOR FLIGHT\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the first Honor Flight from Kentucky for the 2009 operational \nseason. Many members of this body have had the chance to see their \nconstituents at the World War II Memorial because of the noble work \nHonor Flight does in transporting surviving World War II veterans from \naround the country to see their memorial free of charge. I am honored \nto have been invited to participate in previous flights from the \nCommonwealth, and I regret that my schedule prevented me from attending \nthe one that took place this past weekend. I hope to have the chance \nonce again to visit with Kentucky Honor Flight participants.\n  On Saturday, May 16, Honor Flight's Bluegrass Chapter arrived in our \nNation's Capital with 79 World War II veterans from my home State of \nKentucky to see the memorial which they inspired. It is my hope that \nthese veterans felt a sense of pride in seeing their memorial after \nall, pride is the very same feeling these men and women inspire in \ntheir fellow Americans.\n  In my previous experiences in meeting with the participants of Honor \nFlight trips, people of all ages have been humbled by the presence of \nthese veterans at the memorial. School children have shook hands with \nthe men and women who served in World War II and thanked them for their \nservice. Others have asked for the privilege of taking a photo with a \nreal-life American hero. Still more, including myself, have shared \nstories that have been passed down through generations about how World \nWar II affected their family. In watching these interactions, one thing \nis clear: the sacrifices that these men and women made will never be \nforgotten.\n  I wish to express my sincere gratitude to the Kentucky veterans who \nwere here over the weekend for having served to protect our great \nnation's principles from the enemies of freedom. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the names of the 79 World War II veterans from the \nCommonwealth be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                         World War II Veterans\n\n       Allen Courts, Robert Adams, Charles Alessandro, Donald \n     Cobb, Kenneth Gillespie, Guthrie Catlin, Joe Terrell, Donivan \n     Mahuron, George Spaulding, George Schembari, Dale Tinkle, \n     Jack Distler, Walter Pearce, Joseph Crouse, Kathleen \n     Drummond, Clarence Lange, Leroy Lange, Marcus Shearer, \n     Garland Lewis, Gordon Lewis.\n       Herbert Lewis, William Morris, Dewey Smith, Roy Ricketts, \n     Frank Mellon, Jr., Hugo Becker, Robert Byrum, Carl Kiesler, \n     Nelson Moody, Murrell Ramsey, George Pearl, Chesterfield \n     Pulliam, John Canary, William Grantz, Jack McQuair, William \n     Miller, John Noonan, Irvine Stevens, Joseph Blincoe, Richard \n     Burnett,\n       Charles Branson, Francis Kindred, Gustave LaFontaine, \n     Carojean MacDonald, Carroll Hackett, Ira Johnston, Billy \n     Turner, William Fender, John Hinkebein, Richard Yann, Edwin \n     Casada, Fitzhugh Roy, Henry Anderson, Marvin Lawson, George \n     Greathouse, Paul Berrier, Sr., Thomas Napier, Thomas Roberts, \n     Ralph Stengel, Chester Sublett.\n       Frederick Kleinschmidt, James Williams, Elmer Givan, Leslie \n     Powers, Marion Crockett, Edward Goldner, Loren Charley, Edgar \n     Hodges, Joseph Johnson, Alvin Lawyer, Orin Bond, Antonio \n     Martinez, John Eckert, Lee Bumpus, Donald King, Marcus Combs, \n     Norman Miller, Allen Jones, Roy Vance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5805-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CREDIT CARDHOLDERS' BILL OF RIGHTS ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I opposed this legislation because it will \nlikely have the unintended consequence of restricting credit to those \nwho need it most. The major economic issue at play is the ability of \nfinancial institutions to utilize risk-based pricing to determine how \nmuch to charge an individual for credit. Risk-based pricing essentially \npermits a lender to charge a higher price to individuals who are at a \ngreat risk for nonpayment. More sophisticated pricing has also expanded \ncredit to those who otherwise would not be eligible for a credit card.\n  Financial institutions that offer credit cards face four major risks. \nOne, the lending they provide is not secured by collateral. Two, a \ncreditor has no way of knowing when a cardholder loses his job and the \nincome he would need to repay his debt. Three, a borrower can max out \nthe full amount of his limit without advance notice. And four, unlike \nother forms of lending, credit cards are relatively more susceptible to \nfraud.\n  Since it is impossible for a lender to know when a borrower will \ndefault, credit card companies carefully monitor their cardholders' \nactivity. A delinquent payment, exceeding one's credit limit or \nbouncing a check acts as an early warning sign that help firms identify \nhigher risk cardholders. In order to manage these risks, credit card \ncompanies use certain practices to protect themselves from the \npossibility of default.\n  Any legislation or regulation that restricts the ability of credit \ncard issuers to adequately price risk could have several unintended \nconsequences. Investors who in the past may have been attracted to the \nrelatively higher returns afforded securitized credit card assets may \nshift their funds into alternative sources of lending. As a result, \ncredit card companies may increase interest rates on all card holders, \nincrease monthly minimum payments, reduce credit limits or simply issue \nfewer cards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5805-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5805-S5807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, very few people in America today would \nargue that our health care system is not in need of reform. It is a \ntravesty that in the richest, most powerful country in the world, there \nare more than 47 million people without health insurance. That is an \nabsolutely shocking number. It represents roughly one in six people who \nare going without regular trips to the doctor, forgoing needed\n\n[[Page S5806]]\n\nmedications and resorting to emergency rooms for care because they have \nnowhere else to turn. These are our friends, our neighbors, and \nmillions of our children.\n  An estimated 87 million people--one in every three Americans under \nthe age of 65--were uninsured at some point in 2007 and 2008. While my \nhome State of Vermont has made significant strides in creating a plan \nfor comprehensive coverage, there are still far too many Vermonters \nwithout health insurance. While we beat the national average, roughly \n10 percent, or 66,000 Vermonters remain uninsured.\n  Those Americans who are fortunate enough to have health coverage \noften cannot afford to access care. Every day, Americans across this \ncountry are struggling to afford premiums for health insurance, which \nhave nearly tripled since 2000. In fact, new estimates show that the \ncost for health care for the average American family is more than \n$16,000 per year--an increase of over $1,100 from the previous year. \nHealth care reform has been put on hold for far too long and cannot be \ndelayed any further.\n  It is encouraging that this Congress has already taken a few \nconstructive steps toward insuring more Americans and making our health \ncare system more effective. One of the first bills that President Obama \nsigned into law was the reauthorization and expansion of the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program. This bill has extended and renewed health \ncare coverage for over 10 million children and provided 4 million more \nwith new coverage. As part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct, Congress extended health benefits for Americans who lost their \njobs as part of the economic downturn and invested over a billion \ndollars to help States implement electronic health records to help make \ncare more efficient with strong personal privacy protections, which I \nwas proud to coauthor with others. While these bills have moved our \ncountry in the right direction, it would be a mistake to stop short of \nlarger scale changes to our health system. The need for comprehensive \nreform has never been more urgent.\n  Health care reform legislation must create a system where all \nAmericans have the opportunity to access health insurance that is \naffordable and provides adequate coverage. For far too long, an \nunregulated health insurance market has cherry-picked healthy Americans \nto provide coverage to, while offering unaffordable coverage to \nindividuals with ``pre-existing conditions.'' Many others who have \ninsurance do not have adequate coverage and are insured only for \ncertain conditions. Others have high premiums or unaffordable \ndeductibles so accessing care is unrealistic.\n  Competition among private insurers has not driven down costs to \nconsumers and the current private insurance market has a clear \nincentive to offer coverage only to the healthiest Americans. \nComprehensive health care reform can change this calculus and that is \nwhy I support the creation of a federally backed, public health \ninsurance option. For those who are satisfied with their current \ninsurance there is no need to change. A public option would only give \nconsumers more choices to purchase an affordable and quality health \ninsurance plan and will help drive down overall health care costs by \nintroducing real competition into the health care market. I was proud \nto join Senator Brown and over twenty other Senators to introduce a \nresolution stating our support of a public option as part of \ncomprehensive health care reform legislation.\n  I appreciated the recent news that leaders of the health care \nindustry are working with the Obama administration and have unveiled a \nplan to voluntarily trim roughly $200 billion in health care costs per \nyear. While this is a movement in the right direction, this should not \ndistract from the fact that coverage must be affordable for Americans \nor the larger goal of reducing overall costs will not be realized. A \npublic option should recognize an individual's ability to pay and offer \nsubsidies for those who are still unable to afford care. Leaving \nindividuals without insurance drives up health care costs for us all, \nand we must work toward a goal of insuring all Americans.\n  Insuring more Americans is of no use unless we work toward \nincentivizing people to become nurses, doctors, and health care \nprofessionals. My wife Marcelle is a nurse, and I understand the threat \nthat nursing shortages pose to health care access and safety. \nAdditionally, with the costs of a medical education rising, many \naspiring physicians are choosing to specialize instead of pursuing a \ncareer in primary care. Especially in a rural State like Vermont, we \nare struggling to maintain primary and preventative care services \nthroughout the State. I have heard from far too many Vermonters who use \nthe emergency room for everyday health care needs because there are not \nenough primary care physicians to handle the demand for services. I \nsupport efforts to establish programs to help students repay their \nloans should they choose to practice in underserved fields or areas \nhigh in need of physicians and nurses across the country.\n  Strengthening our primary care workforce will also help Americans \naccess preventative services to help maintain good health and reduce \nthe incidence of debilitating chronic conditions. Chronic diseases are \noften preventable or manageable with treatment, yet currently account \nfor 75 percent of our health care spending. Already we have seen a \nmovement to target preventable diseases by focusing on ways to promote \nhealthy lifestyles and choices. As part of its Blueprint for Health, \nVermont has begun a series of pilots across the State to enhance health \ncare coordination and patient outcomes through patient centered medical \nhomes. Vermont is seeing good results and is finding that a coordinated \napproach to health care prevents repeated hospital visits and the \nemergence of chronic conditions. Prevention must be seen as a \ncornerstone to both reducing costs and keeping Americans healthy.\n  Some argue that in our current economic climate it would be \nirresponsible to reform health care because we simply cannot afford it. \nWhat we cannot afford is to stick with the status quo, which is \ncrippling our economy and neglecting millions of Americans who want \ncoverage but cannot afford it. Health care costs currently consume 16 \npercent of the United States's gross domestic product, which is \nexpected to double in the next decade if nothing is done to slow the \ntrend.\n  Strengthening our enforcement efforts to crack down on rampant fraud, \nwaste, and abuse in the health care system is vital to lowering costs \nassociated with health care. The scale of health care fraud in America \ntoday is staggering. According to conservative estimates, about 3 \npercent of the funds spent on health care are lost to fraud--that \ntotals more than $60 billion a year. For the Medicare Program alone, \nthe Government Accountability Office estimates that more than $10 \nbillon was lost to fraud just last year. Unfortunately, this problem \nappears to be getting worse, not better.\n  The answer to this problem is to make our enforcement stronger and \nmore effective. We need to deter fraud with swift and certain \nprosecution, as well as prevent fraud by using real-time internal \ncontrols that stop fraud even before it occurs. We need to make sure \nour enforcement efforts are fully coordinated, not only between the \nJustice Department and other agencies, but also between federal, state, \nand private health care fraud investigators. Much has been done to \nimprove enforcement since the late 1990s, but we can and must do more.\n  Health spending cannot be controlled without a comprehensive approach \nthat focuses on all aspects of our health system. We cannot afford to \nstop the growth in health spending without ensuring that Americans have \naccess to primary care to prevent and treat chronic conditions before \nthey begin. We must target inefficiencies and fraud within the system \nand incentivize quality of care not necessarily quantity of care.\n  We have the opportunity to create a system that maintains patient \nchoice, gives all Americans access to quality care and reduces overall \nhealth spending. We cannot afford to neglect true reform to our health \nsystem any longer.\n  I look forward to working with the Finance and HELP Committees and \nall Senators to pass a comprehensive health care reform bill this year.\n\n[[Page S5807]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5807-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5807-S5808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      NATIONAL SMALL BUSINESS WEEK\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this week we celebrate National Small \nBusiness Week, a time that affords us the opportunity to reflect not \nonly on the countless contributions that small businesses have made, \nand continue to make, to the economic strength of our great country--\nbut also on how the Federal Government is assisting these companies to \nbe successful in their own right. As such, I rise today as ranking \nmember of the Senate Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship \nto discuss the status of our Nation's 27 million small businesses, and \nto elaborate on the role the Federal Government is playing, can play--\nand must play--in providing these critical firms with the resources and \ntools they require to lead us out of our deep economic morass.\n  The facts and figures are enlightening. Small businesses represent \n99.7 percent of all employer firms nationwide. They generate two-thirds \nof net new jobs annually. And they create over half of our Nation's \nnonfarm private gross domestic product--GDP. So there can be no \nquestion that small businesses are critical to our nation's economic \nvitality and success.\n  Yet we face an economic landscape that is unlike any other we have \nseen in decades. The unemployment rate stands at 8.9 percent--the \nhighest level in over 25 years. More than 13.7 million Americans are \nwithout jobs, 5.7 million of which have been lost since the beginning \nof this recession in December 2007. We are in an economy that \ncontracted 6.1 percent in the first quarter of 2009--after having \ncontracted 6.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008. During what is \nthe deepest and longest recession since the Great Depression, small \nbusinesses struggle in accessing capital to purchase equipment and \nexpand their operations; providing affordable and quality health \ninsurance to their employees; and complying with complex tax laws and \nregulations.\n  Without healthy small businesses, our economy cannot--and will not--\nrecover. We must design comprehensive and thoughtful initiatives to aid \nsmall businesses during these difficult times. President Obama and this \nCongress have already taken several steps, but these cannot represent \nthe totality of our efforts.\n  The central focus and priority of our efforts must be thawing frozen \ncredit markets and increasing lending volume. The flow of credit is \ncritical to the well-being of small businesses because when companies \ncannot access credit, jobs are lost and businesses suffer. What last \nyear was a ``credit crunch'' for small businesses has all too rapidly \nballooned into a full-blown crisis. This calamity threatens to continue \nshuttering storefronts all across Main Street America--the very last \nthing we need at this critical juncture. At a time when small \nbusinesses should be turning to the safety of government-backed \nlending, Small Business Administration--SBA--loan volume is showing \nmixed results.\n  Recently, Congress and the White House have taken a number of steps \nto address this crisis. Specifically, in the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act, Small Business Committee Chair Landrieu and I worked \ntogether to eliminate fees and increase guarantee rates to a maximum of \n90 percent for the SBA's flagship 7(a) and 504 loan programs. The Obama \nAdministration quickly implemented these vital provisions. As a result, \naverage weekly SBA loan volume has increased 25 percent since their \nimplementation.\n  This is significant progress. Nonetheless, as I continue to hear from \nentrepreneurs, including during four small business roundtables I \nrecently held in Maine, credit remains constrained. Accordingly, I am \ncalling on the Obama administration to immediately implement the \nremaining small business provisions from the Recovery Act, something \nour committee members urged of SBA Administrator Mills just last week.\n  And it appears that the administration is listening. On Monday, \nAdministrator Mills announced the official roll-out of the new Business \nStabilization Loan Program, otherwise known as the America's Recovery \nCapital, or ARC, loan program, to provide interest-free loans, up to a \nmaximum of $35,000, to firms having difficulties making loan payments. \nThese stabilization loans include deferred repayment schedules, to help \nsmall businesses weather this recession. A critical provision that \nChair Landrieu and I worked together to include in the Recovery Act, \nthe ARC loan program will act as a bridge for hundreds of small \nbusiness owners that just need a small infusion of capital to stay \nafloat.\n  Chair Landrieu and I also worked together to increase funds for \nmicrolending within the SBA, and ease refinancing restrictions for 504 \nloans, allowing more small businesses to access credit and other \nresources through the SBA. These are crucial measures that, if \nimplemented soon, could have a dramatic effect on the flow of credit.\n  I am pleased that President Obama recognizes the credit crisis and \nheld a White House Summit that I participated in last March to address \nthe concerns of the small business community. In a step for which I \nadvocated in conversations with the administration, he used the \noccasion to announce that Treasury will directly purchase, through the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program, TARP, $15 billion in securitized SBA \n7(a) and 504 loans. A witness before our Committee recently testified \nthat this essential step is a ``great launch pad'' for promoting \nliquidity in the secondary markets to spur new financing dollars, and I \nagree. I encourage the administration to roll out this program as \nquickly as possible.\n  The provisions in the stimulus and the President's announcement are \npositive steps addressing different facets of the problem we are \naddressing here today, but more must be done.\n  During a private meeting I had with President Obama in the Oval \nOffice recently, I implored the President to create a competitive \nlending platform at the SBA. Too often, potential SBA borrowers are \nstymied by the limited number of SBA lending options in their \ncommunity. In the traditional lending sphere, this problem has been \naddressed by the emergence of private for-profit Web sites that \naggregate lending offers for potential borrowers, giving banks the \nopportunity to compete for lending business. A lending platform that \nallows SBA lenders nationwide to ``bid'' on potential borrowers would \nincrease potential SBA borrowers' access to SBA lenders and would \nincrease the pool of applicants for banks. This platform would create \nmore competition and availability for borrowers, and in turn lead to a \nlikely reduction in interest rates for SBA-backed loans.\n  At a Small Business Committee hearing in March, we heard testimony \nabout the difficulty small business owners face in maintaining existing \nlines of credit during these uncertain economic times. Small businesses \nare reporting that banks are ``calling'' back loans, by requiring \noutstanding loans to be repaid within compressed and expedited \ntimeframes. Unfortunately, with banks demanding payment and little \naccess to other credit, the survival of numerous small businesses is \nbeing threatened.\n  As such, another solution to the credit crisis worth considering is \nusing TARP funds to guarantee lines of credit for small businesses. The \nTreasury Department could use funds from TARP to support guarantees on \ncredit lines and in return, the bank receiving this guarantee would \nagree to help craft a payment schedule that would help the affected \nsmall business. This program would be completely voluntary but would \nbenefit both the borrower, who would continue to receive credit, and \nthe lender who would receive a guarantee on an outstanding loan. Chair \nLandrieu and I sent a letter to Treasury Secretary Geithner in March, \nand he has been extremely helpful in working to assess the viability of \nthis proposal.\n  Among the many issues we have been discussing here in the Senate is \nthe onerous burden of taxes--a topic that arises every time I speak \nwith small business owners. Frankly, small businesses suffer under the \nweight of our Nation's tax burden. The undeniable and regrettable fact \nis, tax compliance costs are 67 percent higher for small business than \nfor larger firms. A horrendously complicated Tax Code fosters evasion \nthat then builds skepticism among Americans about the validity of the \nwhole system. Much of our Tax Code is also due to expire in less than 2 \nyears. And as a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, I am\n\n[[Page S5808]]\n\nready to work on a bipartisan basis to forge a new tax code that is \nprogrowth with the fewest number of economic distortions and that \nraises sufficient revenue to finance our Nation's spending priorities.\n  I must say that I am particularly concerned about raising taxes on \nsmall business owners when the tax cuts expire at the end of 2010. \nRaising personal tax rates from 33 to 36 percent and from 35 to 39.6 \npercent results in a 9 percent tax increase on small business because \n93 percent of small businesses are organized as flow-through entities \nsuch as partnerships and Subchapter S corporations. Taking another 9 \npercent out of small business leaves fewer resources available to small \nbusiness owners to reinvest in America's greatest job generators.\n  There are lots of conflicting studies, but Treasury data indicates \nthat almost 70 percent of flow-through income is earned by 9 percent of \nsmall business owners, and these are the owners who are generating \njobs. Furthermore, according to data Senator Grassley received from the \nJoint Committee on Taxation, small business owners would pay more than \nhalf the taxes from higher marginal rates. That data indicates that \n$187 billion of the $339 billion raised from increasing the top two tax \nrates would come from small business. Notably, I offered an amendment \nduring the budget debate that would have prevented tax increases on \nsmall business owners if more than 50 percent of their income came from \na small business. The amendment, which would have allowed this proposal \nto go forward if offset, passed by voice vote but was inexplicably \ndropped in conference. Nonetheless, it is imperative that we work \ntogether to preserve the tax cuts for all small businesses, and I hope \nthat we can.\n  I would also like to add that although the Recovery Act made some \nvital changes to the Tax Code to help small businesses--such as \nextending bonus depreciation and expensing--it fell short in its \ntreatment of net operating losses. The Recovery Act allows small \nbusinesses to carryback 5 years losses they incurred in 2008, a \nprovision for which I successfully fought. This indispensable cash flow \ntool allows businesses that have been profitable--but are currently \nfacing losses--to file for a refund of taxes paid in the last 5 years. \nYet, this relief remains incomplete as it was limited to businesses \nwith gross revenues less than $15 million. So I commend the President \nfor proposing to allow all businesses to carryback their 2008 and 2009 \nlosses for 5 years. That is also why I introduced a bill to address \nthis situation, and I thank Senators Baucus, Hatch, Stabenow, Ensign, \nLincoln, Cantwell, and Bill Nelson, for cosponsoring this significant \nlegislation.\n  The bottom line is that at the end of the day, if small businesses \ncannot gain greater access to capital, our economic recovery will be \nslowed, stagnated, or worse. I have made several suggestions today \nthat, when coupled with the small business provisions passed in the \nRecovery Act, can hasten a revitalization of our Nation's economy. I \nsincerely hope that we take to heart the critical role small businesses \nplay in the creation of a healthy and stable economy, and work in a \nbipartisan fashion to seek new ways of ensuring that we in Congress are \nproviding them with the right kind of assistance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5808-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5808-S5811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ROTARY KEYNOTE ADDRESS\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I wish to call the attention of my \ncolleagues to a most thoughtful address delivered in my State of \nIndiana recently by a fellow Hoosier, one who served as a Member of \nCongress from Indiana for 22 years, 1959 until 1981. I refer to Dr. \nJohn Brademas, who represented the district centered in South Bend.\n  A Democrat, John Brademas served throughout those years on the \nCommittee on Education and Labor of the House of Representatives where \nhe took part in writing most of the measures then enacted to support \nschools, colleges, and universities; the arts and the humanities; \nlibraries and museums; Head Start; and education of children with \ndisabilities as well as others.\n  In his last 4 years, John Brademas was majority whip of the House of \nRepresentatives, third-ranking member of the Leadership.\n  Seeking election in 1980 to a 12th term, John Brademas lost that \nrace. He was shortly thereafter invited to become president of New York \nUniversity, the Nation's largest private, or independent, university.\n  He served as president until 1992 when he became president emeritus, \nhis present position. I believe it is recognized by those in the higher \neducation world in the United States that John Brademas led the \ntransformation of NYU, as it is known, to one of the most successful \ninstitutions of higher learning in our country.\n  A graduate of Harvard University where, as a Veterans National \nScholar, he earned his B.A., magna cum laude, in 1949, he went on to \nOxford University, England, where as a Rhodes Scholar, he earned a \nPh.D. with a dissertation on the anarchist movement in Spain.\n  John Brademas is married to Dr. Mary Ellen Brademas, a physician in \nprivate practice, a dermatologist, affiliated with the NYU Medical \nCenter.\n  On May 2, 2009, John Brademas delivered the keynote address, \n``Rotary: Pathfinder to Peace,'' for a statewide conference in \nIndianapolis of members of Rotary Clubs from throughout Indiana.\n  I believe my colleagues will read with interest John Brademas' \naddress on this occasion, and I ask unanimous consent to have the text \nof his remarks printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      ROTARY: PATHBUILDER TO PEACE\n\n  Keynote Address of Dr. John Brademas, President Emeritus, New York \nUniversity and Former Member (1959-1981), U.S. House of Representatives \n                              (Dem.-Ind.)\n\n\n             rotary international district 6506 conference\n\n                  (Indianapolis, Indiana, May 2, 2009)\n\n       Rotary District Governor, Judge Tom Fisher; Rotarians all, \n     I am greatly honored to have been invited to open your \n     conference in Indianapolis today.\n       In the first place, I am a fellow Hoosier. My mother was \n     born in Grant County, Indiana, and my two brothers, sister \n     and I, while students in school in South Bend, would spend \n     summers in the small Grant County town of Swayzee at the home \n     of my mother's parents, Mr. and Mrs. William Chester Goble.\n       As my grandfather had been a school principal and college \n     history professor, he had a library in their home of some \n     6,000 books. My brothers, sister and I practically lived in \n     that library during those summers--an invaluable experience.\n       My mother was a schoolteacher and my father ran a \n     restaurant. My dad, Stephen J. Brademas, was born in Greece, \n     and although we four children grew up with a strong sense of \n     pride in our Hellenic ancestry, we were all members of the \n     Methodist Church.\n       I must add that I am the first person of Greek origin \n     elected to the Congress of the United States, and only last \n     month I was at the White House for a reception hosted by \n     President Obama to mark Greek Independence Day, while some \n     days after that, I attended a similar reception at Gracie \n     Mansion, the home of Mayor Bloomberg of New York City.\n       You may also be interested to know that when I was a senior \n     at South Bend Central High School, P. D. Pointer, our school \n     principal, invited me to join him at the regular luncheons of \n     the Rotary Club of South Bend.\n\n\n                       rotary club of south bend\n\n       Indeed, on inquiry of the Rotary Club of South Bend about \n     those luncheons, I learned that 65 years ago, the students \n     who attended them were not called ``Junior Rotarians'' but \n     ``High School Boys'' even as I was reminded that in January \n     1945, 65 years ago, I gave the farewell for the ``High School \n     Boys'' who graduated from Rotary luncheons that week.\n       So it's obvious that my link with Rotary goes back a long \n     way!\n       After high school, with World War II still on, I enlisted \n     in the Navy and was sent to an officers' training program at \n     the University of Mississippi, in Oxford, Mississippi.\n       Following my freshman year at ``Ole Miss'', with the war \n     over, and discharged, I went to Cambridge, Massachusetts and \n     Harvard where I completed college, graduating in 1949. And \n     I'll be back at Harvard next month for the 60th reunion of my \n     graduating class.\n       While at Harvard, I spent a summer working with Aztec \n     Indians in rural Mexico, wrote my college honors thesis on \n     the Sinarquista movement there and four years later, at the \n     other Oxford, in England, as a Rhodes Scholar, wrote my Ph.D. \n     dissertation on the anarchist movement in Spain, which was \n     centered in Catalonia.\n       My study of the anarchists was published thirty-five years \n     ago, in Spanish, in Barcelona, and, in fact, only last \n     December, I was awarded an honorary degree by the University \n     of Barcelona.\n       I like to say that although I studied anarchism, I did not \n     practice it! For only months after returning to South Bend, I \n     was running for Congress.\n       Just old enough under the Constitution to be a candidate, I \n     lost my first race, in 1954,\n\n[[Page S5809]]\n\n     by half a percent. Not surprisingly, I decided to run again \n     two years later and lost a second time, in 1956.\n       My political godfather, you may be interested to know, was \n     a Hoosier who became Chairman of the Democratic National \n     Committee, the late Paul M. Butler of South Bend.\n       Indeed, as I've said, one reason I was so pleased to accept \n     the invitation to address you today is that it's good to be \n     back home in Indiana--and surrounded by fellow Hoosiers!\n       After a brief stint serving in Chicago on the presidential \n     campaign staff of Adlai Stevenson, I again ran for Congress \n     and, as I told you, I lost a second time--as did he--in 1956. \n     But I still thought I could win, and on my third try, in \n     1958, was first elected, then ten times reelected, and so was \n     a Member of Congress for twenty-two years.\n       I am delighted in this respect to see here today a \n     distinguished member of the Supreme Court of the State of \n     Indiana, Justice Frank Sullivan, and his wife, Cheryl. \n     Justice Sullivan was at one point my top assistant when I was \n     a Member of Congress and, indeed, his wife, Cheryl, was also \n     a member of my staff. She now serves on the staff of Senator \n     Evan Bayh as Policy Director.\n       I served on Capitol Hill during the Administrations of six \n     Presidents: three Republicans--Eisenhower, Nixon and Ford; \n     and three Democrats--Kennedy, Johnson and Carter.\n\n\n                majority whip, house of representatives\n\n       During my last four years, I was the Majority Whip of the \n     House of Representatives, third-ranking position in the House \n     Democratic Leadership.\n       Every other week, as Whip, I would join Speaker ``Tip'' \n     O'Neill of Massachusetts, House Majority Leader Jim Wright of \n     Texas, Senate Majority Leader Bob Byrd of West Virginia and \n     Senate Majority Whip Alan Cranston of California for \n     breakfast at the White House with President Carter and Vice \n     President Mondale. All Democrats, we talked politics and \n     policy. It was a fascinating experience and I've just written \n     to President Obama to urge, respectfully, that he follow the \n     same practice.\n       Indeed, because, as you may know, President Obama will, in \n     two weeks, give the commencement address at the University of \n     Notre Dame, in my old Congressional District, I hope, as I \n     plan to be there, to review my suggestion with him then.\n       Beyond serving as Whip, I found my principal responsibility \n     in Congress was on the Committee on Education and Labor of \n     the House of Representatives. There, for more than two \n     decades, I helped write all the Federal laws then enacted to \n     support schools, colleges and universities; libraries and \n     museums; education for handicapped children; the National \n     Endowments for the Arts and the Humanities; Head Start; the \n     War on Poverty; the Drug and Alcohol Abuse Education Act; the \n     Environmental Education Act; and the Pell Grants for aid to \n     college students.\n\n\n                      international education act\n\n       But of particular interest, I trust, to Rotarians is that I \n     was also chief author of the International Education Act of \n     1965, a measure that authorized Federal grants to colleges \n     and universities to offer courses about other countries.\n       This legislation is, in my view, directly in harmony with \n     the central mission of Rotary International.\n       For, as you Rotarians know better than I, the fundamental \n     mission of Rotary, as it describes itself, is ``to build \n     world peace and understanding through its network of over 1.2 \n     million members in over 32,000 clubs in 200 countries and \n     geographical areas.''\n       The description continues: Rotary club members, coming from \n     all political, social and religious backgrounds, are united \n     in their mission to promote international understanding \n     through humanitarian and educational programs. Rotary clubs \n     initiate projects both locally and internationally, to \n     address the underlying causes of conflict including \n     illiteracy, disease, hunger, poverty, lack of clean water and \n     environmental concerns.\n\n\n                     president, new york university\n\n       I leap ahead. Following my defeat in my campaign for \n     reelection in 1980, I was invited to become President of New \n     York University, the largest private, or independent, \n     university in the United States.\n       Located in Manhattan, headquartered on Washington Square \n     Park, NYU, as it is familiarly known, I found an exciting \n     place to be, and to lead it, an exciting challenge.\n       You will not be surprised, in view of what I've told you, \n     that I gave particular attention to NYU's programs for the \n     study of other countries and cultures.\n       I found on arrival in 1981 that New York University was \n     already strong in French and German Studies.\n       Two years later, in 1983, I awarded an honorary degree to \n     King Juan Carlos I of Spain, announced a professorship in his \n     name and in 1997, in the presence of Their Majesties, the \n     King and his Greek Queen, Queen Sofia, and of the then First \n     Lady of the United States, now Secretary of State, Hillary \n     Rodham Clinton, I dedicated the King Juan Carlos I of Spain \n     Center at NYU for the study of the economics, history and \n     politics of modern Spain.\n       All this was the result of my having, as a schoolboy in \n     South Bend, read a book about the Maya! So I know what early \n     exposure to another culture, another country, another \n     language has meant in my own life.\n       And I believe that among the reasons--I do not say the only \n     one--the United States suffered such loss of life and \n     treasure in Vietnam and does now in Iraq is ignorance--\n     ignorance of the cultures, histories and languages of those \n     societies.\n       I add that the tragedies of 9/11, Madrid, London, Bali and \n     Baghdad must bring home to us as Americans the imperative, as \n     a matter of our national security, of learning more about the \n     world of Islam.\n       But it is not only for reasons of national security that we \n     must learn more about countries and cultures other than our \n     own. Such knowledge is indispensable, too, to America's \n     economic strength and competitive position in the world.\n       The marketplace has now become global. Modern technology--\n     the Internet, for example--has made communication and travel \n     possible on a worldwide basis. In the last few years, I \n     myself have visited Spain, England, Greece, Jordan, Morocco, \n     Cuba, Kazakhstan, Japan, Turkey and Vietnam.\n\n\n                      international studies at nyu\n\n       Reflecting on my commitment to international education, I \n     can say that during my presidency of NYU, my colleagues and I \n     established a Center for Japan-U.S. Business & Economic \n     Studies, a Casa Italiana Zerilli-Marimo, Onassis Center for \n     Hellenic Studies, a Remarque Institute for the Study of \n     Europe, a Center for Dialogue with the Islamic World. And \n     with a gift from a foundation established by the late Jack \n     Skirball, an Evansville, Indiana rabbi, who went into the \n     motion picture business and became very successful, the \n     Skirball Department of Hebrew and Judaic Studies.\n       NYU has also opened several campuses abroad--in Madrid, \n     Florence, Prague, London, Paris and most recently, Dubai, \n     Ghana and Shanghai. We have established an NYU base in Buenos \n     Aires and will shortly do so as well in Tel Aviv.\n       Moreover, when I last looked, New York University is among \n     the top half-dozen universities in the United States in \n     hosting students from other countries.\n       Now if as a Member of Congress and as president of New York \n     University, I pressed for more study of other countries, \n     cultures and languages, I continued--and continue--to do so \n     wearing other hats.\n       Appointed, by President Clinton, chairman of the \n     President's Committee on the Arts and the Humanities, which \n     in 1997 produced a report, Creative America, with \n     recommendations for generating more support for these two \n     fields in American life, I was naturally pleased that our \n     committee recommended that our ``schools and colleges . . . \n     place greater emphasis on international studies and the \n     history, languages and cultures of other nations.''\n       As for seven years chairman of the National Endowment for \n     Democracy, the Federally financed agency that makes grants to \n     private groups struggling to build democracy in countries \n     where it does not exist, I had another exposure to the \n     imperative of knowing more about other countries and \n     cultures.\n       I continued that interest through service on the World \n     Conference of Religions for Peace; on the advisory council of \n     Transparency International, the organization that combats \n     corruption in international business transactions; and by \n     chairing the American Ditchley Foundation, which helps plan \n     discussions of policy issues at Ditchley Park, a conference \n     center outside Oxford, England.\n\n\n                  senators richard lugar and evan bayh\n\n       Here I must note that citizens of Indiana can take pride in \n     the leadership in the shaping of our national foreign policy \n     offered by three distinguished legislators in Washington. \n     Senator Richard Lugar is former chairman of, and now ranking \n     Republican on, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, while \n     Lee Hamilton was for a number of years chairman of the House \n     Committee on Foreign Affairs and is now director of the \n     Woodrow Wilson International Center in Washington, D.C.\n       Moreover, Indiana's junior Senator, Evan Bayh, has \n     important assignments in foreign affairs through membership \n     on four committees--Armed Services, Intelligence, Banking, \n     and Energy and Natural Resources.\n       Preparing for my visit with you today, I had a good \n     conversation with Harriet Mayor Fulbright, the widow of \n     another distinguished Congressional leader in foreign \n     affairs, the late Senator J. William Fulbright. Harriet told \n     me about a forthcoming--November 1 to 3--Global Symposium of \n     Peaceful Nations.\n       The purpose of the Symposium, to be held in Washington, \n     D.C., will be ``to call attention to the value of peace and \n     the strategies available to achieve a more peaceful world.'' \n     The Symposium, to be sponsored by the Alliance for \n     Peacebuilding and the J. William & Harriet Fulbright Center, \n     will focus on measuring, defining and quantifying ``peace'', \n     in order, Mrs. Fulbright added, that countries can understand \n     ``the elements of peacefulness''. When I told her I would be \n     speaking to you today, Mrs. Fulbright strongly affirmed the \n     role that Rotarians can play in this effort to recognize and \n     press for the achievement of these elements for global peace. \n     We can, she said, learn how countries are organized to find \n     peace and we can stimulate the leadership to promote peace.\n       Clearly, business and the professions have a deep moral \n     interest as well as business and professional interests in \n     building a world of peace.\n       I hope that Rotarians will pay attention to the forthcoming \n     Global Symposium because\n\n[[Page S5810]]\n\n     its mission is so much in harmony with the stated goals of \n     Rotary. For I remind you that among the objectives of Rotary \n     is ``the advancement of international understanding, goodwill \n     and peace through a world fellowship of business and \n     professional persons united in the ideal of service.''\n       Here are some specific suggestions for what Rotary Clubs \n     and individual Rotarians can do to achieve those objectives. \n     Certainly, Rotary should continue to support current programs \n     such as Polio Plus, Rotary Youth Exchange, for students in \n     secondary education, and the Rotary Foundation's \n     Ambassadorial Scholarships as well as Rotary Fellowships, \n     which support graduate fellowships in other countries.\n\n\n                       rotary world peace fellows\n\n       I draw particular attention to a relatively new initiative, \n     the ``Rotary Peace and Conflict Resolution Program'', which \n     provides funds for graduate study in several universities \n     around the world. I note that Rotary World Peace Scholars are \n     to complete two-year studies, at the Master's level, in \n     conflict resolution, peace studies and international \n     relations, and that only five years ago, the Rotary World \n     Peace Fellows Association was established to encourage \n     interaction among scholars, Rotarians and the public on \n     issues related to peace studies.\n\n\n              rotary graduate fellow, joan breton connelly\n\n       Here let me cite an example with which I am familiar of the \n     impact of a Rotary Fellowship.\n       In 1979, the Rotary Club of Toledo, Ohio awarded Joan \n     Breton Connelly a Rotary International Graduate Fellowship \n     enabling her to spend a year of study in Athens, Greece. The \n     fellowship supported her participation in the American School \n     of Classical Studies distinguished program in Classical \n     Archaeology. The generous terms of her fellowship allowed her \n     to go to Athens three months early for intensive language \n     training in modern Greek, an utterly transformative \n     experience for Connelly.\n       She has returned to Greece every one of the 30 years that \n     have followed, participating in and now, leading, \n     archeological expeditions. A Professor of Classics and Art \n     History at New York University, Connelly has taken hundreds \n     of her own students to Cyprus where she has directed the \n     Yeronisos Island Excavation Field School for nineteen \n     summers.\n       Rotary International's investment in the young Joan \n     Connelly has certainly paid off. In 1996, she was awarded a \n     MacArthur Foundation ``Genius'' Award for pushing the \n     boundaries of our understanding of Greek art and myth, \n     reinterpreting the Parthenon frieze. She has become a leader \n     in the preservation of global cultural heritage, having \n     served on the President's Cultural Property Advisory \n     Committee, U.S. Department of State, since 2003.\n       In 2002, the Republic of Cyprus awarded Dr. Connelly a \n     special citation for her leadership in the exploration and \n     preservation of Cypriot cultural heritage.\n       In 2000, she was granted honorary citizenship by \n     Municipality of Peyia, Republic of Cyprus, singling her out \n     as the only American citizen to enjoy this status. Professor \n     Connelly attributes all these successes to that first break, \n     the Rotary International Graduate Fellowship that so \n     generously opened for her a new world and gave her, through \n     rigorous language training, the all-important gift of \n     communication.\n       So I think that Rotary International, Rotary Clubs and \n     Rotarians are on the right track!\n       Here I remind you that there are 33,000 Rotary Clubs in \n     over 200 countries and geographical areas with over 1.2 \n     million business, professional and community leaders as \n     members.\n       I must also tell you that a few years ago (2006), I co-\n     chaired the Subcommittee of the Committee for Economic \n     Development (CED) which produced a report entitled, Education \n     for Global Leadership: The Importance of International \n     Studies and Foreign Language Education for U.S. Economic and \n     National Security, and that our report made these \n     recommendations:\n       1. That international content be taught across the \n     curriculum and at all levels of learning, to expand American \n     students' knowledge of other countries and cultures.\n       2. That we expand the training pipeline at every level of \n     education to address the paucity of Americans fluent in \n     foreign languages, especially critical and less commonly \n     taught ones such as Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, \n     Persian/Farsi, Russian and Turkish.\n       3. That national leaders--political, as well as business, \n     philanthropic and media--educate the public about the \n     importance of improving education in foreign languages and \n     international studies.\n       You will not be surprised, in view of what I have already \n     said, that to these recommendations I say anew, ``Amen!''\n       Indeed, only a few days ago, former Congressman Lee \n     Hamilton, with whom I spoke about my visit with you today, \n     observed that one aspect of the foreign policy of the United \n     States that pays the highest dividend is our support for \n     international exchanges.\n\n\n                        CONGRESSMAN LEE HAMILTON\n\n       Lee Hamilton, as you know, one of the most highly respected \n     Members of Congress of our era, told me, ``A foreigner who \n     has studied in the United States will become an ally.'' Lee \n     said that Rotary Clubs were one of the key groups with whom \n     he met in Indiana and added, ``Rotary Clubs in Indiana are \n     movers and shakers, civic-minded leaders in their \n     communities.''\n       Now you all know that I am a Democrat but speaking to you \n     today, I am pleased to recall the budget recommendation of \n     President Bush for Fiscal 2007 for programs to strengthen \n     international and foreign language study and to remind you \n     that just four years ago, President Bush told a group of \n     university presidents in the United States how important it \n     was to strengthen the study of foreign languages, \n     particularly Arabic and other critical languages.\n       Here I echo the final sentence of the CED Report of which I \n     earlier spoke, ``Our national security and our economic \n     prosperity ultimately depend on how well we educate today's \n     students to become tomorrow's global leaders.''\n       To that again I say, ``Amen!''\n\n\n                     CSIS COMMISSION ON SMART POWER\n\n       As I reflected further on my remarks today, I recalled a \n     most thoughtful report, issued a couple of years ago by the \n     Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), \n     entitled the CSIS Commission on Smart Power. The report, \n     produced by an impressive group of American leaders, co-\n     chaired by Richard L. Armitage, former Deputy Secretary of \n     State and Assistant Secretary of Defense for International \n     Security Affairs, and Joseph S. Nye, Jr., distinguished \n     service professor at Harvard, former dean of the Kennedy \n     School of Government there, and also former Assistant \n     Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs and \n     the chairman of the National Intelligence Council, and \n     including such other figures as former Supreme Court Justice \n     Sandra Day O'Connor, Senators Jack Reed and Chuck Hagel and \n     several prominent leaders of business and industry, asserted:\n       The United States must become a smarter power by once again \n     investing in the global good--providing things people and \n     governments in all quarters of the world want but cannot \n     attain in the absence of American leadership. By \n     complementing U.S. military and economic might with greater \n     investments in soft power, America can build the framework it \n     needs to tackle tough global challenges.\n       You will not be surprised that among the recommendations of \n     the CSIS Commission on Smart Power is greater investment in \n     education at every level.\n       The authors of the report assert: ``Countries with a higher \n     proportion of 15-to-29 year-olds relative to the adult \n     population are more likely to descend into armed conflict. \n     Education is the best hope of turning young people away from \n     violence and extremism. But hundreds of millions of children \n     in the developing world are not in school or else attend \n     schools with inadequate teachers or facilities. . . . An \n     annual meeting could help increase the saliency of U.S. \n     bilateral and multilateral efforts to increase education \n     levels worldwide . . .\n       The report goes on to observe:\n\n     ``. . . [T]he number of U.S. college students studying abroad \n     as part of their college experience has doubled over the last \n     decade to more than 200,000, though this still represents \n     slightly more than 1 percent of all American undergraduates \n     enrolled in public, private and community institutions. One \n     way to encourage U.S. citizen diplomacy is to strengthen \n     America's study abroad programs at both the university and \n     high school levels . . .''\n       In addition to increasing the number of American students \n     going abroad, the next administration should make it a \n     priority to increase the number of international students \n     coming to the United States for study and research and to \n     better integrate them into campus life.\n       America remains the world's leading education destination, \n     with more than a half-million international students in the \n     country annually.\n       We urge the next president of the United States to make \n     educational and institutional exchanges a higher priority . . \n     .\n       The American private sector also has a responsibility to \n     educate the next generation of workers. The next president \n     should challenge the corporate sector to develop its own \n     training and internship programs that could help teach the \n     skills that American workers will need in the decades to \n     come. The next administration should consider a tax credit \n     for companies to make their in-house training available to \n     public schools and community colleges.\n       The concluding paragraph of the report of the CSIS \n     Commission on Smart Power is also worth quoting here: \n     ``America has all the capacity to be a smart power. It has a \n     social culture of tolerance. It has wonderful universities \n     and colleges. It is has an open and free political climate. \n     It has a booming economy. And it has a legacy of idealism \n     that channeled our enormous hard power in ways that the world \n     accepted and wanted. We can become a smart power again. It is \n     the most important mandate for our next president.''\n       I think you can see from what I have told you of the \n     recommendations in this report how closely they harmonize \n     with the goals and mission of Rotary.\n\n\n             ROTARY CLUBS, ROTARIANS: PATHBUILDERS TO PEACE\n\n       So I hope that individual Rotarians and Rotary Clubs will, \n     wherever they are, among their other commitments, lend \n     support to efforts, both private and public, to encouraging \n     education about other countries and\n\n[[Page S5811]]\n\n     cultures and in this way, in the language of Rotary \n     International, ``provide humanitarian service, encourage high \n     ethical standards in all vocations, and help build goodwill \n     and peace in the world.''\n       In this way, Rotary Clubs and Rotarians can be pathbuilders \n     to peace.\n       Now both because of the pressures of the economic recession \n     and the commitment of Rotary International and, indeed, of \n     our conference in Indianapolis to ``World Peace and \n     Understanding'', I want to call to your attention a \n     development only several days ago that I believe directly \n     relevant to our discussions.\n       I could, of course, speak of President Obama's stimulus \n     plan with its several features designed to put more cash into \n     the pockets of taxpayers, laid-off workers, and first-time \n     homebuyers as well as college students. But I want rather to \n     take note of the action only last month of Congress in \n     voting, by overwhelming bipartisan majorities, approval of \n     the Serve America Act of 2009. This legislation, co-sponsored \n     by Senators Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and \n     Orrin Hatch, Republican of Utah, would by 2017 triple the \n     number of participants in AmeriCorps, our major national \n     service program, and create a number of new volunteer \n     programs. AmeriCorps members work for ten months to one year \n     for a modest stipend, and when they finish, get a grant \n     for education.\n\n\n             JOHN BRADEMAS CENTER FOR THE STUDY OF CONGRESS\n\n       Finally, I shall take advantage of this forum to say just a \n     word about what is now my own major initiative in my capacity \n     as president emeritus of New York University. It is the John \n     Brademas Center for the Study of Congress, located in NYU's \n     Robert F. Wagner Graduate School of Public Service.\n       For I think it is not as widely understood as it should be \n     that in our American separation-of-powers constitutional \n     system, Congress--the Senate and House of Representatives--\n     the legislative branch of our national government, can be a \n     source of national policy as well as are the President of the \n     United States and members of the executive branch.\n       I've earlier given you one example directly related to the \n     commitment of Rotary, the International Education Act. This \n     measure did not originate in the White House but on Capitol \n     Hill.\n       It is, however, not easy for even informed Americans to \n     understand the operation of Congress. After all, there are \n     100 Senators and 435 Representatives and we do not, \n     customarily, have the strict party discipline commonly found \n     in parliamentary democracies.\n       So how does Congress make policy?\n       Our Center sponsors lectures, symposia and research on the \n     ways in which the Congress of the United States initiates and \n     shapes national policy.\n       A modest example: While in Congress I was chief author in \n     the House of Representatives of the Arts and Artifacts \n     Indemnity Act of 1975. This law enables museums, galleries, \n     and universities to borrow art from abroad as well as lend \n     parts of their collections to museums in other countries \n     without paying the prohibitive cost of private insurance. The \n     Federal Government, under this legislation, indemnifies the \n     works on loan.\n       So, last January, we convened, at NYU, under the auspices \n     of the Brademas Center, a colloquium, which examined the \n     impact of this legislation and ways to expand it. The session \n     was led by former National Endowment for the Arts Chairman \n     Bill Ivey and brought together leaders from the museum, \n     foundation and performing arts worlds as well as scholars of \n     arts and public policy and public officials. Based on our \n     discussions, we are preparing a report to the President and \n     Congress with recommendations for expanding international \n     arts and cultural exchanges as part of a renewed strategy for \n     U.S. public diplomacy.\n       To reiterate, in view of the commitment of Rotary ``to \n     encourage and foster the ideal of humanitarian service'' and \n     ``to help build goodwill and civil peace in the world'', I \n     believe it wholly fitting that Rotarians as individuals and \n     Rotary Clubs as community organizations, wherever located, \n     encourage and support education about other countries and \n     cultures.\n       To conclude, as I reflected on what I might say to you \n     today, I realized that such is the role of the United States \n     in the world today that challenges never cease.\n       For example, in light of President Obama's recent encounter \n     with President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, we must ask where is \n     United States policy toward Cuba going?\n       Given the recent attacks on American vessels by Somali \n     pirates operating off the coast of Somalia, what is our \n     appropriate response?\n       Then comes the controversy over the correct action--if \n     any--to take with respect to Central Intelligence Agency \n     interrogators who apparently tortured detainees during the \n     presidency of George W. Bush.\n       And beyond these challenges in foreign policy is, of \n     course, the economic challenge here at home--the recession. \n     That is the subject for another speech and one I shall \n     certainly not inflict on you today.\n       Clearly, as we look at the challenges our country faces \n     both at home and abroad, we can all agree that dealing with \n     them requires the most knowledgeable and intelligent \n     responses our country can make. And that's why I believe that \n     the commitment of Rotarians ``to bring together business and \n     professional leaders to provide humanitarian service, \n     encourage high ethical standards in all vocations, and help \n     build goodwill and peace in the world'' is still as valid, \n     indeed, essential today as when I was one of the ``High \n     School Boys'' attending luncheons at the South Bend Rotary \n     Club.\n       Again, I count it an honor to have been invited to address \n     you and I wish you, my fellow Hoosiers, all the best in the \n     years ahead!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5811-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5811-S5812]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ALASKA DECORATION OF HONOR CEREMONY\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, it is my pleasure to rise today in honor \nof the military men and women serving our country across the country \nand overseas. As Memorial Day approaches, I want to personally \nrecognize the sacrifice these service men and women and their families \nare making for our Nation.\n  In 233 years of American history, the struggle for freedom has \nremained ever present. During this time, our Nation has surrendered its \nbravest men and women to liberate the oppressed and to ensure freedom \nfor future generations. In doing so, battle lines were drawn and blood \nwas spilled on both U.S. and foreign soil.\n  I am certain the dedicated service and sacrifice of our men and women \nwho met the challenges defined by those battle lines safeguarded the \nfreedom and democracy we all cherish. In recognition of that fact, we \npause each year on Memorial Day to recognize and honor those who have \ngiven their all on the field of battle.\n  There is simply no greater service and no braver act than a warrior \nwilling to stand in the face of evil and selflessly make the ultimate \nsacrifice.\n  We must never forget these brave Americans and their actions which \nhave earned them a place in our hearts and their names on the role of \nhonor for this State and this Nation.\n  This year we also pause to specifically honor those Alaskans who have \ngiven the last full measure of devotion on the battlefield in defense \nof freedom and democracy. We recognize them with the Alaska Decoration \nof Honor.\n  Alaska celebrates the 50th anniversary of its statehood this year. \nThere will be hundreds of events and celebrations to mark this \nanniversary, but one of the most important ones is this weekend in \nAnchorage when every Alaska soldier killed in action is presented with \nthe Alaska Decoration of Honor.\n  I thank the families of these soldiers for traveling to Alaska to be \npart of the ceremony, and again honor our current service men and women \non this Memorial Day.\n\n            2008 Alaska Decoration of Honor Medal Recipients\n\n       Shawn G.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer my support for the \nPost-Deployment Health Assessment Act of 2009. I am pleased to join my \ncolleague, the senior Senator from Montana, in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation.\n  The Post Deployment Health Assessment Act requires the Defense \nDepartment to increase mandatory mental health screenings for military \npersonnel who deploy to combat. This legislation is important and \nnecessary because of the alarming increase in combat-related \npsychological injuries suffered by our soldiers overseas.\n  A RAND study in 2008 concludes that nearly 20 percent of Iraq and \nAfghanistan veterans suffer from Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or \ndepression. That is nearly 300,000 returning American servicemembers. \nIt also finds that rates of marital stress, substance abuse, and \nsuicide are all increasing.\n  According to a report released earlier this year, the Army's suicide \nrate hit a record high last year, putting the suicide-per-capita rate \nhigher than the national population. In the first three months of this \nyear, there have already been 56 reported suicides in the Army. If that \nrate is maintained for the rest of this year, we will have another \nunfortunate, record-breaking year for military suicides.\n  Soldiers returning from deployment are already required to receive an \nin-person mental health assessment when they return home. The Post \nDeployment Health Assessment Act requires that soldiers receive an \nassessment from personnel trained to conduct such screenings before \nthey deploy. That way, the screening personnel has a reference point \nand can monitor the soldier's progress and any serious changes that may \nhave occurred during the soldier's deployment. The Post Deployment \nHealth Assessment Act also requires soldiers to receive mental health \nassessments every six months for two years after they return from \ncombat. The periodic assessments allow health personnel to monitor a \nsoldier's adjustment from the combat zone back into normal society. By \nproviding the mental health screening program called for in the Post \nDeployment Health Assessment Act, we will give the Defense Department \nan effective system for diagnosing the unseen scars that are so \nprevalent amongst our combat veterans.\n  The program proposed by this bill is based on a pilot program \ndeveloped by the Montana National Guard. When I heard about it, the \nprogram made a great deal of sense to me. That unit has improved the \nmental health care its servicemembers receive, and it seems natural to \nimplement such a program to benefit all of our warriors and veterans.\n  Since the beginning of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Congress has \nacted to protect the physical health of the soldiers on the front \nlines. Congress responded to the needs of our fighting men and women by \nfunding more body armor and reinforced vehicles. Now, we must do more \nto protect the mental health of our war fighters by giving them the \naccess to mental health screenings that can help them get ahead of \ndebilitating depression and other disorders that result from intense \ncombat experiences.\n  Finally, I point out that my colleagues need look no further for \nsupport than to the veterans whom this bill will help. It has been \nendorsed by groups representing our brave warriors such as the Iraq and \nAfghanistan Veterans of America, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, the \nNational Guard Association, and the Enlisted Association of the \nNational Guard.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Post-Deployment Health Assessment \nAct of 2009, and I look forward to its swift passage so that our \nsoldiers and veterans can get the treatment and protection they need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5812-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5812-S5813]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO LTC JOHN H. BURSON III, MD\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the selfless \ncommitment to the U.S. Army Reserve and to this Nation, of a true \nAmerican patriot, LTC John H. Burson III, MD.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Burson is a citizen of Carrollton, GA, and earned \nhis bachelor's, medical, doctor of philosophy and doctor of medicine \ndegrees from the Georgia Institute of Technology and Emory University.\n  During his medical career, Dr. Burson pioneered a new health care \nfacility with outpatient surgery in Villa Rica, GA, that served as the \nforerunner for a new Villa Rica hospital with multiclinic services.\n  Later, he led and personally funded college students to visit various \nWorld War II historical sites including an extended tour of Normandy \nand related battlefields in order to educate America's youth about \nAmerican history, especially the military. I would like to yield to my \nfriend, Senator Isakson for further remarks.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for yielding and also \nrise in recognition of Lieutenant Colonel Burson and his incredible \nlife story. Lieutenant Colonel Burson volunteered for reserve duty in \nOperation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom at the age of 70 \nin order to relieve active-duty doctors so they could carry out other \nduties. To this end, he searched nationwide for military units in need \nof a medical doctor and even delayed the celebration of his 50th \nwedding anniversary for his upcoming deployment with the medical unit \nof the Indiana National Guard.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Burson was assigned as medical officer for the \nU.S. Embassy in Iraq from November 2005 to March 2006 and served as one \nof the doctors overseeing treatment of former Iraqi President Saddam \nHussein. During this time, he was part of the team that successfully \nconvinced Hussein to end his hunger strike. He did this while also \nperforming surgery and treating patients at a nearby trauma/emergency \ncare unit. Lieutenant Colonel Burson was 71 by the time he completed \nthis deployment.\n  At such a point in life, many men and women are well into their \nretirements. However, after his first deployment to Iraq, Lieutenant \nColonel Burson instead renewed his search for a combat arms unit in \nneed of a doctor during the 2007 troop surge in Iraq. He served an \nadditional deployment with an Army Reserve military police battalion \nfrom Raleigh, NC, from August 2007 to November 2007 at age 73.\n  Today, as we stand before you on this floor, this extraordinary \nAmerican will have just returned home after his third combat \ndeployment. At 75 years of age, he has just completed another full \ntour, this time in Afghanistan.\n  MR. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his kind \nobservations regarding Dr. Burson's service. Lieutenant Colonel Burson \nillustrates the selflessness, commitment to excellence, and courage \nthat exemplifies American character.

RASLEY\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I pay tribute to a Mr. David D. \nRasley, Sr., who passed away on May 8, 2009. Mr. Rasley was a 50-year \nresident of Alaska. Working in the construction field, he was highly \nregarded in the Fairbanks labor community. He also gave tirelessly to \ncommunity causes before and after his retirement. Dave was very proud \nof his Army service.\n  I have included his obituary below and ask that it be printed in the \nRecord. Interior Alaskans mourn the loss of Dave Rasley and join in \noffering condolences to his wife of nearly 58 years, Luella, sons \nDavid, Ron and Brian and his grandchildren, Michael and Carolyn.\n  The information follows:\n\n       David Dale Rasley Sr. died May 8, 2009, after a long battle \n     with cancer.\n       He was born on December 2, 1928, in Deer River, MN. Dave \n     lived in Fairbanks for more than 50 years and came to Alaska \n     for good in 1959 shortly after statehood.\n       Dave had come first to Alaska in 1948 with some family and \n     friends to work on post-World War II projects in Anchorage, \n     Kodiak and Fairbanks. He returned to Minnesota and was \n     drafted into the Army in 1950.\n       Dave married his wife, Luella, June 7, 1951, in Port \n     Townsend, WA, while he was in the Army. He loved Luella very \n     much, and they were married for almost 58 years. He was proud \n     of his military service and was stationed at Camp Desert \n     Rock, NV, and participated in at least three atomic bomb \n     tests during the early 1950s. His unit helped build some of \n     the test facilities and participated in what are now known to \n     be dangerous post blast tests.\n       Shortly after moving to Alaska in 1959, he worked on the \n     Cold War DEW line installations at Barter Island and Clear \n     Air Force Station. In 1961 he was diagnosed with myasthenia \n     gravis, a rare neuromuscular disease and was told he might \n     not survive long, or would be wheelchair-bound. He underwent \n     experimental surgery at the University of Washington and with \n     medication was able to function normally.\n       He began classes at the University of Alaska Fairbanks and \n     graduated with a bachelor of science degree in business in \n     1966. He worked in the construction industry for two years, \n     then took a job with the Operating Engineers Union Local 302 \n     as a field agent. He eventually became the head agent for the \n     northern region of the state and was involved in the trans-\n     Alaska oil pipeline and related work contract agreements for \n     IUOE Local 302 until his retirement in 1989.\n       Dave was also proud of his 32 years of work as a board \n     member of the Fairbanks Memorial Hospital and a past \n     president of the board. He was involved in FMH projects such \n     as the Denali Center, Imaging Center, Cancer Treatment Center \n     and several general hospital expansions.\n       Dave and Luella were big sports fans supporting UAF hockey, \n     men and women's basketball, volleyball, and other UAF \n     activities. They were fixtures and season ticket holders for \n     Gold Kings, Ice Dogs, UAF hockey teams and Fairbanks \n     Goldpanners baseball team. Dave was a Goldpanner board member \n     for many years and was not afraid to get involved when a \n     volunteer was needed.\n       David is survived by his wife, Luella; sons, David Jr. \n     (Beverly), Ron (Stephanie), Brian; and by his grandchildren, \n     Michael and Carolyn. David was a true Alaskan and will be \n     missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5813-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5813-S5814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING L. WILLIAM SEIDMAN\n\n Mr. BOND. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the life of \nBill Seidman who passed away last week.\n  Bill was a man whose love for his country was matched only by his \nlove for his family. Bill's life is heavily marked with numerous \naccomplishments in both his personal and professional lives that had a \nprofound impact on many individuals and families who knew him and on \nthose who never knew him.\n  To many of my Senate colleagues, Bill will be most remembered as the \nman who rescued our economy during the Savings and Loan Crisis in the \nlate 1980's. As the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation, FDIC, and head of the Resolution Trust Corporation, RTC, \nhe faced down a national economic crisis, the likes of which had not \nbeen seen since the Great Depression, and fundamentally changed the way \nthe government dealt with failing banks.\n  In that time of fear and deep economic uncertainty, Bill stood out as \nthe leader who stood on principle, talked straight, and told it like it \nwas. It did not always make him popular and angered those who wanted \nhim to ``toe the line.'' However, it earned him the trust, respect, and \ncredibility of policymakers, government officials, financial industry \nofficials, and millions of citizens all across America.\n  But there was more to Bill than his public service achievements. His \naccomplishments were so numerous--and his humility so great--that many \nof them went unnoticed. He served his country during World War II and \nreceived the Bronze Star for his service as a communications officer on \na destroyer while serving in the invasion of the Philippines, Iwo Jima, \nand Okinawa. He spoke very little about his service during the war, \nlike many of his great generation.\n  Bill earned degrees from some of the finest institutions in the \nNation--his undergraduate degree from Dartmouth, a law degree from \nHarvard, and an MBA from the University of Michigan.\n  Bill was born in Grand Rapids, MI, where he maintained strong roots \nthroughout his life. He began his career there at his family's \naccounting firm, Seidman and Seidman, and became a respected member of \nthe local business community. But his greatest contribution to Grand \nRapids was his role as a principal founder of Grand Valley State \nUniversity in 1960. He was named the first honorary life member of \nGrand Valley's board, and the university's Seidman College of Business \nis named after his father.\n  In 1962, Bill ran unsuccessfully to be Michigan's State auditor \ngeneral--his only attempt at elected office. He went on to become an \neconomic adviser to Michigan Governor George Romney, and later joined \nPresident Gerald Ford's Administration as the Assistant to the \nPresident for Economic Affairs.\n  In the early 1980s, he returned to academia as dean of Arizona State \nUniversity's College of Business.\n  These are just a few of the many things Americans may not know about \nBill Seidman--and he accomplished all of this before becoming Chairman \nof the FDIC, establishing the RTC, and brilliantly guiding America out \nof the economic wilderness--the role which brought him fame.\n  But with all he had accomplished, Bill never stopped to rest. He went \non to author two books, ``Productivity--The American Advantage,'' with \nSteven Shancke, and ``Full Faith and Credit,'' a memoir of his time at \nthe FDIC and his role in establishing and running the RTC. President \nGerald Ford hailed ``Full Faith and Credit'' as ``a fascinating story \nby a straight talker. The author dramatically tells how the Federal \nagencies sought to confront the challenge of the banking and S \ncrisis.''\n  In recent years, already well into his eighties, Bill stayed as \nactive as ever, working as CNBC's chief commentator, regularly \ncontributing opinion pieces to major newspapers, serving on numerous \nboards, and advising top officials--and me--on the current economic \ncrisis.\n  In his most recent piece, published by the Wall Street Journal on May \n8, he addressed the staffing and management challenges now confronting \nthe FDIC. In it, he drew parallels between the hurdles that current \nChairman Sheila Bair faces and the obstacles he faced in getting the \nFDIC and the new RTC properly ``staffed up'' to deal with the S \ncrisis nearly two decades ago.\n  Bill wrote ``The Resolution Trust Corporation had to handle the \nassets from failed institutions when I ran it in the aftermath of the \nsavings and loan crisis of 1985-1992. The RTC experience provides a \nuseful guide for what the FDIC has to do now.'' Amen.\n  With the country again facing the same fear and uncertainty that Bill \nsaw during his tenure at the FDIC, he provided what few others could: a \nbrilliant and straightforward voice with years of experience, wisdom, \nand unquestionable integrity. The loss of his voice simply cannot be \nreplaced.\n  But perhaps what was most remarkable about Bill is that for all of \nhis brilliance, myriad accomplishments and worldwide recognition, there \nwas a deep humility and kindness about Bill that was evident the moment \nyou met him. Although he had the ears of presidents and the respect of \nthe elite, he famously rode his bike to work. When asked about his \naccomplishments at the FDIC in a 1991 interview, he dismissed them as \n``primarily luck.'' But everyone knew better.\n  The passing of Bill Seidman is a loss for all of America. He \ndedicated his life\n\n[[Page S5814]]\n\nto his country and his family, and we are eternally grateful. I will \nespecially miss Bill as he and I met in my office just 2 months ago to \ntalk about the RTC and how we could apply those lessons to our current \nfinancial and economic crisis. I appreciated his wisdom, guidance, \ngenerosity, and the kindness and respect he paid to me.\n  It is my deepest hope that we can all learn from Bill, in not just \nhis expertise on addressing the current financial crisis, but also in \nthe way he treated others with kindness, humility, honesty, and \npassion.\n  Our hearts and prayers go out to his wife Sally, his six children, \nhis many grandchildren and great grandchildren, and to all of his \nfamily. I will truly miss him.\n  It has been my honor today to offer this commemoration on the \nincredible life of Bill Seidman, and to salute this great \nAmerican.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5814-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING BRIAN O'NEILL\n\n Mrs. BOXER.: Mr. President, it is with a very heavy heart that \nI ask my colleagues to join me today in honoring the memory of an \nextraordinary National Park Service, NPS, leader, Brian O'Neill. Brian \nwas a legendary conservationist and community builder whose legacy will \nserve as a source of inspiration for decades to come. Brian passed away \non May 13, 2009. He was 67 years old.\n  Brian was born in Washington, DC, in 1942, where he lived for the \nfirst 27 years of his life. During his early years, Brian's family \noften took camping and road trips to many of our National Parks. It was \non these trips that Brian first began to bond with the Great West that \nwould eventually become his home. The deep love and respect for nature \nthat Brian fostered in his youth continued to motivate his professional \nlife and nurture his personal life for the remainder of his years.\n  Brian never kept his love of the out-of-doors to himself. From the \nbeginning, he recognized the importance of sharing his enthusiasm for \nall things wild with his family, friends, and especially with young \npeople. As a freshman at the University of Maryland, Brian and his twin \nbrother Alan worked with their mother Mimi to establish a nonprofit \norganization that provided urban children with opportunities to visit \nnational parks.\n  Brian began his career in Government service in 1965, when he was \nhired by what was then the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, BOR. As Deputy \nDirector of BOR's Office of Urban Park Studies, Brian was a crucial \npart of the team that persuaded President Nixon to support legislation \nestablishing two major urban parks: Golden Gate in San Francisco and \nGateway in New York City. Brian was also instrumental in the inclusion \nof 2,000 miles of rivers on California's north coast in the national \nscenic rivers system during the final days of President Carter's \nadministration.\n  For the past 25 years, Brian O'Neill served as the superintendent of \nthe Golden Gate National Recreation Area, GGNRA. Comprised of over \n76,000 acres in Marin, San Mateo, and San Francisco counties, GGNRA is \none of the largest urban parks in the country. GGNRA hosts over 16 \nmillion visitors annually and is home to 1, 250 historic buildings, or \n7 percent of all designated historic structures in the country. With \never-growing expertise, Brian led GGNRA's 347 NPS employees and 8,000 \nvolunteers.\n  Brian had a special skill for connecting people with parks. He \nunderstood that in order to garner lasting support for parks, community \nmembers must be personally invested and involved every step of the way. \nBrian's can-do attitude enabled him to create fruitful partnerships \nwith business leaders, philanthropists, and community leaders. He \nconsistently proved skeptics wrong, as he raised more and more money to \ncreate additional parklands. NPS recognized Brian's natural aptitude \nfor building partnerships--when NPS created a new assistant director \nposition focused on creating relationships with outside entities, Brian \nwas asked to serve in this role for the first year of its existence.\n  I had the great pleasure of knowing Brian for many years, and will \nalways remember his bright smile and cheerful optimism. Brian's warmth \ndrew people to him--he was always surrounded by a rich circle of \nfriends and colleagues of all ages. Though he will be deeply missed, \nBrian has left us with the priceless and timeless gifts of the parks he \nhelped to build. Thanks in great part to Brian, GGNRA provides its \nvisitors with endless opportunities for exploration, education, and \ngetting in touch with life's deepest purpose and most rewarding \nopportunities.\n  Brian has no doubt left an indelible mark on our hearts, minds, and \nthe bay area's natural treasures. He was an inspiring and wonderful \nman. For those of us who were fortunate to know him, we take comfort in \nknowing that hundreds of thousands of park visitors will continue to \nbenefit from Brian's vision and determination for generations to come.\n  Brian is survived by his mother Mimi, twin brother Alan, wife Marti, \ndaughter Kim, son Brent, daughter-in law Anne, and three \ngrandchildren--Justin, Kieran and Sean.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5814-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     JESUSITA WILDFIRE FIREFIGHTERS\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in honoring the brave men and women firefighters who worked \ntirelessly to protect the residents of Santa Barbara County from the \nrecent Jesusita wildfire.\n  The Jesusita wildfire has burned nearly 10,000 acres, destroyed and \ndamaged dozens of homes, and at one point forced the evacuation of more \nthan 30,000 local residents.\n  Firefighters are often called upon to protect our communities while \nputting themselves in grave danger. This is certainly the case when \nreflecting on the efforts of Firefighter Robert Lopez, Captain Ron \nTopolinski, and Captain Brian Bulger from the Ventura County Fire \nDepartment. Firefighter Lopez and Captain Topolinski were assigned to \nstructure protection when their position was overrun by a fast-moving \nwall of fire. Firefighter Lopez and Captain Topolinski utilized their \ncombined 40-years of firefighting experience to survive the initial \nfire blast and call for help. Captain Brian Bulger responded to the \nemergency call and risked his own life to ensure the safety of his \nfellow firefighters. Although all three firefighters suffered injuries \ndue to fire and toxic smoke exposure, all three survived and are now on \ntheir way toward recovery. An additional 27 firefighters were injured \nduring this event.\n  I want to give special thanks to the more than 4,000 Federal, State, \nlocal, fire protection district, and volunteer firefighters who have \nput their lives on the line to fight this fire. Their courage and swift \naction during this recent wildfire has been truly heroic. They have \nrisked their health and well-being for the benefit of our communities, \nand we are grateful.\n  I invite all of my colleagues to join me in commending all men and \nwomen firefighters who risk their lives to protect our own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5814-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5814-S5815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JANE HAGEDORN\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am pleased to recognize the \ncareer and contributions of Breathe California of Sacramento-Emigrant \nTrails, Inc., chief executive officer, Jane Hagedorn, for her 36 years \nof service to promoting clean air and preventing lung and air \npollution-related diseases.\n  Jane Hagedorn began her affiliation with The American Lung \nAssociation of Sacramento-Emigrant Trails--later becoming Breathe \nCalifornia of Sacramento-Emigrant Trails--as a volunteer in 1973. \nDuring her 3 years as a volunteer, she served as president of the board \nand then became executive director in 1976.\n  Under Jane Hagedorn's leadership, Breathe California of Sacramento-\nEmigrant Trails, Inc. lead the fight to substantially reduce smoking \nand developed ``Thumbs Up! Thumbs Down!'' a nationally recognized \ntobacco research program developed to reduce the negative influence of \ntobacco use in film. Ms. Hagedorn also led Breathe California's \ncollaboration with the Sacramento Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce to \ncreate the Cleaner Air Partnership, which brings elected officials, \nbusiness leaders and nonprofit organizations together to collaborate on \nclean air initiatives for the Capital Region. She was also a leader in \nbringing light rail transit service to Sacramento to provide an \nenvironmentally friendly\n\n[[Page S5815]]\n\npublic transportation alternative to the region.\n  Ms. Hagedorn's dedication to her community and California has also \nbeen demonstrated by her participation on the boards of many government \nand nonprofit organizations in the region such as, the Tahoe Regional \nPlanning Agency, the Arden Park and Recreation District, Friends of \nLight Rail, and the Planning and Conservation League.\n  As her family, friends and the community gather to celebrate her \nretirement, I congratulate and thank Jane Hagedorn for her work to \nmaintain clean air for our future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5815-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           REMEMBERING HARRY KALAS AND CONSTANTINE PAPADAKIS\n\n Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, the city of Philadelphia lost two of \nits favorite sons recently. We are all saddened by the passing of \nlongtime Philadelphia Phillies broadcaster Harry Kalas and the loss of \nDrexel University president Constantine Papadakis. It has been a sad \ntime in Philadelphia with the loss of these two great pillars of the \ncommunity, and I wish today to honor their memory.\n  Harry Kalas was the voice of the Philadelphia Phillies for four \ndecades. His signature calls of ``Outta Here'' following a Phillies' \nhome run and ``Struck hiimm out'' following a strikeout became fixtures \non Phillies' broadcasts. Born in Chicago, Harry grew up the son of a \nminster in Naperville, IL. He began his broadcasting career in Hawaii \nand eventually moved to Houston, where he broadcasted Astros games from \n1965 to 1970. The Phillies were the Astros' opponent in his first game \nas a Major League broadcaster.\n  Harry signed up as the Phillies play-by-play announcer in 1971. He \nquickly became a popular figure in Philadelphia. Together with Richie \nAshburn, the Phillies' Hall of Fame outfielder, whom Harry worked with \nfrom 1971 until Asburn's passing in 1997, the pair formed a memorable \nteam built upon what the Philadelphia Inquirer recently described as \n``a special rapport in the broadcast booth that won over the fans' \nhearts.''\n  Fans, players, and sports writers have recounted over the past week \njust how deeply Harry was loved. One of the most poignant examples of \njust how beloved Harry was came after the 1980 World Series between the \nPhillies and the Kansas City Royals. Not a lot of people know that \nHarry was not permitted to call the Phillies' World Series victory over \nthe Royals due to a Major League Baseball rule in place at the time \nthat prevented local broadcasts of World Series games. The outcry from \nfans of baseball everywhere, particularly in Philadelphia, was so \nvociferous that Major League Baseball changed its rules. As a result, \nfans were treated to Harry's call of the Phillies' appearances in the \n1983 and 1993 World Series games and the Phillies' victory in the 2008 \nWorld Series. Harry's now famous call of the final out of the 2008 \nseries will forever ring in the minds of fans and players alike.\n  The Phillies have taken appropriate steps to honor Harry's memory for \nthe rest of the season. Most notably, Harry's signature ``Outta Here'' \nwill be played over the PA system each time a Phillies' player hits a \nhome run. Thousands of fans paid their respects to Harry during a \nmoving ceremony at Citizens Bank Park last Saturday. The tributes \nacross Major League Baseball are fitting for a man of Harry's stature.\n  Harry was not only a great broadcaster, he was a great man. I \npersonally will always remember Harry's faithful attendance and \nparticipation in the annual Veterans Day parade and ceremony in Media, \nPA. He loved the city of Philadelphia, and it loved him back.\n  No matter the score, Harry's passion for the game and unique voice \nkept the fans captivated for all nine innings. He made the tough \nseasons easier and the good years even better. To say he will be missed \nis an understatement. His is the voice that Phillies fans will forever \nassociate with baseball. My deepest condolences go out to Harry's \nfamily and the Philadelphia Phillies.\n  I also wish to honor the life of Constantine Papadakis--known as \n``Taki''--the longtime president of Drexel University in Philadelphia, \nPA, who passed away recently after a long and brave battle with lung \ncancer.\n  Taki was a creative and dynamic leader at Drexel University for 14 \nyears. He was described by one of his colleagues as identifying himself \ncompletely with the university--``there was no Taki that wasn't \nconnected to Drexel.'' His devotion to Drexel meant that for him, it \nwas not enough to simply preside over the institution. Instead, he \nthrew himself into building, expanding, and extending Drexel's reach, \nboth its academic prowess and its role in the community of \nPhiladelphia. Enrollment grew by more than 130 percent. Freshman \napplications increased by nearly 700 percent. Research funding went \nfrom $15 million to more than $100 million in each of the last three \nyears. The size of the faculty doubled and the university is now the \nseventh largest private employer in the city of Philadelphia. During \nTaki's tenure, Drexel added both a law school and a medical school. \nMost recently, he spearheaded the effort to acquire a campus in \nSacramento, CA.\n  Through the sheer force of his personality and his vision, Taki also \nbrought renewed hope and optimism to Philadelphia's leaders and \ncitizens. He established a leading role for Drexel in regional economic \ndevelopment, reaching out to business, academic, and community leaders \nto show what could be done by investing in growth. He knew that a \nuniversity is not an isolated institution but a member of a larger \ncommunity with the potential to transform a city and a region. He \nconstantly pushed forward, never content, as one colleague said, to \nrest on the laurels of Drexel's gains, ``however meteoric.'' Government \nofficials, business and community leaders, and ordinary citizens should \nbe inspired by Taki's relentless drive toward improving our communities \nby strengthening our civic institutions and engaging in public life.\n  Taki's last year was emblematic of how he lived the rest of his life. \nHis energy and charisma never waned, as he conducted business from his \nhospital bed, his office, and in board meetings. He had so much to work \nto finish, which is remarkable for an individual who had already \nachieved so much. He has been described as ``larger than life and taken \nfrom us too young,'' which is undoubtedly true.

Mr. President, today I commend Chuck Mack for \nhis contributions to the labor movement in California and his \nremarkable 47 years as a Teamster.\n  Chuck began his career as a Teamster in 1962 and has spent every year \nsince working on behalf of his fellow union members, organizing and \nensuring fair treatment and benefits for all.\n  First elected to a representative position in 1966, he worked as a \nbusiness agent until 1971 when he briefly moved to Sacramento to lobby \nthe legislature as part of the Teamsters Public Affairs Council.\n  Returning to the East Bay in 1971, Chuck successfully ran for the \nposition of secretary-treasurer of Local 70, a position he has \nmaintained ever since, which represents 5,000 members in Alameda \nCounty.\n  He was elected to the joint council in 1972, and became president of \nthe council, which represents 55,000 members in San Francisco, in 1982. \nIn 1996, Chuck was elected western region vice president. And, in 2003, \nhe was appointed director of the Teamsters Port Division.\n  Chuck's responsibilities and leadership roles have steadily increased \nover the last four decades.\n  I know him to be a passionate, thoughtful, and committed advocate for \nall workers.\n  Whether through his efforts to protect the environment in port \ncommunities or preserve wages and benefits for truck drivers, Chuck \nMack has always put the needs of his fellow Teamsters first.\n  Chuck will be stepping down from his Teamsters positions at Local 70, \nJoint Council 7, and the International Union at the end of this month.\n\n[[Page S5816]]\n\n  Chuck is now moving on to another significant challenge as he becomes \ncochair of the Western Conference of Teamsters Pension Trust.\n  I wish him the very best in this new endeavor and offer my heartfelt \nand sincere congratulations for a job well done representing Teamsters \nin the bay area and across northern California for the last four \ndecades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5816-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5816-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5816]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5816-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5816-S5817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  REPORT RELATIVE TO A PROPOSED AGREEMENT FOR COOPERATION BETWEEN THE \n GOVERNMENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE \n UNITED ARAB EMIRATES CONCERNING PEACEFUL USES OF NUCLEAR ENERGY--PM 21\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to sections 123 b. \nand 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. \n2153(b), (d)) (the ``Act''), the text of a proposed Agreement for \nCooperation Between the Government of the United States of America and \nthe Government of the United Arab Emirates Concerning Peaceful Uses of \nNuclear Energy. I am also pleased to transmit my written approval, \nauthorization, and determination concerning the Agreement, and an \nunclassified Nuclear Proliferation Assessment Statement (NPAS) \nconcerning the Agreement. (In accordance with section 123 of the Act, \nas amended by Title XII of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring \nAct of 1998 (Public Law 105-277), a classified annex to the NPAS, \nprepared by the Secretary of State in consultation with the Director of \nNational Intelligence, summarizing relevant classified information, \nwill be submitted to the Congress separately.) The joint memorandum \nsubmitted to me by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy \nand a letter from the Chairman of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission \nstating the views of the Commission are also enclosed.\n  The proposed Agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the Act \nand other applicable law. In my judgment, it meets all applicable \nstatutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other \nforeign policy interests of the United States.\n  The Agreement provides a comprehensive framework for peaceful nuclear \ncooperation with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) based on a mutual \ncommitment to nuclear nonproliferation. The United States and the UAE \nare entering into it in the context of a stated intention by the UAE to \nrely on existing international markets for nuclear fuel services as an \nalternative to the pursuit of enrichment and reprocessing. Article 7 \nwill transform this UAE policy into a legally binding obligation from \nthe UAE to the United States upon entry into force of the Agreement. \nArticle 13 provides, inter alia, that if the UAE at any time following \nentry into force of the Agreement materially violates Article 7, the \nUnited States will have a right to cease further cooperation under the \nAgreement, require the return of items subject to the Agreement, and \nterminate the Agreement by giving 90 days written notice. In view of \nthese and other nonproliferation features, the Agreement has the \npotential to serve as a model for other countries in the region that \nwish to pursue responsible nuclear energy development.\n  The Agreement has a term of 30 years and permits the transfer of \ntechnology, material, equipment (including reactors), and components \nfor nuclear research and nuclear power production. It does not permit \ntransfers of Restricted Data, sensitive nuclear technology, sensitive \nnuclear facilities, or major critical components of such facilities. In \nthe event of termination of the Agreement, key nonproliferation \nconditions and controls continue with respect to material, equipment, \nand components subject to the Agreement.\n  In addition to the UAE's obligation to forgo enrichment and \nreprocessing--the first instance of such an obligation on the part of a \nU.S. cooperating partner in an agreement of this type--the Agreement \ncontains certain additional nonproliferation features not typically \nfound in such agreements. These are modeled on similar provisions in \nthe 1981 United States-Egypt Agreement for Peaceful Nuclear Cooperation \nand include (a) a right of the United States to require the removal of \nspecial fissionable material subject to the Agreement from the UAE \neither to the United States or to a third country if exceptional \ncircumstances of concern from a nonproliferation standpoint so require, \nand (b) confirmation by the United States that the fields of \ncooperation, terms, and conditions accorded by the United States to the \nUAE shall be no less favorable in scope and effect than those that the \nUnited States may accord to any other non-nuclear-weapon State in the \nMiddle East in a peaceful nuclear cooperation agreement. The Agreement \nalso provides, for the first time in a U.S. agreement for peaceful \nnuclear cooperation, that prior to U.S. licensing of exports of nuclear \nmaterial, equipment, components, or technology pursuant to the \nAgreement, the UAE shall bring into force the Additional Protocol to \nits safeguards agreement.\n  The UAE is a non-nuclear-weapon State party to the Treaty on the Non-\nProliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). The United States is a nuclear-\nweapon State party to the NPT. Article 12 of the proposed Agreement \nprovides that the Agreement shall not be interpreted as affecting the \ninalienable rights of the United States and the UAE under the NPT. A \nmore detailed discussion of the UAE's intended civil nuclear program \nand its nonproliferation policies and practices is provided in the NPAS \nand in a classified Annex to the NPAS to be submitted to the Congress \nseparately.\n  The Agreed Minute to the Agreement provides U.S. prior approval for \nretransfers by the UAE of irradiated nuclear material subject to the \nAgreement to France and the United Kingdom, if consistent with their \nrespective policies, laws, and regulations, for storage or reprocessing \nsubject to specified conditions, including that prior agreement between \nthe United States and the UAE is required for the transfer of any \nspecial fissionable material recovered from any such reprocessing to \nthe UAE. The transferred material would also have to be held within the \nEuropean Atomic Energy Community subject to the Agreement for \nCooperation in the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Energy Between the United \nStates of America and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM).\n  In view of the fact that this consent would constitute a subsequent \narrangement under the Act if agreed separately from the proposed \nAgreement, the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Energy have \nensured that the advance approval provisions meet the applicable \nrequirements of section 131 of the Act. Specifically, they have \nconcluded that the U.S. advance approval for retransfer of nuclear \nmaterial for reprocessing or storage contained in the Agreed Minute to \nthe proposed Agreement is not inimical to the common defense and \nsecurity. An analysis of the advance approval given in the Agreed \nMinute is contained in the NPAS.\n  This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both \nsections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Act. My Administration is prepared to \nbegin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee as provided in \nsection 123 b. Upon completion of the period of 30 days of continuous \nsession provided for in section\n\n[[Page S5817]]\n\n123 b., the period of 60 days of continuous session provided for in \nsection 123 d. shall commence.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 21, 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5817-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5817]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 9:04 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bills:\n\n       H.R. 131.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nassistance in implementing cultural heritage, conservation, and \nrecreational activities in the Connecticut River watershed of the \nStates of New Hampshire\n\n[[Page S5823]]\n\nand Vermont; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce today the Upper \nConnecticut River Partnership Act. This legislation will help bring \nrecognition to New England's largest river ecosystem and one of our \nNation's 14 American Heritage Rivers.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to help the communities along the \nriver protect and enhance their rich cultural history, economic \nvitality, and the environmental integrity of the river.\n  From its origin in the mountains of northern New Hampshire, the \nConnecticut River runs over 400 miles and eventually empties into Long \nIsland Sound. The river forms a natural boundary between my home state \nof Vermont and New Hampshire, and travels through the States of \nMassachusetts and Connecticut. The river and surrounding valley have \nlong shaped and influenced development in the New England region. This \nriver is one of America's earliest developed rivers, with European \nsettlements going back over 350 years. The industrial revolution \nblossomed in the Connecticut River Valley, supported by new \ntechnologies such as canals and mills run by hydropower.\n  I am pleased that the entire Senate delegations from Vermont and New \nHampshire have cosponsored this bill. For years our States have worked \ntogether, to help communities on both sides of the river develop local \npartnerships to protect the Connecticut River valley of Vermont and New \nHampshire. While great improvements have been made to the river, its \noverall health remains threatened by water and air pollution, habitat \nloss, hydroelectric dams, and invasive species.\n  Historically, the people throughout the Upper Connecticut River \nValley have functioned cooperatively and the river serves to unite \nVermont and New Hampshire communities economically, culturally, and \nenvironmentally.\n  Citizens on both sides of the river know just how special this region \nis and have worked side by side for years to protect it. Efforts have \nbeen underway for some time to restore the Atlantic salmon fishery, \nprotect threatened and endangered species, and support urban riverfront \nrevitalization.\n  In 1989, Vermont and New Hampshire came together to create the \nConnecticut River Joint Commissions--a unique partnership between the \nstates, local businesses, all levels of Government within the 2 States \nand citizens from all walks of life. This partnership helps coordinate \nthe efforts of towns, watershed managers and other local groups to \nimplement the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan. This Plan has \nbecome the blueprint for how communities along the river can work with \none another with Vermont and New Hampshire and with the federal \ngovernment to protect the river's resources.\n  The Upper Connecticut River Partnership Act would help carry out the \nrecommendations of the Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan, \nwhich was developed under New Hampshire law with the active \nparticipation of Vermont citizens and communities.\n  This act would also provide the Secretary of the Interior with the \nmuch needed ability to assist the States of New Hampshire and Vermont \nwith technical and financial aid for the Upper Connecticut River Valley \nthrough the Connecticut River Joint Commissions. The act would also \nassist local communities with cultural heritage outreach and education \nprograms while enriching the recreational activities already active in \nthe Connecticut River Watershed of Vermont and New Hampshire.\n  Lastly, the bill will require that the Secretary of the Interior \nestablish a Connecticut River Grants and Technical Assistance Program \nto help local community groups develop new projects as well as build on \nexisting ones to enhance the river basin.\n  In the future, I hope this bill will help bring renewed recognition \nand increased efforts to conserve the Connecticut River as one of our \nNation's great natural and economic resources.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follwos:\n\n                                S. 1117\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Upper Connecticut River \n     Partnership Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the upper Connecticut River watershed in the States of \n     New Hampshire and Vermont is a scenic region of historic \n     villages located in a working landscape of farms, forests, \n     and the mountainous headwaters and broad fertile floodplains \n     of New England's longest river, the Connecticut River;\n       (2) the River provides outstanding fish and wildlife \n     habitat, recreation, and hydropower generation for the New \n     England region;\n       (3) the upper Connecticut River watershed has been \n     recognized by Congress as part of the Silvio O. Conte \n     National Fish and Wildlife Refuge, established by the Silvio \n     O. Conte National Fish and Wildlife Refuge Act (16 U.S.C. \n     668dd note; Public Law 102-212);\n       (4) the demonstrated commitment to stewardship of the River \n     by the citizens living in the watershed led to the \n     Presidential designation of the River as 1 of 14 American \n     Heritage Rivers on July 30, 1998;\n       (5) the River is home to the bi-State Connecticut River \n     Scenic Byway, which was declared a National Scenic Byway by \n     the Department of Transportation in 2005 to foster heritage \n     tourism in the region;\n       (6) each of the legislatures of the States of Vermont and \n     New Hampshire has established a commission for the \n     Connecticut River watershed, and the 2 commissions, known \n     collectively as the ``Connecticut River Joint Commissions''--\n       (A) have worked together since 1989; and\n       (B) serve as the focal point and catalyst for cooperation \n     between Federal agencies, States, communities, and citizens;\n       (7) in 1997, as directed by the legislatures, the \n     Connecticut River Joint Commissions, with the substantial \n     involvement of 5 bi-State local river subcommittees appointed \n     to represent riverfront towns, produced the 6 volume \n     Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan, to be used as a \n     blueprint in educating agencies, communities, and the public \n     in how to be good neighbors to a great river;\n       (8) in 2009, after 3 years of broad consultation, the \n     Connecticut River Joint Commissions have substantially \n     expanded and published updates via the Connecticut River \n     Recreation Management Plan and the Water Resources Management \n     Plan to guide public and private activities in the watershed;\n       (9) through a joint legislative resolution, the \n     legislatures of the States of Vermont and New Hampshire have \n     requested that Congress provide for continuation of \n     cooperative partnerships and that Federal agencies support \n     the Connecticut River Joint Commissions in carrying out the \n     recommendations of the Connecticut River Corridor Management \n     Plan;\n       (10) this Act effectuates certain recommendations of the \n     Connecticut River Corridor Management Plan that are most \n     appropriately directed by the States through the Connecticut \n     River Joint Commissions, with assistance from the National \n     Park Service and the United States Fish and Wildlife Service; \n     and\n       (11) where implementation of those recommendations involves \n     partnership with local communities and organizations, support \n     for the partnership should be provided by the Secretary.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to authorize the \n     Secretary to provide to the States of New Hampshire and \n     Vermont (including communities in those States), through the \n     Connecticut River Joint Commissions, technical and financial \n     assistance for management of the River.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend part D of title V of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act of 1965 to provide grants for the repair, \nrenovation, and construction of elementary and secondary schools, \nincluding early learning facilities at the elementary schools; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the School \nBuilding Fairness Act of 2009. I offer this legislation to meet the \nurgent need for Federal support to repair crumbling schools in \ndisadvantaged and rural school districts.\n  This bill would authorize up to $6 billion annually to fund a new \nprogram of Federal grants to States for the repair, renovation, and \nconstruction of public schools. States would award the grants \ncompetitively, with priority given to high-poverty and rural school \ndistricts, as well as school districts that plan to make their \nfacilities more energy efficient and environmentally friendly. \nDistricts receiving this federal funding would then be required to \nprovide a local match.\n  I know this approach to school construction and repair can work \nbecause this bill is modeled on the success of the Iowa Demonstration \nand Construction Grant Program in my home State. Over the last decade, \nI have secured $121 million in Federal funds that more than 300 school \ndistricts across Iowa have used for school construction and repair. \nThis modest Federal investment has leveraged more than $600 million in \nadditional local funding.\n  In addition to improving the learning environment for students, the \nSchool Building Fairness Act will provide a stimulus to the economy by \ncreating jobs in thousands of communities all across the country for \nworkers in the construction industry, as well as architects and \nengineers.\n  It will also spur school districts to make their facilities more \nenvironmentally friendly and energy-efficient. According to the 2006 \nreport ``Greening America's Schools: Costs and Benefits,'' green \nschools use an average of 33 percent less energy than conventionally \nbuilt schools, and generate financial savings of about $70 per square \nfoot.\n  Safe, modern, healthy school buildings are essential to creating an \nenvironment where students can reach their academic potential. Yet too \nmany students in the U.S., particularly those most at risk of being \nleft behind, attend school in facilities that are old, overcrowded and \nrun-down.\n  We all agree that school infrastructure requires constant \nmaintenance. Unfortunately, far too many schools have been forced to \nneglect ongoing issues, most likely due to lack of funds, which can \nlead to health and safety problems for students, educators and staff. \nThe most recent Infrastructure Report Card issued by the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers gives public schools a D grade. Now, I do \nnot know many parents who would find D grades acceptable for their \nchildren. So why on Earth would we stand by while the state of the \nbuildings in which our children learn are assigned such a grade?\n  Despite the declining condition of many public schools, federal grant \nfunding is generally not available to leverage local spending. In \nfiscal year 2001, in the Senate Labor, Health and Human Services, and \nEducation Appropriations Subcommittee, which I then chaired, I was able \nto secure $1.2 billion for school repair and renovation. I continue to \nhear nothing but positive feedback from educators across the country \nabout that funding.\n  But that one-time investment amounted to nothing more than a drop in \nthe bucket compared to the estimated national need. At the beginning of \nthis decade, the National Center for Education Statistics estimated \nthat the nation's K-12 public schools needed $127 billion in repairs \nand upgrades. A 2008 analysis by the American Federation of Teachers \nfound that the Nation's school infrastructure needs total an estimated \n$254.6 billion.\n  This bill is called the School Building Fairness Act because, as I \nsaid, States will give preference in awarding grants to high-poverty \nand rural districts. Currently, spending on school facilities is almost \ntwice as high in affluent districts as in disadvantaged districts. This \nis one of those ``savage inequalities'' that Jonathan Kozol writes \nabout--inequalities that largely explain the learning gap between \naffluent and poor children.\n  Something is seriously wrong when children go to modern, gleaming \nshopping malls and sports arenas, but attend public schools with \ncrumbling walls and leaking roofs. This sends exactly the wrong message \nto children about our priorities as adults.\n  With the School Building Fairness Act, we have a chance to get our \npriorities right, and to provide a desperately needed boost to school \ndistricts all across America.\n  I hope that my colleagues will join me to help create safe, modern, \nand healthy school environments so all of our children can grow to be \nthe leaders of tomorrow.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BARRASSO (for himself, Mr. Johnson, Mr. Udall of Colorado, \n        Mr. Bennet, Mr. Risch, and Mr. Bennett:\n  S. 1122. A bill to authorize the Secretary of Agriculture and the \nSecretary of the Interior to enter into cooperative agreements with \nState foresters authorizing State foresters to provide certain forest, \nrangeland, and watershed restoration and protection services; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce the Good \nNeighbor Forestry Act today along with my Senators Johnson, Udall of \nColorado, Bennet of Colorado, Risch, and Bennett of Utah. This \nlegislation authorizes cooperative action between western states and \nthe U.S. Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management to complete forest \nand rangeland health projects on private, State and Federal lands.\n  Almost half of the land in Wyoming is managed by Federal agencies. \nOur State has a long history of forestry, grazing and multiple use of \npublic lands. Recreation and tourism on our public lands is a pillar of \nour economy. The people of Wyoming are proud stewards of our public \nlands and our state depends on the public lands for our future.\n  It is my goal to enact common-sense policies to address the \nmanagement needs of our Federal lands. Wyoming forests, like those of \nall states across the West, are facing management challenges. We have \nan opportunity to meet those challenges with policies that encourage \nforest and rangeland health. Preventing forest fires, removing invasive \nspecies, addressing watershed health and conserving wildlife habitat \nrequire ``big picture'' thinking. We have to address these threats at \nthe landscape level.\n  Resource challenges do not stop at fencelines, and neither should our \npolicy.\n  The Good Neighbor Forestry Act would set in place a cooperative \nmanagement policy. This act would allow the State of Wyoming to go \nforward with forest and rangeland health projects as agreed to by the \nU.S. Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management. With this authority, \nthe agencies can cooperatively pursue projects that address landscape-\nlevel needs. This authority would provide on-the-ground management that \nour private, State, and Federal lands desperately need.\n  I am pleased to introduce this legislation today. It is of great \nimportance to the people of Wyoming, and public land communities across \nthe West. I hope the U.S. Senate will proceed quickly with its passage \nto enhance western states' response to growing management challenges.\n  The people of Wyoming demand on-the-ground results. This legislation \ncan deliver those results. I hope we can pass it expediently.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous cnsent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1122\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for a five-year payment increase under the \nMedicare program for home health services furnished in a rural area; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues from \nArkansas and Missouri to introduce the Medicare Rural Home Health \nPayment Fairness Act to reinstate the 5 percent add-on payment for home \nhealth services in rural areas that expired on January 1, 2007.\n  Home health has become an increasingly important part of our health \ncare system. The kinds of highly skilled--and often technically \ncomplex--services that our Nation's home health caregivers provide have \nenabled millions of our most frail and vulnerable older and disabled \ncitizens to avoid hospitals and nursing homes and stay just where they \nwant to be--in the comfort and security of their own homes. I have \naccompanied several of Maine's caring home health nurses on their \nvisits to some of their patients. I have seen first hand the difference \nthat they are making for Maine's elderly.\n  Surveys have shown that the delivery of home health services in rural \nareas can be as much as 12 to 15 percent more costly because of the \nextra travel time required to cover long distances between patients, \nhigher transportation expenses, and other factors. Because of the \nlonger travel times, rural caregivers are unable to make as many visits \nin a day as their urban counterparts. The executive director of the \nVisiting Nurses of Aroostook in Northern Maine, where I am from, tells \nme her agency covers 6,600 square miles with a total population of only \n73,000. This agency's costs are understandably much higher than other \nagencies due to the long distances the staff must drive to see clients. \nMoreover, the staff is not able to see as many patients due to time on \nthe road.\n  Agencies in rural areas are also frequently smaller than their urban \ncounterparts, which means that their relative costs are higher. Smaller \nagencies with fewer patients and fewer visits mean that fixed costs, \nparticularly those associated with meeting regulatory requirements, are \nspread over a much smaller number of patients and visits, increasing \noverall per-patient and per-visit costs.\n\n  Moreover, in many rural areas, home health agencies are the primary \ncaregivers for homebound beneficiaries with limited access to \ntransportation. These rural patients often require more time and care \nthan their urban counterparts, and are understandably more expensive \nfor agencies to serve. If the extra rural payment is not extended, \nagencies may be forced to make decisions not to accept rural patients \nwith greater care needs. That could translate into less access to \nhealth care for ill, homebound seniors. The result would likely be that \nthese seniors would be hospitalized more frequently and would have to \nseek care in nursing homes, adding considerable cost to the system.\n  Failure to extend the rural add-on payment will only put more \npressure on rural home health agencies that are already operating on \nvery narrow margins and could force some of the agencies to close their \ndoors altogether. Many home health agencies operating in rural areas \nare the only home health providers in large geographic areas. If any of \nthese agencies were forced to close, the Medicare patients in that \nregion could lose all of their access to home care.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will extend the rural add-on \nfor 5 years and help to ensure that Medicare patients in rural areas \ncontinue to have access to the home health services they need.

A bill to require the Director of National Intelligence to \nsubmit a report to Congress on retirement benefits for former employees \nof Air America and for other purposes; to the Select Committee on \nIntelligence.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it has been said that ``The nation which \nforgets its defenders will itself be forgotten.'' I believe it. This is \nwhy I rise today to again introduce legislation to help correct an \ninjustice for those who have served our country in times of crisis.\n  Many people have never heard of Air America. This top-secret \npassenger and cargo airline was a Government corporation owned and \noperated by the\n\n[[Page S5826]]\n\nCentral Intelligence Agency during the Cold War.\n  Forty-eight years ago, the first Air America pilots were killed in \ncovert military action in Laos. On May 30th, 1961, Charles Mateer and \nWalter Wizbowski crashed their helicopter in rugged terrain and \nunpredictable weather while trying to land in order to resupply \nbesieged Hmong during the Cold War.\n  Air America employed several hundred U.S. citizens like Mr. Mateer \nand Wizbowski to conduct covert missions throughout the Cold War. \nDuring the Vietnam War, they carried nearly 12,000 government-sponsored \npassengers each month including troops and refugees. During the final \ndays of the Vietnam war, Air America helicopters evacuated some 41,000 \nAmericans, diplomats and friendly Vietnamese. Throughout the Cold War, \nnumerous Air Force and Navy pilots were saved by heroic Air America \nhelicopter rescue missions after being shot down behind enemy lines.\n  Air America personnel paid a costly burden to run these dangerous \nmissions. Sadly, at least 86 American pilots were killed in action \nwhile operating aircraft for our Government. In all, Air America had \n240 pilots and crewmembers killed in action.\n  In order to be able to conduct these high-risk missions, Air America \noperations were conducted by the CIA with strict secrecy. The \nGovernment ownership of the company was never acknowledged at the time \nand was not known to the public. Only a small number of officials were \naware that, as employees of the CIA, Air America personnel were \nentitled to standard benefits provided to Federal employees.\n  Despite their heroic service to our nation, Air America employees are \nnow being neglected by our Government.\n  Frustrated by Federal intransience and bureaucracy, former Air \nAmerica employees from Nevada came to me and requested congressional \nassistance to help them obtain Federal civil service retirement \nbenefits.\n  Today, the legislation I am introducing helps move us closer to \ncorrecting this injustice.\n  Mr. President, the ``Air America Veteran's Act'' recognizes these \nemployees by requiring the Director of National Intelligence to submit \na report to Congress about the number of Air America beneficiaries and \nthe benefits owed to them. This report is critical because it will \nprovide the justification Congress needs to ensure that these veterans \nare treated equitably and fairly by their Government.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to join me in cosponsoring this \nimportant legislation to correct this injustice. These great Americans \nhave earned these benefits and the gratitude of a thankful Nation. Now \nis our chance to honor their service and begin recognizing their \nsacrifices.\n  Mr. Presdient, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1126\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Education to award \ngrants to local educational agencies to improve college enrollment; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, an educated workforce is crucial to the \nsuccess of the American economy. A recent report from the consulting \nfirm McKinsey, ``The Economic Impact of the Achievement Gap in \nAmerica's Schools,'' concludes that if America had raised the \neducational attainment of our students to those of high-performing \nnations like Finland and South Korea between 1983 and 1998, U.S. G.D.P. \nin 2008 would have been between $1.3 trillion and $2.3 trillion higher \nthan it is today. If the gap between low-income American students and \nAmerican students of higher means had been narrowed, G.D.P. in 2008 \nwould have been $400 billion to $670 billion higher.\n  If we want to be economically competitive and avoid future \nrecessions, we need to close the achievement gap in education for all \nAmericans. In his first speech to Congress, President Obama set a goal \nof having the highest college graduation rate in the world by 2020. Too \nmany students are not receiving a college education, and we will have \nto do far better to reach the President's goal.\n  Of students who were in eighth grade in 2000, only 20 percent of the \nlowest-income students will earn a college degree by 2012, compared to \n68 percent of the highest income group. Every student who wants to go \nto college should have that opportunity, and we should provide them \nwith the tools they need.\n  Today, I am introducing the Pathways to College Act with Senator \nBurr, which creates grants for school districts to help them increase \nthe number of low-income students who are entering and succeeding in \ncollege.\n  Lack of guidance and information about college has a real effect on \nstudents in poor schools. The Consortium\n\n[[Page S5827]]\n\non Chicago School Research released a report last year, ``Potholes on \nthe Road to College,'' that looks at the difficulties Chicago Public \nSchool students face during the college application process. The \nConsortium discovered that only 41 percent of Chicago Public School \nstudents who wanted to go to college took the steps necessary to apply \nto and enroll in a 4-year college. Only one-third of students enrolled \nin a college that matched their qualifications. Of the students who had \nthe grades and test scores to attend a selective college, 29 percent \nwent to a community college or skipped college entirely.\n  The Pathways to College Act would create a grant program for school \ndistricts serving low-income students to increase their college-\nenrollment rates. The Consortium's ``Potholes'' report found that the \nmost important factor in whether students enroll in a four-year college \nis if they attended a school where teachers create a strong college-\ngoing culture and help students with the process of applying. The \nPathways to College Act would provide the funding to help school \ndistricts improve the college-going culture in schools and guide \nstudents through the college admissions process.\n  The Pathways to College Act provides flexibility to school districts \nto achieve higher college enrollment rates, but requires that each \nschool accurately track their results so we can learn from what works. \nChicago Public Schools is doing a great job--both in tackling the \nproblem and in documenting progress. Under the leadership of Arne \nDuncan, Chicago Public Schools responded aggressively to the \n``Potholes'' report.\n  A team of postsecondary coaches were deployed in high schools to work \nwith students and counselors. To ensure that financial aid is not a \nroadblock, FAFSA completion rates are tracked so that counselors can \nfollow-up with students. A spring-break college tour took 500 students \nto see colleges across the country. Because Chicago Public Schools \ntracks its college enrollment rates, we know that their efforts are \nworking.\n  Half of the 2007 graduating class enrolled in college, an increase of \n6.5 percent in 4 years. The national increase was less than 1 percent \nin the same time-frame. Nationally, the number of African-American \ngraduates going to college has decreased by 6 percent over the last 4 \nyears while the Chicago rate has increased by almost 8 percent.\n  Applying to college is not easy. Low-income students often need the \nmost help to achieve their college dreams. When schools focus on \ncollege and provide the tools to get there, students make the \nconnection between the work they are doing now and their future goals \nin college and life. Students in those schools are more likely enroll \nin college and are also more likely to work hard in high school to be \nprepared for college when they arrive. The bill we are introducing \ntoday tries to ensure that lack of information never prevents a student \nfrom achieving his or her college dream.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1129\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Pathways to College Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) An educated workforce is crucial to the success of the \n     United States economy. Access to higher education for all \n     students is critical to maintaining an educated workforce. \n     More than 80 percent of the 23,000,000 jobs that will be \n     created in the next 10 years will require postsecondary \n     education. Only 36 percent of all 18- to 24-year olds are \n     currently enrolled in postsecondary education.\n       (2) Workers with bachelor's degrees earn on average $17,000 \n     more annually than workers with only high school diplomas. \n     Workers who earn bachelor's degrees can be expected to earn \n     $1,000,000 more over a lifetime than those who only finished \n     high school.\n       (3) In order to prepare students for college, all schools \n     should--\n       (A) provide student guidance to engage students in college \n     and career awareness; and\n       (B) ensure that students enroll in a rigorous curriculum to \n     prepare for postsecondary education.\n       (4) The Department of Education reports that the average \n     student-to-counselor ratio in high schools is 315:1. This is \n     far higher than the ratio recommended by the American School \n     Counselor Association, which is 250:1. While school \n     counselors at private schools spend an average of 58 percent \n     of their time on postsecondary education counseling, school \n     counselors in public schools spend an average of 25 percent \n     of their time on postsecondary education counseling.\n       (5) While just 57 percent of students from the lowest \n     income quartile enroll in college, 87 percent of students \n     from the top income quartile enroll. Of students who were in \n     eighth grade in 2000, only 20 percent of the lowest-income \n     students are projected to attain a bachelor's degree by 2012, \n     compared to 68 percent of the highest income group, according \n     to the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance in \n     2006.\n       (6) A recent report by the Consortium on Chicago School \n     Research found that only 41 percent of Chicago public school \n     students who aspire to go to college took the steps necessary \n     to apply to and enroll in a 4-year institution of higher \n     education. The report also reveals that only \\1/3\\ of Chicago \n     students who want to attend a 4-year institution of higher \n     education enroll in a school that matches their \n     qualifications. Even among students qualified to attend a \n     selective college, 29 percent enrolled in a community college \n     or did not enroll at all.\n       (7) The Consortium found that many Chicago public school \n     students do not complete the Free Application for Federal \n     Student Aid, even though students who apply for Federal \n     financial aid are 50 percent more likely to enroll in \n     college. Sixty-five percent of public secondary school \n     counselors at low-income schools believe that students and \n     parents are discouraged from considering college as an option \n     due to lack of knowledge about financial aid.\n       (8) Low-income and first-generation families often \n     overestimate the cost of tuition and underestimate available \n     aid; students from these backgrounds have access to fewer \n     college application resources and financial aid resources \n     than other groups, and are less likely to fulfill their \n     postsecondary plans as a result.\n       (9) College preparation intervention programs can double \n     the college-going rates for at-risk youth, can expand \n     students' educational aspirations, and can boost college \n     enrollment and graduation rates.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to provide for a demonstration project regarding \nMedicaid reimbursements for stabilization of emergency medical \nconditions by non-publicly owned or operated institutions for mental \ndiseases; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the Medicaid \nEmergency Psychiatric Care Demonstration Project Act. I am pleased to \nbe joined by Senators Conrad, Wyden and Collins in this effort. We are \nintroducing this legislation to address an unfair conflict in two \nFederal laws--the Institution for Mental Diseases, IMD, Exclusion and \nThe Emergency Medical and Labor Treatment Act, EMTALA.\n  EMTALA requires all hospitals, including freestanding psychiatric \nhospitals, to stabilize patients who come in with an emergency medical \ncondition. At the same time, under an outdated Medicaid provision \ncalled the IMD exclusion, adult Medicaid patients, 21-64, are not \ncovered for inpatient psychiatric care in a freestanding psychiatric \nhospital, but are covered in a general hospital psychiatric unit. Yet \nboth types of hospitals are required to stabilize any patient--which \nmay require hospitalization--who comes to them for emergency care \nregardless of ability to pay.\n  In order to correct this inequity, we have introduced the Medicaid \nEmergency Psychiatric Care Demonstration Project Act. This legislation \nwould establish a 3-year, demonstration program capped at $75 million, \nwhich would allow states to apply for federal Medicaid matching funds \nto demonstrate that covering Medicaid patients in freestanding, non-\ngovernmental psychiatric hospitals will improve timely access to \nemergency psychiatric care, reduce the burden on overcrowded emergency \nrooms, and improve the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of inpatient \npsychiatric care. Our legislation helps alleviate a problem where \npatients with significant mental health needs are often forced to \nendure prolonged stays in emergency rooms and hospitals without the \npsychiatric attention they require.\n  The measure is supported by 27 national healthcare organizations, \nincluding the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill--the country's \nlargest advocacy organization for the mentally ill, the National \nAssociation of Psychiatric Health Systems, the American Hospital \nAssociation, the Federation of American Hospitals, the American \nPsychiatric Association, the National Association of County Behavioral \nHealthcare Directors, the American College of Emergency Physicians, and \nthe Emergency Nurses Association.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WYDEN (for himself, Mr. Burr, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. \n        Cardin):\n  S. 1131. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide certain high cost Medicare beneficiaries suffering from \nmultiple chronic conditions with access to coordinated, primary care \nmedical services in lower cost treatment settings, such as their \nresidences, under a plan of care developed by a team of qualified and \nexperienced health care professionals; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am reintroducing the Independence at Home \nAct together with colleagues in the Senate and the House. Mr. Burr, Mr. \nWhitehouse, Mr. Cardin and I are proud to join forces with our House \ncolleagues, Mr. Markey, and his cosponsor, Mr. Smith, to move forward \nwith this important legislation to provide a coordinated team-based \napproach to primary care for chronically ill Medicare beneficiaries in \ntheir own homes. Returning to basics like paying doctors for home \nvisits to vulnerable patients, and following them through the course of \ntheir illness while saving taxpayers money, is the kind of legislation \nI am proud to introduce.\n  The Independence at Home, or IAH, Act comes at the perfect time. The \nAmerican people and the federal government need to save money on health \ncare, while having more choices and getting better results. This \ndelivery model has a proven track record of doing just this. Similar \n``house calls'' programs, currently operating across the country, are \nreducing costs, improving care quality, and helping people remain \nindependent as long as possible. This delivery model is also providing \nmuch needed relief to caregivers who are often juggling a full-time job \nwhile caring for their very ill family member. This is medical care \nAmericans want and deserve.\n  It is not too often that health policy has good outcome results \nbefore the pilot program phase begins, but that is exactly the case \nwith the IAH Act. Similar home health delivery models, such as the \nVeterans Administration's Home-Based Primary Care, Boston, \nMassachusetts' Urban Medical's House Calls Program, and Portland, \nOregon's Housecall Providers have been so successful in improving \nquality and reducing costs, that our bill guarantees 5 percent savings \nto Medicare.\n  These successful home health programs have demonstrated that the \noptimal way to address the challenges of caring for persons with \nchronic conditions is to better integrate their care and to work with \ntheir caregivers. Medical problems are best managed and coordinated by \nhealth care professionals who know their patients, their problems, \ntheir medications, and their other health care providers. Using this \napproach, the Independence at Home Act provides a better, more cost-\neffective way for Medicare patients with chronic conditions to get the \ncare they need. It further advances Medicare reform by creating \nincentives for providers to develop better and lower cost health care \nfor the highest cost beneficiaries.\n  This bipartisan, bicameral bill would create a pilot program to \nimprove in-home care availability for beneficiaries with multiple \nchronic conditions. This is a win-win for all involved. It will help \npeople remain in their homes for longer periods of time, it will \nimprove the quality of care, and physicians will receive a bundled \npayment for coordinating this care with a team of healthcare providers.\n  More specifically, the Independence at Home Act establishes a two-\nphase three-year Medicare pilot project that uses a patient-centered \nhealth care delivery model to ensure that Medicare beneficiaries with \nmultiple chronic conditions can remain independent for as long as \npossible in a comfortable environment. By incorporating lessons from \npast Medicare demonstration projects and from current home health\n\n[[Page S5830]]\n\nmodels, this bill provides for programs that hold providers accountable \nfor quality, mandatory annual minimum savings, and patient \nsatisfaction. Savings are generated by providing better care to \nMedicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions and reducing \nduplicative and unnecessary services, hospitalization, and other health \ncare costs.\n  Persons eligible for the program include Medicare beneficiaries with \nfunctional impairments, two or more chronic health problems, and recent \nuse of other health services. Each IAH patient will receive a \ncomprehensive assessment at least annually. The assessment will inform \na plan for care that is directed by an IAH physician, nurse-\npractitioner, or physician's assistant. The plan is developed by an IAH \nplan coordinator in collaboration with the patient and caregiver. \nMedication management is provided by pharmacists due to their expertise \nin pharmacology, and electronic medical records and health information \ntechnology will be employed to improve patient care and reduce costs.\n  The two-phase pilot program will take place in the thirteen highest-\ncost states plus thirteen additional states. After review of Phase I \nand the evaluation report, the Secretary may elect to expand the \nprogram nationwide so it could then become an ongoing benefit for \nMedicare beneficiaries.\n  A shared-savings agreement incentive program allows this innovative \ndelivery model to attract and maintain providers. The IAH organization \nwill be required to demonstrate savings of at least 5 percent annually \ncompared with the costs of serving non-participating Medicare \nchronically ill beneficiaries. The IAH organization may keep 80 percent \nof savings beyond the required 5 percent savings as an incentive to \nmaximize the financial benefits of being an IAH organization. Any \nsavings beyond 25 percent would be split, with 50 percent directed to \nthe IAH organization and 50 percent to Medicare. In Phase II, the \nSecretary may modify the payment incentive structure to increase \nsavings to the Medicare Trust Fund only if it will not impede access to \nIAH services to eligible beneficiaries.\n  I would like to thank my fellow Senate cosponsors, Richard Burr, \nSheldon Whitehouse, and Benjamin Cardin, and my cosponsor in the House, \nRepresentative Ed Markey, and his cosponsor, Chris Smith, for their \nsupport. I also thank Rahm Emanuel for his support of IAH in the last \nCongress. I would also like to thank all our staff who worked so hard \non this legislation, particularly Gregory Hinrichsen in my office. \nFinally, I would like to thank the following groups for voicing their \nsupport for this legislation: The American Academy of Home Care \nPhysicians; The American Academy of Neurology; The AARP; The \nAlzheimer's Association; The Alzheimer's Foundation of America; The \nAmerican Academy of Nurse Practitioners; The American College of Nurse \nPractitioners; American Academy of Physician Assistants; The American \nSociety of Consultant Pharmacists; The National Family Caregivers \nAssociation; The Family Caregiver Alliance/National Center on \nCaregiving; The American Association of Homes and Services for the \nAging; The Housecalls Doctors of Texas; The Maryland-National Capital \nHome Care Association; The Visiting Nurse Associations of America; \nHousecall Providers, Inc. of Portland, OR; Intel Corp.; The National \nCouncil on Aging; U.S. PIRG; Massachusetts Neurologic Society; Naples \nHealth Care Associates; Urban Medical House Calls of Boston, MA; MD2U \nDoctors Who Make Housecalls (Louisville, KY); Wyeth Pharmaceuticals.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important legislation to \nhelp Medicare patients get better care at lower cost.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows;\n\n                                S. 1131\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Independence at Home Act of \n     2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the November 2007 Congressional Budget \n     Office Long Term Outlook for Health Care Spending, unless \n     changes are made to the way health care is delivered, growing \n     demand for resources caused by rising health care costs and \n     to a lesser extent the nation's expanding elderly population \n     will confront Americans with increasingly difficult choices \n     between health care and other priorities. However, \n     opportunities exist to constrain health care costs without \n     adverse health care consequences.\n       (2) Medicare beneficiaries with multiple chronic conditions \n     account for a disproportionate share of Medicare spending \n     compared to their representation in the overall Medicare \n     population, and evidence suggests that such patients often \n     receive poorly coordinated care, including conflicting \n     information from health providers and different diagnoses of \n     the same symptoms.\n       (3) People with chronic conditions account for 76 percent \n     of all hospital admissions, 88 percent of all prescriptions \n     filled, and 72 percent of physician visits.\n       (4) Studies show that hospital utilization and emergency \n     room visits for patients with multiple chronic conditions can \n     be reduced and significant savings can be achieved through \n     the use of interdisciplinary teams of health care \n     professionals caring for patients in their places of \n     residence.\n       (5) The Independence at Home Act creates a chronic care \n     coordination pilot project to bring primary care medical \n     services to the highest cost Medicare beneficiaries with \n     multiple chronic conditions in their home or place of \n     residence so that they may be as independent as possible for \n     as long as possible in a comfortable setting.\n       (6) The Independence at Home Act generates savings by \n     providing better, more coordinated care across all treatment \n     settings to the highest cost Medicare beneficiaries with \n     multiple chronic conditions, reducing duplicative and \n     unnecessary services, and avoiding unnecessary \n     hospitalizations, nursing home admissions, and emergency room \n     visits.\n       (7) The Independence at Home Act holds providers \n     accountable for improving beneficiary outcomes, ensuring \n     patient and caregiver satisfaction, and achieving cost \n     savings to Medicare on an annual basis.\n       (8) The Independence at Home Act creates incentives for \n     practitioners and providers to develop methods and \n     technologies for providing better and lower cost health care \n     to the highest cost Medicare beneficiaries with the greatest \n     incentives provided in the case of highest cost \n     beneficiaries.\n       (9) The Independence at Home Act contains the central \n     elements of proven home-based primary care delivery models \n     that have been utilized for years by the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs and ``house calls'' programs across the \n     country to deliver coordinated care for chronic conditions in \n     the comfort of a patient's home or place of residence.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to improve the \nprovisions relating to the carrying of concealed weapons by law \nenforcement officers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, in 2003, Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell \nand I, along with 68 other Senators, introduced a bill to allow \nqualified retired or current law enforcement officers to carry a \nconcealed firearm across State lines. The Senate passed our bill by \nunanimous consent, and it was signed into law in July 2004. Passage of \nthe Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act indicated strong confidence in \nthe men and women who serve to protect their communities and their \nNation as the first line of defense in any emergency.\n\n[[Page S5835]]\n\n  Introduction of this legislation to benefit active and retired law \nenforcement officers across the country is especially timely as the \nCongress and the country have just recognized National Peace Officers \nMemorial Day. I am proud to introduce this legislation today and thank \nSenator Kyl for joining me as a cosponsor.\n  This year, the Senate Judiciary Committee has turned its attention to \nState and local law enforcement. It has held hearings about the \nimportance of Federal funding at the local level, and how strong \ncommunity policing and positive community relationships are fundamental \nto a prosperous economy. I agree, and appreciated having the \nperspective at recent Judiciary Committee hearings of the State and \nlocal officials like Chief Michael Schirling and Lieutenant Kris \nCarlson from the Burlington, Vermont, Police Department. I hope the \nSenate will continue its strong support of our law enforcement officers \nwith support for this legislation.\n  In 2007, the Senate Judiciary Committee twice reported the \nlegislation I introduce today--once as a stand-alone bill and again as \npart of the School Safety and Law Enforcement Improvements Act. I hope \nthe Senate will act in the interest of so many law enforcement officers \nacross the United States by improving and building upon the current \nlaw.\n  Since enactment of the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, I have \nheard feedback from many in law enforcement that qualified retired \nofficers have been subject to varying certification procedures from \nState to State. In many cases, differing interpretations have \ncomplicated the implementation of the law, and retired officers have \nexperienced significant frustration in getting certified to lawfully \ncarry a firearm under the law.\n  With the input of the law enforcement community, this bill proposes \nmodest amendments to the current law, and will give retired officers \nmore flexibility in obtaining certification. It also provides room for \nthe variability in certification standards among the several States. \nFor example, where a State has not set active duty standards, the \nretired officer can be certified pursuant to the standards set by a law \nenforcement agency in the State.\n  In addition to these changes, the bill makes clear that Amtrak \nofficers, along with law enforcement officers of the Executive branch \nof the Federal Government, are covered by the law. The bill also \nreduces the years of service required for a retired officer to qualify \nunder the law from 15 to 10. The bill now contains clearer standards to \naddress mental health issues related to eligibility for officers who \nseparate from service or retire. These are positive changes to the \ncurrent law, and the requirements for eligibility would continue to \nrequire a significant term of service for a retired officer to qualify, \na demonstrated commitment to law enforcement, and retirement in good \nstanding.\n  The dedicated public servants who are trained to uphold the law and \nkeep the peace deserve our support not just in their professional \nlives, but also when they are off-duty or retire. As a former \nprosecutor, I have great confidence in those who serve in law \nenforcement and their ability to exercise their privileges under this \nlegislation safely and responsibly. The responsibilities they shoulder \nday to day on the job deserve our recognition and respect.\n  I hope all Senators will join us in support of this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1132\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the establishment of shared decision making standards and \nrequirements and to establish a pilot program for the implementation of \nshared decision making under the Medicare program; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined by my colleague, \nthe distinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Judd Gregg, to introduce \nan important bill that will put patients in the driver's seat of their \nmedical care. Today, my fellow Oregonian Representative Earl Blumenauer \nis introducing the same bill in the House of Representatives.\n  On the Senate floor and in the Finance Committee and Health Education \nLabor and Pensions Committee, senators have been wrestling with health \nreform. The challenge before the Congress is to both expand quality, \naffordable coverage to all Americans while containing costs.\n  Cost containment requires a lot of tough choices because it will \nrequire changing how care is delivered. The time of paying for volume \nand low quality is past. Chairman Baucus rightly recognized the \nchallenges in cost containment and took up this issue as the first area \nhe wanted to address in the series of public roundtables held in the \nFinance Committee.\n  I believe the key to transforming the health care system and cost \ncontainment is to give patients more choices. Patients should have more \nchoices of health insurance plans. Patients should have a choice of \ndoctor. Patients should also have choices in their medical care.\n  The research by Dr. Jim Weinstein and Dr. John Wennberg with the \nDartmouth Atlas Project has documented regional variations in medical \ncare. They have found both underuse, or the failure to deliver needed \nevidence-based care, and overuse, or the delivery of unnecessary \nsupply-sensitive care. Regional variations are driven by local medical \nopinion, rather than sound science or the preferences of well-informed \npatients. Just because doctors are licensed to have a hammer, doesn't \nmake every patient a nail.\n  Using their research, Office of Management and Budget Director Peter \nOrszag and other experts have estimated that as much as 30 percent of \nmedical spending today goes to care that is unnecessary. That is 30 \npercent of $2.5 trillion is $750 billion going to care that does not \nmake patients healthier and may even harm them.\n  The current standard of medical care in the U.S. fails to adequately \nensure that patients are informed about all their treatment options and \nthe risks and benefits of those options. This leads to patients getting \nmedical treatments they may not have wanted had they been fully \ninformed of their treatment options and integrated into the decision \nmaking process. In order to deliver the right care at the right time, \ninformed patient choice should be the goal of medical care.\n  Shared decision making is a collaborative process between the doctor \nand patient when they discuss the trade-offs among treatment options \nand discuss the patient's preferences and values. Shared decision \nmaking uses patient decision aids, an educational tool like a video or \npamphlet that helps patients understand, communicate their beliefs and \npreferences related to their treatment options, and decide what medical \ntreatments are best for them with their provider based on their medical \ntreatment options, scientific evidence, circumstances, beliefs and \npreferences.\n  Informed patients choice depends on clinical comparative \neffectiveness research that compares the effectiveness of health care \ntreatments. Shared decision making and patient decision aids use \nclinical comparative effectiveness research so that doctors and \npatients together make the right medical treatment choice for each \nindividual patient.\n  This bill creates a three stage phase in of patient decision aids and \nshared decision making into the Medicare program. Phase I of the pilot \nis a 3-year period allowing `early adopting' providers--those who \nalready have experience using patient decision aids and incorporating \nthem into their clinical practices--to participate in the pilot \nproviding data for the Secretary and also serve as Shared Decision \nMaking Resource Centers. During this period, an independent entity will \ndevelop consensus based standards for patient decision aids and a \ncertification process to ensure decision aids are effective and provide \nunbiased information. An expert panel then recommends to the Secretary \nwhich patient decision aids may be used in this program.\n  Phase II is a 3-year period during which providers will be eligible \nto receive reimbursement for the use of certified patient decision \naids. New providers may be added on an annual basis allowing for the \ngradual and voluntary expansion of shared decision making and patient \ndecision aids to a large portion of the country.\n  The final stage requires all Medicare providers to ensure that \nMedicare beneficiaries receive shared decision making and patient \ndecision aids prior to receiving treatment for a preference sensitive \ncondition. If a provider does not ensure that a patient receives a \npatient decision aid then the provider's reimbursement may be reduced \nby no more than 20 percent.\n  This legislation is built on a shared savings model distributing 50 \npercent of the savings to participating providers based on their \nparticipation and performance on quality measures. Twenty-five percent \nof the savings are used to expand provider participation providing \nfinancial support to the Shared Decision Making Centers and providers. \nThe final 25 percent savings are returned to the Medicare program. As \nshared decision making becomes the standard of practice, the shared \nsavings percentages phases out.\n  I believe that this simple approach to informed patient choice is \ncritically important to giving patients real choices by engaging them \nin their health care. As we look to expand access to health coverage, \nthis bill provides a bipartisan, sensible path to putting patients in \nthe driver's seat.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this bill, and I look \nforward to working with Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley and \nother members of the Finance Committee to secure passage of this \nimportant bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1133\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Empowering Medicare Patient \n     Choices Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Dartmouth Atlas Project's work documenting regional \n     variations in medical care has found both underuse, or the \n     failure to deliver needed evidence-based care, and overuse, \n     or the delivery of unnecessary supply-sensitive care.\n       (2) The Dartmouth Atlas Project has also found that many \n     clinical decisions physicians make for elective medical \n     treatments are driven by local medical opinion, rather than \n     sound science or the preferences of well-informed patients. \n     For example, the Dartmouth Atlas Project found that, among \n     the 306 Hospital Referral Regions in the United States during \n     the period of 2002 through 2003, the incidence of surgery for \n     back pain-related conditions and joint replacement for \n     chronic arthritis of the hip and knee varied 5.9-, 5.6-, and \n     4.8-fold, respectively, from the lowest to the highest \n     region.\n       (3) Discretionary surgery for the following common \n     conditions accounts for 40 percent of Medicare spending for \n     inpatient surgery: early stage cancer of the prostate; early \n     stage cancer of the breast; osteoarthritis of the knee; \n     osteoarthritis of the hip; osteoarthritis of the spine; chest \n     pain due to coronary artery disease; stroke threat from \n     carotid artery disease, ischemia due to peripheral artery \n     disease; gall stones; and enlarged prostate.\n       (4) Decisions that involve values trade-offs between the \n     benefits and harms of 2 or more clinically appropriate \n     alternatives should depend on the individual patient's \n     informed choice. In everyday practice, however, patients \n     typically delegate decision making to their physicians who \n     may not have good information on the patient's true \n     preferences.\n       (5) The current standard of medical care in the United \n     States fails to adequately ensure that patients are informed \n     about their treatment options and the risks and benefits of \n     those options. This leads to patients getting medical \n     treatments they may not have wanted had they been fully \n     informed of their treatment options and integrated into the \n     decision making process.\n       (6) Patient decision aids are tools designed to help people \n     participate in decision making\n\n[[Page S5837]]\n\n     about health care options. Patient decision aids provide \n     information on treatment options and help patients clarify \n     and communicate the personal value they associate with \n     different features of treatment options. Patient decision \n     aids do not advise people to choose one treatment option over \n     another, nor are they meant to replace practitioner \n     consultation. Instead, they prepare patients to make \n     informed, value-based decisions with their physician.\n       (7) The Lewin Group estimated that the change in spending \n     resulting from the use of patient decision aids for each of \n     11 conditions using per-procedure costs estimated for the \n     Medicare population studied, assuming full implementation of \n     such patient decision aids in 2010, would save as much as \n     $4,000,000,000.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to ensure the energy independence and economic \nviability of the Untied States by promoting the responsible use of coal \nthrough accelerated carbon capture and storage and through advanced \nclean coal technology research, development, demonstration, and \ndeployment programs, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Responsible \nUse of Coal Act of 2009. This bill provides the Department of Energy \nwith the funding needed to continue to accelerate both the research and \ndevelopment and the demonstration, and ultimately, the deployment of \ncarbon capture and storage, CCS, technology. Further, this bill would \nposition the U.S. as the world leader in CCS technology development and \nexport, creating the potential for thousands of new clean energy jobs.\n  Climate change is one of the most complex and challenging imperatives \nthat our Nation, and, the world, has ever faced. We need to move \nforward in crafting a national program that will reduce our greenhouse \ngas emissions, encourage the use of renewable power, and create clean \nenergy jobs. As we move forward, we must do so in a manner that will \nensure our energy security, protect our industries from ``carbon \nleakage,'' help get our economy back on track, and enable us to \ncontinue to benefit from our most abundant, affordable energy \nresource--coal.\n  Today coal provides over half of the Nation's electricity. While coal \nuse for energy generation has more than tripled since 1970, emissions \nof sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter from power \nplants have been dramatically reduced as the power industry deploys \ntechnologies for capturing these pollutants. Now, responding to health \nconcerns about mercury, power plants are implementing technology to \ncapture this toxic element. This illustrates how the development and \ndeployment of advanced technology has allowed coal to continue to play \nsuch an important role in our energy strategy in the face of strict \nenvironmental requirements.\n  Coal helps keep American homes, businesses, factories, airports, \nschools and hospitals humming. Coal creates millions of good-paying \njobs across all sectors of the economy--from direct and indirect mining \nand electric utility jobs to all those businesses and industries, large \nand small, which depend on affordable electricity to compete in the \nglobal marketplace. Coal-based electricity keeps people warm on \nfreezing nights and comfortable during the hottest of summer days. Coal \nprovides the reliable, secure electricity needed for the myriad of \nmedical procedures to detect and treat cancer, heart disease and other \nhealth threats, saving innumerous lives every year. Electricity from \ncoal is there when you need it.\n  Much of the world depends on coal, and developing economies like \nChina and India are increasingly relying on coal to power them into the \n21st Century. Coal supplies more than 40 percent of worldwide \nelectricity demand. For China, the amount of electricity from coal is \nastonishing. Eighty percent of China's electricity comes from coal. \nPrior to the current global recession, China built one to two new coal \nplants every week.\n  But the continued use of coal in the U.S. and abroad has a \nsignificant challenge ahead of it--climate change. While we have made \nprogress in the U.S. in dealing with climate change, we are still at \nthe beginning of the process of piecing together a domestic program \nthat will work for all of the different regions of this country and \nthat will reduce our greenhouse gas emissions so that we meet our \nglobal commitment.\n  One of the key pieces that must be included in our domestic program \nto help meet the challenge of climate change is carbon capture and \nstorage. I am sponsoring the Responsible Use of Coal Act of 2009 to \nsupplement funding under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act by \nfurther accelerating the Department of Energy's CCS research, \ndevelopment, demonstration, and deployment programs. Specifically the \nbill will promote the rapid commercial demonstration and early \ndeployment of carbon capture and storage systems that will allow the \nNation to continue to use its abundant, secure, and low-cost coal \nresources while moving forward with a national program to reduce the \nimpact of man-made emissions on our environment.\n  The bill will promote the continued research and development of \nadvanced CCS and other coal power generation technologies in order to \ndrive down costs, increase performance, and foster innovation. It is \ncrucial that, in parallel to the commercial demonstration of current \nCCS technology, we continue to develop and advance new CCS ideas and \nconcepts through a robust research and development program in order to \ncontinue to lower the cost of complying with CO2 \nregulations.\n  The bill will promote the export of U.S. CCS technologies to those \ncountries, such as China and India, which also rely on coal as their \ndominant energy source--ensuring that the U.S. is the leader in \ndeveloping and exporting clean coal technologies and taking advantage \nof the thousands of new clean energy jobs such an industry would \ncreate.\n  I am fully committed to work with my colleagues in the Senate in \naddressing climate change. At the same time, I believe that the Nation \nneeds to recognize the critical role coal plays in driving our economic \nengine and to aggressively move forward in the research, development, \ndemonstration, and deployment of CCS technology.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in ensuring that the United \nStates continues to enjoy the economic and energy security advantages \nthat our domestic coal resources afford us while we move forward in \ncrafting legislation\n\n[[Page S5841]]\n\nthat will reduce our emissions of greenhouse gases.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1134\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

REALLOCATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       From the amounts appropriated under the American Recovery \n     and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Public Law 111-5), the Director \n     of the Office of Management and Budget may allocate such sums \n     as the Director determines to be necessary to carry out the \n     Drive America Forward Program established under this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. \n        Sanders, and Mr. Dodd):\n  S. 1137. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to establish a Volunteer Teacher Advisory Committee; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am today introducing the Teachers at \nthe Table Act of 2009. This bill is the Senate companion to legislation \nintroduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Carolyn \nMcCarthy of New York and Representative Lee Terry of Nebraska and would \ncreate a Volunteer Teacher Advisory Committee to advise Congress and \nthe Department of Education on the impact of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, ESEA, also known as No Child Left Behind, \nNCLB, on students, their families, and the classroom learning \nenvironment. The teachers serving on this committee would be chosen \nfrom past or present State or national Teachers of the Year and would \nbe competitively selected by the Secretary of Education and the \nmajority and minority leaders of both the Senate and the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Every year I travel to each of Wisconsin's 72 counties to hold a \nlistening session to listen to Wisconsinites' concerns and answer their \nquestions. Since NCLB was enacted in early 2002, education has rated as \none of the top issues brought up at these listening sessions. I have \nreceived feedback from constituents about the noble intentions of NCLB, \nbut I have also heard about the multitude of implementation problems \nwith the law's provisions. The feedback from teachers, parents, school \nadministrators, and school board members has been invaluable over the \npast 7 years and has guided many of my education policymaking \ndecisions.\n  As Congress seeks to undertake the reauthorization of ESEA this year, \nit is my hope that this legislation can be part of the reauthorization. \nFeedback\n\n[[Page S5844]]\n\nfrom good teachers is absolutely vital to understanding how federal \neducation policy is impacting classroom instruction around the country. \nThis legislation seeks to help ensure that continuous feedback is \nprovided to Congress about how the reauthorized ESEA is impacting \nstudent achievement and closing the persistent achievement gap that \nexists in our Nation.\n  The Teachers at the Table bill I am introducing today seeks to help \nensure that Congress and the Department of Education receive high-\nquality yearly feedback on how ESEA/NCLB is impacting classroom \nlearning around the country. The teachers who will serve on this \ncommittee represent some of the best that teaching has to offer. The \nbill would create a committee of 20 teachers, with 4 selected by the \nSecretary of Education and 4 selected by each of the majority and \nminority leaders in the Senate and House of Representatives. These \nteachers would serve 2-year terms on the advisory committee and would \nwork to prepare annual reports to Congress as well as quarterly updates \non the law's implementation.\n  Every State and every school district is different and this \nlegislation ensures that the teacher advisory committee will represent \na wide range of viewpoints. The bill specifies that the volunteer \nteacher advisory committee should include teachers from diverse \ngeographic areas, teachers who teach different grade levels, and \nteachers from a variety of specialty areas. Creating a diverse \ncommittee will help ensure that the committee presents a broad range of \nviewpoints on ESEA/NCLB to Congress and the Department of Education.\n  Much work needs to be done this year to reform many of the mandates \nof ESEA/NCLB and I look forward to working with my colleagues during \nthe reauthorization to make those necessary changes. One thing is \ncertain whatever form the reauthorized ESEA takes, there will be a need \nfor consistent feedback from a diverse range of viewpoints.\n  We need to ensure that the voices of students, educators, parents, \nand administrators, who are on the frontlines of education reform in \nour country, are heard during the reauthorization of ESEA and going \nforward during the reauthorized law's implementation in years to come. \nThis bill seeks to help address that need by enlisting the service of \nsome of America's best teachers in providing information to Federal \neducation policymakers. The advisory committee created by this \nlegislation will provide nationwide feedback and will allow Congress to \nhear about ESEA/NCLB directly from those who deal with the law and its \nconsequences on a daily basis.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. FEINSTEIN (for herself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1138. A bill to amend the Reclamation Wastewater and Groundwater \nStudy and Facilities Act to expand the Bay Area Regional Recycling \nProgram, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of myself and Senator \nBoxer to introduce the Bay Area Regional Water Recycling Program \nExpansion Act of 2009, which will reduce demand for limited fresh water \nsupplies by providing recycled water to 6 communities across the Bay \nArea.\n  It will make 6 additional Bay Area recycled water projects eligible \nfor a 25 percent Federal cost-share, and expand the authorizations for \ntwo more, totaling $38,075,000. The activities authorized by the new \nlegislation include installing new piping, storage tanks, and pump \nstations to convey the recycled water to a number of cities across the \nBay Area.\n  These projects collectively will save 2.6 billion gallons per year of \nregional water supply by providing a new water supply of clean treated \nwastewater for irrigation and industrial use. It will free up the \namount needed to supply 24,225 households in the growing Bay Area \nregion. And to the regional agencies, over 3,500 local green jobs will \nbe supported by this legislation.\n  The adoption of water recycling technology is an invaluable \nconservation method which will result in 8,000 acre-feet of new and \nreliable water which will reduce demand on fresh water from the Delta.\n  California is facing phenomenal water supply challenges that are \naffecting our economy, our communities and our environment.\n  California's water infrastructure is woefully out of date. Drought, \npopulation growth, climate variability, ecosystem needs and a broken \nDelta are making it even more difficult to manage our water system and \ndeliver reliable supplies.\n  And unless we take action to address climate change, we could lose a \nsignificant portion of the Sierra snowpack, which stores water for 2/3 \nof California, by 2100.\n  Increasing the capability for and use of recycled water will help \naddress California's cycles of drought and reduce dependence on water \nfrom the troubled Bay-Delta ecosystem.\n  Water recycling projects are already under way in several local Bay \nArea communities, and have qualified for Federal funding under the Bay \nArea Regional Water Recycling Program. This program allows local water \nmanagers to treat wastewater and use the clean, recycled water for \nlandscape irrigation and other uses, including at golf courses, \nschools, city parks and other municipal facilities. Under the new \nlegislation, the six additional Bay Area communities would be allowed \nto work with the Federal Bureau of Reclamation to use water supplies \nmore efficiently.\n  With the increasing strain on Bay-Delta and other natural resources, \nit is vital that we look to adopt innovative water recycling \ntechnologies which sustain permanent clean water supplies and support \nexisting water resources and local economies.\n  Nine Bay Area congressional representatives in the House put this \nregional approach together, and I'd like to recognize and thank them \nfor their leadership: George Miller, D-Martinez, Pete Stark, D-Fremont, \nEllen Tauscher, D-Concord, Anna Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, Mike Honda, D-San \nJose, Lynn Woolsey, D-Petaluma, Jerry McNerney, D-Pleasanton, Zoe \nLofgren, D-San Jose and Jackie Speier, D-San Mateo, worked together to \naddress the Bay Area's water needs.\n  This bill reflects a federal-local partnership and will provide \ncommunities in the San Francisco Bay Area with reliable and sustainable \nwater supplies, and be a benchmark for other major American cities.\n  Declining water supplies affects people from all across the United \nStates. Now is the time to invest in new water technologies, such as \nwater recycling, to meet increasing needs. Wastewater recycling is an \nimportant part of a multifaceted water supply strategy that also \nincludes surface and groundwater storage, improved conveyance, \nconservation, and desalination.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1138\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Agriculture to enter into \na property conveyance with the city of Wallowa, Oregon, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce two bills \nthat will provide two important communities in rural Oregon with the \nmeans to promote their cultural history and their economic development \nopportunities, S. 1139 and S. 1140.\n  Like anywhere in America, the leaders in rural communities in my \nstate are working every day to build the best place they can. And in \nmany rural communities in my state, that means not much happens without \nthe Federal Government involved. Like many places in the Western United \nStates, the Federal Government owns much of the land surrounding these \nsmall communities. To be sure, many of these lands are treasures; they \nare the source of a vibrant tourism economy; an attraction for \nindividuals and businesses to move to the region; and the daily outlet \nfor the people lucky enough to live there.\n  By the same token, this high percentage of Federal land ownership \nsometimes limits the ability of local governments and civic leaders to \nsolve problems and serve the public. The Federal Government can and \nshould be an active partner in advancing communities and improving a \nregion's quality of life.\n  So today I am introducing legislation that demonstrates the \npossibilities that can come from a quality Federal Government \npartnership with a proactive, innovative community that faces \nchallenging economic conditions and a dominant pattern of Federal land \nownership.\n  My first bill, the La Pine Land Conveyance Act, would convey two \nparcels of property to Deschutes County, Oregon. The bill directs the \ntransfer of Bureau of Land Management BLM, lands to Deschutes County, \nthat will enable the small town of La Pine to develop rodeo and \nequestrian facilities, public parks, and other recreation facilities.\n  La Pine has a set of unique challenges well known to the people of \nDeschutes County. The town recently incorporated, and with \nincorporation has come a feeling in the community that good things can \nhappen if they work together to make their town as good as it can \npossibly be.\n  My bill proposes the transfer of 320 acres of BLM land contiguous to \nthe La Pine city limit, on its western boundary. Ownership of this \nlocation will enable construction of public equestrian and rodeo \nfacilities that have become increasingly important in La Pine. The \nproperty is within reasonable walking distance of downtown, creating an \nideal parade route for the annual 4th of July Frontier Days parade. In \naddition, the land will provide a location for development of ball \nfields, parks, and recreation facilities, which can be developed as the \ntown grows and budgets allow.\n  The La Pine Rodeo and Frontier Days events are currently facing the \nlast year they can hold their events on the currently utilized location \nbecause that private property is being developed for other uses. So \nlooking towards the Federal Government, who controls the vast majority \nof land in the La Pine area, to find a solution provides the right kind \nof partnership between the federal and local government.\n  My bill also directs the transfer of approximately 750 acres of BLM \nlands to Deschutes County for the purpose of expanding the town's \nwastewater treatment operation.\n  More than two years ago my office participated in discussions between \nthe La Pine community leaders and the BLM concerning the La Pine \ncommunity's need for land to serve public purposes. Due to staffing \nlimitations, BLM asked the City to choose one top priority for a land \ntransfer under the Recreation and Public Purposes Act. The La Pine City \nCouncil responded immediately that its top priority was\n\n[[Page S5846]]\n\nthe acquisition of land to enable expansion of their sewer district.\n  To date, the land has not been transferred, which make this small \ncommunity unable to be competitive for state and federal economic \nstimulus funds.\n  This project is too important to let languish. Perhaps the most \nimportant issue affecting water quality in Deschutes County involves \nthe threat to groundwater and the Deschutes River from household septic \nsystems in southern Deschutes County, the region around La Pine. This \nproject directly reduces nitrate loading into south county groundwater \nin two ways. First, by enabling expansion of the District service \nboundary to residential areas where septic systems are generating \nelevated groundwater nitrate levels; and second, by closing the current \nlocation for spreading treated effluent, over a relatively high \ngroundwater area, to this new location which is judged not to threaten \ngroundwater. That is why I am introducing legislation today to make \nsure this transfer moves forward.\n  My second bill, the Wallowa Forest Service Compound Conveyance Act \nwould convey an old Forest Service Ranger Station compound to the City \nof Wallowa, Oregon. In Wallowa County, this Forest Service compound was \nbuilt by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the 1930's. For many years \nit was the center of town and this site continues to represent the \nnatural and cultural history of one of eastern Oregon's most beautiful \ncommunities. The City of Wallowa, along with County Commissioners, the \nlocal arts organizations, and a broad group of community leaders intend \nto restore this important example of Pacific Northwest rustic \narchitecture and tribute to bygone times, making a valuable community \ninterpretive center at this site. The conveyance of this property will \nallow the community to move forward with this project. The community is \ncurrently working to list the Ranger Station on the National Register \nof Historic Places, and ownership by the City will allow this coalition \nto restore the buildings and again develop a vibrant community center. \nOregon Public Broadcasting aired a segment depicting an early 20th \ncentury railroad logging community--a significant part of the rich and \ndiverse history and traditions that will be preserved and celebrated as \nthis Forest Service Compound is developed as an interpretive center.\n  I want to express my thanks to all the citizens and community leaders \nthat have worked to build their communities and develop these projects. \nThey represent the pioneering spirit and vision that defines my State.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1139\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to extend certain trade preferences to certain least-\ndeveloped countries, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Bond to \nintroduce the Tariff Relief Assistance for Developing Economies Act of \n2009 to help some of the world's poorest countries sustain vital export \nindustries and promote economic growth and political stability.\n  I worked with former senator Gordon Smith on this bill in the past \nand I am proud to move it forward in the 111th Congress.\n\n[[Page S5847]]\n\n  This legislation will provide duty free and quota free benefits for \ngarments and other products similar to those afforded to beneficiary \ncountries under the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, AGOA.\n  The countries covered by this legislation are the 14 Least Developed \nCountries, LDCs, as defined by the United Nations and the U.S. State \nDepartment, which are not covered by any current U.S. trade preference \nprogram: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Cambodia, Kiribati, Laos, \nMaldives, Nepal, Samoa, Solomon Islands, East Timor, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, \nand Yemen.\n  The bill also includes Sri Lanka as an eligible country.\n  To be eligible for the benefits provided under our bill, a country \nmust demonstrate that it is making continual progress toward \nestablishing rule of law, political pluralism, the right to due \nprocess, and a market-based economy that protects private property \nrights. Our legislation would help promote democracy while sustaining \nvital export industries and creating employment opportunities.\n  The beneficiary countries of this legislation are among the poorest \ncountries in the world.\n  Nepal has per capita income of $240. Unemployment in Bangladesh \nstands at 40 percent. Approximately 36 percent of Cambodia's population \nlives below the poverty line.\n  Each country faces critical challenges in the years ahead including \npoor health care, insufficient educational opportunities, high HIV/AIDS \nrates, and the effects of war and civil strife.\n  The U.S. must take a leadership role in providing much needed \nassistance to the people of these countries.\n  Yet humanitarian and development assistance should not be the sum \ntotal of our efforts to put these countries on the road to economic \nprosperity and political stability.\n  Indeed, the key for sustained growth and rising standards of living \nwill be the ability of each of these countries to create vital export \nindustries to compete in a free and open global marketplace.\n  We should help these countries help themselves by opening the U.S. \nmarket to their exports.\n  Success in that endeavor will ultimately allow these countries to \nbecome less dependent on foreign aid and allow the U.S. to provide \nassistance to countries in greater need.\n  The garment industry is a key part of the manufacturing sector in \nsome of these countries.\n  In Nepal, the garment industry is entirely export oriented and \naccounts for 40 percent of foreign exchange earnings. It employs over \n100,000 workers--half of them women--and sustains the livelihood of \nover 350,000 people.\n  The United States is the largest market for Nepalese garments and \naccounts for 80-90 percent of Nepal's total exports every year.\n  In Cambodia, approximately 250,000 Cambodians work in the garment \nindustry supporting approximately one million dependents. The garment \nindustry accounts for more than 90 percent of Cambodia's export \nearnings.\n  In Bangladesh, the garment industry accounts for 75 percent of export \nearnings. The industry employs 1.8 million people, 90 percent of whom \nare women, and sustains the livelihoods of 10 to 15 million people.\n  Despite the poverty seen in these countries and the importance of the \ngarment industry and the U.S. market, they face some of the highest \nU.S. tariffs in the world, averaging over 15 percent. In contrast, \ncountries like Japan and our European partners face tariffs that are \nnearly zero.\n  Surely we can do better. This legislation will help these countries \ncompete in the U.S. market and let their citizens know that Americans \nare committed to helping them realize a better future for themselves \nand their families.\n  Doing so is consistent with U.S. goals to combat poverty, \ninstability, and terrorism in a critical part of the world. We should \nnot forget that of the approximately 265 million people that live in \nthe TRADE Act countries, almost 200 million are Muslim.\n  The impact on U.S. jobs will be minimal. Currently, the beneficiary \ncountries under this legislation account for only 4 percent of U.S. \ntextile and apparel imports, compared to 24 percent for China, and 72 \npercent for the rest of the world.\n  These countries will continue to be small players in the U.S. market, \nbut the benefits of this legislation will have a major impact on their \nexport economies.\n  At a time when we are trying to rebuild the image of the U.S. around \nthe world, we need legislation such as this to show the best of America \nand American values. It will provide a vital component to our \ndevelopment strategy and add another tool to the war on terror. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1141\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Tariff Relief Assistance for \n     Developing Economies Act of 2009'' or the ``TRADE Act of \n     2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is in the mutual interest of the United States and \n     least-developed countries to promote stable and sustainable \n     economic growth and development.\n       (2) Trade and investment are powerful economic tools and \n     can be used to reduce poverty and raise the standard of \n     living in a country.\n       (3) A country that is open to trade may increase its \n     economic growth.\n       (4) Trade and investment often lead to employment \n     opportunities and often help alleviate poverty.\n       (5) Least-developed countries have a particular challenge \n     in meeting the economic requirements and competitiveness of \n     globalization and international markets.\n       (6) The United States has recognized the benefits that \n     international trade provides to least-developed countries by \n     enacting the Generalized System of Preferences and trade \n     benefits for developing countries in the Caribbean, Andean, \n     and sub-Saharan African regions of the world.\n       (7) Enhanced trade with least-developed Muslim countries, \n     including Yemen, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh, is consistent \n     with other United States objectives of encouraging a strong \n     private sector and individual economic empowerment in those \n     countries.\n       (8) Offering least-developed countries enhanced trade \n     preferences will encourage both higher levels of trade and \n     direct investment in support of positive economic and \n     political developments throughout the world.\n       (9) Encouraging the reciprocal reduction of trade and \n     investment barriers will enhance the benefits of trade and \n     investment as well as enhance commercial and political ties \n     between the United States and the countries designated for \n     benefits under this Act.\n       (10) Economic opportunity and engagement in the global \n     trading system together with support for democratic \n     institutions and a respect for human rights are mutually \n     reinforcing objectives and key elements of a policy to \n     confront and defeat global terrorism.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act \nwith respect to inclusion of effectiveness information in drug and \ndevice labeling and advertising; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Informed Health Care \nDecision Making Act of 2009. I am introducing this legislation along \nwith my colleague Senator Mikulski because every American deserves to \nhave the full information regarding drugs and devices prescribed by \ntheir provider.\n  Even though the amount of money spent to reach the public about drugs \nand devices is greater than five billion dollars annually, the most \nfundamental information--information about how well the drug or device \nactually works--is generally absent. In 2007, the Institute of Medicine \nconducted a workshop regarding the public's understanding of drugs and \nconfirmed the importance for patients and physicians of having \nstandardized and quantitative information about the product before \nmaking health care decisions.\n  Researchers at Dartmouth University have documented that replacing \nthe current narrative information contained in drug advertisements with \nsimplified, factual information, will enable patients to play an active \nrole in health care decision making. In fact, similar to the nutrition \nfacts boxes that are required on our Nation's packaged food supply, \nthis research demonstrated that a drug facts box will actually help \nphysicians make better health care choices.\n  If the research is not enough proof that this type of streamlined \ninformation will be beneficial, the Food and\n\n[[Page S5849]]\n\nDrug Administration's, FDA, Risk Communications Advisory Committee, a \ncommittee specifically designed to counsel the agency on how to \nstrengthen the communication of risks and benefits of FDA-regulated \nproducts to the public, unanimously recommended that the FDA adopt \nstandardized, quantitative summaries of risks and benefits in a drug \nfacts box format.\n  As such, the Informed Health Care Decision Making Act of 2009 would \nrequire the FDA to determine if the information provided in a drug \nfacts box, or a similar format, would improve health care decision \nmaking by clinicians and patients, and report to Congress on that \ndetermination. If the report determines that a specific standardized, \nquantitative format would be beneficial, the FDA must issue regulations \nto implement the format.\n  Regardless of the FDA's determination, it is important for clinicians \nand patients to be able to compare the similarities, differences, \nbenefits, and risks of drugs and devices. As such, the legislation \nwould require the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality to \nestablish a multi-stakeholder process for developing and periodically \nupdating methodological standards and criteria for comparative clinical \neffectiveness research. This would include standards and criteria for \nthe sources of evidence and the adequacy of evidence that are \nappropriate for the inclusion of comparative clinical effectiveness \ninformation in labeling and print advertisements.\n  Upon completion of these standards, the legislation requires drug \nlabels and print advertisements to include information on the clinical \neffectiveness of a product--compared to other products approved for the \nsame health condition for the same patient demographic subpopulation--\nor a disclosure that there is no such information, if another product \nhas not been approved for the same use. The potential of such a \ndisclosure should be a powerful incentive for manufacturers to fund \ncomparative effectiveness research.\n  It is my hope that as we embark upon meaningful health care reform, \nmy colleagues will join me in supporting this bill and other \ninitiatives to improve the health care decision making of both patients \nand clinicians.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1142\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Informed Health Care \n     Decision Making Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) National randomized controlled trials have found that \n     replacing the brief summary of drug advertisements with a \n     drug facts box improved consumer knowledge and judgments. In \n     such trials, consumers who were presented with a drug facts \n     box more accurately perceived the side effects and benefits \n     of a drug, and were more than twice as likely to choose the \n     superior drug.\n       (2)(A) In 2007, the Institute of Medicine conducted a \n     workshop that highlighted that the public has a limited \n     understanding of the benefits and risks of drugs. The \n     workshop also highlighted that it is important to--\n       (i) provide patients and physicians with the best possible \n     information for making informed decisions about the use of \n     pharmaceuticals;\n       (ii) employ quantitative and standardized approaches when \n     trying to evaluate pharmaceutical benefit-risk; and\n       (iii) develop and validate improved tools for communicating \n     pharmaceutical benefit-risk information to patients and \n     physicians.\n       (B) The general agreement of the workshop was that the Food \n     and Drug Administration should pilot test a drug facts box.\n       (3) On February 27, 2009, the Food and Drug \n     Administration's Risk Communication Advisory Committee made \n     the following unanimous recommendations:\n       (A) The Food and Drug Administration should adopt a single \n     standard document for communicating essential information \n     about pharmaceuticals.\n       (B) That standard document should include quantitative \n     summaries of risks and benefits, along with use and \n     precaution information.\n       (C) The Food and Drug Administration should adopt the drug \n     facts box format as its standard.\n\n     SEC. 3. PRESENTATION OF DRUG BENEFIT AND RISK INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     (referred to in this Act as the ``Secretary''), acting \n     through the Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall determine \n     whether standardized, quantitative summaries of the benefits \n     and risks of drugs in a tabular or drug facts box format, or \n     any alternative format, in the labeling and print advertising \n     of such drugs would improve health care decision making by \n     clinicians and patients and consumers.\n       (b) Review and Consultation.--In making the determination \n     under subsection (a), the Secretary shall review all \n     available scientific evidence and consult with drug \n     manufacturers, clinicians, patients and consumers, experts in \n     health literacy, and representatives of racial and ethnic \n     minorities.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the \n     Congress a report that provides--\n       (1) the determination by the Secretary under subsection \n     (a); and\n       (2) the reasoning and analysis underlying that \n     determination.\n       (d) Authority.--\n       (1) In general.--If the Secretary determines under \n     subsection (a) that standardized, quantitative summaries of \n     the benefits and risks of drugs in a tabular or drug facts \n     box format, or any alternative format, in the labeling and \n     print advertising of such drugs would improve health care \n     decision making by clinicians and patients and consumers, \n     then the Secretary, not later than 1 year after the date of \n     submission of the report under subsection (c), shall \n     promulgate regulations as necessary to implement such format.\n       (2) Objective and up-to-date information.--In carrying out \n     paragraph (1), the Secretary shall ensure that the \n     information presented in a summary described under such \n     paragraph is objective and up-to-date, and is the result of a \n     review process that considers the totality of published and \n     unpublished data.\n       (3) Posting of information.--In carrying out paragraph (1), \n     the Secretary shall post the information presented in a \n     summary described under such paragraph on the Internet Web \n     site of the Food and Drug Administration.\n\n     SEC. 4. STANDARDS FOR COMPARATIVE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS \n                   INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary, acting through the \n     Commissioner of Food and Drugs, shall establish and \n     periodically update methodological standards and criteria for \n     the sources of evidence and the adequacy and degree of \n     evidence that are appropriate for inclusion of comparative \n     clinical effectiveness information in labeling and \n     advertisements under subsections (f), (n)(3), and (r) of \n     section 502 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as \n     amended by section 5).\n       (b) Requirements.--The standards and criteria established \n     under subsection (a) shall ensure that comparative clinical \n     effectiveness information provides reliable and useful \n     information that improves health care decision making, \n     adheres to rigorous scientific standards, and is produced \n     through a transparent process that includes consultation with \n     stakeholders.\n       (c) Consultation.--In carrying out subsection (a), the \n     Secretary shall consult with manufacturers of drugs and \n     devices, clinicians, patients and consumers, experts in \n     health literacy, and representatives of racial and ethnic \n     minorities.\n       (d) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``comparative clinical effectiveness'' means the clinical \n     outcomes, effectiveness, safety, and clinical appropriateness \n     of a drug or device in comparison to 1 or more drugs or \n     devices, respectively, approved to prevent, diagnose, or \n     treat the same health condition for the same patient \n     demographic subpopulation.\n\n     SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF COMPARATIVE CLINICAL EFFECTIVENESS \n                   INFORMATION.\n\n       (a) Comparative Clinical Effectiveness.--Section 201 of the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(rr) The term `comparative clinical effectiveness' means \n     the clinical outcomes, effectiveness, safety, and clinical \n     appropriateness of a drug or device in comparison to 1 or \n     more drugs or devices, respectively, approved to prevent, \n     diagnose, or treat the same health condition for the same \n     patient demographic subpopulation, on the basis of research \n     that meets standards adopted by the Secretary under section 4 \n     of the Informed Health Care Decision Making Act.''.\n       (b) Labeling and Advertising Information.--Section 502 of \n     the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 352) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (f), by striking ``for use; and (2)'' and \n     inserting ``for use; (2) such information in brief summary \n     relating to comparative clinical effectiveness as shall be \n     required in regulations which shall be issued by the \n     Secretary in accordance with the procedure specified in \n     section 701(a); and (3)'';\n       (2) in subsection (n)(3), by striking ``and effectiveness'' \n     and inserting ``effectiveness, and comparative clinical \n     effectiveness (or a disclosure that there is no such \n     information relating to comparative clinical effectiveness if \n     another drug has been approved for the same use),''; and\n       (3) in subsection (r)--\n       (A) by striking ``In the case of any'' and inserting ``(1) \n     In the case of any'';\n       (B) by striking ``(1) a true'' and inserting ``(A) a \n     true'';\n       (C) by striking ``(2) a brief'' and inserting ``(B) a \n     brief''; and\n\n[[Page S5850]]\n\n       (D) by striking ``and contraindications'' and inserting \n     ``contraindications, and, if appropriate after taking into \n     consideration the type of device, effectiveness and \n     comparative clinical effectiveness (or a disclosure that \n     there is no such information relating to comparative clinical \n     effectiveness if another device has been approved for the \n     same use)''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1143. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish \nvarious programs for the recruitment and retention of public health \nworkers and to eliminate critical public health workforce shortages in \nFederal, State, local, and tribal public health agencies and health \ncenters; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the people who work in public health are \nresponsible for some of the most important jobs that protect the lives \nand health of ordinary Americans. The scope of public health includes \npreventing the spread of communicable diseases and pandemics, managing \nthe health system's response to biological and chemical attacks, \nfighting food-borne illnesses, assisting communities in preparing for \ndisasters, and promoting best health practices.\n  The recent outbreak of Influenza A H1N1 virus reminds us how much we \ndepend on the people who work in public health. This virus has infected \nthousands of people and caused nearly a hundred deaths worldwide. The \nAmerican people have looked to the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention and their State and local health departments to collect \ndata, monitor the threat, provide accurate information, and prepare to \nrespond if the situation worsens. But even when a pandemic or other \nwidespread threat is not imminent, the public health workforce remains \non the front lines in promoting healthy lifestyles and preventing \nchronic disease.\n  Our ability to prevent, respond to, and recover from a pandemic or \nother health challenges depends largely on a strong pipeline of public \nhealth professionals. Unfortunately, a critical--and growing--shortage \nof public health workers is putting our nation at risk.\n  The Association of Schools of Public Health recently reported that \nthere were 50,000 fewer public health workers in 2000 than there were \nin 1980. In my home State of Illinois, the average Illinois Department \nof Public Health worker is 48 years old, and 39 percent of the staff \nwill be eligible to retire within 5 years. Compounding this problem is \nthe fact that 13 percent of agency positions are vacant, and when a new \nhire is found, the average age is 41. The ``graying'' workforce and \nweak pipeline of new public health graduates are problems across all \nlevels of government. Nearly half of the federal employees in \noccupations critical to U.S. biodefense will be eligible to retire by \n2012.\n  We cannot stay on the same trajectory in the future. We are not \neducating enough people in public health to replace retiring public \nhealth workers, and the salaries for those who do work in public health \ndisciplines are not competitive with comparable employment in the \nprivate sector. The Association of State and Territorial Health \nOfficials reports that in 2004, most of the approximately 6,400 \ngraduates from accredited schools of public health took jobs in the \nprivate sector.\n  I am pleased to introduce the Public Health Workforce Development Act \nof 2009 today to help address this challenge. This legislation provides \nseveral common-sense solutions to develop a strong pipeline of public \nhealth professionals. This bill would provide scholarships to students \ngoing into public health and provide loan repayment for current public \nhealth workers in exchange for a commitment to additional years of \nservice in public health.\n  The legislation also encourages states to set up their own public \nhealth training programs and creates a scholarship program for mid-\ncareer professionals to maintain or upgrade their training. Finally, it \ncreates an online clearinghouse of public health jobs available in the \nFederal Government. Together, these programs will help attract young \npeople to a career in public health and give current public health \nprofessionals incentives to remain in the field in the long-term\n  Our health care system today focuses too much on treating sickness, \nat the expense of preserving wellness. As the process of health reform \nmoves forward, two key concerns are improving health care quality, \nwhile holding health care costs down. To do this, we need to focus on \nwellness, preventive care, and effective management of chronic \nconditions, all of which are hallmarks of the public health system. \nThis bill will help maintain a strong and effective public health \nsystem by alleviating the dangerous shortage of public health workers\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1143\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Health Workforce \n     Development Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The ability of the public health system to prevent, \n     respond to, and recover from bioterrorism, acute outbreaks of \n     infectious diseases, or other health threats and emergencies, \n     and to prevent and reduce chronic disease, depends upon the \n     existence of adequate numbers of well-trained public health \n     professionals in Federal, State, local, and tribal public \n     health departments and health centers.\n       (2) The public health system has an aging staff nearing \n     retirement with no clear pipeline of highly-skilled and \n     capable employees to fill the void, with the average age of \n     the State public health workforce at 47 years.\n       (3) Retirement rates in some State public health agencies \n     were as high as 20 percent as of June 2007, and projected to \n     be as high as 45 percent in 2009.\n       (4) The ratio of public health workers to the population \n     has dropped from 219 per 100,000 in 1980 to 158 per 100,000 \n     in 2000, while responsibilities of such workers have \n     continued to expand.\n       (5) Public health nurses comprise the largest segment of \n     the public health workforce. A study by the Institute of \n     Medicine in 2003 identified nursing as facing one of the most \n     severe shortages of public health workers. The average age of \n     public health nurses is nearly 50 years, with the leaders of \n     State public health nursing averaging more than 30 years of \n     service. In one State nearly 40 percent of the public health \n     nursing workforce was eligible for retirement as of June \n     2007.\n       (6) According to the Association of State and Territorial \n     Health Officials, most of the approximately 6,400 graduates \n     from accredited schools of public health took jobs in the \n     private sector in 2004. The Bureau of Labor Statistics \n     projects that there will be an increase in private sector \n     demand for highly-educated graduates in scientific fields \n     during the 10-year period ending in 2017. Public health \n     agencies will have difficulty competing for those highly-\n     skilled scientists.\n       (7) As of June 2007, approximately 42 percent of the \n     epidemiology workforce in State and territorial health \n     departments lacked formal academic training in epidemiology. \n     States have reported that approximately 47 percent more \n     epidemiologists are needed to adequately prevent and control \n     avian influenza and other emerging diseases.\n       (8) The Partnership for Public Service reports that in the \n     field of microbiology, there are more than 4 times as many \n     full-time permanent employees over age 40 as under age 40 at \n     the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Among full-\n     time permanent employees with medical backgrounds at the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and \n     Drug Administration, there are 3 times as many employees over \n     40 years of age as under 40.\n       (9) More than 50 percent of States cite the lack of \n     qualified individuals or individuals willing to relocate as \n     being a major barrier to preparedness. A study conducted by \n     the Health Resources and Services Association reported \n     difficulty with recruiting more educated, skilled public \n     health providers to work in traditionally medically \n     underserved areas, such as rural populations. Public health \n     agencies continue to face an unmet need for public health \n     workers who are bilingual and culturally competent.\n       (10) Lack of access to advanced education, including \n     baccalaureate nursing and graduate studies, is a significant \n     barrier to upgrading the existing public health workforce, \n     particularly in rural areas.\n\n     SEC. 3. PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION \n                   PROGRAMS.\n\n       Part E of title VII of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 294n et seq.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n\n``Subpart 3--Public Health Workforce Recruitment and Retention Programs\n\n     ``SEC. 780.

A bill to prevent tobacco smuggling, to ensure the \ncollection of\n\n[[Page S5853]]\n\nall tobacco taxes, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Leahy to introduce \nthe Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking, PACT, Act of 2009. As the \nproblem of cigarette trafficking continues to worsen, we must provide \nlaw enforcement officials with the tools they need to crack down on \ncigarette trafficking. The PACT Act closes loopholes in current tobacco \ntrafficking laws, enhances penalties for violations, and provides law \nenforcement with new tools to combat the innovative new methods being \nused by cigarette traffickers to distribute their products. Each day we \ndelay passage of this important legislation, terrorists and criminals \nraise more money, States lose significant amounts of tax revenue, and \nkids have easy access to tobacco products over the internet.\n  The cost to Americans is not merely financial. Tobacco smuggling also \nposes a significant threat to innocent people around the world. It has \ndeveloped into a popular, and highly profitable, means of generating \nrevenue for criminal and terrorist organizations. Hezbollah, for \nexample, earned $1.5 million between 1996 and 2000 by engaging in \ntobacco trafficking in the U.S. Al Qaeda and Hamas have also generated \nsignificant revenue from the sale of counterfeit cigarettes. That money \nis often raised right here in the U.S. and it is then funneled back to \nthese international terrorist groups. Cutting off financial support to \nterrorist groups is an integral part of the protecting this country \nagainst future attacks. We can no longer continue to let terrorist \norganizations exploit weaknesses in our tobacco laws to generate \nsignificant amounts of money. The cost of doing nothing is too great.\n  This is not a minor problem. Cigarette smuggling is a multibillion \ndollar a year phenomenon, and it is getting worse. In 1998, the Bureau \nof Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (BATFE) had six active \ntobacco smuggling investigations. In 2005, that number swelled to 452. \nToday there are more than 400 open cases.\n  The number of cases alone, however, does not sufficiently put this \nproblem into perspective. The amount of money involved is truly \nastonishing. Cigarette trafficking, including the illegal sale of \ntobacco products over the internet, costs States billions of dollars in \nlost tax revenue each year. It is estimated that we lose $5 billion in \nstate revenues due to illegal tobacco sales. As lost tobacco tax \nrevenue lines the pockets of criminals and terrorist groups, states are \nbeing forced to college tuition and restrict access to other public \nprograms. Tobacco smuggling may provide some with cheap access to \ncigarettes, but those cheap cigarettes are coming at a significant cost \nto the rest of us.\n  According to the Government Accountability Office, each year, \ncigarette trafficking investigations are growing more and more complex, \nand take longer to resolve. More people are selling cigarettes \nillegally, and they are getting better at it. As these cases get \ntougher to solve, we owe it to law enforcement officials to do our part \nto lend a helping hand. The PACT Act enhances BATFE's authority to \nenter premises to investigate and enforce cigarette trafficking laws, \nand increasing penalties for violations. Unless these existing laws are \nstrengthened, traffickers will continue to operate with near impunity.\n  Just as important, though, we must provide law enforcement with new \nenforcement tools--tools that enable them to combat the cigarette \nsmugglers of the 21st century. The internet represents one of those new \nobstacles to enforcement. Illegal tobacco vendors around the world \nevade detection by conducting transactions over the internet, and then \nemploying the services of common carriers and the U.S. Postal Service \nto deliver their illegal products around the country. Just a few years \nago, there were less than 100 vendors selling cigarettes online. Today, \nwe estimate that approximately 500 vendors sell illegal tobacco \nproducts over the internet.\n  Without new and innovative enforcement methods, law enforcement will \nnot be able to effectively address the growing challenges facing them \ntoday. The PACT Act sets out to do just that by cutting off the \ndelivery. A significant part of this problem involves the shipment of \ncontraband cigarettes through the U.S. Postal Service, USPS. This bill \nwould cut off access to the USPS by making tobacco products non-\nmailable. We would treat cigarettes just like we treat alcohol, making \nit illegal to ship them through the U.S. mails and cutting off a large \nportion of the delivery system.\n  It also employs a novel approach, one being used in some of our \nStates today, to combat illegal sales of tobacco over the internet. \nSpecifically, it will allow the Attorney General, in collaboration with \nState and local law enforcement, to create a list of companies that are \nillegally selling tobacco products. That list will then be distributed \nto legitimate businesses whose services are indispensable to illegal \ninternet vendors--common carriers. Once a common carrier knows which \ncustomers are breaking the law, this bill will ensure that they take \nappropriate action to prevent their companies from being exploited by \nterrorists and other criminals.\n  It is important to point out that this bill has been carefully \nnegotiated with the common carriers, including UPS, to ensure that it \ndoes not place any unreasonable burdens on these businesses. In \nrecognition of UPS and other common carriers' agreements to not deliver \ncigarettes to individual consumers on a nationwide basis, pursuant to \nagreements with the State of New York, we have exempted them from the \nbill provided this agreement remains in effect.\n  In addition to these important law enforcement needs, it is important \nto mention another aspect of this legislation that is equally \nimportant. One of the primary ways children get access to cigarettes \ntoday is on the internet and through the mails. The PACT Act now \ncontains a strong age verification section that will ensure that online \nvendors are not selling cigarettes to our children. This provision \nwould prohibit the sale of tobacco products to children, and it would \nalso require sellers to use a method of shipment that requires a \nsignature and photo ID check upon delivery. Most States already have \nsimilar laws on the books, and this would simply make sure that we have \na national standard to ensure that the internet is not being used to \nevade similar ID checks we require at our grocery and convenience \nstores.\n  The recognition that this is a significant problem, along with the \ncommonsense approach taken in the PACT Act to combat it, has brought \ntogether a coalition of strange bedfellows. The legislation has not \njust garnered the support of the law enforcement community, including \nthe National Association of Attorneys General, and public health \nadvocates, such as the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids. It also has the \nstrong support of tobacco companies like Altria. These groups, who \nsometimes find themselves on opposite sides of these issues, all agree \nthat this is an issue begging to be addressed. They all recognize the \nurgent need to provide our law enforcement officials with the tools \nthey need to combat a very serious threat to our security and protect \npublic health.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1147\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS CONCERNING THE PRECEDENTIAL EFFECT \n                   OF THIS ACT.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that unique harms are \n     associated with online cigarette sales, including problems \n     with verifying the ages of consumers in the digital market \n     and the long-term health problems associated with the use of \n     certain tobacco products. This Act was enacted recognizing \n     the longstanding interest of Congress in urging compliance \n     with States' laws regulating remote sales of certain tobacco \n     products to citizens of those States, including the passage \n     of the Jenkins Act over 50 years ago, which established \n     reporting requirements for out-of-State companies that sell \n     certain tobacco products to citizens of the taxing States, \n     and which gave authority to the Department of Justice and the \n     Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives to \n     enforce the Jenkins Act. In light of the unique harms and \n     circumstances surrounding the online sale of certain tobacco \n     products, this Act is intended to help collect cigarette \n     excise taxes, to stop tobacco sales to underage youth, and to \n     help the States enforce their laws that target the online \n     sales of certain tobacco products only. This Act is in no way \n     meant to create a precedent regarding the collection of State \n     sales or use taxes by, or the validity of efforts to impose \n     other types of taxes on, out-of-State entities that do not \n     have a physical presence within the taxing State.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself, Mrs. McCaskill, Mr. Bond, and Mr. \n        Thune):\n  S. 1148. A bill to amend the Clean Air Act to modify a provision \nrelating to the renewable fuel program; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joined today in \nintroducing commonsense legislation with Senators McCaskill and Bond. \nThe Renewable Fuel Standard Improvement Act, seeks to improve a number \nof provisions included in the expanded Renewable Fuels Standard that \nwas enacted in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, EISA.\n  Just a week ago, the Chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, \nRepresentative Collin Peterson, introduced this legislation in the \nHouse of Representatives. It now has more than 44 bipartisan \ncosponsors. Because Chairman Peterson crafted such thoughtful \nmodifications to the Renewable Fuel Standard, I want to give my Senate \ncolleagues an opportunity to consider the bill. So, today I am \nintroducing companion legislation in the Senate.\n\n[[Page S5861]]\n\n  A component of the new Renewable Fuels Standard was a requirement \nthat various biofuels meet specified life-cycle greenhouse gas emission \nreduction targets. The law specified that lifecycle greenhouse gas \nemissions are to include direct emissions and significant indirect \nemissions from indirect land use changes. In the Notice of Proposed \nRulemaking released by the Environmental Protection Agency earlier this \nmonth, the EPA relies on incomplete science and inaccurate assumptions \nto penalize U.S. biofuels for so-called ``indirect land use changes.'' \nSo, this bill ensures that the greenhouse gas calculations are based on \nproven science by removing the requirement to include indirect land use \nchanges.\n  The bill also includes a number of other commonsense fixes to the \nexpanded Renewable Fuels Standard. Under EISA, the life-cycle \ngreenhouse gas reduction requirements do not apply to corn ethanol \nplants that were in operation or under construction prior to the date \nof enactment. This grandfather provision does not apply to biodiesel \nfacilities, however. The legislation I am introducing today would \nextend the same grandfathered treatment to biodiesel facilities.\n  Finally, the bill includes a more inclusive definition of renewable \nbiomass, and it expands the role of the U.S. Departments of Agriculture \nand Energy in administering the program.\n  This bill goes a long way to rectifying a few provisions that are \nundermining and harming our efforts toward energy independence. I do \nnot think it makes sense to impose hurdles on our domestic renewable \nfuels industry, particularly if it prolongs our dependence on dirtier \nfossil fuels, or increases our dependence on energy from countries like \nIran and Venezuela.\n  I would like to thank the cosponsors for their support. I look \nforward to Senate consideration of this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 1149. A bill to eliminate annual and lifetime aggregate limits \nimposed by health plans; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Annual \nand Lifetime Health Care Limit Elimination Act of 2009, legislation \nthat would prohibit insurance companies from imposing any annual or \nlifetime limit on any individual or group health insurance policy, thus \nproviding continuity and affordability of health care coverage for \nthose with serious chronic conditions.\n  Each year, thousands of insured Americans face daunting medical \nexpenses and challenges when they reach the annual or lifetime limit on \ntheir individual or employer-sponsored health insurance plan. Once a \nbeneficiary's medical costs have exceeded the annual or lifetime limit \nof their plan, the insurance company no longer pays for the medical \ncosts incurred by that individual.\n  In April, I held a roundtable discussion on health care in Raleigh \nCounty. There, I met a woman who had myelodysplastic syndrome, which is \na non-curable pre-leukemia type disease. Unfortunately, her husband's \ninsurance policy had a lifetime limit of $300,000, which she had \nreached. Another young West Virginian, born with serious congenital \nheart defects, reached the $1 million limit on his mother's insurance \npolicy within the first nine months of his life. The limits on their \nhealth insurance plans have left these families struggling to find a \nway to pay for the expensive and life-sustaining treatments their loved \nones desperately need.\n  Unfortunately, these two West Virginia families are not alone. In \n2007, it was estimated that 55 percent of all people who obtain health \nbenefits from their employer have some type of lifetime limit on their \nplan, an increase of approximately 4 percent since 2004. More than 23 \npercent of people have health insurance plans that impose limits of $2 \nmillion or less. Also, some health insurance policies renew less \nfrequently than annually and contain annual limits to reduce the \nmedical expenses paid by insurance companies. It is estimated that \napproximately 20,000 to 25,000 people no longer have health care \nbenefits through their employers because of lifetime limits on their \nemployer-sponsored health care plans.\n  When individuals with serious chronic conditions--such as transplant \nrecipients, patients living with hemophilia, and newborns with life-\nthreatening illnesses--hit the annual or lifetime limits on their \npolicies, they are often left with very few options to meet their \nhealth care needs. Individuals and families that can afford it can try \nto pay for their health care costs completely out-of-pocket. However, \nthis is rarely financially feasible; therefore, many people are forced \nto leave good, stable jobs and seek different employment in an effort \nto obtain new employer-sponsored coverage. Unfortunately, new enrollees \nare often subject to a waiting period for coverage if there was any \nbreak in their previous health care coverage.\n  Should an individual try to find health insurance in the individual \nmarket, coverage is likely to be prohibitively expensive. More often \nthen not, these individuals are denied coverage altogether because of \nthe insurer's pre-existing condition exclusion. Annual or lifetime \nlimits can force people to turn to public programs such as Medicaid, or \nspend down their savings to meet the financial restrictions of the \nprogram. Others are forced to forgo treatment altogether, which can \nlead to serious complications and greater long-term health care costs.\n  It is time to stop health insurance companies from imposing annual or \nlifetime limits on health insurance policies. The beneficiaries \naffected by these limits have paid their premiums, deductibles, and \ncopays faithfully, only to lose access to life-saving treatment when \nthey need care the most.

A bill to improve end-of-life care; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my friends and \ncolleagues--Senators Collins, Kohl, Wyden and Carper--to introduce the \nAdvance Planning and Compassionate Care Act of 2009, comprehensive \nlegislation that recognizes the critical importance of advance care \nplanning and quality end-of-life care. Senator Collins and I have \nworked on this legislation for over a decade--with the ultimate goal of \none day passing comprehensive end-of-life care legislation. We are \nencouraged by the prospect of comprehensive health reform this year and \nbelieve that it is absolutely critical that end-of-life care provisions \nbe included.\n  In preparation for the impending health reform debate, Senator \nCollins and I decided last year that it was time to update our Advance \nPlanning and Compassionate Care Act to incorporate all of the best \nideas out there on improving end-of-life care--including new and \ninnovative approaches being implemented in the states, approaches \nsuggested by scholars in this field, and recommendations based on our \nown experiences with loved ones facing the end of life. This new and \nimproved bill is truly a labor of love and we are certainly hopeful \nthat we can finally get something comprehensive and meaningful done for \nthe millions of individuals and families faced with the agonizing \nissues surrounding the end of life.\n  A modern health care delivery system is well within our reach and \nsomething that we can start to achieve this year. A critical component \nof a modernized health system is the ability to address the health care \nneeds of patients across the life-span--especially at the end of life. \nDeath is a serious, personal, and complicated part of the life cycle. \nYet, care at the end of life is eventually relevant to everyone. \nAmericans deserve end-of-life care that is effective in providing \ninformation about diagnosis and prognosis, integrating appropriate \nsupport services, fulfilling individual wishes, and avoiding \nunnecessary disputes.\n  The bitter dispute that played out publicly for Terri Schiavo and her \nfamily is an agonizing experience that countless other families quietly \nface over the care of a loved one because clear advance directives are \nnot in place. End-of-life care is a very delicate, yet important, issue \nand we must act to ensure that all Americans have the dignity and \ncomfort they deserve at the end of life. Services should be available \nto help patients and their families with the medical, psychological, \nspiritual, and practical issues surrounding death.\n  Most people want to discuss advance directives when they are healthy \nand they want their families involved in the process. Yet, the vast \nmajority of Americans have not completed an advance directive \nexpressing their final wishes. In 2007, RAND conducted a comprehensive \nreview of academic literature relating to end-of-life decision-making. \nThis review found that only 18 to 30 percent of Americans have \ncompleted some type of advance directive expressing their end-of-life \nwishes. RAND also found that acutely ill individuals, for whom these \ndecisions are particularly relevant, complete advance directives at \nonly slightly higher rates--35 percent of dialysis patients and 32 \npercent of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, COPD, patients. \nPerhaps most alarmingly, between 65 and 76 percent of physicians whose \npatients had an advance directive were unaware of its existence.\n  In its present form, end-of-life planning and care for most Americans \nis perplexing, disjointed, and lacking an active dialogue. In its 1997 \nreport entitled Approaching Death: Improving Care at the End of Life, \nthe Institute of Medicine found several barriers to effective advance \nplanning and end-of-life care that still persist today.\n  In addition to the substantial burden of suffering experienced by \nmany at the end of life, there are also significant financial \nconsequences for family members and society as a whole that stem from \nineffective end-of-life care. According to one Federal evaluation, 80 \npercent of all deaths occur in hospitals--the most costly setting to \ndeliver care--even though most people would prefer to die at home. \nCurrent studies indicate that around 25 percent of all Medicare \nspending occurs in the last year of life. Largely because of their \npoorer health status, dually eligible beneficiaries have Medicare costs \nthat are about 1.5 times that of other Medicare beneficiaries. Research \nalso shows significant variation in expenditures at the end-of-life by \ngeography and hospital, without evidence that greater expenditures are \nassociated with better outcomes or satisfaction.\n  We must find ways to improve the quality of end-of-life care. Quality \nmeasures provide not only information for oversight, but data with \nwhich to improve care practices and models. No core sets of end-of-life \nquality measures are required across provider settings. Even for \ncertified hospices, reporting of quality measures has only recently \nbeen required, with each hospice deciding its own indicators. Hospice \nsurveys are behind schedule and not conducted frequently enough.\n  Facilitating greater advance planning and improving care at the end \nof life also requires an adequate workforce. Unfortunately, there is a \nsubstantial shortage of health professionals who specialize in \npalliative care. There is a severe shortage of physicians and advance \npractice nurses trained in palliative medicine. Contributing to these \nshortages is a shortage of medical and nursing school faculty in \npalliative medicine and care. There is also a lack of content about \nend-of-life care in medical school curricula. Medical students in \ngeneral receive very little formal end-of-life education. Almost half \nof medical residents in a survey felt unprepared to address patients' \nfears of dying. For Americans to have a full range of choices in end-\nof-life care, we must strengthen our health care workforce, including \npalliative care education of physicians and other health professionals.\n  Care at the end-of-life can, and should, be better and more \nconsistent with what Americans want. The Advance Planning and \nCompassionate Care Act takes enormous steps forward to fully inform \nconsumers of their treatment options at the end of life and to actually \naddress patient end-of-life care needs when the time comes. To promote \nadvance care planning, this legislation provides both patients and \ntheir physicians with the information and tools to help them in this \nmost personal and often difficult discussion.\n  Last year's Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act, PL \n110-275, took a significant step forward toward improving advance care \nplanning. MIPPA included a provision that I authored, requiring \nphysicians to provide an advance care planning consultation as part of \nthe Welcome to Medicare physical exam. Unfortunately, less than 10 \npercent of new enrollees use the Welcome to Medicare visit. The MIPPA \nprovision also does not address the advance care planning needs of \nexisting Medicare enrollees.\n  The legislation we are introducing today establishes physician \npayment under Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP for vital patient advance \ncare planning conversations. It provides help in documenting decisions \nfrom these conversations in the form of advance directives and in the \nform of actionable orders for life sustaining treatment. It also takes \nsteps to address the problem of accessing advance directives when \nneeded, including state grants for electronic registries.\n  This legislation establishes a National Geriatric and Palliative Care \nService Corps, modeled after the National Health Service Corps, to \nincrease the woefully inadequate supply\n\n[[Page S5863]]\n\nof geriatric and palliative specialists and to even out their \ngeographic distribution. It adopts MedPAC's 2009 hospice payment \nreforms aimed at aligning payment with the actual trajectory of \nresources expended over hospice episodes of care, while remaining \nwithin the constraints of current reimbursement. Demonstration projects \nare funded to explore ways to better meet the needs of patients over \nlonger time periods than the 6-month prognoses inherent in the hospice \nbenefit.\n  Certification standards and processes are developed for hospital-\nbased palliative care teams. Such teams are critical to providing \nconsultation and care to dying patients. Quality measurement and \noversight are strengthened, with development of end-of-life measures \nacross care settings and greater data reporting requirements of \nhospices--so that we can make sure the hospice benefit is keeping pace \nwith the changing diagnostic mix of patients that hospice serves.\n  Finally, this bill takes the important step of establishing a \nNational Center on Palliative and End-of-Life Care within the NIH. This \nis a vital step toward prioritizing biomedical research in the areas of \npalliative and end-of-life care. It will also serve as a symbol to \nremind us that, as in other phases of life, we need care at the end of \nlife that addresses our individual needs and circumstances.\n  Death is a serious, personal, and complicated issue that is \neventually relevant to each and every one of us. Americans deserve end-\nof-life care that is effective in fulfilling individual wishes, \navoiding unnecessary disputes, and, most importantly, providing quality \nend-of-life care. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join us in \nimproving end-of-life care and reducing the amount of grief that \ninevitably comes with losing those who we hold dear.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1150\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend part A of title IV of the Social Security \nAct to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services to conduct \nresearch on indicators of child well-being; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce with \nmy distinguished colleague Senator Olympia Snowe, bipartisan \nlegislation known as the State Child Well-Being Research Act of 2009. \nCompanion legislation has already been introduced in the House by \nCongressmen Fattah and Camp. This bill is designed to enhance child \nwell-being by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nfacilitate the collection of state-specific data based on a defined set \nof indicators. The well-being of children is important to both national \nand State governments. Therefore, data collection is a priority that \ncannot be ignored if we hope to make informed decisions on public \npolicy.\n  In 1996, Congress passed bold legislation, which I supported to \ndramatically change our welfare system. The driving force behind this \nreform was to promote the work and self-sufficiency of families and to \nprovide the flexibility to States necessary to achieve these goals. \nStates, which is where most child and family legislation takes place, \nhave used this flexibility to design different programs that work \nbetter for the families who rely on them. The design and benefits \navailable under other programs that serve children, ranging from the \nChildren Health Insurance Program, CHIP, to child welfare services, can \nvary widely among States.\n  It is obvious that in order for policy makers to evaluate child well-\nbeing, we need state-specific data on child well-being to measure the \nresults. Current surveys provide minimal data on some important \nindicators of child well-being, but insufficient data is available on \nlow-income families, geographic variation, and young children. \nAdditionally, the information is not provided in a timely manner, which \nimpedes legislators' ability to effectively measure child well-being \nand design effective programs to support our children.\n\n[[Page S5873]]\n\n  The State Child Well-Being Research Act of 2009 is intended to fill \nthis information gap by collecting up-to-date, State-specific data that \ncan be used by policymakers, researchers, and child advocates to assess \nthe well-being of children. As we strive to promote quality programs, \nwe need basic benchmarks to measure outcomes. Our bill would require \nthat a survey examine the physical and emotional health of children, \nadequately represent the experiences of families in individual states, \nbe consistent across states, be collected annually, articulate results \nin easy to understand terms, and focus on low-income children and \nfamilies. This legislation also establishes an advisory committee, \nconsisting of a panel of experts who specialize in survey methodology \nand indicators of child well-being, and the application of this data to \nensure that the purpose is being achieved.\n  Further, this bill avoids some of the problems in the current system \nby making data files easier to use and more readily available to the \npublic. As a result, the information will be more useful for policy-\nmakers managing welfare reform and programs for children and families. \nFinally, this legislation also offers the potential for the Health and \nHuman Service Department to partner with private charitable \nfoundations, like the Annie E. Casey Foundations, which has already \nexpressed an interest in forming a partnership to provide outreach, \nsupport and a guarantee that the data collected would be broadly \ndisseminated. This type of public-private partnership helps to leverage \nadditional resources for children and families and increases the \nstudy's impact. Given the tight budget we face, partnerships make sense \nto meet this essential need.\n  I hope my colleagues review this legislation carefully and choose to \nsupport it so that Federal and state policy makers and advocates have \nthe information necessary to make good decisions for children.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1151\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``State Child Well-Being \n     Research Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The well-being of children is a paramount concern for \n     our Nation and for every State, and most programs for \n     children and families are managed at the State or local \n     level.\n       (2) Child well-being varies over time and across social, \n     economic, and geographic groups, and can be affected by \n     changes in the circumstances of families, by the economy, by \n     the social and cultural environment, and by public policies \n     and programs at the Federal, State, and local level.\n       (3) States, including small States, need information about \n     child well-being that is specific to their State and that is \n     up-to-date, cost-effective, and consistent across States and \n     over time.\n       (4) Regular collection of child well-being information at \n     the State level is essential so that Federal and State \n     officials can track child well-being over time.\n       (5) Information on child well-being is necessary for all \n     States, particularly small States that do not have State-\n     level data in other federally supported databases. \n     Information is needed on the well-being of all children, not \n     just children participating in Federal programs.\n       (6) Telephone surveys of parents represent a relatively \n     cost-effective strategy for obtaining information on child \n     well-being at the State level for all States, including small \n     States, and can be conducted alone or in mixed mode strategy \n     with other survey techniques.\n       (7) Data from telephone surveys of the population are \n     currently used to monitor progress toward many important \n     national goals, including immunization of preschool children \n     with the National Immunization Survey, and the identification \n     of health care issues of children with special needs with the \n     National Survey of Children with Special Health Care Needs.\n       (8) A State-level telephone survey, alone or in combination \n     with other techniques, can provide information on a range of \n     topics, including children's social and emotional \n     development, education, health, safety, family income, family \n     employment, and child care. Information addressing marriage \n     and family structure can also be obtained for families with \n     children. Information obtained from such a survey would not \n     be available solely for children or families participating in \n     programs but would be representative of the entire State \n     population and consequently, would inform welfare \n     policymaking on a range of important issues, such as income \n     support, child care, child abuse and neglect, child health, \n     family formation, and education.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to allow Americans to earn paid sick time so that \nthey can address their own health needs and the health needs and the \nhealth needs of their families; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, in this turbulent economy, working \nfamilies are facing enormous challenges. Too many families are living \npaycheck to paycheck, just one layoff or health crisis away from \ndisaster. Now more than ever, workers are struggling to balance the \ndemands of their jobs and their families. When a sickness or health \nproblem arises, these challenges can easily become insurmountable.\n  Unfortunately, almost half of all private sector workers--including \n79 percent of low-wage workers--have no paid sick days they can use to \ncare for themselves or a sick family member. For these workers, taking \na day off to care for their own health or a sick child means losing a \nmuch-needed paycheck, or even putting their jobs in danger. In a recent \nsurvey, 1 in 6 workers reported that they or a family member have been \nfired, punished or threatened with termination for taking time off \nbecause of their own illness or to care for a sick relative.\n  Workers can't afford to take that kind of risk now. Losing even one \npaycheck can mean falling behind on bills, foregoing needed medicines, \nor skipping meals. As a result, many employees continue to go to work \nwhen they are ill, and send their children to school or day care sick, \nbecause it's the only way to make ends meet.\n  The lack of paid sick day is not just a crisis for individual \nfamilies--it is a public health crisis as well. The current flu \noutbreak provides a compelling illustration. To prevent the spread of \nthe virus, the World Health Organization, the Center for Disease \nControl, and numerous state and local public health officials urged \npeople to stay home from work or school if they flu-like symptoms. \nStrong scientific evidence proves that this is one of the best ways to \nprevent the spread of disease and protect the public health.\n  But without paid sick days, following this sound advice is often \nimpossible--millions of employees want to do the right thing and stay \nhome, but our current laws just do not protect them. The Family and \nMedical Leave Act enables workers to take time off for serious health \nconditions, but only about half of today's workers are covered by the \nact, and millions more can not take advantage of it because this leave \nis unpaid.\n  Hardworking Americans should not have to make these impossible \nchoices. That's why Senator Dodd, Representative Rosa DeLauro and I are \nintroducing the Healthy Families Act, which will enable workers to take \nup to 56 hours, or about 7 days, of paid sick leave each year. \nEmployees can use this time to stay home and get well when they are \nill, to care for a sick family member, to obtain preventive or \ndiagnostic treatment, or to seek help if they are victims of domestic \nviolence.\n  This important legislation will provide needed security for working \nfamilies struggling to balance the jobs they need and the families they \nlove. It will improve public health and reduce health costs by \npreventing the spread of disease and giving employees the access they \nneed to obtain preventive care. It will also help victims of domestic \nviolence to protect their families and their futures.\n  In addition, the legislation will benefit businesses by decreasing \nemployee turnover, and improving productivity. ``Presenteeism''--sick \nworkers coming to work and infecting their colleagues instead of \nstaying at home--costs our economy $180 billion annually in lost \nproductivity. For employers, the cost averages $255 per employee per \nyear, and exceeds the cost of absenteeism and medical and disability \nbenefits. The lack of paid sick days also leads to higher employee \nturnover, especially for low-wage workers. When the benefits of the \nHealthy Families Act are weighed against its costs, providing paid sick \ndays will actually save American businesses up to $9 billion a year by \neliminating these productivity losses and reducing turnover.\n  Above all, enabling workers to earn paid sick time to care for \nthemselves and their families is a matter of fundamental fairness. \nEvery worker has had to miss days of work because of illness. Every \nchild gets sick and needs a parent at home to take care of them. And \nall hardworking Americans deserve the chance to take care of their \nfamilies without putting their jobs or their health on the line.\n  It is long past time for our laws to deal with these difficult \nchoices that working men and women face every day. As President Obama \nhas said, ``Nobody in America should have to choose between keeping \ntheir jobs and caring for a sick child.'' I urge all of my colleagues \nto join in supporting the Healthy Families Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5874-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5874-S5875]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 155--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \n GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA SHOULD IMMEDIATELY CEASE \n  ENGAGING IN ACTS OF CULTURAL, LINGUISTIC, AND RELIGIOUS SUPPRESSION \n                   DIRECTED AGAINST THE UYGHUR PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. BROWN (for himself and Mr. Inhofe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                              S.

Res. 156\n\n       Whereas in the presence of a federally-backed insurance \n     pool, those Americans who have become unemployed, live in \n     rural and other traditionally underserved areas, or have been \n     unable to attain affordable health insurance would benefit \n     from consumer choice: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate recognizes that any efforts to \n     reform our Nation's health care system should include as an \n     option the establishment of a federally-backed insurance pool \n     to create options for American consumers.\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, in my approaching 2\\1/2\\ years in the \nSenate, I have held some 140 roundtables across my State--from Bryan, \nto Saint Clairsville, to Ashtabula, to Cincinnati--where I have had the \nopportunity to listen to health care professionals and advocates and \ntheir families speak about their circumstances and struggles. Through \nthese discussions, one thing has become painfully obvious: Health care \nreform must include insurance reform, and health insurance reform must \ninclude the option of a federally backed health insurance plan. That is \nwhy I am here today to introduce a resolution, along with 26 of my \nSenate colleagues, to express the importance of including a federally \nbacked health insurance plan in health care reform.\n  As we work to reform our health care system, we must protect what \nworks and fix what is broken. It is important that we preserve access \nto employer-sponsored coverage for those who want to keep their current \nplan. That is what President Obama is insisting on. If you are \nsatisfied, you keep what coverage you have. But with more and more \nAmericans losing jobs and seeing their health insurance scaled back, it \nis important that people have access to something else. Americans \ndeserve the chance to go with a private or a federally backed health \ninsurance plan. It is their choice, and this choice is good policy. \nThis choice is good common sense.\n  Americans are tired of trying to get health insurance coverage and \nbeing turned down because they have a preexisting condition. They are \ntired of premiums and deductibles and copays that they simply can no \nlonger afford. They are tired of having to fight for every penny when \nthey have paid their insurance premium month after month. They are \ntired of having to fight for every penny that the insurer owes them \nwhen they try to use their insurance and waiting all too often for \nmonths to get their claims paid. They are tired of wondering whether \ntheir insurance will pay for them at all to see the specialist they \nneed, to get the medicine they need, or to have the operation they \nneed. That is not what insurance should be.\n  They are tired mostly of the uncertainty surrounding health \ninsurance. If they lose their job, they lose insurance. If they get \nsick, they can't get insurance. If they submit a claim, it may be paid \nin 2 or 6 months, or sometimes, even though they are fighting their \ninsurance company and asking and pleading and begging, they may not get \nthe claim paid at all.\n  To be meaningful, health care reform must be responsive to all of \nthese shortcomings in our current system. To be responsive, health care \nreform must address insurance affordability, reliability, and insurance \ncontinuity. To achieve these goals, health care reform must provide \nOhioans and every American with more options. People should be able to \nchoose whether to keep the coverage they have or to purchase coverage \nbacked by the Federal Government.\n  A federally backed plan would provide continuity. It would be \navailable in every part of the country, no matter how rural, in western \nNorth Carolina or in southeast Ohio. Its benefits would be guaranteed, \nand its cost sharing would be affordable because of the problems of \ncost shifting--no ifs, no ands, and no buts. A federally backed plan \nwould be an option but certainly not the only option. Americans who \nhave employer-sponsored coverage would still have that coverage. \nAmericans who have individual coverage through a private insurer would \nstill have that coverage. A federally backed plan would be an option, \nnot a mandate. Some will choose it; others will not. That is the kind \nof choice we ask for.\n  One reason such an option is important is because hundreds of \nthousands of Americans are losing their jobs and have no affordable \ncoverage option. This would give them one. If you have ever tried to \npurchase affordable coverage in the individual insurance market--and I \nhave--you understand why a federally backed insurance program is so \nimportant. If you live in a rural area where quality, affordable \ncoverage is unavailable, you know why a federally backed insurance \noption is so important. There needs to be an option for people who \ncan't find what they need in the private insurance market, just as \nMedicare is there for seniors. The federally backed option will give \nthose under 65, if not yet eligible for Medicare, a place to turn.\n  The resolution I am introducing today, with half of the Democrats in \nthe Senate already signed on as cosponsors--there will be more later--\ndemonstrates broad support for a federally backed insurance option and \nhealth care reform. I encourage all colleagues to support this \nresolution.\n  The majority of the HELP Committee are cosponsors of this bill. That \nis the committee that will help to write the health insurance bill with \nthe Finance Committee. If consumers have more options, including the \noption to purchase federally backed coverage designed to provide the \nthree things that matter most--affordability, reliability, and \ncontinuity, the three things that too often are absent from private \ninsurance plans--we will have gone a long way toward making the U.S. \nhealth care system work for every American. That is why this resolution \nmatters. That is why the option of a federally backed insurance plan \nmakes so much sense.\n\n[[Page S5876]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5876-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 157--RECOGNIZING BREAD FOR THE WORLD, ON THE 35TH \n  ANNIVERSARY OF ITS FOUNDING, FOR ITS FAITHFUL ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF \n       POOR AND HUNGRY PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \nBrown, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Casey, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. Menendez) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

Res. 161\n\n       Whereas according to the HHT Foundation International, \n     Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiecstasia (HHT), also referred \n     to as Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome, is a long-neglected \n     national health problem that affects approximately 70,000 (1 \n     in 5,000) people in the United States and 1,200,000 \n     worldwide;\n       Whereas HHT is an autosomal dominant, uncommon complex \n     genetic blood vessel disorder, characterized by \n     telangiectases and artery-vein malformations that occurs in \n     major organs including the lungs, brain, and liver, as well \n     as the nasal mucosa, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and skin \n     of the face and hands;\n       Whereas left untreated, HHT can result in considerable \n     morbidity and mortality and lead to acute and chronic health \n     problems or sudden death;\n       Whereas according to the HHT Foundation International, 20 \n     percent of those with HHT, regardless of age, suffer death \n     and disability;\n       Whereas according to the HHT Foundation International, due \n     to widespread lack of knowledge of the disorder among medical \n     professionals, approximately 90 percent of the HHT population \n     has not yet been diagnosed and is at risk for death or \n     disability due to sudden rupture of the blood vessels in \n     major organs in the body;\n       Whereas the HHT Foundation International estimates that 20 \n     to 40 percent of complications and sudden death due to these \n     ``vascular time bombs'' are preventable;\n       Whereas patients with HHT frequently receive fragmented \n     care from practitioners who focus on 1 organ of the body, \n     having little knowledge about involvement in other organs or \n     the interrelation of the syndrome systemically;\n       Whereas HHT is associated with serious consequences if not \n     treated early, yet the condition is amenable to early \n     identification and diagnosis with suitable tests, and there \n     are acceptable treatments available in already-established \n     facilities such as the 8 HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence \n     in the United States;

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Enslaved African Americans provided labor essential to \n     the construction of the United States Capitol.\n       (2) The report of the Architect of the Capitol entitled \n     ``History of Slave Laborers in the Construction of the United \n     States Capitol'' documents the role of slave labor in the \n     construction of the Capitol.\n       (3) Enslaved African Americans performed the backbreaking \n     work of quarrying the stone which comprised many of the \n     floors, walls, and columns of the Capitol.\n       (4) Enslaved African Americans also participated in other \n     facets of construction of the Capitol, including carpentry, \n     masonry, carting, rafting, roofing, plastering, glazing, \n     painting, and sawing.\n       (5) The marble columns in the Old Senate Chamber and the \n     sandstone walls of the East Front corridor remain as the \n     lasting legacies of the enslaved African Americans who worked \n     the quarries.\n       (6) Slave-quarried stones from the remnants of the original \n     Capitol walls can be found in Rock Creek Park in the District \n     of Columbia.\n       (7) The Statue of Freedom now atop the Capitol dome could \n     not have been cast without the pivotal intervention of Philip \n     Reid, an enslaved African-American foundry worker who \n     deciphered the puzzle of how to separate the 5-piece plaster \n     model for casting, when all others failed.\n       (8) The great hall of the Capitol Visitor Center was named \n     Emancipation Hall to help acknowledge the work of the slave \n     laborers who built the Capitol.\n       (9) No narrative on the construction of the Capitol that \n     does not include the contribution of enslaved African \n     Americans can fully and accurately reflect its history.\n       (10) Recognition of the contributions of enslaved African \n     Americans brings to all Americans an understanding of the \n     continuing evolution of our representative democracy.\n       (11) A marker dedicated to the enslaved African Americans \n     who helped to build the Capitol will reflect the charge of \n     the Capitol Visitor Center to teach visitors about Congress \n     and its development.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to Calendar No. 61, S. Con. Res. 19.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the concurrent \nresolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (S. Con. Res. 19) expressing the \n     sense of Congress that the Shi'ite Personal Status Law in \n     Afghanistan violates the fundamental human rights of women \n     and should be repealed.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution, which had been reported from the Committee on \nForeign Relations, with an amendment to strike out all after the \nresolving clause and insert the part printed in italic and to strike \nout the preamble and insert the part printed in italic.\n\n       Whereas in March 2009, the Shi'ite Personal Status Law was \n     approved by the parliament of Afghanistan and signed by \n     President Hamid Karzai;\n       Whereas according to the United Nations, the law legalizes \n     marital rape by mandating that a wife cannot refuse sex to \n     her husband unless she is ill;\n       Whereas the law also weakens mothers' rights in the event \n     of a divorce and prohibits a woman from leaving her home \n     unless her husband determines it is for a ``legitimate \n     purpose'';\n       Whereas President Barack Obama has called the law \n     ``abhorrent'' and stated that ``there are certain basic \n     principles that all nations should uphold, and respect for \n     women and respect for their freedom and integrity is an \n     important principle'';\n       Whereas the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \n     Rights has said that the law represents a ``huge step in the \n     wrong direction'' and is ``extraordinary, reprehensible and \n     reminiscent of the decrees made by the Taliban regime in \n     Afghanistan in the 1990s'';\n       Whereas the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization (NATO) has asserted that passage of the law \n     could discourage countries in Europe from contributing \n     additional troops to help combat terrorism in the region;\n       Whereas President Karzai has instructed the Government of \n     Afghanistan and members of the clergy to review the law and \n     change any articles that are not in keeping with \n     Afghanistan's Constitution and Islamic Sharia;\n       Whereas the law includes provisions that are fundamentally \n     incompatible with the obligations of the Government of \n     Afghanistan under various international instruments to which \n     it is a party;\n       Whereas Afghanistan is a signatory of the Universal \n     Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR), which establishes the \n     principle of nondiscrimination, including on the basis of \n     sex, and states that men and women are entitled to equal \n     rights to marriage, during marriage, and at its dissolution;\n       Whereas Afghanistan became a party to the International \n     Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, done at New \n     York December 16, 1966, and entered into force January 3, \n     1976 (ICESCR), which emphasizes the principle of self-\n     determination, in that men and women may freely determine \n     their political status as well as their economic, social, and \n     cultural development;\n       Whereas Afghanistan acceded to the Convention on the \n     Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, \n     done at New York December 18, 1979, and entered into force \n     September 3, 1981 (CEDAW), which condemns discrimination \n     against women in all its forms and reaffirms the equal rights \n     and responsibilities of men and women during marriage and at \n     its dissolution;\n       Whereas article 22 of the Constitution of Afghanistan \n     (2003) prohibits any kind of discrimination between and \n     privilege among the citizens of Afghanistan and establishes \n     the equal rights of all citizens before the law;\n       Whereas the international community and the United States \n     have a long-standing commitment to and interest in working \n     with the people and Government of Afghanistan to re-establish \n     respect for fundamental human rights and protect women's \n     rights in Afghanistan; and\n       Whereas the provisions in the Shi'ite Personal Status Law \n     that restrict women's rights are inconsistent with those \n     goals: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), [That Congress--\n       [(1) urges the Government of Afghanistan and President \n     Hamid Karzai to declare the provisions of the Shi'ite \n     Personal Status Law on marital rape and restrictions on \n     women's freedom of movement unconstitutional and an erosion \n     of growth and development in Afghanistan;\n       [(2) supports the decision by President Karzai to analyze \n     the draft law and strongly urges him not to publish it on the \n     grounds that it violates the Constitution of Afghanistan and \n     the basic human rights of women;\n       [(3) encourages the Secretary of State, the Special \n     Representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan, the Ambassador-\n     at-Large for International Women's Issues, and the United \n     States Ambassador to Afghanistan to consider and address the \n     status of women's rights and security in Afghanistan to \n     ensure that these rights are not being eroded through unjust \n     laws, policies, or institutions;

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the amendment \nat the desk be agreed to, the committee-reported amendments, as \namended, if amended, be agreed to, the resolution, as amended, be \nagreed to, the preamble, as amended, be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table en bloc, and that any statements \nrelating to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 160.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 160) condemning the actions of the \n     Burmese State Peace and Development Council against Daw Aung \n     San Suu Kyi and calling for the immediate and unconditional \n     release of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to note passage of a Senate \nresolution on Burma. This resolution reflects the U.S. Senate's \nunequivocal condemnation of the show trial currently being conducted by \nBurmese officials against Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. \nIt is bad enough that Suu Kyi has been imprisoned for 13 of the past 19 \nyears. Now the Burmese regime, the State Peace and Development Council, \nhas come up with the flimsiest of pretexts to try to detain her \nfurther. It appears the regime will do anything to consolidate its grip \non power. One suspects that the regime wants Suu Kyi behind bars at \nleast until elections under its sham constitution are held in 2010.\n  I am gratified that this resolution reflects the strong, bipartisan \nview of the Senate on this matter. This resolution, which was authored \nby Senator Gregg, is cosponsored by Senators Feinstein, Durbin, McCain, \nBrownback, Lieberman, Collins, Bennett, Bond and me. It is also \ncosponsored by the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senators Kerry and Lugar. A clearer signal from \nthis chamber about Suu Kyi could hardly be sent.\n  As I noted earlier in the week, the members of the Senate have been \nand will continue to monitor the trial of Suu Kyi with deep concern.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this morning Secretary of State Hillary \nClinton appeared before the State Department, Foreign Operations, and \nRelated Programs Appropriations Subcommittee to discuss the fiscal year \n2010 budget request for America's international affairs programs and \noperations. We had a productive discussion on the numerous and \nextraordinary challenges that our Nation faces in the world today.\n  During the hearing, I brought up the plight of Burmese democracy \nleader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, who faces criminal charges stemming for an \nuninvited visit by an American citizen to her compound in Rangoon, a \ncompound on which she has spent 13 of the last 19 years under house \narrest. These charges are absurd and have been roundly, and \nappropriately, condemned by the international community.\n  Unfortunately, this is not an isolated incident but merely the latest \nattempt by General Than Shwe and the State Peace and Development \nCouncil to persecute Suu Kyi and her National League for Democracy \nparty.\n  I regret that General Than Shwe has made clear his complete and total \ndisinterest in improving Burma's relationship with the United States. \nIt is apparent that any open hand will be met with a clenched fist.\n\n[[Page S5885]]\n\n  The resolution my colleagues and I offer today recognizes the \ncontinued injustices in Burma, and it states unequivocally that we \ndeplore and condemn the show trial of Suu Kyi. The resolution sends a \nclear message to Suu Kyi and her supporters that the Senate remains \nsquarely on the side of freedom and justice in Burma.\n  I agree with Secretary Clinton that more can and should be done on a \nbilateral and multilateral basis to secure the release of Suu Kyi and \nall prisoners of conscience in Burma today. The resolution calls for \nthe Secretary to reinvigorate such efforts, and I intend to continue to \nwork with her in support of human rights in Burma.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, and the motions to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 160\n\n       Whereas the military regime in Burma, headed by General \n     Than Shwe and the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC), \n     has carried out a longstanding and brutal campaign of \n     persecution against Burmese democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu \n     Kyi and her supporters in the National League for Democracy, \n     ethnic minorities, and ordinary citizens of Burma who \n     publicly and courageously speak out against the regime's many \n     injustices, abuses, and atrocities;\n       Whereas the military regime in Burma is solely responsible \n     for failing to provide for the basic needs of the people of \n     Burma and has restricted the activities and movement of \n     United Nations agencies and humanitarian nongovernmental \n     organizations operating in Burma today;\n       Whereas Burmese democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has \n     been imprisoned in Burma for 13 of the last 19 years, and \n     many members of the National League for Democracy have been \n     similarly jailed, tortured, or killed;\n       Whereas Burmese democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi \n     currently faces criminal charges by the military regime for \n     breaking the terms of her house arrest, which arose from the \n     uninvited visit of an American citizen; and\n       Whereas these criminal charges are consistent with other \n     past actions by the military regime to harass and persecute \n     Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and the National League for Democracy: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns and deplores the show trial of Burmese \n     democracy leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi;\n       (2) condemns and deplores the criminal actions by the State \n     Peace and Development Council against Daw Aung San Suu Kyi \n     and members of the National League for Democracy;\n       (3) recognizes that currently conditions do not exist in \n     Burma for the conduct of credible and participatory \n     elections;\n       (4) calls for the immediate and unconditional release of \n     Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all prisoners of conscience in \n     Burma;\n       (5) calls upon the Secretary of State to reinvigorate \n     efforts with regional governments and multilateral \n     organizations (including the People's Republic of China, \n     India, and Japan as well as the Association of Southeast \n     Asian Nations and the United Nations Security Council) to \n     secure the immediate and unconditional release of Daw Aung \n     San Suu Kyi and all prisoners of conscience in Burma; and\n       (6) calls upon the State Peace and Development Council to \n     establish, with the full and unfettered participation of the \n     National League for Democracy and ethnic minorities, a \n     genuine roadmap for the peaceful transition to civilian, \n     democratic rule.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5885-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING JUNE 2009 AS THE FIRST HHT MONTH\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 161\n\n       Whereas according to the HHT Foundation International, \n     Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiecstasia (HHT), also referred \n     to as Osler-Weber-Rendu Syndrome, is a long-neglected \n     national health problem that affects approximately 70,000 (1 \n     in 5,000) people in the United States and 1,200,000 \n     worldwide;\n       Whereas HHT is an autosomal dominant, uncommon complex \n     genetic blood vessel disorder, characterized by \n     telangiectases and artery-vein malformations that occurs in \n     major organs including the lungs, brain, and liver, as well \n     as the nasal mucosa, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, and skin \n     of the face and hands;\n       Whereas left untreated, HHT can result in considerable \n     morbidity and mortality and lead to acute and chronic health \n     problems or sudden death;\n       Whereas according to the HHT Foundation International, 20 \n     percent of those with HHT, regardless of age, suffer death \n     and disability;\n       Whereas according to the HHT Foundation International, due \n     to widespread lack of knowledge of the disorder among medical \n     professionals, approximately 90 percent of the HHT population \n     has not yet been diagnosed and is at risk for death or \n     disability due to sudden rupture of the blood vessels in \n     major organs in the body;\n       Whereas the HHT Foundation International estimates that 20 \n     to 40 percent of complications and sudden death due to these \n     ``vascular time bombs'' are preventable;\n       Whereas patients with HHT frequently receive fragmented \n     care from practitioners who focus on 1 organ of the body, \n     having little knowledge about involvement in other organs or \n     the interrelation of the syndrome systemically;\n       Whereas HHT is associated with serious consequences if not \n     treated early, yet the condition is amenable to early \n     identification and diagnosis with suitable tests, and there \n     are acceptable treatments available in already-established \n     facilities such as the 8 HHT Treatment Centers of Excellence \n     in the United States; and\n       Whereas adequate Federal funding is needed for education, \n     outreach, and research to prevent death and disability, \n     improve outcomes, reduce costs, and increase the quality of \n     life for people living with HHT: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the need to pursue research to find better \n     treatments, and eventually, a cure for HHT;\n       (2) recognizes and supports the HHT Foundation \n     International as the only advocacy organization in the United \n     States working to find a cure for HHT while saving the lives \n     and improving the well-being of individuals and families \n     affected by HHT through research, outreach, education, and \n     support;\n       (3) supports the designation of June 2009 as National \n     Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiecstasia (HHT) month, to \n     increase awareness of HHT;\n       (4) acknowledges the need to identify the approximately 90 \n     percent of the HHT population that has not yet been diagnosed \n     and is at risk for death or disability due to sudden rupture \n     of the blood vessels in major organs in the body;\n       (5) recognizes the importance of comprehensive care centers \n     in providing complete care and treatment for each patient \n     with HHT;\n       (6) recognizes that stroke, lung, and brain hemorrhages can \n     be prevented through early diagnosis, screening, and \n     treatment of HHT;\n       (7) recognizes severe hemorrhages in the nose and \n     gastrointestinal tract can be controlled through \n     intervention, and that heart failure can be managed through \n     proper diagnosis of HHT and treatments;\n       (8) recognizes that a leading medical and academic \n     institution estimated that $6,600,000,000 of 1-time health \n     care costs can be saved through aggressive management of HHT \n     in the at-risk population; and\n       (9) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe and support the month through \n     appropriate programs and activities that promote public \n     awareness of HHT and potential treatments for it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5885-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5885-S5886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING LANGSTON GOLF COURSE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Res. 163\n\n       Whereas a stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident, \n     is an acute neurologic injury that occurs when the blood \n     supply to a part of the brain is interrupted by a clot in the \n     artery or a burst of the artery;\n       Whereas a stroke is a medical emergency that can cause \n     permanent neurologic damage or even death if not promptly \n     diagnosed and treated;\n       Whereas 26 out of every 100,000 newborns and almost 3 out \n     of every 100,000 children have a stroke each year;\n       Whereas an individual can have a stroke before birth;\n       Whereas stroke is among the top 10 causes of death for \n     children in the United States;\n       Whereas 9 percent of all children who experience a stroke \n     die as a result;\n       Whereas stroke recurs in 20 percent of children who have \n     experienced a stroke;\n       Whereas the death rate for children who experience a stroke \n     before the age of 1 year is the highest out of all age \n     groups;\n       Whereas the average time from onset of symptoms to \n     diagnosis of stroke is 24 hours, putting many affected \n     children outside the window of 3 hours for the most \n     successful treatment;\n       Whereas many children who experience a stroke will suffer \n     serious, long-term neurological disabilities, including--\n       (1) hemiplegia, which is paralysis of 1 side of the body;\n       (2) seizures;\n       (3) speech and vision problems; and\n       (4) learning difficulties;\n       Whereas such disabilities may require ongoing physical \n     therapy and surgeries;\n       Whereas the permanent health concerns and treatments \n     resulting from strokes that occur during childhood and young \n     adulthood have a considerable impact on children, families, \n     and society;\n       Whereas very little is known about the cause, treatment, \n     and prevention of childhood stroke;\n       Whereas medical research is the only means by which the \n     citizens of the United States can identify and develop \n     effective treatment and prevention strategies for childhood \n     stroke;\n       Whereas early diagnosis and treatment of childhood stroke \n     greatly improves the chances that the affected child will \n     recover and not experience a recurrence; and\n       Whereas The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia should be \n     commended for its initiative in creating the Nation's first \n     program dedicated to pediatric stroke patients: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of an appropriate date as \n     ``National Childhood Stroke Awareness Day''; and\n       (2) urges the people of the United States to support the \n     efforts, programs, services, and advocacy of organizations \n     that work to enhance public awareness of childhood stroke.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5886-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5886-S5887]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES \n         AND A CONDITIONAL RECESS OR ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, while we are waiting tonight for the staff \nto get the necessary closing papers ready so we can go out for the \nrecess, I wish to say a couple of things about someone I have gotten to \nknow over the past decade--Joe Lapia. I am going to miss tremendously, \nwhen we come back next work period, Joe not being in the cloakroom. He \nhas been there for 10 years. He is a fixture in the cloakroom.\n  He is someone who is dependable, a great sport, and he is somebody \nwho is so much fun to deal with. I love to talk sports with him. He is \nfrom Pittsburgh. I had to tell him--and I spread it on the record \nhere--that the Pittsburgh teams have never been one of my favorites, \nbut they are his. He went to Penn State. They have also not been one of \nmy favorite teams, but they are his. And the records of the Steelers \nand Penn State speak for themselves--the great Joe Paterno and the \nwonderful records the Steelers have made. And Joe went to the White \nHouse today to see the world champion Super Bowl winners--the \nPittsburgh Steelers.\n  Another thing I am going to miss is every time he went home--which \nwas quite often, frankly--his mom would cook stuff. And maybe she \nthinks he ate it all, but he didn't. He brought stuff back, and we \nshared treats Mrs. Lapia fixed. Brownies were my favorite, but there \nwere other things she cooked.\n  I think I can speak for the entire Senate family, the people who are \nhere who make this place work, when I say we will all miss Joe. He is \ngoing to go off into the private sector now, which disappoints me \nbecause it is always hard getting used to new things. No matter who \nreplaces Joe, there is only one Joe Lapia. He is someone I will always \nremember and I will always consider my friend.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want the record to reflect the cooperation \nof Dr. Barrasso, Senator Barrasso. He had some concerns about this. We \ndid our best to answer them. He has been very positive in his approach. \nHe had some questions that needed to be answered. I think they have \nbeen answered, and I appreciate very much his being as courteous as he \nwas through this whole process. He has been a real gentleman, and I \nappreciate it a lot.\n  Mr. President, let me express my appreciation to the Presiding \nOfficer. All Senators are very busy, but you have been presiding for \nhours. That is a real burden. We all appreciate it, especially other \nSenators appreciate it. We have to have someone presiding.\n  I am so impressed with the skills that the Senator from Colorado has \nbrought to us. I didn't know you before you were appointed by the \nGovernor to come, but the people of Colorado should understand, using \nan overworked term, you hit the ground running. You have done so well. \nYou adjusted so well to Senate life.\n  I say it twice tonight, I am very impressed, and I hope the people of \nColorado understand what a good choice Governor Ritter made, choosing \nyou to fill the seat of a terrific person, Ken Salazar.\n  Mr. President, I want all the staff to know of my appreciation. I \nspeak for all of us. Every Senator would come and say the same thing, \nbut I am the one here to express our appreciation for helping this \nprocess go forward. It is not easy.\n  As much time as I have spent over the years on this floor--and it \namounts to, all added up--it has probably been years. As familiar as I \nam with everything, I couldn't do it without the help of the staff.\n  It is not only Lula Davis--she has been such a wonderful asset to the \nDemocratic caucus--but also the help that I get from the Republican \nside, the staff. I think we were always very worried after Marty \ndecided to go downtown. We wanted to make sure the same goodwill \nprevailed between David Schiappa and Lula Davis as we had before.\n  It is as good if not better. I am very happy with the cooperation we \nget. I wish I could express this personally to Senator McConnell, but I \nthink he will get the word.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/21/senate-section/article/S5888-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ORDERS FOR MONDAY, JUNE 1, 2009\n\n  Mr. REID.
