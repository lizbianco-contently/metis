It is so ordered.\n  The Answer to the Articles of Impeachment is as follows:\n\n                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n                SITTING FOR THE TRIAL OF AN IMPEACHMENT\n\n     In re:\n     Impeachment of G. Thomas Porteous, Jr.,\n     United States District Judge for the Eastern\n     District of Louisiana\n\n Answer of Judge G. Thomas Porteous, Jr. to the Articles of Impeachment\n\n       The Honorable G. Thomas Porteous, Jr., a Judge of the \n     United States District Court for the Eastern District of \n     Louisiana, as commanded by the summons of the Senate of the \n     United States, answers the accusations made by the House of \n     Representatives of the United States in the four Articles of \n     Impeachment it has exhibited to the Senate as follows:\n\n                                Preamble\n\n\n    THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES' IMPEACHMENT OF JUDGE PORTEOUS IS \n                     UNPRECEDENTED AND UNJUSTIFIED\n\n       For the first time in modern history, the House of \n     Representatives has impeached a sitting Article III Judge who \n     has never been charged with a crime. Indeed, it has been more \n     than 74 years since the House of Representatives has brought \n     Articles of Impeachment against a judge that were not \n     preceded by that judge's indictment in the criminal courts. \n     The Articles of Impeachment brought against Judge Porteous \n     are also unprecedented in two additional ways. First, this is \n     the only time since the ratification of the Constitution that \n     the House of Representatives has brought Articles of \n     Impeachment against a judge after the Executive Branch, \n     having conducted a thorough investigation, has declined to \n     prosecute. Second, it is the only time in the same period \n     that the House of Representatives has based an Article of \n     Impeachment against a judge, or any other officer, upon \n     allegations that pre-date his or her entry into federal \n     office.\n       These actions are unprecedented and they are also \n     unjustified by the facts of this case. The four Articles of \n     Impeachment do not allege a single offense that supports the \n     conviction and removal of a sitting Article III Judge under \n     the impeachment clause of the Constitution. Article II, \n     Section 4 of the Constitution provides that the civil \n     officers shall be removed from office only upon ``Impeachment \n     for, and Conviction of, Treason, Bribery or other high Crimes \n     and Misdemeanors.'' The charges in the articles against Judge \n     Porteous do not rise to the constitutionally required level \n     of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' Indeed, in some \n     instances, the Articles allege violations of the canons of \n     judicial ethics or criticize Judge Porteous' handling of \n     matters before the Court. While Judge Porteous vehemently \n     denies violating those canons or mishandling matters, \n     noncriminal ethical violations or incorrect decisions have \n     never been found to be a sufficient basis for conviction and \n     removal from office. Such issues simply do not rise to the \n     level of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' as contemplated by \n     the Framers. To the extent that a trial on the Articles in \n     this case is permitted to convert--in contravention of both \n     the Constitution and impeachment precedent--such acts into \n     grounds for removal of an Article III Judge, it will set a \n     new standard. A standard that treads deeply and dangerously \n     into the realm of an independent judiciary that was at the \n     very core of the Framers' vision of three co-equal branches \n     of government.\n       In devising the three branches, the Framers divided the \n     ability to impeach and remove Executive and Judicial Branch \n     officers between the House of Representatives and the Senate. \n     By doing so, the Framers, through the Constitution, empowered \n     the House to allege the standard for impeachment based upon \n     the language of the impeachment clause. But history has shown \n     the power to impeach is not the power to remove. The power to \n     try impeachments and remove officers upon conviction was \n     vested solely in the Senate. It is the Senate--a uniquely \n     deliberative body, free from the passions and prejudices of \n     the majority--that sits in judgment and determines whether a \n     given Article of Impeachment is sufficient, both legally and \n     factually, to justify the removal of an Article III Judge.\n       In striking this careful balance, the Framers made clear \n     that the trial and removal process is not one that should \n     embrace unprecedented or novel impeachments. In vesting the \n     power in the Senate, the Framers' intent was that the process \n     would not be exercised easily or quickly, but carefully and \n     deliberately. The Framers, through the Constitution, \n     positioned the Senate along the path between the possibility \n     of ill-considered and novel uses of the power to impeach and \n     the decision to remove, confident that the Senate would stand \n     as a safeguard against removal when constitutional standards \n     had not been met. The Articles of Impeachment returned by the \n     House are unprecedented, unjustified, and fail to meet the \n     constitutionally required standard. Accordingly, Judge \n     Porteous, in answer, asks the Senate to fulfill its \n     constitutionally mandated role by dismissing the articles or, \n     alternatively, acquitting him of the charges.\n\n                  General Denial of Facts Not Admitted\n\n       Judge Porteous denies each and every material allegation of \n     the four Articles of Impeachment not specifically admitted in \n     this ANSWER.\n\n                               Article I\n\n\n                          ANSWER TO ARTICLE I\n\n       Without waiving his affirmative defenses, Judge Porteous \n     admits that he presided as a United States District Judge \n     over the Lifemark Hospitals of Louisiana, Inc. v. Liljeberg \n     Enterprises litigation and that on October 17, 1996 he denied \n     a motion seeking to recuse him from presiding over the case. \n     Judge Porteous denies that he engaged in any corrupt conduct \n     in connection with his handling of the litigation or in \n     denying the motion for recusal. Judge Porteous denies that he \n     intentionally made any misleading statements during the \n     recusal hearing. Judge Porteous also denies engaging in a \n     corrupt scheme of any sort with Jacob Amato, Jr. and Robert \n     Creely and that he, at any time, deprived the parties or the \n     public of the right to the honest services of his office. \n     Judge Porteous further denies that he engaged in any corrupt \n     conduct after the bench trial in Lifemark Hospitals of \n     Louisiana, Inc. v. Liljeberg Enterprises or at any time while \n     the case was under advisement.\n\n\n                 FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE I\n\n       Article I does not allege an offense that supports the \n     conviction and removal of a sitting Article III United States \n     District Judge under the impeachment clause of the \n     Constitution. Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution \n     provides that the civil officers shall be removed from office \n     only upon ``Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, \n     Bribery or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The charges \n     in the articles against Judge Porteous do not rise to the \n     constitutionally required level of ``high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors.'' Because Article I does not meet the rigorous \n     constitutional standard for conviction and removal, it should \n     be dismissed.\n\n\n                SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE I\n\n       Article I is unconstitutionally vague. No reasonable person \n     could know what specific charges are being leveled against \n     Judge Porteous or what allegations rise to the level of \n     ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' as required by the \n     Constitution. In essence, Article I alleges that Judge \n     Porteous took several judicial actions while presiding as a \n     United States District Judge in Lifemark Hospitals of \n     Louisiana, Inc. v. Liljeberg Enterprises, including failing \n     to grant a recusal motion and failing to disclose certain \n     facts. In doing so, the Article alleges that Judge Porteous \n     ``deprived the parties and the public of the right to the \n     honest services of his office.'' This ``deprivation of the \n     right to honest services'' language is borrowed from Title \n     18, United States Code, Section 1346, a statute that is \n     fraught with vagueness concerns. Indeed, its constitutional \n     viability is currently pending before the United States \n     Supreme Court in a series of cases. See Weyhrauch v. United \n     States, No. 08-1196; Black v. United States, No. 08-876; and \n     Skilling v. United States, No. 08-1394. The inclusion of this \n     standard, as well as the nonspecific allegations regarding \n     the allegedly improper judicial actions taken by Judge \n     Porteous, render Article I unconstitutionally vague.\n       It is a fundamental principle of our law and the \n     Constitution that a person has a right to know what specific \n     charges he is facing. Without such notice, no one can prepare \n     the defense to which every person is entitled. The law and \n     the Constitution also require that the charges provide \n     adequate notice to jurors so they may know the basis for the \n     vote they must make. Without a definite and specific \n     identification of specific ``high Crime and Misdemeanor'' \n     upon which the Article of Impeachment is grounded, a trial \n     becomes a moving target for the accused.\n       Article I fails to provide the required definite and \n     specific identification. As an article of impeachment, it is \n     constitutionally defective and should be dismissed.\n\n\n                 THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE I\n\n       Article I is fatally flawed because it charges multiple \n     instances of allegedly corrupt conduct in a single article. \n     The Constitution provides that ``no person shall be convicted \n     without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members \n     present.'' Senate Rule XXIII provides that ``an article of \n     impeachment shall not be divisible for the purpose of voting \n     thereon at any time during the trial.''\n       Despite these clear pronouncements, the House of \n     Representatives, in Article I, has alleged a series of \n     allegedly wrongful acts. In doing so, the House of \n     Representatives has returned an Article of Impeachment which \n     might permit a Senator to vote for impeachment if he or she \n     finds that Judge Porteous committed even a single allegedly \n     wrongful act, even where two-thirds of the Senators do not \n     agree on which wrongful act was committed. This creates the \n     very real possibility\n\n[[Page S2183]]\n\n     that conviction could occur even though Senators were in wide \n     disagreement as to the alleged wrong committed. The structure \n     of Article I presents the possibility that Judge Porteous \n     could be convicted even though he would have been acquitted \n     if separate votes were taken on each allegedly wrongful acts \n     included in the article. As written, Article I does not \n     require the constitutionally required number of Senators \n     to agree on the specific conduct forming the basis for \n     conviction and removal. By charging multiple wrongs in one \n     article, the House of Representatives has made it \n     impossible for the Senate to comply with the \n     Constitutional mandate that any conviction be by the \n     concurrence of two-thirds of the members. Accordingly, \n     Article I should fail.\n\n\n                FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE I\n\n       Article I was returned by the House of Representatives in \n     violation of Judge Porteous' constitutional rights in that it \n     is based, in part, upon his compelled testimony provided \n     under a grant of immunity. Because the process of \n     impeachment, conviction and removal is a quasi-criminal one \n     and under the circumstances here, Judge Porteous has \n     constitutional rights that are violated by the use of his \n     prior compelled, immunized testimony, Article I must be \n     dismissed. Further, because the immunity grant by Judge Edith \n     Jones, Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals and \n     Chair of the Special Committee of the Judicial Conference of \n     the Fifth Circuit, was not proper under the immunity statute, \n     the compelled testimony was wrongly procured and any Article \n     of Impeachment based upon that testimony must be dismissed.\n\n                               Article II\n\n\n                          ANSWER TO ARTICLE II\n\n       Without waiving his affirmative defenses, Judge Porteous \n     denies that he engaged in a longstanding pattern of corrupt \n     conduct demonstrating his unfitness to serve as a United \n     States District Court Judge as alleged in Article II. Judge \n     Porteous further denies that he improperly set aside or \n     expunged felony convictions for two Marcotte employees. Judge \n     Porteous also denies that he at any time took any action in \n     his capacity as a United States District Judge that related \n     in any way to the Marcottes or their business interests.\n\n\n                FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE II\n\n       Article II does not allege an offense that supports the \n     conviction and removal of a sitting Article III United States \n     District Judge under the impeachment clause of the \n     Constitution. Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution \n     provides that the civil officers shall be removed from office \n     only upon ``Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, \n     Bribery or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The charges \n     in the articles against Judge Porteous do not rise to the \n     constitutionally required level of ``high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors.'' Because Article II does not meet the rigorous \n     constitutional standard for conviction and removal, it should \n     be dismissed.\n\n\n                SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE II\n\n       Article II is unconstitutionally vague. No reasonable \n     person could know what specific charges are being leveled \n     against Judge Porteous or what allegations rise to the level \n     of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' as required by the \n     Constitution. Article II alleges that Judge Porteous engaged \n     in certain corrupt actions prior to his appointment and \n     confirmation to the position of Untied States District Judge. \n     Article II makes no specific allegations concerning actions \n     taken by Judge Porteous while on the federal bench. Indeed, \n     the only allegations concerning Judge Porteous tenure on the \n     federal bench is that he in some unidentified way ``used the \n     power and prestige of his office to assist the Marcottes in \n     forming relationships with State judicial officers and \n     individuals important to the Marcottes' business.'' The \n     vagueness problem here cannot be overstated. It is simply not \n     possible to begin to defend against this type of allegation. \n     It is wholly lacking in any factual basis and clearly fails \n     to frame a set of facts that amount to ``high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors.''\n       As we set forth in the SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO \n     ARTICLE I, it is a fundamental principle of our law and the \n     Constitution that a person has a right to know what specific \n     charges he is facing. Without such notice, no one can prepare \n     the defense to which every person is entitled. The law and \n     the Constitution also require that the charges provide \n     adequate notice to jurors so they may know the basis for the \n     vote they must make. Without a definite and specific \n     identification of specific ``high Crime and Misdemeanor'' \n     upon which the Article of Impeachment is grounded, a trial \n     becomes a moving target for the accused.\n       Article II fails to provide the required definite and \n     specific identification. As an article of impeachment, it is \n     constitutionally defective and should be dismissed.\n\n\n                THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE II\n\n       For the reasons set forth in the THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n     TO ARTICLE I, Article II is constitutionally defective \n     because it charges multiple alleged wrongs in a single \n     article, which makes it impossible for the Senate to comply \n     with the Constitutional mandate that any conviction be by the \n     concurrence of the two-thirds of the members. Accordingly, \n     Article II should fail.\n\n\n                FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE II\n\n       Article II cannot support the conviction and removal of an \n     Article III United States District Judge because the alleged \n     conduct preceded Judge Porteous' service as a United States \n     District Judge. The constitutional impeachment mechanism \n     provides a procedure to remove a judge for the commission of \n     ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' while in federal office. The \n     impeachment precedents do not provide a single example of an \n     Article of Impeachment that has ever been based upon conduct \n     that allegedly occurred prior to the impeached officer's \n     entry into federal office. In contrast, the precedents \n     suggest that while the House of Representatives may have \n     investigated such allegations, that such conduct has never \n     provided the basis for an impeachment and, significantly, the \n     House has, on occasion, refused to take action because the \n     allegations preceded the officer's entry into federal \n     service. Moreover, while Judge Porteous contends that any \n     attempt to use Article III's ``good behaviour'' clause to \n     lower the standard necessary to impeach a federal judge is \n     unsupported by the Constitution's impeachment clause, the \n     House has clearly applied that lower standard in returning \n     the four Articles of Impeachment. To the extent that the \n     House has relied on the ``good behaviour'' clause, that \n     clause states that judges ``shall hold their offices during \n     good behaviour'' and clearly relates to a judge's conduct \n     while in federal judicial office. Because the allegations of \n     Article II relate to a period prior to Judge Porteous taking \n     the federal bench, Article II must be dismissed.\n\n                              Article III\n\n\n                         ANSWER TO ARTICLE III\n\n       Without waiving his affirmative defenses, Judge Porteous \n     denies that he knowingly and intentionally made material \n     false statements and representatives in connection with his \n     personal bankruptcy or that he knowingly and intentionally \n     repeatedly violated a court order in his bankruptcy case.\n\n\n                FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE III\n\n       Article III does not allege an offense that supports the \n     conviction and removal of a sitting Article III United States \n     District Judge under the impeachment clause of the \n     Constitution. Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution \n     provides that the civil officers shall be removed from office \n     only upon ``Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, \n     Bribery or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The charges \n     in the articles against Judge Porteous do not rise to the \n     constitutionally required level of ``high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors.'' Because Article III does not meet the \n     rigorous constitutional standard for conviction and removal, \n     it should be dismissed.\n\n\n               SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE III\n\n       Article III is unconstitutionally vague. No reasonable \n     person could know what specific charges are being leveled \n     against Judge Porteous or what allegations rise to the level \n     of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' as required by the \n     Constitution. In essence, Article III alleges a number of \n     actions taken by Judge Porteous in connection with his \n     personal bankruptcy, but it unclear as to the specific acts \n     are claimed to violate the constitutional standard. Moreover, \n     it is also does not clearly state the specific allegations \n     regarding what transaction Judge Porteous concealed during \n     the bankruptcy process or what new debts he allegedly \n     incurred.\n       As we set forth in the SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO \n     ARTICLE I, it is a fundamental principle of our law and the \n     Constitution that a person has a right to know what specific \n     charges he is facing. Without such notice, no one can prepare \n     the defense to which every person is entitled. The law and \n     the Constitution also require that the charges provide \n     adequate notice to jurors so they may know the basis for the \n     vote they must make. Without a definite and specific \n     identification of specific ``high Crime and Misdemeanor'' \n     upon which the Article of Impeachment is grounded, a trial \n     becomes a moving target for the accused.\n       Article III fails to provide the required definite and \n     specific identification. As an article of impeachment, it is \n     constitutionally defective and should be dismissed.\n\n\n                THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE III\n\n       For the reasons set forth in the THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n     TO ARTICLE I, Article II is constitutionally defective \n     because it charges multiple alleged wrongs in a single \n     article, which makes it impossible for the Senate to comply \n     with the Constitutional mandate that any conviction be by the \n     concurrence of the two-thirds of the members. Accordingly, \n     Article II should fail.\n\n\n               FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE III\n\n       For the reasons set forth in the FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n     TO ARTICLE I, Article III was returned by the House of \n     Representatives in violation of Judge Porteous' \n     constitutional rights in that it is based, in part, upon \n     his compelled testimony provided under a grant of \n     immunity. Because the process of impeachment, conviction \n     and removal is a quasi-criminal one and under the \n     circumstances here, Judge Porteous has constitutional \n     rights that are violated by the use of his prior \n     compelled, immunized testimony, Article 1 must be \n     dismissed. Further, because the immunity grant by Judge \n     Edith Jones, Chief Judge of the Fifth Circuit Court of \n     Appeals and Chair of the Special Committee of the Judicial \n     Conference of the Fifth Circuit, was not proper under the \n     immunity statute, the compelled testimony\n\n[[Page S2184]]\n\n     was wrongly procured and any Article of Impeachment based \n     upon that testimony must be dismissed.\n\n\n                FIFTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE III\n\n       The allegations in Article III do not rise to the level of \n     ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' because they address purely \n     personal conduct that is not criminal. Prior impeachment \n     precedent has never before sought to convict and remove a \n     judge from office based upon personal non-criminal conduct. \n     The very nature of the impeachment process is focused first \n     and foremost upon the official actions of judges. Where \n     allegations in the Articles of Impeachment address non-\n     official personal acts by judges, longstanding precedent has \n     limited ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' to those personal \n     acts that are also indictable offenses. Article III ignores \n     this precedent in seeking to convict and remove Judge \n     Porteous from office for non-official, non-criminal acts. \n     While it is possible that the House of Representatives would \n     claim that the actions taken in relation to the personal \n     bankruptcy were indictable offenses, this claim would \n     conflict with the multi-year investigation of the United \n     States Department of Justice which concluded that prosecution \n     was not warranted in light of the concern that the issues \n     related to the bankruptcy were not material. It would also \n     conflict with the criminal bankruptcy statutes, which require \n     that any alleged false statement not be made simply knowingly \n     or willfully, but fraudulently, before criminal liability may \n     attach to such conduct. In framing Article III, the House of \n     Representatives is seeking to convict and remove a sitting \n     United States District Judge based upon a lowered standard, \n     one that does not constitute ``high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors,'' and one that has never before provided a \n     basis for impeachment, much less conviction and removal from \n     office. Article III of the Articles of Impeachment should be \n     dismissed.\n\n                               Article IV\n\n\n                          ANSWER TO ARTICLE IV\n\n       Without waiving his affirmative defenses, Judge Porteous \n     denies that he knowingly made material false statements in \n     order to obtain the office of United States District Court \n     Judge.\n\n\n                FIRST AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE IV\n\n       Article IV does not allege an offense that supports the \n     conviction and removal of a sitting Article III United States \n     District Judge under the impeachment clause of the \n     Constitution. Article II, Section 4 of the Constitution \n     provides that the civil officers shall be removed from office \n     only upon ``Impeachment for, and Conviction of, Treason, \n     Bribery or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors.'' The charges \n     in the articles against Judge Porteous do not rise to the \n     constitutionally required level of ``high Crimes and \n     Misdemeanors.'' Because Article IV does not meet the rigorous \n     constitutional standard for conviction and removal, it should \n     be dismissed.\n\n\n                SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE IV\n\n       Article IV is unconstitutionally vague. No reasonable \n     person could know what specific charges are being leveled \n     against Judge Porteous or what allegations rise to the level \n     of ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' as required by the \n     Constitution. In essence, Article IV alleges that Judge \n     Porteous gave false answers on various forms that were \n     presented in connection with the background investigation \n     that was used to evaluate his appointment and confirmation as \n     a United States District Judge. However, it is not clear \n     whether Article IV contends that simply providing a single \n     one of the alleged false statements is a ``high Crime or \n     Misdemeanor'' or whether the ``high Crime or Misdemeanor'' is \n     based upon all of the acts alleged, i.e., several alleged \n     false statements and other conduct alleged. Moreover, the \n     nature of the questions on the forms that are the focus of \n     this Article themselves add to the vagueness problem.\n       As we set forth in the SECOND AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO \n     ARTICLE I, it is a fundamental principle of our law and the \n     Constitution that a person has a right to know what specific \n     charges he is facing. Without such notice, no one can prepare \n     the defense to which every person is entitled. The law and \n     the Constitution also require that the charges provide \n     adequate notice to jurors so they may know the basis for the \n     vote they must make. Without a definite and specific \n     identification of specific ``high Crime and Misdemeanor'' \n     upon which the Article of Impeachment is grounded, a trial \n     becomes a moving target for the accused.\n       Article IV fails to provide the required definite and \n     specific identification. As an article of impeachment, it is \n     constitutionally defective and should be dismissed.\n\n\n                THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE IV\n\n       For the reasons set forth in the THIRD AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE \n     TO ARTICLE I, Article IV is constitutionally defective \n     because it charges multiple instances of alleged acts of \n     making false statements in one article, which makes it \n     impossible for the Senate to comply with the Constitutional \n     mandate that any conviction be by the concurrence of the two-\n     thirds of the members. Accordingly, Article IV should fail.\n\n\n                FOURTH AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE TO ARTICLE IV\n\n       Article IV cannot support the conviction and removal of an \n     Article III United States District Judge because the alleged \n     conduct preceded Judge Porteous' service as a United States \n     District Judge. The constitutional impeachment mechanism \n     provides a procedure to remove a judge for the commission of \n     ``high Crimes and Misdemeanors'' while in federal office. The \n     impeachment precedents do not provide a single example of an \n     Article of Impeachment that has ever been based upon conduct \n     that allegedly occurred prior to the impeached officer's \n     entry into federal office. In contrast, the precedents \n     suggest that while the House of Representatives may have \n     investigated such allegations, that such conduct has never \n     provided the basis for an impeachment and, significantly, the \n     House has, on occasion, refused to take action because the \n     allegations preceded the officer's entry into federal \n     service. Moreover, while Judge Porteous contends that any \n     attempt to use Article III's ``good behaviour'' clause to \n     lower the standard necessary to impeach a federal judge is \n     unsupported by the Constitution's impeachment clause, the \n     House has clearly applied that lower standard in returning \n     the four Articles of Impeachment. To the extent that the \n     House has relied on the ``good behaviour'' clause, that \n     clause states that judges ``shall hold their offices during \n     good behaviour'' and clearly relates to a judge's conduct \n     while in federal judicial office. Because the allegations of \n     Article IV relate to a period prior to Judge Porteous taking \n     the federal bench, Article IV must be dismissed.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Richard W.

Mr. President, I wish to extend my personal condolences to \nthose who suffered the two tragedies while we were back home--one here \nin America and one halfway around the world.\n  The mining tragedy in West Virginia hit home for me. It brought back \na lot of memories. When I was less than 1 week old, my dad was working \nin a mine in a place called Chloride, AZ, which was just over the \nColorado River from Searchlight. He and another man were sinking a \nshaft, and in those days you didn't have all the protections you have \ntoday. They had drilled some holes--seven to be exact--and always, when \nthe holes are lit, both miners\n\n[[Page S2185]]\n\ndon't stay there. They leave and one remains to light the hole. So Carl \nMyers, who was working with my dad, went to the next level, as a matter \nof fact, and waited until the holes were lit, and then my dad would \ncome up and meet him and the holes would go off.\n  What happened was that one of the pieces of fuse was defective, and \nit set off one of the holes prematurely. It blew my dad's light out and \nblew one of the soles off his shoe. He was hurt and in a state of \nshock. What the miners did in those days, in a shaft, is they would \nhave a sinking ladder about 10 feet long and they would take it up \nbefore the holes went off and then they would climb out on that ladder. \nMy dad, even though he was hurt, knew he had to get out of that mine \nbecause he knew there were six other holes burning. They were covered \nwith muck. He had to get out of there, so he put the ladder down and \ntried to climb out, but it kept falling over. His mind wasn't working \nwell and he couldn't understand why that was, but the blast had blown \none of the legs off the ladder, so it kept tipping over.\n  The man that was on the next level, knowing how many holes had been \ndrilled and knowing only one had gone off and that there were six more \nto go, in spite of that, came down and helped carry my dad, who was \nmuch bigger than he was, out of that mine. He got a medal for heroism, \nand the incident was written up by the great journalist Lowell Thomas.\n  I can remember as a boy my mother still picking rocks out of my dad's \nback as a result of that blast. In a book I wrote about Searchlight, I \ntalk about a number of the deaths in the mines at Searchlight. My dad \nworked quite a bit at Blossom, and the dad of one of my friends I grew \nup with was killed in that mine. My dad carried him out of that hole. \nSo I have some knowledge about how people feel when these mining \naccidents occur.\n  As I said, this tragedy brought back a lot of memories, and I extend \nmy condolences to all the people of West Virginia, through Governor \nManchin, Senator Byrd, and Senator Rockefeller. I sympathize with the \npeople of West Virginia for their loss.\n  I also extend my condolences to the people of Poland. That plane \ncarried 96 souls--parents, husbands, wives, and friends. It carried \nthat nation's President, its First Lady, its Deputy Foreign Minister, \nlawmakers, their military chief of staff, and so many other military \nand civilian leaders. The tragic loss is unthinkable, and America \ngrieves alongside our friends in Poland, especially when you understand \nwhere they were going and why they were going there--20,000 Poles had \nbeen killed by the Russians even before war on Germany was declared by \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2185-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2185]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              EXPRESSION OF APPRECIATION TO CHAPLAIN BLACK\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, last December, just minutes before the \nSenate passed the health care reform bill that President Obama signed \ninto law last month, my friend, the Republican leader, predicted we \nwould get an earful when we got home, and he was right. Everywhere I \nwent in Nevada, from the two big cities of Reno and Las Vegas, to Elko \nand Carson City and my hometown of Searchlight, Nevadans, young and \nold--people, in general--came up to me and said: Thank you--numerous \npeople, without any exaggeration.\n  One mother told me how grateful she was she could finally cover her \nchild's health care. Her child has juvenile diabetes. Parents such as \nshe told me how grateful they were that they would be able to keep \ntheir kids on their insurance until they are 26 years old. Out-of-work \nNevadans--and there is more than one I would like to acknowledge--\nexplained to me how grateful they were that finally they will be able \nto afford their own health care while they try to find a full-time job.\n  Seniors, individually and in groups, told me how grateful they are \nnow that they will not have to worry about whether they are going to \nhave to split a pill or take a pill because the doughnut hole has been \nfilled. Everyone--every senior citizen in America, every Social \nSecurity recipient--understands what the doughnut hole was and isn't \nanymore.\n  Many small businesses told me that because of the tax cuts this \nCongress passed and our President signed into law because of the health \ncare bill this year, they will be able to afford health insurance for \nthe first time in their lives for their employees--24,000 of those \nsmall businesses in Nevada.\n  These people haven't been fooled by the opposition's strategy of \nmyths and misinformation. They aren't frightened by the campaign of \nfear and false cries of socialism.\n  I know I am not the only one who got an earful of thanks from \nconstituents whose lives are changing for the better because of this \nhistoric reform. I also heard one other thing everywhere I went: This \nlaw should not be repealed.\n  A week ago this Sunday, I returned from Salt Lake City to Las Vegas, \nand the front page of the Salt Lake Tribune had a story, which I will \nparaphrase, but basically it said that those people in Utah are no \nlonger talking about repealing the bill; they are talking about trying \nto improve the bill.\n  It is hard for people to talk about repealing this bill which gives \nsuch immediate benefits to the American people. It is difficult to try \nto have someone say I would like this bill repealed because I do not \nagree with the $1.3 trillion by which this legislation is going to \nreduce the debt of this country in the second 10 years--$142 billion in \nthe first 10 years.\n  I explained to people at home, if you have a fight in a ring, you \nhave a referee, a referee there to be as fair as they can to make sure \nit is a fair fight. In this health care debate, we had such an entity \nin the ring with us as we battled, Democrats and Republicans. It was \nset up many years ago, this referee; it was called the Congressional \nBudget Office. It is not run by Republicans or Democrats. It is there \nto be fair. It is their determination this legislation over the first \n10 years would save $142 billion, the second 10 years would reduce the \ndebt by a further $1.3 trillion.\n  People all over America, and Nevadans, now have more control than \never over their health, more protection from insurance companies, and \nmore opportunity than ever before to have a healthy life.\n  As it relates to the economy, Nevadans know that health reform is \neconomic reform. It will save families money in the short run and save \nour country money in the long run. But they also know we have to do \nmore. We have to make more investments today to help our economy run \nbetter tomorrow. One of the best ways to do that is by creating green \njobs, and that has worked so well, jobs right here at home that can \nnever be outsourced, jobs that strengthen our Nation's economic, \nenvironmental and national safety and security.\n  Boulder City is a city in Nevada. It was built because of the Boulder \nDam, now Hoover Dam. It is a great and beautiful little city. It is the \nonly city in Nevada that has a growth ordinance. But they have also \nbeen very farsighted. I extend my appreciation to Mayor Tobler and all \nthe city council. They have set up a zone where they are creating green \njobs, and lots of green jobs. I went there. It is between Railroad Pass \nand Searchlight and part of it is Boulder City. It was amazing what we \nsaw there. For acre after acre, workers, men and women in their hard \nhats and their orange vests, were placing 1 million solar panels in \nplace--1 million in the desert to produce enough electricity for about \n45,000 homes. It is\n\n[[Page S2186]]\n\nthe largest plant of its type in the world. There may be one in Spain \nthat may be a tiny bit bigger, but let's assume it is not. It is a huge \nplant. We have this going on all over Nevada as a result of the \neconomic recovery package and tax incentives we give people to build \ngreen energy--clean energy jobs. That vast array in the middle of the \ndesert, dotted by countless hard hats worn by people working very hard, \nwas truly an impressive sight.\n  This afternoon at 5:30 we are going on to something extremely \nimportant, especially for people who have been struggling in America. \nWe need to continue supporting projects such as, of course, the solar \nplant in Boulder City and continue moving toward a clean energy \neconomy. They demand critical long-term investments and we have a long \nway to go. But there are additional things we can do right now this \nafternoon at 5:30 to help millions of hard-working Nevadans and \nAmericans struggling to find work. These are not deadbeats; these are \nnot bums; these are people who are out of work and have been out of \nwork for a long time and have struggled to find a job. If we pass this \nemergency extension of unemployment and health benefits, we can give \nthose unemployed families the help they need to put food on the table \nor go to the doctor.\n  Some on the other side flatly refuse to do so. To them it doesn't \nmatter that these people lost their jobs through no fault of their own \nor that they are desperate to find a new full-time job and that this is \nan emergency, not only for our families but for our country. Many of \nthose who oppose this extension voted to give tax breaks to rich chief \nexecutive officers who shipped American jobs overseas. Now that their \nconstituents are trying to find jobs of their own, I hope they will \nconsider giving them at least the short-term help they need and need \ncritically. If Republicans continue blocking unemployment assistance, 1 \nmillion Americans will lose that lifeline by the end of this month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2186-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, while we were in recess, the people of \nWest Virginia experienced a very difficult mine safety experience. Our \nneighbors in West Virginia, like Kentucky, are big coal producers. We \nhave had our share, in the Commonwealth of Kentucky, over the years of \nmining disasters, and our hearts and prayers go out to our neighbors in \nWest Virginia as they attempt to recover from the latest tragedy in \nwhat is obviously a very dangerous profession, and that is mining of \ncoal.\n\n\n                             Polish Tragedy\n\n  We also witnessed a great tragedy overseas, the death of the Polish \nPresident Lech Kaczynski, his wife, and so many other Polish leaders \nover the weekend. This is obviously a terrible tragedy for Poland and a \ngreat loss for us as well. Poland is a great friend of the United \nStates and we send our heartfelt condolences and every expression of \nsolidarity to the Polish people and the families of the dead at this \nvery difficult time.\n\n\n                       Long-Term Fiscal Security\n\n  Turning back to home now, I want to welcome everybody back. I hope \neveryone had a restful and productive break. My constituents have never \nbeen shy about sharing their views on what we are doing here in \nWashington. These past 2 weeks were no different. To be perfectly \nblunt: Kentuckians are concerned about the direction of our country. \nThey are overwhelmingly opposed to the health spending bill, what it \nwill cost, and the process used to pass it. And more generally, \nKentuckians, and Americans everywhere, are concerned about the \nconsequences of the endless borrowing and spending here in Washington.\n  Americans worry that we are on the cusp or maybe even past the cusp \nof a debt crisis. And they are frustrated. They don't understand how \nlawmakers in Washington can ignore this looming disaster after just \nnarrowly averting the last one. Americans know that this is one crisis \nno bailout could ever prevent. We could borrow a trillion dollars to \ndig the country out of a mess that was created on Wall Street, but once \nthe government maxes out its own credit card, there is nowhere to \nturn--except to the citizens themselves.\n  So the time to act is now. The deficit this year alone is projected \nto be more than $1.4 trillion. Social Security recently started paying \nout more than it is taking in. Interest payments alone on the national \ndebt are approaching $1 trillion a year. Interest rates on mortgages, \nstudent loans, and small business loans are threatening to rise. There \nis no reason to think the problems we are seeing in Europe won't strike \nhere at home if we do nothing to reverse current trends.\n  Those who continue to use the taxpayer credit card with reckless \nabandon threaten not only our chances of a quick recovery and the jobs \nit would create but also the nation's long-term fiscal security--and a \nsafety net that has been built up over the decades precisely for \nmoments like this. Democrats can no longer hide behind the argument of \ngood intentions when the results threaten our very stability as a \nnation.\n  We must get a handle on the deficit and the debt. This is the issue \nthat will focus our attention in the weeks and months ahead. And over \nthe coming weeks, I assure you, Republicans will continue to give our \ncolleagues across the aisle and our President the opportunity to live \nup to the President's commitment on February 13: ``Now, Congress will \nhave to pay for what it spends, just like everybody else.'' Americans \nwill not tolerate another crisis of Washington's making.\n\n\n                         Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Another issue we will be focused on, of course, is the Supreme Court. \nJustice Stevens' decision last week to retire from the Court gives us \nanother opportunity to discuss the proper role of our Federal courts \nand our Constitution.\n  Last year, during the debate over Justice Sotomayor's nomination, \nAmericans saw the Senate debate and discuss the President's ``empathy'' \nstandard for judicial appointments. At the end of that debate, most \nAmericans--and indeed Justice Sotomayor herself, along with Senators of \nthe President's own party--rejected that standard and agreed with \nRepublicans that judges ought to apply the law, not their own feelings \nand personal preferences.\n  We are hopeful that this time around the President will select \nsomeone with extensive real-world legal experience and a demonstrated \ncommitment to the rule of law. That is what Americans expect from their \njudges, whether it is small claims court or the Supreme Court. They do \nnot expect us to select judges based upon whose side the judge is on, \nas one Democrat on the Judiciary Committee once suggested.\n  Once the President submits his nominee, Senate Republicans will \ndiligently review his or her record so the American people can be \nconfident that they will be able to fulfill the judicial oath; namely, \nto administer ``justice without respect to persons and to do right by \nthe poor and by the rich.'' I am hopeful that at the end of the day, I \nand other Republicans will be convinced that the nominee will be able \nto do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2186-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I join my colleagues in expressing my \nsorrow to the families of West Virginia for the coal miners who were \nlost in that disaster. Illinois is a coal mining State. Throughout our \nhistory we have had terrible mine disasters and the loss of\n\n[[Page S2187]]\n\nlife. I hope we can not only bring them consolation but that we can \nlearn from this disaster. When we find that only a small portion of the \nfines that have been imposed on coal companies for safety violations \nhave been paid, it clearly calls for a much more aggressive approach by \nour Federal Government and the agencies that are entrusted with the \nresponsibility of protecting the safety of these coal miners. We can do \nbetter.\n  One of the saddest comments, but I am afraid true comments, came from \nmy colleague Senator Jay Rockefeller, who said these tragedies are \nlikely to occur again no matter how much we do.\n  Congressman Nick Rahall said: unfortunately, reform, when it comes to \ncoal mine safety, is written in the blood of dead coal miners. But let \nus use their lives as an inspiration to do a better job of writing the \nlaws and enforcing the laws so that the men and women who work in this \nperilous trade have the protection of their government.\n  Second, I will be speaking at length at a later time, but I want to \njoin with those who expressed their sorrow over the death of the \nPresident and First Lady of Poland and so many of the government \nleaders. It is said there are more Polish Americans living in Chicago, \nIL, than in any other city than Warsaw, Poland. We have a proud, strong \nPolish population in and around the city of Chicago. They have been \nthrough much in their lives. Many of them came to this country to \nescape the horrors of World War II. They have built their families, \ntheir neighborhoods, their churches, their parishes--they have built \nour city, the city of Chicago, and many others in my State. They were \nin grief and mourning as they gathered over the weekend at a Polish \ncemetery to express their sorrow for the loss of their President and \nFirst Lady.\n  The people of Poland have been inspired by faith and family in times \nof adversity. They will be again. I will have more remarks to make on \nthat subject at a later point.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  The minority leader, Senator McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, \nbefore we left, said, wait until you go home and listen to people about \nhealth care reform.\n  So I did. I went all across Illinois, and I spent 2 weeks. I went \nright into the teeth of the most conservative parts of Illinois, held \nmeetings, answered questions, and by and large people had some \nimpressions of what the bill did but did not know the details on what \nit was going to do and how it was going to change their lives.\n  I talked to them about the fact that there are literally people \nworking today in our State of Illinois--1.4 million of them--without \nhealth insurance. Many times, these people and their children have \nlived a whole life without health insurance.\n  On the Senate floor, I spoke of a lady I met in a Hampton Inn in \nMarion, IL. Her name is Judy. What a sweetheart. She is there every \nmorning cleaning off the tables, greeting everyone with a smile. She \nhas become my buddy because we stop there, and we talk about southern \nIllinois and what is going on. On the last trip there, I talked to her \nabout health care reform. She was worried about it.\n  What is it going to do to me? Is it going to mandate that I buy \nhealth insurance? I do not make a lot of money, Senator.\n  I said: Do you have health insurance?\n  She said: Senator, come on. I have never had health insurance in my \nlife. I am a waitress.\n  Never had health insurance in her life.\n  How old are you, Judy?\n  Fifty-nine.\n  Never had health insurance.\n  Never, she said. When you saved up enough money, you went to the \ndoctor and you had to make do.\n  Well, how is your health, I asked her.\n  She said: Well, I have high blood sugar.\n  I said: How high?\n  She said: I do not know. I cannot get to the doctor regularly, but \nwhen it gets very bad, I get checked out. He says: I have to do \nsomething about it.\n  That is what she told me on the last trip. When I saw her on this \ntrip, I almost did not recognize her. She had dropped 25 pounds, and \nshe looked pretty weak. But she came to me and she said: Well, my blood \nsugar is acting up again. I have lost 25 pounds. But I never missed a \nday of work. I came in here every day.\n  Judy would be covered by this health care reform bill. She will have \nhealth insurance for the first time in her life, under Medicaid. She \nwill be able to be taken care of. She will have a doctor looking at her \nblood sugar to make sure she does not go blind or lose a limb. That is \nwhat this health care reform bill does.\n  Before we left town, I had one of my staff call a local doctor and \nask him, as a personal favor, to see her. He said he would. I thanked \nhim so much for doing that. I hope he can help her along.\n  As we left town, though, I went by Carbondale, IL, home of Southern \nIllinois University. There is a baseball coach there named Danny \nCallahan. I have known him since he was 6 years old. He is a great guy; \nprobably in his forties now; two or three kids. He was diagnosed with \nmelanoma 6 or 8 years ago from a sunburn he got as a baseball player, \nand it had spread. He has been battling cancer ever since. He has had \ntumors removed, his lower jaw removed, and he is trying to hang on. His \ndoctor came up with a therapy for him, a cancer therapy for him, that \nworks, that slows down the progress of the cancer. When they turned in \nthe bill for the cancer therapy, the health insurance company said: No, \nwe do not cover that. Well, it cost $14,000 a month. Danny cannot \nafford that. He has been in court in a battle with this health \ninsurance company to get the drugs his doctor wants to give him to save \nhis life. Sadly, that battle still goes on.\n  The health reform bill we passed will give Danny and his family and \nothers like him a fighting chance against health insurance companies. \nSo when I hear the Republican leader come to the floor and tell us we \nare going to catch this firestorm of opposition, I think of these \ncases, of those people, and how, if we did nothing, their lives could \nnot be as good. In fact, some of them may suffer as a result of the \ncurrent system and the law.\n  We are going to have a vote this afternoon, for those who follow the \nSenate. It is a vote about unemployment benefits. You see, many of us \nbelieve we are in an economic emergency in this country with about 8 \nmillion people unemployed, another 6 million under long-term \nunemployment--almost 15 million Americans unemployed, looking for work. \nFor some of them, we have been extending unemployment benefits so they \ncan get by. It is about $300 a week. For families who have been going \nthrough this for a long time, with unemployment that has lasted over a \nyear, we know what they have been through. They have lost their life \nsavings, and they have nowhere to turn. So on an emergency basis, we \nhave been extending unemployment benefits and health insurance coverage \nfor the unemployed in this country. We tried to do it again before we \nleft for this 2-week Easter break, and there was an objection from the \nRepublican side of the aisle. Senator Coburn of Oklahoma has objected. \nWhat it means is that as of 1 week ago, we started cutting people off \nfrom coverage for unemployment benefits in America because of the \nobjection of one Senator. How many people? Over 200,000 lost their \nunemployment benefits across America in the first week; another 200,000 \nwill lose their benefits this week; and by the end of the month, 1 \nmillion Americans will lose their unemployment benefits because 1 \nSenator objected and they do not want to bring this to a vote.\n  If you want to know why a Senator who is, like myself, drawing a \npaycheck and living a pretty comfortable life would want to cut off \nunemployment benefits for those who are struggling, the argument was \nmentioned earlier by the Republican leader: It is time to fight the \ndeficit. Let's fight the deficit when it comes to unemployment benefits \nin America. That is the stand they are taking. It is interesting to me \nthat many of these same Senators thought nothing of an $800 billion \nbailout for the banks when they were in trouble. That was not paid for. \nMr. President, $800 billion for banks--oh, we have to do that--but when \nit comes to helping the unemployed in this country, oh, that is going \nto break the bank. When are we ever going to learn?\n\n[[Page S2188]]\n\n  I am getting a little tired of being preached to by the other said of \nthe aisle about fiscal conservatism. It was their President, the last \nPresident, who more than doubled the national debt in this country, \nfrom $5 trillion to $12 trillion. It was under their watch that we \nengaged in two wars and did not pay for any of it, added it to the \nnational debt. It was under their watch that they called for tax breaks \nfor the wealthiest people in America in the midst of a war and added it \ndirectly to the debt. Now when we come to the floor and say, for \ngoodness' sake, give the unemployed in this country the basics of life \nto get by, they say we cannot afford it; we have this deficit. When it \ncame to the bank bailout, we did not hear a word about the deficit. \nWhen it came to paying for these wars, which we did not do, we did not \nhear these deficit hawks. When it came to a prescription drug benefit \nthat cost $400 billion, they did not pay for it. The list goes on.\n  I look at my State and think, 16,000 people in Illinois lost their \nhealth insurance because 1 Republican Senator objected; 2,600 from his \nhome State of Oklahoma. And the number grows by the week. What are we \ngoing to do about this? They want to pay for this by taking the money \nout of programs we are going to use to put people to work, taking the \nmoney away from projects that are going to be built across America to \nput construction workers back to work. Construction trades have one of \nthe highest unemployment rates in America, over 25 percent. They are \ntalking about cutting the money from the projects to pay for \nunemployment benefits. That is not going to bring us out of the \nrecession; it is going to create more unemployment in the process. That \nis what this debate is all about.\n  There are ways we can address this deficit, and should. There is a \nPresidential commission which I am going to serve on with a number of \nRepublicans and Democrats. It will not be easy. But why in the world do \nwe want to fight this battle today on the backs of those who are \nunemployed and losing their benefits? It literally means that thousands \nacross America are going to have to do without.\n  What do you do when you have exhausted your savings, you have no job, \nyou are about to lose your home, and it is a real question about \nwhether you can keep going down to the food pantry or the soup kitchen? \nIf you don't think that is happening, check out your hometown. That is \nexactly what is happening. The Republican answer is, cut off the \nbenefits and tell them we have to cut the projects to build the roads, \nto build the bridges, and make more unemployment in the construction \ntrade sector in order to pay for this. That, to me, is not a good \napproach. It is not a humane approach. If we can just get as much \ncompassion from the other side of the aisle for unemployed workers as \nwe had for bank bailouts, we would have a chance of feeding those \npeople and keeping their families together during one of the worst \neconomic turns we have seen in America.\n  The vote later on today--we will need 60 votes in order to continue \nto move forward on unemployment benefits. We do not have those votes on \nthis side of the aisle. We will need Republican votes. The last time we \ndealt with this a month or so ago, a number of Republicans stepped \nforward and helped. I hope we do the same this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2188-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2188-S2189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              JOBS IMPACT\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, last week I traveled around my State of \nArizona to large towns and small, and I heard from many of my \nconstituents. Arizonians have very serious concerns about what is \nhappening here in Washington. They are worried about the direction in \nwhich our country has moved and about the kind of Nation their kids and \ntheir grandkids will inherit. They are unhappy about the tremendous \nlevels of spending and debt and about how new taxes and regulations \nthreaten jobs and our economy. It is not an overstatement to say that \npeople are outraged about what they perceive as irresponsible behavior \nin Washington. Many are frustrated because they feel as if they have \nlost control of their government. Today, I wish to focus on three \nspecific concerns I heard, and they all relate to how taxes and \nregulations are impacting jobs in my home State.\n  First is the health spending bill. If anyone thinks the American \npeople will have forgotten about this in a few months, I can assure you \nthey will not have. They are overwhelmingly opposed to this law, and \nthey are frustrated that it was passed despite widespread opposition. \nThey are upset about the high cost, the new taxes, the massive \nregulations, and the manner in which it was passed.\n  Arizona's employers and the unemployed workers are both affected by \nthe new taxes and mandates in the bill that will prevent hiring. How? \nWell, many small business owners in Arizona are wondering how they are \nsupposed to hire new employees when they are about to be slapped with a \nnew payroll tax. Of course, a payroll tax is a direct tax on hiring.\n  Arizona employers with more than 50 workers face a second problem: \nthey will face steep fines if they do not comply with the new mandate \nthat they provide health insurance to all of their employees. It is \nanother disincentive to create a job or even to retain current \nemployees.\n  The refrain I heard from employers and other Arizonians over and over \nagain is: You have to repeal this bill. And I agree.\n  The second concern I heard a lot about was unemployment insurance and \nits impact on jobs. I will discuss in just a moment the concern the \nemployers have about their share of the expense of unemployment \ninsurance. But first of all, let me address comments just made by my \ncolleague from Illinois, who suggested that Republicans wanted to leave \npeople who are unemployed out in the lurch, that we did not support \nextending unemployment benefits. That, of course, is not true. I voted \nfor every extension of benefits, as have the majority of my colleagues. \nThe question is, Who should pay for the extension? My colleague \nsuggests that it is not a question of who but whether it should be paid \nfor. It is said over and over again: The question is whether it should \nbe paid for. Well, it is not a matter of whether. It will have to be \npaid for. That is to say, we are borrowing the money. We have to pay \nthat money back. It is a question of whether we pay for it or we simply \nsay: Put it on the tab for our kids and our grandkids to pay for it.\n  So the question is, to extend unemployment benefits again to folks \nalongside us, who have the misfortune of having lost their job, until \nthey can get another job, who is going to pay to extend their \nunemployment benefits? It seems to me that is an obligation of this \ngeneration.\n  My kids and grandkids are going to have plenty to worry about in \ntheir generations. They will probably face the prospect of some \nunemployment, too, and they are probably going to have to extend \nunemployment benefits, and somebody will have to pay for that. The \nquestion is, Who? Are we going to make them pay not only for what \nhappens on their watch but also what happened on our watch that we were \nnot able to pay for?\n  That is the question: Are we able to? To extend these benefits for \nthe period of time we were taking about just before the recess was $9.5 \nbillion. And I don't think one could contend that somewhere in the \nFederal budget we can't find $9.5 billion over the course of the year \nwhich could be used to pay for these benefits. If they are a top \npriority, then that is what should be used to pay for the benefits. It \nis a 30-day period of time.\n  Interestingly, during the debate before the Easter recess, we \nactually had an agreement for about 45 minutes in this Chamber where \nRepublicans and Democrats alike agreed that to ensure there would not \nbe a hiatus where benefits would not be extended--and by the way, the \nphysicians would be reimbursed for the care they provide to Medicare \npatients--we agreed on a set of revenue measures that would pay for a \nweek of these benefits so that there would be no period of time that \nthere would be a hiatus, that they would not be paid for. But someone \nfrom the other side had to call the Speaker of the House to make sure \nthat was OK with the House of Representatives.\n  I am told it was the Speaker who said: No, we will not pay for the \nextension of benefits. We will not do that.\n\n[[Page S2189]]\n\n  It is not a question of whether we are for extending unemployment \nbenefits. It is not a question of whether they have to be paid for. It \nis a question of who pays for them. For my money, if we can't find $9.5 \nbillion somewhere in this government and say it is a higher priority to \nextend unemployment benefits and pay for it than whatever that money is \nused for, then we are not doing our jobs.\n  My colleague from Illinois suggested that Republicans were \nresponsible for taking us to war and not paying for it. That needs to \nbe responded to. This body voted to go to war. This body supports the \ntroops who are fighting. I assume this body wants to pay them and to \nbuy them the appropriate equipment and that is a top priority of our \ngovernment. Under the Constitution, the first obligation of government \nis to protect its citizens. That is the No. 1 priority. We have to \nspend that money. There are other priorities, but there comes a point \nwhen we have to begin setting priorities and say to go to war, we have \nto do that. That has to be paid for. To do this and this and this, that \nhas to be paid for. But at a certain point in time, we are entitled to \nask: Now that we have run out of money, do we want to keep spending or \ndo we find a way for this generation to pay for that spending? That is \nwhat we are talking about with the extension of unemployment benefits.\n  Of course, they need to be extended. We will support that. The \nquestion will be, will my colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nsupport finding the funds to offset the cost.\n  This is not without cost. The Coalition of Arizona Business \nOrganizations reinforced the point in a recent letter to my office. \nThey pointed out: The Arizona Department of Economic Security estimates \nthat my State will have to borrow $300 to $400 million from the U.S. \nDepartment of Labor between 2010 and 2013 to keep the unemployment fund \nsolvent so they can continue to make payments to beneficiaries.\n  To make matters more difficult, Arizona employers have already been \nhit with an average increase of 50 percent in unemployment insurance \ntaxes. This increase has occurred at the very time that businesses are \ntrying to recover. Of course, it can delay economic recovery, and more \nhiring for businesses the more they have to pay. The message I got from \nsmall businesses was, if you want them to start hiring, Congress needs \nto waive the Federal Unemployment Tax Act penalties, also known as \nFUTA.\n  This is a tax that currently averages $56 per employee. But if \nArizona were to fail to repay the money the State has borrowed from the \nFederal Government, it could rise as high as $308 per employee. \nObviously, that does not portend more hiring, and it is not what \nemployers need.\n  The third and final concern relates to lending. Senator McCain and I \nmet with representatives of some of Arizona's smaller banks, community \nbanks. They are being crushed because regulators have been forcing them \nto raise more capital than they are required to hold, and that \nundermines economic recovery because they then have less money to lend.\n  In addition, regulatory guidelines, especially on commercial real \nestate lending, are hindering new loans as well as the refinancing of \nexisting loans, and existing regulations are discouraging banks from \nworking with borrowers to avoid foreclosure. These banks are being \nforced to increase capital in an environment in which capital is very \nscarce for community banks. A more sensible course would be having \nbanks retain more capital when times are good and easing up on those \nrequirements when times are bad.\n  The effect of the bank regulators' actions is not just denial of \nloans to those who should not get them--and there are some who should \nnot be refinanced--but even to more creditworthy individuals and \nbusinesses. As a result, businesses can't invest and grow, which is \nwhat they need to do to create jobs and improve the economy.\n  The bottom line is a lot of things Washington is doing have hurt \nsmall businesses, the engines of job creation. Americans are not happy \nabout this. Jobs should be our No. 1 priority. Congress has the tools \nto create a better environment for job creation. I am not talking about \nlabeling every spending bill that comes up as a jobs bill. It means \nlistening to what job creators are saying, not punishing them with a \ntidal wave of new taxes and regulations.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the American people are asking: \nWhy can't those guys get together up there and get something done? They \nare asking: Whatever happened to common sense? They say: People are out \nof work. Why can't you extend their unemployment benefits? All of this \nis what the vast majority of the American people are saying. Yet we \nallowed, over 2 weeks ago, unemployment compensation to cease for \ncertain people hurting in this country. It is important for us now to \ntemporarily extend unemployment benefits, as well as the ability for \nsomeone who is out of work to continue their health insurance coverage \nthrough what is known as the COBRA program. These important programs \nexpired. We are going to have a procedural vote later today.\n  As is typical in the Senate, we don't get to the actual, substantive \nvote today. We vote on a motion to proceed, and we have to cut off \ndebate with a motion to cut off debate, called a motion for cloture, \njust to get to the motion to proceed to get to the bill. But that is \nwhat has taken place today. We will get it done. We will use the better \npart of this week going through all of this parliamentary falderal. \nWhen they call the final roll, we will get it extended.\n  But why can't we get together? Why did one Senator, over 2 weeks ago, \nhold up the whole works on something so obvious? Folks are hurting in \nmost of the country. They certainly are in my State. Over 40 percent of \nFlorida homeowners are under water on their mortgage. The banks are \npulling back on credit to small businesses. When you get right down to \nit, the blame for failing to temporarily extend this eleemosynary help, \nthis commonsense help to people who are hurting, falls solely at the \nfeet of the Congress because we couldn't get it together, through our \nparliamentary rules.\n  Our people are hurting. It is our responsibility to extend these \nprograms to provide some little pittance for people who can't get work \nand financially have a desperate need. Unfortunately, for many \nAmericans these benefits are the only thing keeping food on the table \nas they struggle to find a job and make financial ends meet.\n  I certainly hope we are not going to let these programs lapse again. \nThere are encouraging signs in the economy, but unemployment always \nlags the recovery of other parts of the economy. Therefore, we need to \ngive some little measure of stability to these people, these poor \nfamilies out of work, instead of us continuing to have partisan \ngamesmanship that we have seen so often over the course of the last \ncouple months.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2189-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2189-S2190]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FINANCIAL REFORM\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, after the extension of \nunemployment benefits is accomplished--and we will get it done--we will \ntake on financial reform. Remember back, the failure of Lehman Brothers \nand the near collapse of our financial system and, as a result, the \npassage of $700 billion of taxpayer money to bail out Wall Street? Back \nin the fall of 2008, the break down in our financial system fueled one \nof the worst economic downturns since the early part of the last \ncentury. The stock market plunged. The credit and capital markets \nfroze, and real economic activity took a nosedive.\n  While we are seeing some slight improvement in both the markets and \nthe economy as a whole, too many people remain unemployed and \nunderemployed. In Florida, the unemployment rate has surpassed 12 \npercent. The unemployment rate in Florida is now the sixth highest in \nthe country. Since the crisis began in the fall of 2008, a lot has \nhappened. We elected a new President. We passed an economic\n\n[[Page S2190]]\n\nrecovery bill. We passed health reform. We passed an enhanced home \nbuyer tax credit. We passed several measures of tax relief for small \nbusinesses. But there is one thing we have yet to do that is at the top \nof the list; that is, to try to help clean up Wall Street and our \nexcesses in the financial system. We owe it to taxpayers so they do not \nface another $700 billion bailout in the future. Never again should we \nuse taxpayer money to bail out reckless and freewheeling Wall Street \nbankers.\n  Our colleagues on the Banking Committee have put forth one proposal. \nIt includes a new consumer financial watchdog. It also includes new \nrules for the regulation of derivatives--those things that have fancy \nnames such as credit default swaps, which are insurance policies on \nlosses that you would have in other investments. Listen to what one of \nthe richest people in the world, the sage of Omaha, Warren Buffett, \nsays. He refers to all of those very clever financial instruments as \n``financial weapons of mass destruction.'' That is Warren Buffett. If \nthere is one lesson from the former Goliath insurance company, AIG, it \nis that we better get serious about regulating derivatives.\n  The Banking Committee bill includes new rules for liquidating large \nfinancial institutions when they become insolvent. It tightens rules \nrelated to capital requirements, liquidity, and the use of leverage. \nBut when the Banking Committee bill comes to the floor, we must \nstrengthen and improve the legislation to rein in the greed that ran \namok, that nearly brought down our entire financial system altogether. \nOf course, we can expect a vast army of lobbyists who will descend to \nprotect various financial fiefdoms from these new transparency and \naccountability rules.\n  I will offer a number of amendments on the floor. I want to mention \none today, the Wall Street Compensation Reform Act. This bill I have \nalready introduced, and which I will offer as an amendment, hopefully \nwill restore some sanity and common sense to executive pay practices on \nWall Street.\n  The legislation is simple. It encourages large banks and financial \ninstitutions to adopt widely accepted compensation practices. Banks \nthat fail to adopt those standards would lose the benefit of certain \ntax deductions. They could no longer deduct the large compensation \npayments they make to highly paid employees.\n  I have read with astonishment the recent reports that Wall Street \nbanks continue to pay outlandish bonuses to undeserving executives. \nMany of these institutions--and this is what gets your blood pressure \ngoing up--are still living on taxpayer-funded life support.\n  In most business professions, executive pay will follow performance. \nManagers and executives usually are rewarded for creating lasting \nvalue. Unsuccessful managers and executives are shown the door. But \napparently these basic commonsense principles have been lost on a lot \nof the Wall Street firms. This year, Wall Street bonuses were in the \nrange of $150 billion. Eighteen months after the fall of Lehman \nBrothers, it is back to business as usual for the major banks.\n  We have been here before. We had the same debate last spring when AIG \npaid those absurd bonuses to the financial traders who managed one \nmajor accomplishment: They drove their company into the ground. \nAlthough we had lots of legislation introduced, Congress again failed \nto act. The army of lobbyists descended to make sure that was the case, \nand here we are again.\n  I daresay there is almost a unanimous recognition that poorly crafted \nexecutive pay practices at major financial institutions contributed to \nthe near collapse of the financial system--what ultimately brought \nabout the $700 billion taxpayer-funded bailout.\n  The general counsel of the Federal Reserve Board has testified that \ncompensation practices in the banking sector were a contributing cause \nto the crisis. In January, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation \nfound that ``excessive and imprudent risk taking remains a contributing \nfactor in financial institution failures and losses to the Deposit \nInsurance Fund.''\n  Current pay practices encourage excessive risk taking because short-\nterm gains are heavily rewarded even if they are unsustainable. The \nnegative consequences of severe losses in a company are often \nexternalized and shifted to the shareholders or to the public.\n  The Federal safety net for financial institutions encourages traders \nand executives to take unnecessary risks. The most obvious example is \nthe $700 billion Wall Street bailout. Executives who should have left \nwithout their shirts instead left with golden parachutes.\n  Real and meaningful financial reform must include changes to the \nexisting compensation culture in the finance industry. And, oh, are we \ngoing to get resistance as we put forward this idea.\n  Under the amendment I am going to offer, major banks and financial \ninstitutions could only deduct their large executive compensation \npayments if the pay complies with rules that focus on rewarding long-\nterm performance. The principles were developed by the Financial \nStability Board, the council of major central banks. The Federal \nReserve was instrumental in developing these compensation principles.\n  Under the amendment I will offer, tax deductions for major banks and \nfinancial institutions are going to be conditioned on the following: \ncompensation payments over $1 million must be performance based and at \nleast half of the performance-based compensation must vest over an \nextended period of 5 years or more. This is going to tie compensation \nnot only to performance but to long-term performance.\n  Another part of this amendment requires that, for executives at \npublic companies, at least half of the performance-based compensation \nmust be paid in employer stock. Compensation agreements for top \nexecutives must include a claw-back provision that retracts the \ndeferred compensation in the event of ethical misconduct. Also in the \namendment, compensation agreements must prohibit employees from \nengaging in personal hedging strategies, such as compensation \ninsurance, that undermine the very risk alignment principles we are \ncreating.\n  This amendment creates a new and meaningful executive compensation \ndisclosure requirement in order to empower the company's shareholders \nand the company's investors to hold banks accountable for what they pay \ntheir senior executives.\n  The special interests certainly are going to argue that Congress \nshould not get involved in compensation decisions. They are going to \nsay the private marketplace knows best. They are going to argue if \nCongress passes measures like this, Wall Street is going to pack up its \nbags and move to greener pastures abroad.\n  Unfortunately, right now, what the market knows is that big, short-\nterm gains lead to big bonuses, and big losses lead to taxpayer-funded \nbailouts. Enough of this. We are going to have the opportunity to take \nreal steps to reform compensation practices. It is my hope--perhaps \nnaively so--that the Senate would unanimously approve this concept. It \nwill not be unanimous, but I believe we can get 60 votes to break a \nfilibuster, and I think we can pass it.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 4851, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to H.R. 4851, an act to provide a \n     temporary extension of certain programs, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, it has been 2 weeks since we last spoke on \nthe floor on this issue. There has been a lot written in the press and \na lot of things that have been said. I will reiterate what I said \nearlier in that debate before we took an inappropriate spring break, \nand that is the fact that everybody thinks those who are unemployed and \nare eligible should be getting unemployment checks. That is not a \npartisan issue. It is a fact we want to support those who need our help \nright now.\n  The real question, however, is what will we do to make sure that \neffort is an effort that has some real meaning behind it and that these \nare not hollow words. The debate around here becomes partisan and \nlabels get applied, and I admit that I am partisan--but not from a \nparty standpoint; I am partisan for our children.\n  The question isn't whether we should make sure that unemployment \nbenefits are there. The question isn't whether people can get health \ninsurance under COBRA. The question isn't whether we ought to do the \nright thing for those who are depending on us. The question is, where \ndo we get the money?\n  It is simple. We have two options. One option says: Time out; this is \nso important that it doesn't matter where we get the money; we have to \nsupply it. The other option is--and by the way, the first option belies \nthe fact that we have any waste in the Federal Government. I don't \nthink we can do a poll that would come so close to unanimity as a poll \non which we would ask the American people whether the Federal \nGovernment is efficient and effective. I doubt that we would get \nanybody on the ``yes'' ledger side on that.\n  The real question, then, becomes do we have the goodwill and the \npresence of mind to do this in a way that doesn't jeopardize our \nchildren? You see, we are not just fighting about unemployment \nbenefits. We are not debating the issue of unemployment benefits. We \nare debating the issue of whether we take from those who come after us \nand give to those today.\n  Many times I have used this poster of this young lady. Her name is \nMadeline. Madeline was caught in DC wearing this poster. I have gone \nover the numbers. When she wore the poster, her debt was $38,375. Her \ndebt today, without us extending this bill after last year, is over \n$45,000. So the question is competing priorities. We have the priority \nof making sure that we help those who need our help in a time of \neconomic decline. And then we have the priority of making sure we have \nnot mortgaged the opportunity of freedom for children such as Madeline.\n  Who will fight for the Madelines? Who will stand up for our \ngrandchildren and say we can find $9.2 billion out of an almost $4 \ntrillion budget and pay for it and not charge it to the Madelines of \nthis world? That is what we are doing when we declare something an \nemergency.\n  I would also make the point that we passed a 9-month extension for \nmany of these programs. It was paid for. In other words, we didn't add \nto the debt when we passed a bill that would extend this for 9 months. \nThe Senate did its work. That bill hasn't come back because the House \nis unlikely to pass it with the pay-fors in it and, frankly, several \nwere used to pay for the health care bill that passed.\n  Who will protect the Madelines of the world? Since the beginning of \nthis year and the famed passage of a statute called pay-go, which says \nwe will no longer create new spending without cutting the spending \nsomewhere else, we have spent $120 billion of Madeline's future, and \nevery Madeline who is out there--every 3-year-old and 4-year-old who is \nout there. We have done it by waiving the new statute that says you \nhave to pay as you go. Congress--and the Senate specifically--increased \nour budget 5.6 percent this year. In a year where true costs were down \nwe increased our own budget. Yet, we refuse to look at the hard choices \nthat are necessary for us to make a future for the Madelines of this \nworld.\n  What happens if we continue this? What happens if we continue to say \nwe will borrow from the future instead of making the tough choices now? \nI will tell you what happens. Madeline's future--her opportunity for \nprosperity--is mortgaged. We tend to think in the short run, and the \nvision our Founders had was thinking in the long term.\n  So where do we find $9.2 billion? If I get an opportunity, I will \noffer five amendments that will pay for that. I wager that nary a \nperson would ever miss the money. We could find $9.2 billion in the \nDefense Department. They have at least $50 billion worth of waste. But, \nno, we won't go there. We have $700 billion in unobligated balances of \nwhich well over 20 percent has been sitting there for 2 years. That is \n$140 billion. We can pay for this for a year, but we won't go there. We \nhave ineffective spending in the stimulus bill that hasn't been rolled \nout yet that I will put forward as a greater priority than the money \nintended left in the stimulus bill is for. But we are not going to go \nthere. What we are going to do--and we will pass a motion to proceed \ntoday to this bill. But what we are going to do is take the easy, the \nsoft road of not paid for. We cannot continue to do that.\n  Last year--and we will continue this year--out of every dollar the \nFederal Government spent we borrowed 43 percent. So 43 cents out of \nevery dollar the Federal Government spent last year we borrowed. We \nended up with a real deficit of close to $1.6 trillion by the time you \nget out of the accounting gimmicks that Washington uses. That is what \nwe added to the Madelines of the world. We are going to do that this \nyear again.\n  The February deficit was the highest on record ever for the Federal \nGovernment. So we are going to have an excessive $1.4 billion or $1.5 \nbillion or probably a $1.6 trillion deficit this year, and we are going \nto add another $9.2 billion with this bill.\n  How is it fair? How is it right that in this country we cannot do two \nright things, we can only do one right and one wrong thing? I posit \nthat stealing money from our kids' future and mortgaging their future \nis morally wrong. I posit that helping people who need our help on \nunemployment benefits is morally right. Why can we not do both? We \nought to be able to do both.\n  I sent a letter to the minority and majority leaders when the bill \nfirst came up. I will read it because I think it is important to \nunderstand the thinking on why we should pay for this--realizing that \nwe passed a 9-month extension that was paid for, and because the House \nhasn't acted, we don't feel an obligation to protect the Madelines of \nthe world. The letter says this:\n\n       I am writing to notify you that I would like to be \n     consulted on any unanimous consent agreements regarding the \n     consideration of H.R. 4851, the Continuing Extension Act of \n     2010, which would extend the number of federal programs for \n     one month.\n       No one is arguing that Americans who are currently \n     unemployed should not have their unemployment insurance \n     payments extended. But once again, Congress is refusing to \n     find a way to offset the $9.15 billion cost of the bill with \n     cuts to less important federal spending.\n       Time and time again, Congress intentionally waits until the \n     last minute to consider important legislation and then \n     declares the billions of dollars in foreseeable costs as \n     ``emergency'' spending in order to avoid having to find a way \n     to pay for the bills' price tags.\n       In the last 6 months, Congress has passed four major \n     extension bills. H.R. 4851 would be the fifth such bill. The \n     total cost of these bills is almost $30 billion. \n     Additionally, over the last year Congress has increased \n     funding totaling $64.9 billion for the Highway and \n     Unemployment Insurance Trust Funds without offsets.\n       This shortsightedness sticks taxpayers with billions of \n     dollars in additional debt and treats the unemployed, doctors \n     and Medicare patients, hard working men and women who help \n     make our roads and bridges safe, and others relying on \n     federal funds as pawns in Congress' borrowing and spending \n     game.\n       When the previous last-minute one month extension (H.R. \n     4692) was brought up days before the funding authority for \n     numerous federal programs, including Unemployment Insurance \n     and the Highway Trust Fund, which expired at the end of \n     February, 2010, a United States Senator was attacked for \n     objecting to passing the bill without any debate or \n     amendments because the bill was unpaid for and added $10 \n     billion to our nation's debt.\n\n\n[[Page S2192]]\n\n\n  In other words, there is something wrong with Senator Bunning raising \nthe question of whether we ought to pay for it.\n\n       As always, those who prefer to borrow to avoid making the \n     tough budget decisions won out, and the taxpayers were stuck \n     with another $10 billion in debt.\n\n  The Madelines of the world.\n\n       Congress has continually resisted the need to act like \n     every family in the United States of America and to budget \n     and live within their means. Our debt is now over $12.6 \n     trillion. The 2010 deficit is projected to amount to $1.3 \n     trillion and we are borrowing 43 cents on every dollar; yet, \n     Congress continues to increase spending without any \n     correlating spending cuts.\n       Congress' inability to prioritize and manage national needs \n     results in real consequences for Americans, whether it be \n     furloughs, market uncertainty that leads to lower investment \n     and job losses, or Americans being saddled with higher debt \n     and taxes.\n       If Congress keeps approving temporary extension bills \n     throughout the calendar year without finding offsets, \n     Congress will have added almost $120 billion to our national \n     debt. Additionally, the Senate has already approved more than \n     $120 billion in new federal spending not offset, even though \n     it passed Pay-Go legislation just over one month ago claiming \n     to prohibit such activity.\n       In the House, Appropriations Chairman David Obey has \n     indicated that some new spending needs to be offset with \n     unused, unobligated funds. Chairman Obey suggested rescinding \n     $362 million in reserve stimulus funds for the Women, Infants \n     and Children nutrition program; $112 million from a Commerce \n     Department program designed to provide coupons to households \n     to help buy analog-to-digital converter boxes; $103 million \n     from USDA rural development programs; and $44 million from \n     the Transportation Department's Consumer Assistance to \n     Recycle and Save Program . . . to offset the cost of a \n     different spending bill. The Senate should likewise find a \n     way to offset this one-month extension bill and create a \n     sustainable precedent.\n       The Senate can start with federal unobligated balances. \n     According to the White House, in Fiscal Year 2011, 33 percent \n     of all federal funds were unused and obligated. The total \n     dollar amount of these unobligated balances was estimated at \n     $703 billion. Rescinding only discretionary funding that has \n     been available for more than two years would likely result in \n     roughly $100 billion in offset spending. The Senate could \n     also tap into $228 billion in unobligated stimulus funds as \n     Chairman Obey has suggested.\n       At the very least, Congress should reconsider transferring \n     the almost $100 million budget increase it approved for \n     itself for 2010 to offset the cost of additional spending. \n     Congress should not be increasing its budget by 4.5 percent \n     when our economy shrunk by 2.4 percent and inflation was at \n     less than 1 percent.\n       I have also detailed through numerous oversight hearings, \n     reports, and legislation how the federal government wastes \n     more than $300 billion every year. I have suggested hundreds \n     of offsets to new spending, including consolidating \n     duplicative programs, and eliminating federal programs that \n     address parochial concerns.\n       We all think our Americans in need of financial assistance \n     are worth the $9 billion bill cost, but do we think our \n     children and grandchildren are worth paying for these costs \n     up front, rather than passing the cost to them?. . . .\n       Thank you for protecting my rights regarding this \n     legislation.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 23, 2010.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am writing to notify you that I \n     would like to be consulted on any unanimous consent \n     agreements regarding the consideration of H.R. 4851, the \n     Continuing Extension Act of 2010, which would extend a number \n     of federal programs for one month.\n       No one is arguing that Americans who are currently \n     unemployed should not have their unemployment insurance \n     payments extended.

The \n     total cost of these bills is almost $30 billion. \n     Additionally, over the last year Congress has increased \n     funding totaling $64.9 billion for the Highway and \n     Unemployment Insurance Trust Funds without offsets.\n       This short sightedness sticks taxpayers with billions of \n     dollars in additional debt and treats the unemployed, doctors \n     and Medicare patients, hard working men and women who help \n     make our roads and bridges safe, and others relying on \n     federal funds as pawns in Congress' borrowing and spending \n     game.\n       When the previous last-minute one-month extension (H.R. \n     4691) was brought up days before the funding authority for \n     numerous federal programs, including Unemployment Insurance \n     and the Highway Trust Fund, expired at the end of February, \n     2010, a United States Senator was attacked for objecting to \n     passing the bill without any debate or amendments because the \n     bill was unpaid for and added $10 billion to our nation's \n     debt.\n       As always, those who prefer to borrow to avoid making tough \n     budget decisions won out, and the taxpayers were stuck with \n     another $10 billion of debt.\n       Congress has continually resisted the need to act like \n     every family in the United States of America and to budget \n     and live within their means. Our debt is now over $12.6 \n     trillion. The 2010 deficit is projected to amount to $1.3 \n     trillion and we are borrowing 43 cents on every dollar; yet, \n     Congress continues to increase spending without any \n     correlating spending cuts.\n       Congress' inability to prioritize and manage national needs \n     results in real consequences for Americans, whether it be \n     furloughs, market uncertainty that leads to lower investment \n     and job losses, or Americans being saddled with higher debt \n     and taxes.\n       If Congress keeps approving temporary extension bills \n     throughout the calendar year without finding offsets, \n     Congress will have added almost $120 billion to our national \n     debt. Additionally, the Senate has already approved more than \n     $120 billion in new federal spending not offset, even though \n     it passed Pay-Go legislation just over one month ago claiming \n     to prohibit such activity.\n       In the House, Appropriations Chairman David Obey has \n     indicated that some new spending needs to be offset with \n     unused, unobligated funds. Chairman Obey suggested rescinding \n     $362 million in reserved stimulus funds for the Women, \n     Infants and Children nutrition program; $112 million from a \n     Commerce Department program designed to provide coupons to \n     households to help buy analog-to-digital converter boxes; \n     $103 million from USDA rural development programs; and $44 \n     million from the Transportation Department's Consumer \n     Assistance to Recycle and Save Program (also known as the \n     ``Cash for Clunkers'' program) to offset the cost of a \n     different spending bill. The Senate should likewise find a \n     way to offset this one-month extension bill and create a \n     sustainable precedent.\n       The Senate could start with federal unobligated balances. \n     According to the White House, in Fiscal Year 2011, 33 percent \n     of all federal funds were unused and obligated. The total \n     dollar amount of these unobligated balances was estimated at \n     $703 billion. Rescinding only discretionary funding that has \n     been available for more than two years would likely result in \n     roughly $100 billion in offset spending. The Senate could \n     also tap into $228 billion in unobligated stimulus funds as \n     Chairman Obey has suggested.\n       At the very least, Congress should reconsider transferring \n     the almost $100 million budget increase it approved for \n     itself for 2010 to offset the cost of additional spending. \n     Congress should not be increasing its budget by 4.5 percent \n     when our economy shrunk by 2.4 percent and inflation was at \n     less than 1 percent.\n       I have also detailed through numerous oversight hearings, \n     reports, and legislation how the federal government wastes \n     more than $300 billion every year. I have suggested hundreds \n     of offsets to new spending, including consolidating \n     duplicative programs, and eliminating federal programs that \n     address parochial concerns.\n       We all think our Americans in need of financial assistance \n     are worth the $9 billion bill cost, but do we think our \n     children and grandchildren are worth paying for these costs \n     up front, rather than passing the cost to them? I am willing \n     to accept a unanimous consent agreement to pass the bill with \n     my amendment included to offset the full amount. I am open to \n     all other offset suggestions.\n       Thank you for protecting my rights regarding this \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Tom A. Coburn.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, so what are we going to do? We have before \nus a need. It is a good need. It is something we ought to do. We are \ngoing to borrow 43 cents out of every dollar we spend this year. We are \ngoing to put the Madelines of this world in a position that by 2020, \nthis number is not going to be $45,000; it is going to be $95,000. That \nis where she is going to be. That is every man, woman, and child in \nterms of what they owe in terms of the direct national debt.\n  Can we continue on this pace? We hear we will fix it later. Later is \nnot good enough for the Madelines of this world. Later is today. Now is \nthe time for us to do the very hard work. It is not easy to come up \nwith spending offsets. It is not easy to not increase the national \ndebt. It is very easy to simply put the credit card into the machine \nand say: Because they are out of sight, out of mind--the Madelines of \nthe world--we will just charge it to them.\n\n[[Page S2193]]\n\n  That is what is being proposed here. If you oppose that, all of a \nsudden you do not care about the people who are unemployed. I cannot \ntell you how many times I have heard that in the last 2 weeks; that it \nis obstruction that you want to pay for it. Should we be working hard \nto secure the future of the children such as Madeline?\n  We are told that over the next 9 years, we are going to borrow an \nadditional $9.8 trillion, based on the budget projections that are out \nthere. Of that $9.8 trillion, almost half of it is money we are going \nto borrow and turn around to pay interest on what we already owe. That \nis eerily close to those of us who get into trouble with credit cards. \nWe get another credit card, borrow the max on it to pay off the other \ncredit cards. Then we get in trouble with that one and get another one. \nPretty soon, we cannot pay anything.\n  The Chinese own over $900 billion of our bonds, the Russians $800 \nbillion. Have we considered the fact that our problems, in terms of our \nforeign policy with Iran and our ability to put sharp, tough sanctions \non somebody who wants to use and develop nuclear weapons could possibly \nbe inhibited by the fact that two of the countries opposing those \nstrong, tough sanctions own a lot of our bonds and that we are \ndependent on them? Could it also be that the week before last, when the \nTreasury option was very soft because the Chinese did not participate, \nthat is a warning shot across our bow? We are in waters this country \nhas never seen before. If we pass this bill and we continue to pass \nmore bills, not having made the tough choices, we are steaming toward a \ncatastrophe.\n  What will that look like? It is not that we cannot fix the problem. \nIt is not as if we could not go and find $9.2 billion out of a nearly \n$4 trillion budget. It is that we refuse to. It is not that it is \nimpossible. We refuse to. We refuse to do the same things families \nacross this country do every day; that is, make a choice about \npriorities.\n  My office just last week, with the help of the Congressional Research \nService and the GAO, identified 70 duplicate programs on nutrition \nacross three Federal Departments. We now have 70 programs for food and \nnutrition across three departments, with thousands upon thousands of \nFederal employees, thousands upon thousands of pages of bureaucratic \ngobbledygook and regulations. I would propose probably we ought to have \none good program on food and nutrition. We do not address that. The \nauthorizing committees do not. The appropriating committees do not.\n  We have 105 programs that encourage people to go into math, science, \ntechnology, and engineering across six different agencies--105 \nprograms. There is not one agency that does not have considerable waste \nin it, and there is probably not one American who would not think that \nwe could not cut 1 or 2 or 3 percent from every agency and drive \nefficiency. But we will not do that.\n  The real question is: Why won't we? We will beat up people because \nthey will not agree to spend Madeline's money and her future, but we \nwill not agree to trim the waste, the fat, duplication, and fraud out \nof the Federal Government. It is no wonder the public has such a poor \nimage of Congress because we are actually not doing what they are \nasking us to do.\n  It would be different if there was not waste in the Federal \nGovernment. If everything was fine-tuned, effective, and efficient, one \ncould make an argument for borrowing this money. But nobody I know of \nbelieves the Federal Government is efficient and effective throughout \nits myriad departments and agencies. If the majority might feel that \nway, that it is not, why would we not do the hard work of paying for \nthis bill?\n  What does it mean to borrow $9.2 billion this month and $10 billion \nlast month and $10 billion before and the $120 billion we passed in the \nfirst 3 months of the second session of the 111th Congress? What does \nit mean? It means we do not think we have to play by the same rules as \nthe rest of the American public. We have a tilted sense of reality. \nThere is no obligation on us to eliminate waste to provide a good for \nthose people who are depending on us.\n  We will go forward this evening on a motion to proceed to this bill \nunpaid for, charged to the Madelines of this world, and all you have to \ndo is take $9.2 billion--it is not much in Washington speak; it is \ntwice the size of Oklahoma's budget for a year--and we will charge it \nto a credit card to our kids.\n  Ultimately, what we are doing is stealing a college education from \nour kids. We are stealing a job opportunity from our kids. We are \nstealing the ability for our kids to own a home and to provide for \ntheir children what was provided for them. You see, the heritage we \nhave that built this country was one of sacrifice, where we make \ndecisions that require us to make a sacrifice to create opportunity. \nWhen you turn that upside down, the American experiment fails. When we \nsteal opportunity from the future so we can benefit for today, we \neliminate the genius that made this country great. It is time we \nreversed that.\n\n  It is not really a partisan issue. I know the press is going to say \nthat. It is partisan for our future. It is partisan for our kids. And \nwe can do both. We can find $9.2 billion that isn't as effectively \nspent as will be spent on COBRA or unemployment insurance or on flood \ninsurance or on fixing the SGR for a short period of time. We can do \nthat, but we won't because we are in the habit of not making hard \nchoices. We are in the habit of doing the least best thing rather than \nthe best thing.\n  The best thing for our budget, the best thing for our future, the \nbest thing for our children's future is for us to say X, Y, and Z are \nnot nearly as important as unemployment insurance benefits, are not as \nimportant as COBRA benefits, are not as important as fixing the SGR for \na short period of time. When will we muscle up the courage to start \nmaking those kinds of decisions?\n  We can't continue doing what we are doing. We can't grow to $20 \ntrillion worth of debt--over 100 percent of our GDP. At the rate we are \ngoing, in 2010, we will have $24 trillion worth of debt, and $24 \ntrillion, at 6 percent interest, is $1.5 trillion a year in interest \npayments. We can't make it. We cannot handle that. And the reality will \nonly come home when it is too late.\n  Senator Reid, when we passed the pay-go bill, said it was a new \nstart. He said we are going to open our billfold, and if the money is \nthere we will spend it but we are not going to spend money that is not \nin our billfold--to paraphrase his quote. Well, this bill goes to an \nempty billfold. The money is not there. So we can either increase our \ndebt, which will make life for the Madelines of this world tougher or \nwe can actually take on some tough decisionmaking as a body and \nactually eliminate lower priority programs. Would that have some impact \non some programs? Yes. I mean, we could actually take a 1-percent \nacross-the-board cut and come up with $30 billion easily. Americans \nknow we could get 1 percent out of the Federal agencies. But we are not \ngoing to do that either.\n  The question is, When will we start acting in the responsible role \nwith which we are charged? When will we start thinking with a long-term \nperspective about what is going to happen to our country if, in fact, \nwe don't start making the hard choices now? No matter how much scorn, \nno matter how many derisive statements are made, the Madelines of the \nworld are worth it. When we sit and relax and think this is not as big \na problem as we hear described, we fall into the same trap as every \nother republic in history. And they all collapsed. No republic has \nsurvived more than 250 years, and they all collapsed for the same \nreason. They all collapsed ultimately because they lost control of \ntheir fiscal policy--taxes, spending, priorities.\n  So we have a choice in front of us. This isn't the first time we are \ngoing to have this choice, and it won't be the last. But a question \nthat I think the American people ought to be asking is, When is the \nCongress going to start acting in a responsible manner? When are they \ngoing to start following the guidelines every other prudent financial \ndecisionmaker makes, whether it be the head of a household, a wage \nearner, a small business, or a small nonprofit? They all live within a \nbudget, and what they do is they say: Here is the most important \npriority and here is the least, and they go down the line. When the \nmoney runs out, they either generate efficiency to allow that money to \nbe more effective and more efficient in how it is spent or they \neliminate the lower priority items.\n\n[[Page S2194]]\n\n  It would be a wonderful search for people to go on thomas.gov to find \nout the number of programs that have been eliminated versus the number \nof programs that have been created in the last 2 years. I guarantee you \nthey will outnumber 200 or 300 to 1. In the Judiciary Committee this \nweek, we will have two bills up that duplicate existing programs. I \nwill have the same fight in the Judiciary Committee, and I will lose. \nWe will extend new programs that are doing the same thing other \nprograms are doing, and yet I will lose the battle and we will create \nnew programs to do the same thing we already have government programs \ndoing. Why is that? Because you cannot manage what you do not measure. \nWe don't put metrics on hardly anything in the Federal Government \nprograms, and conveniently so. Therefore, we can say: Well, we can't \nknow whether they are efficient.\n  The time for our comfort with where we find ourselves financially is \nover. The American people already understand that because 72 percent of \nthem, in a recent poll, said their No. 1 issue is debt and spending. \nThey already get it. They are wondering when we are going to catch up \nwith them. They are for supporting unemployment insurance benefits but \nnot charging them to their children. They are for us making the hard \nchoices.\n  So as we go forward, the hope would be that we would get out of the \nshort-term thinking we find ourselves in and start looking down the \nroad of what is coming. I have been quoted as saying that I think we \nhave less than 5 years to fix our ship. I think that is probably \ngenerous. I don't think there is one problem in front of our country \nthat we can't fix. However, if we ignore the realities of our financial \nsituation, if the elected leaders in this country fail to make priority \ndecisions, which means you are going to offend some of the supporters \nof the lower priority programs, then we are not going to solve the \nproblems that are in front of us. If our focus is parochial only--in \nother words, only the concerns within our own States--rather than that \nof our Nation as a whole, we are not going to fix the problems in front \nof us.\n  I have five grandchildren, and in thinking of the future, I often \nwonder what things will be like for them.\n  Thinking backward, when I was 17 and 18 and going to college for the \nfirst year, there was this tremendous vision on the horizon that I saw \nin front of me. I could go to school because I had parents who could \nafford to pay for my college, and wherever I wanted to go, whatever I \nwanted to do was out there on that horizon. That is a limited \npossibility today for our kids. Is it going to be a possibility for the \nMadelines of the world?\n  Thinking forward, if you take everyone who is 25 years of age and \nyounger in this country and go out 20 years, here is where they will \nbe: That group, 45 and younger, will be responsible for $1,113,000--\neach and every one of them will be responsible for $1,113,000 worth of \ndebt and unfunded liabilities, every one of them, if we are on the same \ncourse we are on today. Take 6 percent of that, and you will see they \nare going to have to come up with about $67,000 a year just to pay the \ninterest costs on that debt. That is before they pay income taxes. That \nis before they pay rent or pay a mortgage. That is before they pay for \na car or a car payment. That is before they put food on the table. That \nis before they clothe their kids and themselves. That is before they \ngive to a charity or their church.\n  We are stealing the American dream every time we fail to be cognizant \nof what the future holds, if we don't change course. So the debate \nreally isn't about unemployment insurance; it is about when are we \ngoing to change course? When are we going to start recognizing the need \nto live within our means?\n  We are going to hear that we have always done it this way, that we \nhave passed three other short-term extensions and that we call them \nemergencies so we don't have to pay for them. I would say it is time \nthat we not always do it the way we have always done it because the way \nwe have always done it has gotten us $12.6 trillion in debt and is \nsending us out to sea without a rudder and without enough fuel oil to \nget back to shore.\n  My hope is that our debate will focus on what the real problems are \nin this country, the real long-term problems, because you really solve \nshort-term problems when you start attacking the long-term problems and \nwhen you really start making the tough decisions.\n  I say to my colleague from Montana, as head of the Finance Committee, \nhe knows what would happen if we sent a signal that we were really \ngoing to start getting tough about our budget. He knows what would \nhappen to bond rates. He knows what would happen to our ability to lead \nin the world if we all of a sudden became cognizant and acted in a way \nthat was fiscally responsible. Investment would come flowing back into \nthis country, bond yields would go down, not up, and the cost of our \ndebt would go down. It would be a home run every way we look at it. It \nwould be a home run for the Madelines of this country, and it would be \na home run for those who are unemployed.\n\n  If you read the financial news, you have been seeing what is \nhappening to Greece. Greece got rescued just in the last week, partly \nthrough the IMF, but mainly the money is going to come from Germany and \nFrance. They are going to get to borrow for a short period of time at 5 \npercent instead of the 7\\1/2\\ percent the market reflects.\n  I would say that there is no Germany or France to bail us out. There \nis no one who will come to bail America out. It is highly doubtful that \nGreece has the political will to do what it has to do to solve its own \nproblem. The question is, In 2 or 3 years, are they going to be saying \nthe same thing about our country? Do we have the political will to dig \nout of the hole we have, in fact, dug for ourselves? When I say ``we,'' \nI am not talking about the American public, I am talking about the \nCongress of the United States. You can't blame it on any President. You \ncan't blame it on the courts. The blame for our financial situation \nlies solely with the U.S. Congress. Whether it is lack of oversight of \nfinancial firms or Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae; whether it is the lack \nof oversight of the SEC; whether it is the tremendous amount of waste, \nfraud, and abuse in the Federal Government--$300 billion, at least, per \nyear--it lies with us.\n  We are going to hear a lot of reasons why we should pass this--just \npass the charges on to our kids. My hope is that the American people \nwill reject that because when they accept that it is OK to just charge \nit to our kids, what they are doing is conditioning us to continue \ndoing the same thing--continuing to spend the future opportunities of \nour children and grandchildren. Our heritage is much greater than that. \nOur kids and grandkids are worth much more than that. Let it not be \nsaid of this Congress that we failed to act in the time when the tough \nget going and that we made the tough decisions about not increasing the \ndebt, streamlining the government, eliminating some of the $300 billion \nworth of waste, fraud, abuse, and duplication that is in the Federal \nGovernment.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are starting to come out of the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression.\n  A little more than a year ago, in the fourth quarter of 2008, the \neconomy declined at an annual rate of more than 5 percent. A year \nlater, in the fourth quarter of 2009, the gross domestic product grew \nat an annual rate of nearly 6 percent.\n  Last month, manufacturing activity increased at the fastest rate in \n5\\1/2\\ years. Last month, the service sector expanded at the fastest \nrate in more than 2 years. And last month, the economy added 162,000 \njobs.\n  The economy has taken its first steps toward recovery.\n  The economists say that part of the reason why the economy is \nstarting to come back is what we did here. One of the first things that \nPresident Obama did in office was to press for bold action to prevent \nanother Great Depression. And one of the first bills that Congress \nenacted in the new administration was the Recovery Act.\n  The economists say that it's working. The nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office says that in the fourth quarter of 2009, the Recovery Act \nincreased the number of full-time-equivalent jobs by between 1.4 \nmillion and 3 million. And CBO also estimates that real gross domestic \nproduct was 1\\1/2\\ percent to 3\\1/2\\ percent higher in the\n\n[[Page S2195]]\n\nfourth quarter than it would have been without the Recovery Act.\n  So there are some encouraging signs.\n  But we still face major challenges in the economy. There is still \nwork to do creating jobs.\n  The unemployment rate stands at 9.7 percent. Almost a tenth of the \nlabor force is unemployed. More than 15 million Americans are out of \nwork.\n  First-time claims for unemployment benefits rose the week before \nlast. Businesses are still laying off workers. And companies remain \ntentative in hiring new employees.\n  The economists call unemployment ``a lagging indicator.'' Employers \ncan be slow to rehire, when business begins to pick up.\n  The Congressional Budget Office expects the unemployment rate to \nremain above 8 percent until 2012. CBO does not expect unemployment to \nreach what they call its ``natural state'' of 5 percent until 2016.\n  CBO does not expect that the gap between actual output and potential \noutput will close until the end of 2014.\n  That is why we need to pass a temporary extension of unemployment \nbenefits.\n  Jobless benefits are a powerful way to bolster demand during times of \nhigh unemployment.\n  Households receiving unemployment benefits spend their additional \nbenefits right away. That spurs demand for goods and services. That \nboosts production. And that leads businesses to hire more employees.\n  The Congressional Budget Office looked at the different ways that we \ncan help the economy to grow, and CBO says that extending additional \nunemployment benefits would have one of the largest effects on economic \noutput and employment per dollar spent.\n  Because benefits are often spent quickly, extending unemployment \nbenefits will provide a timely boost to the economy.\n  A temporary extension will also provide immediate assistance to \nmillions of Americans struggling to feed their families and pay the \nbills.\n  According to officials in my home State of Montana, if we do not pass \nthis extension, then thousands of Montanans could lose their \nunemployment benefits and will have significant difficulties. That is a \nsignificant number when you consider the population of my State.\n  An extension of unemployment benefits is essential, but it is not \nenough. We must also consider unemployment insurance reforms that could \nhelp to create more jobs.\n  That is why I plan to hold a hearing in the Finance Committee on \nWednesday to explore ways to use unemployment insurance to help \nAmericans to get back to work.\n  States and experts have ideas for how we can improve the unemployment \ninsurance system. They have ideas about how it can save and create more \njobs.\n  Wednesday, the Finance Committee will discuss possible commonsense \ninnovations with a panel of experts, while also addressing the \nchallenge of State solvency.\n  But right now, it is essential that we pass a temporary extension of \nunemployment benefits. An extension will help workers to get by as they \nsearch or retrain for a new job. And an extension will also provide a \nmuch-needed boost to the economy.\n  So, let us help the families who are struggling in this difficult \neconomic time. Let us help to spur demand and economic growth. Let us \nvote to invoke cloture on this vital legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we are going to have a cloture vote this \nevening at 5:30. It is about a subject that is very important. Yet I \nhave been listening to the floor today and hearing the discussion about \nsaving our country, about the issue of large Federal budget deficits, \nand the things that threaten our country's future.\n  I wanted to talk a little bit about some of those issues because I \nhave been reading a book recently, quite an interesting book, called \n``Too Big to Fail.'' I was listening this afternoon to some of the \ndebate and thinking about too big to fail and too small to matter.\n  Interesting dichotomy: Too big to fail is talking about the biggest \ninstitutions in this country, the largest financial institutions in \nAmerica, are too big to fail. So they run themselves into serious \ntrouble. They get the benefit of no-fault capitalism. We are told if \nthey fail, it will be a disaster for America's economy; therefore, we \nwill have the taxpayers pony up $700 billion to make sure they do not \nfail. I am talking about the people at the top.\n  The question is, What about the people at the bottom, the people who \nwork for a living, who like their jobs, want to have a better future \nfor themselves and their children, but who discovered that as we sailed \ninto this economic storm, while the people at the top got a big old \nparachute and they were lifted gently to the ground or allowed to get \ngently grounded, the folks at the bottom were just pushed off a cliff.\n  We ran into this serious economic trouble, and a whole lot of people \nlost their jobs. We have had millions and millions of people lose their \njobs. We estimate somewhere around 17 million Americans woke up this \nmorning without a job. They went looking today, as they do every day, \nbut they have not found a job. They, their spouse, their children, they \nare all victims of this economy.\n  So then the question is, the difference between too big to fail--\nthose institutions, by the way, which for some of our colleagues, they \ncould not be quick enough to get the pillow and the aspirin to say: Can \nwe help you to bed? Is there any way we can be of help? Here is $700 \nbillion on the too-big-to-fail side. But on the too-small-to-matter \nside--it is the person who lost their job--we had folks in here saying: \nYou are just out of luck. We do not have the ability or willingness to \ndeal with you.\n  I taught a little economics a couple of years in college. We always \nunderstood the basic lessons on economics are simple enough when you \nrun into a very severe recession or depression. But let's talk about \nrecession, a deep recession, and in this case the deepest since the \nGreat Depression. The government's revenues dried up; we have lost \nsomewhere around $400 billion a year in revenue. The economic \nstabilizers that are required in a recession would be unemployment \ninsurance, food stamps, and those kinds of things to try to help people \nout, help them through some difficult periods. I am talking now about \nhelping people at the bottom of the economic ladder. Those things \nautomatically go up.\n  So the revenue goes down, that goes up, and your deficit balloons. \nThere is no question about that. Everybody understands that. I \nunderstand why the deficit has gone out of sight. I also understand it \nis a very serious problem for our country. But I think we should all \nunderstand we should not do the things that would move us right back \ninto a recession. The economic stabilizers and the expenditures on them \nis very important in order to get us out of this problem and in order \nto help those at the bottom of the economic ladder who cannot help \nthemselves.\n  What bothers me is we have people coming to the floor of the Senate \nsaying: I am the champion to try to reduce the Federal budget deficit. \nI am the person who is going to solve this.\n  Well, I would say to those folks: Where were you? Where have you \nbeen? It has been a decade and you were not around. I recall nearly 10 \nyears ago when President Bush came into office, and he said: We have a \nbudget surplus. Yes, they did. The first budget surplus in three \ndecades under the last year of President Clinton's Presidency, a budget \nsurplus at the Federal level, the first one. By the way, that resulted \nfrom a series of fiscal policy judgments that were made beginning in \n1993. I voted for it. It passed by one vote in the Senate. It passed by \none vote in the House. Senators such as--I guess I will name him \nbecause he was proud of it--Senator Phil Gramm from Texas stood up and \nsaid: You pass this, you will bankrupt the country. No, it did not \nbankrupt the country. It actually led us out of the problems we were in \nto a budget surplus in the year 2000.\n  President George Bush came to town and said: You know what. We have \nthis budget surplus. It looks as though we are going to have budget \nsurpluses for\n\n[[Page S2196]]\n\nthe next 10 years. Let's give very large tax cuts to people, but the \nlargest tax cuts to the highest income people in America.\n  Well, I stood on this floor and said: I do not support that. What if \nwe do not have these surpluses for 10 years. These are just economic \npredictions by economists who cannot remember their phone numbers for 3 \ndays, and they are telling us what is going to happen in 3, 5, and 10 \nyears. Let's be a little bit conservative.\n  President Bush and his colleagues on the floor of the Senate said: \nKatey, bar the door. We are pushing this. They did, and they had the \nvotes. They passed it, and all of a sudden we substantially cut the \nrevenue that was coming into the Treasury.\n  Then what happened almost immediately? Then we were hit with 9/11, a \nterrorist attack in this country. Then we were at war in Afghanistan. \nThen we went to war in Iraq, and year after year after year the \nPresident brought to this Congress proposals for emergency spending for \nthe war. This President said--I am talking about President George W. \nBush--we do not intend to pay for a penny of it. Every single penny for \nthe war is going to be on an emergency basis, put on top of the Federal \ndebt.\n  I did not hear those folks who now say they are going to stand \nbetween us and catastrophe come to the Senate floor then to say that \ndid not make any sense. I did. I said: Why don't we pay for some of \nthis?\n  The President said: If you try to pay for it, I will veto the bill.\n  There we were for 8 years spending money we did not have on a war we \nprobably should not have fought, borrowing every single penny of it. \nNow the folks who speak the loudest these days about these issues are \nthe ones who decided: Oh, that made a lot of sense: cut the \ngovernment's revenue, fight a war without paying for any of it.\n  By the way, many of them, 10 years ago when we voted on the floor of \nthis Senate to repeal the restrictions that were put in place after the \nGreat Depression to protect our country, they were the ones who voted \nfor the repeal to say: You know what. Let's let these big financial \ncompanies create holding companies, and you can put them all together. \nYou can put real estate and securities and banks and investment banks, \nFDIC-insured banks, put them all in one big holding company. It will be \njust fine.\n  Well, I was on the floor of the Senate saying: This will not be just \nfine. It will be a catastrophe. I said 10 years ago--I did not know for \nsure, but I said: Within 10 years we are going to see big taxpayer \nbailouts if we do this.\n  Some of the same people on the floor of the Senate back then were \nsaying: Look, let's create these big financial behemoths so we can \ncompete. It will be good.\n  Then the President, George W. Bush, brought in regulators who boasted \nthey were willing to be willfully blind for almost a decade: It does \nnot matter what you do, you can do that. We will not watch. They said: \nThere is a new sheriff in town. We are business friendly.\n  So in all of these agencies where we were supposed to have regulators \nto make sure the free market worked, regulators who were the referees \nwith a striped shirt to blow the whistle to call the foul when the free \nmarket was the victim of a foul, they were not around. They were just \nin a Rip Van Winkle sleep for nearly a decade.\n  Meanwhile, Wall Street went out to play, and they created the most \nunbelievable instruments of deception: credit default swaps, synthetic \ncredit default swaps, CDOs. I mean it is unbelievable. The \ncircumstances that developed, the subprime scandal, the creation of \nthese exotic financial instruments, the development of substantially \nmore lending approved by regulatory agencies--all of this set us up for \nan unbelievable fall.\n  Some of the same people who were cheerleading for these very \nactivities are now telling us they are going to protect America. And \nyou know where they are going to make their last stand? Their last \nstand on these deficit issues is to deal with the poor people by \nsaying: No, you cannot get that unemployment insurance extension.\n  By the way, unemployment insurance is something that people pay for \nout of their paychecks. Unemployment insurance is something we pay for \nout of our paychecks. Extending it during a recession is certainly the \nthing to do. It is something we have always done. Yet this is the last \nstand.\n  What about making the last stand when it comes to bailing out Wall \nStreet? How about making the last stand a couple of weeks from now when \nwe have Wall Street reform on the floor of the Senate, when we have a \nreal fight about trying to do reform that is necessary on Wall Street?\n  In 2008, the financial firms on Wall Street--I am just talking about \nthe Wall Street firms now--the biggest financial firms lost $36 billion \nand paid $18 billion in bonuses.\n  I have an MBA. I went to graduate business school. There is nowhere \nthey teach in graduate school that if you go out and lose $35 or $36 \nbillion, you ought to expect to be able to pay $17 or $18 billion in \nbonuses to those who helped you do it. Yet that is exactly the kind of \ncarnival that existed in this country at the top of the financial food \nchain.\n  So we are going to have a big fight about that in a couple of weeks. \nHow do we plug the holes? How do we solve this problem of Wall Street \nreform? We are going to have a lot of votes, and it will be interesting \nto see whether those who now speak the loudest about being able to \nprotect the American taxpayer, standing up on the issue of debt and \ndeficits, whether those are the people who are going to join us in \ntaking the action to try to make sure that cannot happen again because, \nwhen we talk about what has contributed to this country's debt and \ndeficit, the largest contribution by far are the supportive votes of \nthose who were friends of Wall Street, and in the last 10 years have \ngiven them every single opportunity to do what they have done--that is, \nto create a casino-like economy and to have FDIC-insured banks trading \non their own proprietary accounts.\n  They may just as well have had a blackjack table in the lobby. I \nmean, it is unbelievable. To fuse together inherently risky investment \nbanks with FDIC-insured banks and having both of them, instead of \nproviding the kinds of things banks used to provide--that is, doing \nlending--and having both of them trading securities on their own \nproprietary accounts in order to make big fees and big money. It is \nunbelievable.\n\n  The question is, Who will stand up for our economic interests? \nSpending on someone who is out of work in a deep recession, is that \nwhere you want to take your last stand?\n  Let me help with a couple other suggestions. How about making a last \nstand in asking people, like one person who made $3.6 billion in one \nyear, to pay their fair share of taxes to the government. My \ncalculation says that is a $300 million-a-month paycheck. When that \nperson comes home and the spouse asks, Honey, how are we doing? Every \nsingle day he can say: We are doing really well. Ten million we earned \ntoday. But even better than that, he can now say: And by the way, we \npaid one of the lowest income tax rates in America. We get to pay a 15-\npercent income tax. People who work with their hands for a living can't \ndo that. People who take a shower in the morning and after work can't \ndo that. People who work hard all day pay tax rates far higher than 15 \npercent. We have some of the biggest income earners paying just a 15-\npercent tax rate on carried interest.\n  I say to my friends: If you want to do something about the deficit, \njoin me. Let's get rid of that nonsense.\n  Or I wish they would have joined me the dozen times I have been here \ntalking about the tax dodges that allow people to avoid paying taxes by \ncreating shams. I have shown pictures of American banks that buy German \nsewer systems. You can't actually touch them. You wouldn't want to feel \nthem. You can't move them. But American banks buy a sewer system in a \nGerman city and then lease it back to the city so the city keeps using \nthe system, and the bank gets to write off a sewer system to reduce its \nAmerican tax obligation. They want all the benefits of being American, \nbut they don't want the responsibility of paying taxes. I say to \nsomebody who comes to the floor and wants to reduce the Federal budget \ndeficit: How about joining me and getting rid of these things?\n\n[[Page S2197]]\n\n  Or perhaps you could have joined me on the floor when I have shown \nthe picture of the Ugland House, now reasonably famous, a 5-story white \nbuilding on Church Street in the Cayman Islands. When I showed the \nphotograph, it was an enterprising piece of reporting by a man named \nDavid Evans from Bloomberg News who went to the Cayman Islands and \nfound a 5-story white building that in 2004 was the official home to \n12,748 corporations. No, they don't all fit in that building. I \nunderstand that. It was a legal dodge by companies setting up an \naddress in order to funnel revenue through that address to avoid paying \ntaxes to the United States. By the way, since that time, since 12,748 \ncorporations used that little 5-story house to avoid paying taxes, it \nhas now grown to over 18,000 corporate addresses, as I understand. I \nsay to my friends talking about dealing with budget deficits, how about \nhelping me on that? How about helping me close those loopholes? Those \nare unbelievably ridiculous loopholes that allow some of the people and \ncompanies who make a great deal of money to pay almost no income tax.\n  That is the tax side. I could talk forever about that, but I won't. \nBut if we got a little help on that, we would reduce the budget \ndeficit.\n  On the spending side, I have held 20 hearings on spending dealing \nwith contracting in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. There is a place \nin Iraq. If somebody ever gets there, I suggest they drive by and take \na look at it. It is American taxpayer dollars sitting in the desert. It \nis called Kahn Bani Sa'ad. We paid for it. We built it. We tried to \nbuild it. I think we spent $20 to $30 million for the first contractor \nand then fired the contractor and brought in another one. When the \nother one was finished, the money was gone. But there is a prison \nsitting on the sands of Iraq that the Iraqi Government said they didn't \nwant and would never use that our Federal Government insisted be built. \nIt is now sitting unused, and it doesn't even look like a finished \nbuilding. It is huge. Millions, tens of millions of dollars were spent, \npoured down a hole in the desert. I held 20 hearings on the most \nunbelievable waste, fraud, and abuse on war contracting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan that I think has occurred in the history of the country. \nThere is an area of spending we can tackle. We ought to tackle. There \nare so many areas for us to decide to do something about.\n  Yet the last stand on the floor of the Senate on a Monday is to say: \nWe have ratcheted up all the strength, the muscle, the courage we have \nto say we don't think those at the bottom of the economic ladder, those \nwho have lost jobs, those who are out of work, those who feel hopeless \nand helpless, those whose families are victimized, we don't think they \nought to get unemployment insurance extended or we will put enough \nconditions on it to delay it. The same folks rushed to the altar to \nsay: We can give $700 billion to the biggest financial firms in the \ncountry that ran this country into a ditch.\n  My point is not that we don't have a very serious economic problem. \nWe do. The budget deficits are unsustainable. We have to fix them. My \npoint is, there are some Johnnies-come-lately going on in this Chamber \nby people who have never come to the floor of the Senate on these \nissues in the last decade and now believe this budget deficit problem \nbegan to emerge on January 1 a year ago. That is not the case. This \nbudget deficit problem, which is serious, results, in significant part, \nbecause this country ran into a very serious economic recession. It was \nnot some natural disaster such as a flood, a fire, or tornado we \ncouldn't do anything about. This was manmade. I warned about it 10 \nyears ago. Those warnings were largely ignored.\n  Bad choices and bad policies have brought us to this position. Now it \nis required of us to make good choices. One of the good choices would \nbe to recognize our responsibility to those at the bottom of the \neconomic ladder, the folks who have, millions of them, lost their jobs \nin this recession and didn't do anything wrong. They weren't \nunderperformers at work. They just were swept away by a very \nsubstantial recession. They paid for unemployment insurance in their \npaychecks. We all do.\n  My hope is we will get some cooperation on this vote today. It is a \nvote by which an effort to extend unemployment insurance for those who \nare the most vulnerable in the country has been blocked so we have a \ncloture petition. It ripens today at 5:30. My hope is we can do that \nand then move ahead.\n  There are plenty of us who are anxious to work on reducing the \nFederal budget deficit. This government needs to tighten its belt in a \nwide range of areas. There is no question about it. The spending side \nis important. We need to tackle the spending side and do it seriously. \nBut it is not the only side. There is a whole series of folks who are \nnot paying taxes who should pay. There are some of the biggest \ncorporations in the country avoiding taxes that they should be paying. \nWe ought to bring in the revenue we are required to bring in, ask some \nto pay what everybody else is paying, and we also ought to tighten our \nbelt. All of that can help us address this very serious economic \nproblem.\n  Let me look forward again 2 weeks to say if this is the last stand by \nthose who are worried about the Federal budget deficit; that is, trying \nto make those at the bottom of the economic ladder, the most vulnerable \nAmericans, wait and wonder whether they will get help from this \nCongress--if that is their last stand, 2 weeks from now, when we take \non Wall Street reform and decide to do the things that are necessary to \nfix what caused this economic problem, fix what caused a substantial \nportion of the Federal budget deficits and fix what caused this deepest \nrecession we have been in since the Great Depression, will we not get \nsome help in 2 weeks? By the way, the bill that came out of the Banking \nCommittee is a good first step. It needs to be strengthened in a number \nof areas. But even that bill didn't get any Republican support, not one \nvote in the Banking Committee. There are a lot of people here who \nsupport making sure that we are not too aggressive in trying to deal \nwith the Wall Street folks and Wall Street interests. If we are not \naggressive enough to make sure we have closed the loopholes and make \nsure we have tightened the reins so the American people have some \nconfidence this will not happen again, we will rue the day if we end \nwith a result that doesn't measure up in the minds of the American \npeople.\n  Again, my point is to suggest we have a very serious, unsustainable \nbudget deficit. It ought not to be surprising to anybody in this \nChamber, moving along for a decade, fighting wars without paying for \nthem, running into a very deep recession with revenues drying up when \nexpenditures increase for economic stabilization. That is not \nsurprising. But we need to come together and work together to find ways \nto not only get the taxes paid that are owed while at the same time we \nreduce the Federal budget deficit through those means, tighten our \nbelts, and do the things that are necessary to move away from a decade \nof irresponsibility. If we are going to fight a war, send men and women \noff to war but don't have the courage to pay for it along the way, that \nis unbelievable to me. I have been to so many sendoffs, and every one \nof my colleagues has.\n  We are prepared to take people away from their families and send them \noff. I was just at Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo last week visiting the \ntroops. They are away from home for a year. They have courage. When the \ncountry asks, they go. When they are called, they don't ask why. \nShouldn't this Congress have the same courage to say: If we are going \nto send people to war, we will pay for it; we will have to ask the \nAmerican people to pay the cost of that war? That is another \nsignificant part of this debate about how to deal with Federal budget \ndeficits.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I may speak \nfor up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S2198]]\n\n                   Prospective Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nbriefly about the prospective vacancy in the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States with the resignation of Justice Stevens. I do so to urge \nthe President to select a nominee without regard to any threats of a \nfilibuster. I urge the President to make his selection of whomever he \nbelieves to be the best qualified to handle the responsibilities with a \nview to academic excellence, professional experience, and intellect to \ncarry on the battle, where we have seen the Supreme Court veer very \nsharply to the right.\n  Let's be candid about the Supreme Court being an ideological \nbattleground today. That happens to be the fact. When some decry \njudicial activism, what could be more judicial activism than reversing \nthe 100-year precedent that corporations may not engage in political \nadvertising, as the Supreme Court did in Citizens United, in a \ncontortion of procedural maneuverings to take a case with an isolated \nissue with a predetermined obvious purpose of changing the law on that \nvery vital subject for the operation of our democracy?\n  We had Chief Justice Roberts, in the confirmation proceedings, under \noath, swear he would not, quote, ``jolt the system.'' Well, there have \nbeen quite a number of jolts in the system with his key vote. We had a \nvery extensive questioning and commentary about Chief Justice Roberts' \ndeference to congressional fact-finding. Only Congress has hearings, \nhears witnesses, and makes determinations of fact-finding. When the \nvoting rights came up, all of that seemed to have been forgotten.\n  We have a situation where it is obvious the Supreme Court makes the \ncutting-edge decisions on the law of the land. The Supreme Court, it \nturns out, decides who will be President in Bush v. Gore--a decision \nstrictly along political partisan lines.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States decides what will be the law \nwith respect to campaign finance reform, as we seek to make a \ndetermination as to how we can limit the expenditures in political \ncampaigns--the very core of the democratic process.\n  In Buckley v. Valeo, in 1976, the Supreme Court said that, under the \nFirst Amendment, speech equals money. It seemed to me at the time that \nwas a farfetched decision. Now, with Citizens United, we find that \ncorporations are somehow persons, somehow entitled to first amendment \nrights and can advertise in political campaigns.\n  The Supreme Court decides who will live and who will die, decides \nwhat is the extent of the death penalty. The Supreme Court decides the \nextent of a woman's right to choose--Casey v. Planned Parenthood. The \nSupreme Court decides about the power of the State to take private \nproperty in eminent domain. And so the cases go on and on and on.\n  I have sought, for more than a decade now, to have the Supreme Court \ntelevised, and twice during my tenure as chairman or ranking member of \nthe Judiciary Committee the committee reported out favorably \nlegislation to require the Supreme Court to be televised, unless there \nwas some extraordinary circumstance invoked by the Court. More \nrecently, in this Congress, I have modified that effort with \nlegislation which recommends that the Supreme Court televise its \nproceedings.\n  When Bush v. Gore came up, then-Senator Biden and I wrote to Chief \nJustice Rehnquist urging that the Court allow that monumental case to \nbe televised so the public could see it, considering the very limited \nnumber of people who could gain access.\n  When I went over to the Court that day--being one of the few who \ncould gain access to the Court--the block was surrounded with \ntelevision cameras because of so much public interest. But the cameras \ncould not go inside. That day the Supreme Court, with the Chief \nJustice's order, did change practice and allowed an audio transcript to \nbe released immediately thereafter.\n  I believe Congress has the authority, should it choose to do so, to \ndirect the Supreme Court to permit its proceedings to be televised. The \nSupreme Court, in a series of cases, has said the public has a right to \nknow what is going on inside the courtroom, and that was the case which \ninvolved Richmond Newspapers. Well, in an electronic era, where the \npublic gets so much of its information via television or via radio, \nthere ought to be that access.\n  But the Congress has the authority to determine when the Court starts \nto function each year: the first Monday in October. Congress sets a \nquorum for the Court: six. Congress can set the number of Justices on \nthe Court, as evidenced by the effort by President Franklin Roosevelt \nin the mid to late 1930s to increase the number of the Supreme Court to \nsome 15.\n  Obviously, we cannot tell the Supreme Court what to decide, how to \ndecide, but we can tell them about administrative matters. And the \nCongress has the authority to tell the Court which cases to take. So \nthere is a broad range of matters where the Congress cannot act.\n  I modified the effort I had to have the Supreme Court televised--\ninstead of ``requiring it'' to ``recommending it''--because in the \nfinal analysis the Court can make a determination on separation of \npowers if Congress imposes a requirement that can be overruled by the \nCourt.\n  But if the public had access to what was going on in the Supreme \nCourt, it seems to me there would be a clamor to have more openness, \nmore transparency, and greater public appreciation of the fact that the \nSupreme Court is a battleground.\n  When considerations are made about--as the Sunday talk shows have \nfilled the airwaves just yesterday--a number of Senators from the other \nside of the aisle left the filibuster on the table, would not rule it \nout, the question of what is judge-made law. Well, that is very much in \nthe eye of the beholder as to what is judge-made law.\n  But I would urge the President not to pay any heed to that. When we \nstart to engage in the subtleties of a nominee who will be among the \nfive instead of the four, I suggest that is a stretch beyond making any \ndetermination. That is, I believe--well, it was candidly said trying to \npersuade Justice Kennedy to be among five, as it is speculated with \nsome pretty solid foundation that Justice Stevens succeeded in \npersuading Justice Kennedy to side on the issue of habeas corpus.\n  We had Rasul v. Bush, where Justice Stevens--in a very learned \nopinion, tracing the authority of detention from the Magna Carta down \nthrough habeas corpus--made a determination that habeas corpus was a \nconstitutional right. The case then came to the Court of Appeals for \nthe District of Columbia, and in a contorted opinion--at least \ncontorted in my judgment--the Circuit Court for the District of \nColumbia said it was on statutory grounds and not constitutional \ngrounds. But reading Rasul v. Bush, starting with the Magna Carta and \ntracing the constitutional evolution, it certainly, as a fair reading \nwould say, was on constitutional grounds.\n  Then Boumediene v. Bush came up, and on the petition for cert, only \nthree Justices voted to hear the case, and Justice Stevens was not \namong them. Had Justice Stevens voted to hear the case, there would \nhave been four Justices to take up the case and it would have been \ndocketed and it would have been heard. But Justice Stevens voted not to \nhear the case. It was speculated at that time widely that Justice \nStevens felt if the Court took the case habeas corpus would be \nrejected.\n  We had the long fight on the floor of this body, and I offered an \namendment to restore habeas corpus, which was defeated 51 to 48 on the \nmilitary commissions act. I predicted at that time the Supreme Court \nwould eventually overrule the congressional determination and reinstate \nhabeas corpus as a constitutional right.\n  Then there came to light information in the military commissions \nabout some very questionable practices, and there was a subsequent \npetition for reconsideration for a grant of cert. On a petition for \nreconsideration on a grant of cert, it takes five votes. Four votes are \ninsufficient. You have to have five votes to have cert granted and cert \nwas granted. Justice Stevens and Justice Kennedy joined the other three \nJustices in the petition for reconsideration to grant cert.\n  In Boumediene v. Bush, the Supreme Court said that habeas corpus, in \nfact, was a right. Well, those are speculative and those are \nsubtleties. But my own thinking on the subject is the President ought \nto appoint somebody who\n\n[[Page S2199]]\n\ncan be in a sense a warrior in this ideological battle which is going \non across the green in the Supreme Court. That is what is happening.\n  If a new nominee is only a fourth, well, there may be an opportunity \nfor a fifth. President Obama is not halfway through his second year. \nWho knows what the future will hold on the electoral process or who \nknows what the future may hold with respect to Supreme Court vacancies. \nBut there may well be an opportunity for subsequent appointments to the \nSupreme Court.\n  It is my hope there will be a nominee whom the President feels \ncomfortable with ideologically. Interestingly, when President Obama was \nSenator Obama, as the record shows, he voted against Chief Justice \nRoberts for confirmation. In his statement he pretty much acknowledged \nChief Justice Roberts'--then Judge Roberts--competency and \nqualifications but disagreed with him on philosophical and ideological \ngrounds.\n  But what goes on inside that conference room is known only to the \nJustices. It is very small, very simple, situated right behind where \nthe Chief Justice sits in court, if you walk right in back of that. I \nthink relatively few people have had an opportunity to see that \nconference room. It is written about as a place where only the Justices \ncan go. If there is a knock on the door, as is frequently reported, it \nis the junior Justice who answers the door. But what goes on inside \nthat conference room decides the cutting-edge questions of the day. It \nis my hope that the replacement will be someone with solid academic \ncredentials, solid professional credentials, the intellect and really \nthe ability to carry on that battle, which is an ideological \nbattleground within that Supreme Court conference room.\n\n  I urge further that the President look beyond certain judges. Today, \nthe nine Justices, including Justice Stevens, all come from the courts \nof appeals from the circuits. Well, there is great talent beyond the \ncircuits. When Brown v. Board of Education was decided, I believe only \none had been a circuit judge. Why not look for an ex-Governor like Earl \nWarren? Why not look for an ex-Attorney General like Robert Jackson? \nWhy not look for an ex-Senator or a current Senator, like Hugo Black, \nwho was a Senator when he was selected for the Court, or perhaps even \nan ex-President? William Howard Taft had been President of the United \nStates and later served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  So I believe we ought not to be concerned about it. As divisive as \nthe Senate has become and as partisan and as gridlocked as the Senate \nhas become, I believe there are 60 votes in this Chamber to reject the \nconcept of a filibuster and that the President ought to have a free \nhand in selecting his choice in accordance with the considerations \nwhich I have outlined.\n  I thank the Chair, and in the absence of any Senator seeking \nrecognition, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, we are here to move forward on extending \nunemployment benefits, which is long overdue. They expired April 5. We \nhave thousands and indeed hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens \nacross the Nation who need this assistance.\n  In my State of Rhode Island, it has become even more necessary. Not \nonly are we seeing unemployment rates ranging around 12 percent, but \nlast week we endured the worst flooding in the history of our State. It \nhas swept through a large portion of our State. Senator Whitehouse and \nI have been going from town to town and neighborhood to neighborhood. \nPeople's homes have been engulfed in water, up through the first floor. \nThey have lost their utilities. They have lost their appliances. They \nhave lost their precious mementoes--everything. We have also had \ncommercial operations that have been flooded. Our largest mall in the \nState, Warwick Mall, has been completely inundated. It has been closed \nnow for almost 2 weeks. Literally hundreds and hundreds of employees \nhave not been able to work. They are now eligible, through no fault of \ntheir own, for unemployment compensation. So we have to do this. This \nis an example of one State, but it is throughout this whole country.\n  What is also adding further necessity to the legislation before us is \nthat--what we have found is that our Federal, State, and local \nofficials have been extraordinarily prompt in responding to the \ndisaster. I thank the President. He very quickly issued a Presidential \ndisaster declaration for Rhode Island and parts of Massachusetts, as \nwell as other areas of New England. FEMA has been on the ground. They \nare doing a very good job. But for someone who has lost their home and \nall of their possessions, someone who also may have lost their business \nsimultaneously, every moment is precious. Despite the extraordinary \nefforts of the men and women of FEMA, the Small Business \nAdministration, EPA, the Corps of Engineers, State officials, and local \nofficials, we have to do much more for these people.\n  One of the ironies is that--one of the benefits of the Small Business \nAdministration is essentially providing loans to households and to \nbusinesses; however, they are limited unless these businesses can get \nflood insurance. Private flood insurance is out of sight financially.\n  Public flood insurance has been without authorization. In this \nlegislation, we will have a temporary extension of the National Flood \nInsurance Program. Let me translate that into practical terms. SBA in \nRhode Island could go to a business and say: You have had physical \ndamage. We can lend up to $2 million to you. Unfortunately, because you \ncan't get flood insurance, we are limited to giving you $14,000. When \nyou offer that to someone who is desperate, who is seeing hundreds of \nemployees without work, who is trying their best--in fact, even the \nidea of taking another loan is a very great leap forward. To say: You \nneed $100,000 or $500,000; we can give it to you, but--it is the \nclassic catch-22. In this legislation, we can extend this program, even \nfor several weeks, but allow individuals in these affected areas to \nqualify for what they need.\n  In terms of home loans, the limit is not that high, but it could be \nup around $40,000 for personal property and $200,000 for real estate. I \nhave been in homes where the damage is excessive. Yesterday, I walked \ninto a home in Cranston, RI, and a father and his two grown sons were \nripping up the tiles. The whole first floor has to be gutted and \nreplaced. They may just try to do it on their own, they may try to seek \nbank lending, but it would be nice if they could get the full support \nof the Federal Government, as we intended when we passed the SBA laws \nand disaster relief laws.\n  In terms of economic injury, if there is a business that has lost all \nof its inventory, that has to close, that has just lost business \nbecause of the flood, they, too, can qualify for loans--and again, the \ntotal is up to $2 million. However, without flood insurance, the cap is \n$5,000. So going to someone who has lost all of this and saying to \nthem: Well, let me explain the intricacies. You can get this, but you \ncan't get this. If Congress acts, you can get this. We have to do much \nmore for our citizens. If these programs are available, we have to make \nthem truly available.\n  One of the consequences, frankly, of this political jousting back and \nforth is we lose sight of the effect on our constituents, the effect on \nreal people and real problems. As a result, they are looking at us here \nand saying: What is going on? You have authorized the program. You have \nthe money to loan me up to $2 million, but you can't because you can't \nauthorize another program. We might understand that procedurally. We \nmight understand the delays we see here, et cetera. But the American \npublic doesn't understand it. They have a problem; they expect their \ngovernment to respond, particularly when the programs are already \nauthorized, when the programs are there, and we have done it in the \npast. I would hazard a guess that every Member in this Chamber has \nused--or their constituents have used Federal flood relief programs, \nagriculture relief programs. I supported every one of them because when \nAmericans are facing a natural disaster, they need all of us to rally \nbehind them and support them.\n\n[[Page S2200]]\n\n  Well, now is the time in Rhode Island and Massachusetts. We need that \nsupport. For people to oppose it--oh, we object to this or that--that \nis not what we are called upon to do. We have people who are desperate \nbecause of a natural disaster. We need unemployment compensation for \nthose people and for the thousands who are still looking without \nsuccess for jobs, and we also need it to assure the people that their \nwelfare is our goal. That is what we do. We can sort out the nuances of \nconflicting programs and conditions, et cetera, so that they get the \nhelp they need.\n  So I hope we can move through this motion to proceed and get on to a \nserious debate. I personally believe we have to extend unemployment \ncompensation through the end of the year. This ``Perils of Pauline'' \nevery 30 days leaves people to wondering what is happening to them.\n  I was in a diner yesterday in Rhode Island, and a woman stopped me \nand said: When are you going to extend unemployment insurance? I don't \nknow if I am going to get it. I am running out of resources.\n  This is a woman who has worked all of her life. In fact, she told me \nshe had been laid off once before because she didn't have the training, \nand then she went and got education through a Federal program, moved \ninto administration, and was just let go by her company because of the \ndownsizing. She played by the rules, she has done everything asked of \nher as a citizen, and she is just waiting there.\n  We have to do more. So I hope the logic of our constituents might \noverwhelm the logic of this Chamber at the moment.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I now ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, April 13, \nfollowing a period of morning business, the Senate resume postcloture \ndebate on the motion to proceed to H.R. 4851; that at 2:15 p.m., all \npostcloture time be yielded back, the motion to proceed be agreed to, \nand the Senate proceed to consideration of H.R. 4851.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I would say I have had a number of conversations with the \nmajority leader and Senator Coburn and I think we have a way to move \nforward tomorrow afternoon.\n  Madam President, I was talking to the distinguished Senator from Ohio \nand we were saying, he and I, how much Lula Davis knows. She even \nrecognized I made a mistake. I don't do it very often. I was referring \nto the Republican leader, not the majority leader. I would like the \nRecord to reflect that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I would agree about the part about Lula Davis, for \nsure.\n  We have all been back in our State for the last 2 weeks. I have been \neverywhere from Marietta to Cleveland to Toledo to Defiance to \nYoungstown to Columbus to Dayton--all over my State. There are a lot of \nthings I hear. Of course there is a lot of pain. There are a lot of \npeople who are looking for work, a lot of people who believe they are \nabout to lose their health care or they have lost their health care.\n  I heard a lot, frankly, of gratitude that Congress moved on this \nhealth insurance bill so that now, immediately, small business people \nin Ohio, whether they are in Marion or Mansfield, whether they are in \nWarren or Wapakoneta, have a much better chance because of these tax \nbreaks that take effect immediately to insure their employees, \nsomething that most small businesses I know, whether they are in New \nHampshire or Ohio, want to do.\n  Also, we did not hear much of this during this debate, but the number \nof people who came up to me--and the majority leader was talking to me \nand he sees this in Nevada too--the number of people who came up to me \nin Youngstown or Cleveland or Bay Village or different places who have \n22-year-old daughters or 20-year-old sons who might be home from the \nArmy or home from college, finished college, finished their time in the \nArmy and they do not have insurance and they cannot find a job with \ninsurance. As a 23-year-old, it is pretty hard to find a job with \ndecent health insurance. They like this new law because it means they \ncan stay on their parents' health insurance until the age of 26. I \nheard people all over the State, in the 2 weeks I traveled in Ohio in \nthe time since we have been talking here, talking with senior citizens \nin senior centers, talk about closing the doughnut hole. So the bill \nPresident Bush pushed through more than anything gave huge subsidies \nand giveaways to the drug companies and the insurance industry but now \nwe are taking care of the seniors by closing the doughnut hole at the \nsame time this health care bill will provide the seniors once a year an \nopportunity to get a physical with no copay.\n  In spite of the difficulties people face, there is good news that \nway.\n\n[[Page S2201]]\n\nThere is some light at the end of the tunnel.\n  When I was at a GM plant in Defiance, they are beginning to hire \npeople to build the engine for the Cruise. The Cruise will be assembled \nin Lorantville, OH. They are hiring 1,100 people on the third shift. \nThat was a decision President Obama made at the urging of many of us in \nthe Senate--Senator Casey, Governor Strikland in Ohio, many others--to \nenforce U.S. trade laws on oil country tubular steel which we use for \npiping for oil and gas lines--oil and gas drilling. That company in \nYoungstown, V Star Steel, is hiring 400 people and probably more in \nthe future.\n  We are hearing some pieces of good news. That doesn't mean anyone \nthinks this recession is over. It does not mean there is yet that much \ngood news. It means people are still struggling and it shows how \nimportant it is to do what we did today. In spite of 34 Republicans \nopposed to the bill, we were able to get 4 Republican votes. I applaud \nthe four of them: the newest Senator here, Senator Brown from \nMassachusetts; Senators Collins and Snowe from Maine, the neighboring \nState of the Presiding Officer; and Senator Voinovich, the senior \nSenator from my State--Senator Voinovich, who is retiring at the end of \nthe year. They all voted to move forward on unemployment compensation.\n  It is too bad that Senator Coburn and Senator Bunning, day after day, \ntried to block the extension of unemployment. It looks as though we are \ngoing to be able to move forward now.\n  There seems to be some misunderstanding about what unemployment is. \nIt is not called unemployment welfare, it is called unemployment \ninsurance. That means all of us who are lucky enough, in this economy \nwe have been in in the last couple or 3 years, to have jobs, all pay \ninto an unemployment fund, we pay into an insurance fund. If we lose \nour jobs, the money we have paid in as insurance, we get assistance. \nMany people never receive unemployment insurance, just as some people \ndon't use their health insurance if they are healthy. But those who are \nsick sometimes get more money out of their health insurance than they \nput in. Some people put into unemployment insurance, get more out if \nthey lose their jobs and they are unemployed for a long time. That is \nwhy this bill is so important, because it is unemployment insurance.\n  That means if people lose their jobs, they should get some help. It \nis the right thing to do morally. It is also the right thing to do for \nthe economy because if people are getting unemployment insurance, they \nare spending that money in Zanesville at the local drugstore, they are \nspending that money in Cambridge at the local grocery store, in \nSpringfield and Xenia, OH, to buy books and to buy clothes for their \nkids for school. So unemployment insurance gives the economy a bump and \nsome help and some stimulus. It goes back into the economy quicker than \nanything else government can do--unemployment insurance. That is the \nother reason it is important.\n  Then I heard my colleagues say we are for unemployment insurance \nextension and we are for helping with COBRA, the health care subsidy, \nso people can stay in their health care plan after they have lost their \njob and get some assistance from the government to do that because it \nis expensive. My colleagues say we want--we are OK with that, we think \nit is all right, but we have to pay for it.\n  There are certain emergency situations over the years that government \nhas made a decision that you need to respond to quickly. You don't have \nto cut spending somewhere else or increase taxes to pay for it.\n  That is what I hear my colleagues say, but they never talk about how, \nwhen they voted for tax cuts for the richest Americans, that was added \nto the budget deficit. So a few rich people got huge tax cuts and my \nkids and grandchildren pay for it. They don't mention that.\n  They don't mention this war in Iraq which they enthusiastically \nsupported, costing us $1 trillion in terms of the costs of war and the \ncosts of veterans' benefits and the costs of veterans' health care. \nThey did not pay for that.\n  They don't talk about the Medicare privatization bill, the giveaway \nto the drug companies and the insurance companies and how they did that \nand didn't pay for that.\n  It is only unemployment. It is only unemployed workers. Now they get \nsome fiscal religion. All of a sudden they are for a balanced budget. \nThey are not for a balanced budget in paying for the war, not for a \nbalanced budget in paying for tax cuts for the rich, not for a balanced \nbudget when they are shoveling subsidies to the insurance companies and \ndrug companies, but all of a sudden it is unemployed workers, people \nwho are struggling, people who have paid into this insurance fund, \npeople who send out--listen to them in your State in Hanover or in \nMansfield, OH, listen to people say how they are sending out 10 and 20 \nand 30 and 50 resumes a week to try to find jobs and they still can't \nfind them. We are going to penalize them and say we are not going to \npay for it, but they will not on the cost of war or the cost of \nveterans' benefits or the cost of tax cuts for the rich and the cost of \nthe giveaways to the drug and insurance companies.\n  Let me close with this. As we were home the last 2 weeks--most of us \nwere back in our States. Some were elsewhere. We talked to people more, \nbut we also get letters when we get back. We see the kinds of letters \nthat I am getting all the time from people at home. Let me read two of \nthese letters. James from Franklin County, OH--that is the middle of \nthe State where Columbus is, the State capital.\n\n       At this point in my life my future is uncertain. I have \n     been unemployed for almost a year. Along with my other former \n     co-workers from the optical lab, we continue to look for \n     jobs.\n       I am an American to the bone. I have worked nearly every \n     day of my life. I am now 55 years old.\n       Like many thousands of fellow Ohioans, our current \n     unemployment benefits are about to expire.\n       I can make it financially with two or three part-time jobs \n     to make sure I can pay for my daughter's nursing school. I \n     will live in my car if I lose my apartment, but I will make \n     sure my daughter continues her education. Please help the \n     hard-working people of Ohio.\n\n  ``I will live in my car if I lose my apartment, but I will make sure \nmy daughter continues her education.'' How can you say those people do \nnot matter as much as giving tax cuts to the rich? How can anybody in \nthis institution stand and with a good conscience and a straight face \nsay that James from Franklin County is not doing everything right in \norder to provide for his family and for the future?\n  Do not blame James for this budget deficit that this crowd in this \nbody voted for; the war, unpaid for; the tax cuts, unpaid for; the drug \ncompany subsidies, unpaid for; that James is not trying to do the right \nthing to provide for the future for his daughter to get her through \nnursing school.\n  Derek from Cuyahoga County, the State's largest county on Lake Erie, \nthe Cleveland area, writes:\n\n       I have just exhausted my unemployment benefits. I have been \n     sending resumes like crazy, but there is just no work in this \n     part of Northeastern Ohio. Pretty soon I won't be able to \n     afford my bills--or anything for that matter. I'm 26 years \n     old, don't have health insurance, and need help while I look \n     for a job. We bailed out large corporations when they were in \n     a financial jam. Why can't we help the American people who \n     are in their own financial struggle?\n\n  Unemployment benefits do not make you comfortable. They do not make \nyou rich. They are not what you plan for in the future. They are not \nsomething anybody wants to live on for very long. But they help people \nwhile they are trying to find a job. Unemployment insurance gives \npeople that helping hand. It may be another week, it may be another \nmonth or 3 months. At least four of my colleagues today voted to extend \nunemployment for a month. It should have been longer. I wish we could \ndo better. I wish we could get some Republican votes to do this right \nand to help get us on the track so people can plan better in their \nlives and can continue to go out and try to get jobs. That is what we \nneed to do. It is what this economy needs.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing this week with the \nunemployment extension and to do the right thing with the jobs bill to \nbegin to put more people in this country back to work.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S2202]]\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Madam President, I rise today to call attention to the \nimportance of quality early childhood education programs throughout our \ncountry that promote and support the growth and development of our \nNation's youngest citizens.\n  Research has shown that the quality of early relationships and \nexperiences contributes to school success, overall health, and future \nworkforce productivity. During a young child's life, there are 700 new \nneural connections formed every second, thus creating the foundation \nfor learning and more complex brain development. In fact, more than 85 \npercent of the foundation for communication: critical thinking, problem \nsolving and team work, is developed by age 5--before children enter \nkindergarten.\n  To reach their full potential, these connections need to be nurtured \nwith positive and developmentally appropriate cognitive and social-\nemotional stimuli. Quality prekindergarten programs reduce placement in \nspecial education, lower the risk of grade retention, and decrease \nincidences of juvenile crime. Improving the success rate of high school \ngraduation and adult earning potential is critical for our Nation's \nchildren. The implementation of quality early childhood education \nprograms results in both social and economic benefits for the child \ninto adulthood, as well as for the community and the Nation as a whole. \nEven conservative estimates yield a benefit/cost ratio of 2.36 and a \nsignificant long term increase in the gross national product.\n  Quality early childhood programs require the commitment and \ndedication of a professional early childhood education work force. \nToday, I recognize not only the importance of quality early childhood \neducation programs throughout our country but also the professionals \nwho have dedicated their careers to ensuring the highest levels of \nachievement in early learning for our Nation's children, thus creating \nlifelong benefits for the child, family, community, and country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2202-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2202]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SCHOOL SAFETY PATROL LIFESAVING AWARD\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to show my profound \nappreciation for the actions of five young Americans who comprise this \nyear's School Safety Patrol Lifesaving Award recipients as chosen by \nthe American Automobile Association.\n  In 1920, the American Automobile Association, AAA, began the School \nSafety Patrol Program in hopes of promoting traffic safety amongst \nschool children. The AAA School Safety Patrol Program has been awarding \nits highest honor, the Lifesaving Award, to those patrollers who have \nacted to save the life of another since 1949. This year, five heroic \nschool safety patrollers are receiving this award, and it is my great \nhonor to recognize their courageous actions.\n  Ian Valles, a sixth grader from Heights-Murray Elementary School in \nWilkes-Barre, PA, bore witness to a tragic accident the morning of \nJanuary 9, 2009. While standing at a busy intersection, Ian witnessed a \nvan strike adult crossing guard Edward Martin, who jumped in front of \nthe van to save a mother and child in its way. Ian stayed calm and \ncalled 911 with a cell phone, staying by Mr. Martin's side until he was \nsafely taken to the hospital by paramedics. Ian's heroism along with \nhis calm composure saved the life of Mr. Edward Martin.\n  On April 20, 2009, Lauren Micolichek prevented a young girl at South \nView Elementary in Chippewa Falls from being struck by a fast \napproaching car about to make a left turn into the crosswalk. Lauren \nthought quickly when she saw the student walking toward the crosswalk \nand saved her life by shouting ``wait.'' Her immediate response to the \nsituation prevented the young girl from being hit by the vehicle.\n  Charles Tate, a fifth grade safety patroller from Second District \nElementary School in Meadville, PA, also demonstrated quick action when \nhe saved a kindergarten student from crossing an intersection. The \nkindergartner began to cross the intersection while a large truck came \ndown the road. Charles ran into the middle of the road and swiftly \ngrabbed the student by his shirt, keeping him out of harm's way.\n  Michael Grady, a student at Defer Elementary School in Grosse Pointe \nPark, MI, responsibly checked both intersections before allowing a \ngroup of students to cross. He noticed a car moving toward the students \nand courageously placed himself in front of the group with his arms \noutstretched, diligently responding to the incident before the car \nreached them. Thanks to his prompt actions, Michael prevented a \ntragedy.\n  Jerome Manning was patrolling at the same elementary school in \nMichigan the morning of January 12, 2010. Jerome had been assisting the \nchildren as they crossed the intersection when he spotted a vehicle \nspeeding toward a student. Jerome's alertness enabled him to grab the \nboy by his backpack before the car could hit him. His alertness saved \nthe child from the car by about 6 inches. Jerome's quick actions have \nmade him a hero in his community.\n  These five heroic individuals epitomize values of leadership \nqualities such as courage, alertness, and a commitment to safety. \nMoreover, these traits are what the AAA School Safety Patrol Program \nembodies as an institution. Patrollers exemplify the kind of services \nthat are needed so that young people safely navigate traffic hazards to \nand from school.

Madam President, it is my pleasure to be able to \nrecognize an important project being undertaken by students at Horn \nLake Middle School in Horn Lake, MS, to learn lessons from the \nHolocaust.\n  This project was brought to my attention by Miss Sadie Hopkins who, \nwith her seventh grade classmates, has worked months to collect 1.5 \nmillion pennies--each coin representing one child lost in the \nHolocaust. Led by their teacher Susan Powell, these young people plan \nto use the pennies to understand the tragic and significant impact the \nHolocaust had on Jewish children during World War II and the ripple \neffects of that terrible time on families today.\n  I am pleased that Miss Hopkins made me aware of this project, which \nshould be viewed as an innovative endeavor in making history more real \nfor our youth today. It has opened these students' minds to an \nimportant era in history and put them in touch with some of those whose \nlives were directly affected by the Holocaust. I commend the Horn Lake \ncommunity for supporting this ongoing educational effort.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord an article titled, ``Horn Lake Middle School students collecting \npennies for Holocaust project,'' from the DeSoto Appeal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Commercial Appeal, Nov. 25, 2009]\n\n   Horn Lake Middle School Students Collecting Pennies for Holocaust \n                                Project\n\n                          (By Chris Van Tuyl)\n\n       A teaching wall just inside the front entrance of Horn Lake \n     Middle School is really doing its job.\n       Posted squares urge those passing by to consider this: \n     ``The estimated population of DeSoto County is 154,748. If \n     each person gave 10 pennies, we would have 1.5 million \n     pennies.''\n       It would be an awful lot of coinage for an awfully \n     worthwhile cause. It's a school project spearheaded by \n     seventh-grade Spotlight students currently studying World War \n     II--with a significant focus on the Holocaust. Each penny \n     would stand for one child lost in the Holocaust.\n       ``The pennies will be used in an online museum,'' Horn Lake \n     Spotlight teacher Susan\n\n[[Page S2203]]\n\n     Powell said. ``We will host a (virtual) room, and this is \n     being done through an organization (Christian Friends of \n     Israel) in Memphis. We are going to assist them. The kids are \n     brainstorming on what to do with the pennies.''\n       Seventh-grade language arts teacher Melissa Swartz has an \n     idea, and it involves her artistic husband.\n       ``We've talked about getting enormous frames built, lay the \n     pennies out side by side, have Michael come in and help the \n     kids create some kind of Holocaust scene,'' Swartz said. \n     ``It's about getting the kids involved because we want them \n     to have the biggest part of this.''\n       On Monday, students were on the receiving end of a speech \n     from an 81-year-old Holocaust survivor.\n       ``Lovely lady,'' Powell said. ``Many of the children are \n     the same age (12) that the survivor was when she was taken \n     from her home. They would feel her pain if they were moved \n     and their family members were killed. She knew immediately \n     that her parents were sent to the concentration camp.''\n       Added Swartz: ``They were just entranced. I've never had a \n     group of students as involved as mine are this year. They've \n     totally embraced everything about it.''\n       Studying this part of history hits home for Melissa and \n     Michael, as both are Jewish.\n       ``My husband's family cannot be traced back past World War \n     II,'' said Melissa, ``and I have wonderful and not-so-\n     wonderful stories that I relay to the kids. Some have happy \n     endings and some don't.\n       ``So many of our kids have extended family right here with \n     them--a grandmother, a great-grandmother--they have all of \n     that. My husband doesn't.''\n       As part of the penny project, the Horn Lake students are \n     writing letters to community leaders and to President Barack \n     Obama.\n       ``We would like for this to be something that all the \n     students in DeSoto County help us with,'' Powell said. ``We \n     know we can reach our goal.''\n       Swartz is also attempting to contact Jewish celebrities \n     such as Whoopi Goldberg, Jerry Seinfeld, Ben Stiller and \n     David Beckham.\n       ``I'm going to get their fan mail addresses or whatever,'' \n     she said. ``We're going to send (letters) and tell them, `We \n     want your pennies!' ''\n       Pennies from the community can be dropped off at the \n     school, 6125 Hurt Road.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2203-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Madam President, I rise today to honor the Center for \nExcellence in Education, CEE, for launching the first National Lab \nSkills Symposium. As an honorary member of the board of trustees for \nthe center, I have witnessed firsthand the important work CEE had \nundertaken, and I could not be more impressed and excited about its \nnewest endeavor.\n  Improving science education is an essential investment toward the \nfuture of our Nation and world. Since it was founded in 1983 by Joann \nDiGennaro and the late ADM H.G. Rickover, CEE has been an influential \nleader in championing efforts to provide science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics initiatives for this Nation's top \nachieving students.\n  With over 25 years of experience as a leader in STEM academic \nprograms for high school students, CEE understands exactly what it \ntakes to prepare future innovators for the 21st century; and it is \nprepared to take further steps to ensure that students develop the \nskills they need. Consequently, after data from both of CEE's world-\nrenowned scientific enrichment programs, the Research Science Institute \nand the USA Biology Olympiad, demonstrated that even our Nation's best \nand brightest students are receiving inadequate training in laboratory \nskills and practices, CEE initiated the National Lab Skills Symposium \nto address the poor quality of instruction and learning in our Nation's \nscience and technology labs.\n  CEE held its first such symposium from April 8-9, in Washington, DC, \nto discuss best practices in laboratory education and to determine the \nways in which high school teachers throughout the country can use these \nbest practices for the teaching of laboratory skills to students for \nsuccess in STEM careers.\n  Before holding the symposium, CEE examined laboratory education \nprograms across the United States, seeking those programs that follow \nthe most cost-effective, sustainable, and replicable models for \nteaching students practical lab skills. CEE found six programs it \ndeemed exemplary, which were recognized at the symposium. These \nprograms also served as a framework that attendees, which included \ninfluential members of academia at the high school and university \nlevels, nongovernmental organizations, governmental agency \nrepresentatives, and corporate leaders, could evaluate and reference \nwhen developing a set of best practices for laboratory education. CEE \nplans to implement the symposium's best practice recommendations in \nseveral States within 2 years and hopes to eventually adopt them \nnationwide.\n  I applaud the efforts of CEE to address the crisis in lab skills, and \nI am confident that this new initiative will help us to ensure that the \nUnited States fields a talented and diverse workforce in science and \ntechnology for years to come. I commend CEE's president, Joann \nDiGennaro, for the leadership and vision she has demonstrated in \nputting together the National Lab Skills Symposium. I have no doubt \nthat Admiral Rickover is saluting this latest effort.\n  I ask that all of my colleagues join me in recognizing the Center for \nExcellence in Education for all it has done to assure the Nation's \neconomic growth and national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2203-4", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2203-S2204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JOYCE REVELL\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I would like my colleagues to join me in \nthanking Joyce Revell for 21 years of exemplary service to the U.S. \nSenate and on wishing her well during her retirement.\n  Joyce Revell has dedicated her life to the service of our Nation and \nto the citizens of Maryland. At age 18, she joined the U.S. Army, where \nshe served for 2 years. In 1977, she joined the staff of Senator Paul \nSarbanes, where she became an integral part of his State office staff, \nproviding information and service to constituents. In 2007, I was \nfortunate and privileged when Joyce agreed to join my staff when I was \nsworn into the U.S. Senate.\n  Joyce is one of the most outstanding caseworkers I have ever met, and \nshe has developed an expertise in a field that is often difficult and \nheartbreaking. Joyce's knowledge of immigration law rivals any attorney \nin the field, and thousands of Marylanders over the years have sought \nher advice and counsel when navigating our Nation's immigration \nprocess. Her advocacy on behalf of those who need a\n\n[[Page S2204]]\n\nvoice has often resulted in new American citizens, reunited families \nand helped place adopted babies and children in loving homes.\n  Through her years of service to the Senate, Joyce has become familiar \nwith a number of Federal agencies and departments and she has been more \nthan willing to share her considerable institutional knowledge. In \nfact, her expertise and knowledge is so extensive that employees of the \nU.S. Customs and Immigration Service, as well as other congressional \nand Senate offices, often look to Joyce for guidance and information.\n  I also want to take a moment to mention Joyce's professional skills \nand her approach to her cases. She has an emotional connection to the \nconstituents who contact her, but she is always calm, professional and \ninformative, even in the face of the most severe hardship. She will \nprovide constituents with the right answer, even if it is not the one \nthey want to hear.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Joyce on her many \nyears of dedicated service to our Nation. I also want to take this \nopportunity to thank Joyce's husband Paul, daughter Kate, and son Paul \nMichael for sharing Joyce with the U.S. Senate. I wish her the all best \nin her future endeavors. She will be greatly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2204-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TRIBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL MARC HOFFMEISTER\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Madam President, I wish to recognize a fine Alaskan, \nbrave warrior, dedicated military leader, and inspiration to all who \nknow him. LTC Marc Hoffmeister is an Army engineer and wounded warrior \ncurrently serving on the staff of Alaska Command on Elmendorf AFB, AK. \nLieutenant Colonel Hoffmeister may well be one of the most outstanding \nand motivational military leaders I have had the pleasure of knowing.\n  Wounded by a roadside bomb while deployed to Iraq in 2007, he \nsuffered both traumatic brain injury and a very serious physical injury \nto the left side of his body, injuries that threatened possible long-\nterm disability and a possible end to his military career. Lieutenant \nColonel Hoffmeister had long been committed to his career as well as a \nlife focused on the outdoors. He and his wife Gayle had a long \nreputation of intense physical training and extreme outdoor adventure. \nNow he was facing the very real possibility of a life without either.\n  Today Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmeister, through sheer determination, \ndedication, and the help of his wife Gayle, is still serving our \ncountry and still taking on the most extreme outdoor challenges. This \nfact did not happen overnight and came at a cost--a long stay in the \nhospital, intense rehabilitation, and much physiological effort to come \nto grips with a life that would be different but not debilitated.\n  During his recovery Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmeister came in touch with \nscores of other wounded warriors all dealing with life-changing \nchallenges and the need to rise above them and continue living. His \nability to help these young warriors who had made selfless sacrifices \nin service to our country turned out to be a significant motivation for \nhis own recovery.\n  Recently Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmeister completed climbing the \ntallest mountain in North America. At 20,320 feet, Mount McKinley, \nDenali, is referred to as ``The Great One'' and is located about 150 \nmiles north of Anchorage. On this climb, Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmeister \ntook other wounded warriors, two of whom were amputees. Three members \nof this team, including Lieutenant Colonel Hoffmeister, made the \nsummit. The climb, called Operation Denali, was planned and lead by \nLieutenant Colonel Hoffmeister and was designed to show wounded \nwarriors around the country their physical and mental injuries are not \nthe end but rather a beginning of a new life.\n  Marc and his wife recently went to South Africa and climbed Mount \nKilimanjaro in Tanzania as another example of ``anything is possible,'' \neven in the face of extreme physical adversity. They both continue to \nbe involved in the wounded warrior program and are routinely asked to \nprovide motivational speeches to organizations around Alaska. \nLieutenant Colonel Hoffmeister was recently chosen as the National \nGeographic Readers Choice Adventurer of the Year for 2009.\n  Madam President and colleagues, please join me in recognizing the \nefforts of true warrior, hero, leader, and humanitarian, LTC Marc \nHoffmeister, U.S. Army Alaska. We thank him for his dedication, drive, \nand selfless service both to his fellow wounded warriors as well as the \nUnited States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2204-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2204-S2205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      2010 ALASKA WINTER OLYMPIANS\n\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Alaska is very proud to have these \nsix outstanding athletes competing in this year's Winter Olympics.\n  Callan Chythlook Sifsof of Girdwood, AK, competed in the snowboard \ncross competition. Callan is the first Alaska Native to make the U.S. \nWinter Olympic team. She grew up in a part of Alaska known as ``the \nBush'' and spent her first years in a village along the Bering Sea. \nBefore moving to Girdwood, Callan never imagined herself as an \nOlympian. She holds the double title of 2007 U.S. national champion and \njunior national champion in boardercross.\n  Jeremy Teela's home town is Anchorage, AK. He finished ninth in the \n10-kilometer biathlon sprint during the 2010 Winter Olympics, the best \nAmerican result to date in biathlon. A member of the 2002, 2006, and \n2010 U.S. Olympic teams, Teela's career has spanned more than a decade \nof impressive finishes. He has been a member of the U.S. national team \nsince 1996.\n  Jay Hakkinen, of Kasilof, AK, is a three-time Olympian, and his 10th \nplace finish in the Olympic 20-kilometer individual biathlon \ncompetition in 2006 solidified his reputation as one of the top \nbiathletes in the United States. Jay's career began when he spent his \njunior year of high school in Norway as a foreign exchange student. \nThere he found a biathlon club; it was then he decided to focus on \nbiathlon and began pursuing the sport.\n  Kikkan Randall, from Anchorage, AK, made her Olympic debut in the \n2002 Winter Olympics. At the 2006 Winter Olympics, Kikkan finished \nninth in the Olympic sprint, the best Olympic result in cross-country \nskiing by an American woman. She topped that in 2010, finishing eighth \nin individual sprint classic. Kikkan helped her team finish in sixth \nplace in the 2010 Winter Olympics women's team sprint freestyle race.\n  James Southam is from Anchorage, AK. He started racing in high \nschool, and, after training for 10 years, he won his first ski race at \nage 25. Since then, James has been one of the top distance racers in \nthe country, representing the United States in the 2006 Olympic winter \ngames and the past three world championships. In the 2010 Olympic \nwinter games he placed 34th in the men's 30-kilometer pursuit.\n  Holly Brooks moved to Alaska in 2004. Upon her arrival, she started \nher second coaching job as the head ski coach for West Anchorage High \nSchool and worked part time at a ski shop and for a local consulting \nfirm. In 2006, she was offered a full-time ski coaching position at \nAlaska Pacific University Nordic Ski Center. In 2010, Holly competed in \nthe 10-kilometer freestyle and 15-kilometer pursuit at the Olympics.\n  Kerry Weiland is originally from Palmer, AK. Kerry started playing \nhockey at age 5 and later excelled on the Palmer High School boys' \nhockey team and continued on at the University of Wisconsin, where she \nwas a two-time All-American. Kerry scored a key goal in the game \nagainst Sweden, which moved the United States onto the gold medal \nround. She is now a proud member of the 2010 U.S. Winter Olympic silver \nmedal hockey team.\n  Madam President and colleagues, please join me in recognizing the \nefforts of Alaska's finest winter athletes. We thank them for their \ndedication, hard work, and representation of the United States and \nAlaska at the 2010 Winter Olympics.\n\n[[Page S2205]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2205-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        REMEMBERING DOUGLAS L.

Shriver, 53, and Raymond Brett Wright, 56, both of \nColorado's San Luis Valley, lost their lives in an accident near \nCreede, CO. These men were active leaders in their communities and \nparticularly engaged in water-related issues across Colorado and in the \nSan Luis Valley.\n  Water is a scarce and precious resource in Colorado. In working to \nprotect Colorado's water, Doug and Raymond also worked to protect \npublic health, sustain agriculture, support Colorado's economic \ninterests, and maintain the vast parks, wildlife, and wilderness for \nwhich Colorado is world-renowned. Our State is forever indebted to Doug \nand Ray, for their hard and generous work has been to the benefit of \nall who live in Colorado.\n  Doug served as chairman of the Rio Grande Water Users Association and \nas the vice chair for the Rio Grande Basin Roundtable. He was an avid \noutdoorsman who enjoyed golf, boating, fishing, hunting, sporting \nclays, snow machining, and cross country skiing. Beyond his leadership \nin protecting Colorado's water supply, he gave back to his community by \ntutoring fourth and fifth graders at the Bill Metz Elementary School. \nHe is survived by his wife Karla, his mother Zola, and siblings Deanna, \nLarry, Kay, Randy, Jean, and David.\n  Ray served as board president for the Rio Grande Water Conservation \nDistrict. He also had a strong passion for the outdoors and enjoyed \nhunting, fishing, skiing, and building and flying his own bamboo fly \nfishing rods. A keen intellect and sharp memory made Ray stand out, and \nhe will be remembered by those who love him as an affectionate man who \nlived life to its fullest. He is survived by his daughters Susan, Sara, \nand Lauren, granddaughter Brynn, and siblings Diana and Greg.\n  Doug and Ray were well respected for their hard work, intelligence, \nand congeniality. I join Coloradans in grieving the loss of these \npublic servants, and my prayers go out to their families. Colorado is a \nbetter place as a result of these two men. The works of Doug Shriver \nand Ray Wright will affect Coloradans for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2205-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING EDWARD EUGENE CLAPLANHOO\n\n Ms. CANTWELL.

Mr. Claplanhoo was also chair of \nthe United Indians of All Tribes Foundation Board for 5 years. He was \nknown for his ability to build consensus with his calm and steady \nleadership.\n  Mr. Claplanhoo was chair of the tribe in the 1970s when the Ozette \narchaeological dig was underway in the Makah village of Ozette. He \nworked with Dr. Richard Dougherty of Washington State University to \nensure that the artifacts from the site remained on the reservation, \nand was instrumental in the foundation of the Makah Cultural and \nResearch Center, a museum which now displays the heritage of the \ncommunity.\n  A proud graduate of Washington State University, Mr. Claplanhoo \nbelieved strongly in the power of education and encouraged young people \nto seek advance degrees. He was also an Army veteran and last year \ndonated land to establish a monument to veterans and to the Spanish \ninfluence at Neah Bay.\n  Mr. Claplanhoo will always be remembered for his many contributions \nto the Makah Tribe and all the tribes of Washington State, as well as \nthe many others in the State whose lives he touched.

For half a century, Na Haumana O Hawai'i has been spreading \nthe culture and traditions of Hawaii to Pacific University, enriching \nthe school and surrounding communities.\n  Na Haumana O Hawai'i was founded in 1959 by 16 students from the \nislands of Hawaii. Since then, it has expanded its membership to more \nthan 200 students and includes Native Hawaiians as well as those \ninterested in learning more about Hawaiian culture. One of the ways \nthat Na Haumana O Hawai'i shares the Hawaiian culture with the local \ncommunity is through its annual lu'au. It is the only completely \nstudent-run and student-directed lu'au in the Northwest. Each year, \nabout 2,000 people attend the lu'au and celebrate the Island heritage, \nwhich includes an authentic lu'au meal and traditional Polynesian \ndance, music and entertainment.\n  Na Haumana O Hawai'i has made a tremendous impact on Pacific \nUniversity, Oregon, and our Nation. By bringing to the mainland a taste \nof Hawaii's cultural tapestry, Oregonians and Americans have been able \nto enjoy the State's rich Aloha spirit. I know that all Oregonians will \njoin me in congratulating Na Haumana O Hawai'i on the occasion of its \n50th anniversary and annual lu'au.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2205-4", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2205-5", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and withdrawals which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On Page S2205, April 12, 2010, in the third column, the \nfollowing appears: MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE Enrolled Bill Signed At \n1:22 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the \nSpeaker has signed the following enrolled bill: H.R. 4957.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide for \nthe tolling of the timing of review for appeals of final decisions of \nthe Board of Veterans' Appeals, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to urge passage \nof the bill I have just introduced, the Fair Access to Veterans \nBenefits Act of 2010. Its main provision would require the United \nStates Court of Appeals for Veterans Claims, known as the Veterans \nCourt, to hear appeals by veterans of administrative decisions denying \nthem benefits when circumstances beyond their control--sometimes the \nvery service-related disabilities that entitle them to benefits--render \nthem unable to meet the deadline for filing an appeal. Let me briefly \nexplain why this legislation is so urgently needed.\n  Until 1988, veterans denied benefits by the administrative Board of \nVeterans' Appeals had no right to appeal their cases to any court. \nCongress responded that year with legislation establishing the Veterans \nCourt. The legislation's purpose was to ``ensure that all veterans are \nserved with compassion, fairness, and efficiency and that each \nindividual veteran receives . . . every benefit and service to which he \nor she is entitled under law'', S. Rep. 100-418, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. \n30-31. Proceedings of the Veterans Court were to be ``informal, \nefficient, and fair'' rather than ``formalized'', H.R. Rep. No. 100-\n963, 110th Cong., 2d Sess. 26, 1988. This was important because most \nveterans handle their own appeals without a lawyer.\n  Veterans Court has, by and large, served its intended function well. \nIt regularly corrects many erroneous denials of benefits. The court's \nlast-published annual report notes that, in 2008, veterans prevailed in \nabout eighty percent of the appeals.\n  A recent court decision, however, will close the Veterans Court to \ntoo many deserving veterans. I refer to last year's decision of the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which hears \nappeals from Veterans Court, in Henderson v. Shinseki, 589 F.3d 1201. \nMr. Henderson suffered from paranoid schizophrenia as a result of his \nactive-duty service in the Korean War. His appeal of an administrative \ndenial of benefits to the Veterans Court was filed just 15 days late. \nHe asked the Veterans Court to excuse his late filing--in legal \nparlance, to ``equitably toll'' the filing period--because it was \ncaused by his service-related disability. The Veterans Court refused to \ndo so, and a divided Federal Circuit affirmed its decision. Like the \nVeterans Court, the Federal Circuit held that\n\n[[Page S2210]]\n\nthis unjust result was compelled by a controversial 2007 decision of \nthe Supreme Court, Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, which held that the \ndeadline for filing a notice of appeal from a district court's order is \n``jurisdictional'' and hence not waivable. Three judges dissented in \nHenderson on the ground that Bowles was distinguishable.\n  Whether or not correctly decided in the wake of Bowles, Henderson \ncannot stand. It creates, in the words of the three dissenting judges, \na ``Kafkaesqe adjudicatory process in which those veterans who are most \ndeserving of service-connected benefits will frequently be those least \nlikely to obtain benefits. It is the veteran who incurs the most \ndevastating service-related injury who will often be least able to \ncomply with rigidly enforced deadlines.'' Even two of the judges in the \nmajority felt constrained to note, in a concurring opinion, ``that the \ndeadline of the existing statute can and does lead to unfairness. This \nis particularly so in many cases where the veteran is not represented \nby counsel . . . and/or is suffering from a mental disability. These \ncircumstances can make it extremely difficult for a veteran to navigate \nthe system and meet the statutory deadlines.'' Mr. Henderson's \nsituation is not unique. Already a disturbing number of veterans just \nlike him have been denied their day in court.\n  The two concurring judges in Henderson called upon Congress to \n``amend the statute to provide for a good cause exception. My bill \nwould do just that. It would require the Veterans Court to excuse late \nfilings upon a showing by the veteran of ``good cause.'' This simple \namendment will ensure that each year upwards of a hundred of veterans \nwill receive the benefits to which they are so justly entitled.\n  My bill will also require the Veterans Court to reinstate untimely \nappeals already dismissed as a result of that court's failure to \nequitably toll the filing period. The veterans who filed those appeals \nshould also have their day in court.\n  There are no countervailing policy considerations. As the dissenting \njudges in Henderson persuasively noted, ``because it takes many years--\nin some cases several decades--to obtain service-connected benefits, \nthe government is hardly in a position to complain that equitable \ntolling will result in inordinate delays.''\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, whatever their views \non the issue addressed in Bowles, to support our veterans by passing my \nbill without delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 3194. A bill to provide collective bargaining rights for public \nsafety officers employed by States or their political subdivisions; \nread the first time.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the \nbill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3194\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Safety Employer-\n     Employee Cooperation Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DECLARATION OF PURPOSE AND POLICY.\n\n       The Congress declares that the following is the policy of \n     the United States:\n       (1) Labor-management relationships and partnerships are \n     based on trust, mutual respect, open communication, bilateral \n     consensual problem solving, and shared accountability. Labor-\n     management cooperation fully utilizes the strengths of both \n     parties to best serve the interests of the public, operating \n     as a team, to carry out the public safety mission in a \n     quality work environment. In many public safety agencies, it \n     is the union that provides the institutional stability as \n     elected leaders and appointees come and go.\n       (2) State and local public safety officers play an \n     essential role in the efforts of the United States to detect, \n     prevent, and respond to terrorist attacks, and to respond to \n     natural disasters, hazardous materials, and other mass \n     casualty incidents. State and local public safety officers, \n     as first responders, are a component of our Nation's National \n     Incident Management System, developed by the Department of \n     Homeland Security to coordinate response to and recovery from \n     terrorism, major natural disasters, and other major \n     emergencies. Public safety employer-employee cooperation is \n     essential in meeting these needs and is, therefore, in the \n     National interest.\n       (3) The Federal Government needs to encourage conciliation, \n     mediation, and voluntary arbitration to aid and encourage \n     employers and the representatives of their employees to reach \n     and maintain agreements concerning rates of pay, hours, and \n     working conditions, and to make all reasonable efforts \n     through negotiations to settle their differences by mutual \n     agreement reached through collective bargaining or by such \n     methods as may be provided for in any applicable agreement \n     for the settlement of disputes.\n       (4) The absence of adequate cooperation between public \n     safety employers and employees has implications for the \n     security of employees and can affect interstate and \n     intrastate commerce. The lack of such labor-management \n     cooperation can detrimentally impact the upgrading of police \n     and fire services of local communities, the health and well-\n     being of public safety officers, and the morale of the fire \n     and police departments. Additionally, these factors could \n     have significant commercial repercussions. Moreover, \n     providing minimal standards for collective bargaining \n     negotiations in the public safety sector can prevent \n     industrial strife between labor and management that \n     interferes with the normal flow of commerce.\n       (5) Many States and localities already provide public \n     safety officers with collective bargaining rights comparable \n     to or greater than the rights and responsibilities set forth \n     in this Act, and such State and local laws should be \n     respected.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 476\n\n       Whereas, on April 10, 2010, the President of the Republic \n     of Poland Lech Kaczynski, his wife Maria, and a cadre of \n     current and former Polish statesmen, family members, and \n     others departed Warsaw by plane to the Russian region of \n     Smolensk;\n       Whereas the purpose of the delegation's visit was to hold a \n     ceremony in solemn remembrance of the more than 22,000 Polish \n     military officers, police officers, judges, other government \n     officials, and civilians who were executed by the Soviet \n     secret police, the NKVD, 70 years ago, between April 3 and \n     the end of May 1940;\n       Whereas more than 14,500 Polish victims have been \n     documented at 3 sites in Katyn (in present day Belarus), in \n     Miednoye (in present day Russia), and in Kharkiv (in present \n     day Ukraine), while the remains of an estimated 7,000 Polish \n     victims have yet to be precisely located;\n       Whereas the Soviet Union failed to acknowledge \n     responsibility for the massacres until President Mikhail \n     Gorbachev's statement on April 13, 1990;\n       Whereas, on April 7, 2010, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir \n     Putin became the first Russian or Soviet leader to join \n     Polish officials in commemorating the anniversary of the \n     murders;\n       Whereas the plane carrying the Polish delegation on April \n     10, 2010, crashed in Smolensk, tragically killing all 96 \n     persons on board, including President Kaczynski, his wife, \n     and other current and former Polish statesmen;\n       Whereas President Kaczynski was a steadfast proponent of \n     consolidating freedom and prosperity in Poland and advancing \n     them throughout Central and Eastern Europe and was a close \n     friend of the United States of America; and\n       Whereas the deep friendship between the Governments and \n     people of Poland and the United States is grounded in our \n     mutual respect, shared values, and common priorities on \n     nuclear nonproliferation, counterterrorism, human rights, \n     regional cooperation in Eastern Europe, democratization, and \n     international development: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the terrible tragedy that took place on \n     April 10, 2010, when an aircraft carrying a delegation of \n     current and former Polish officials, family members, and \n     others crashed en route from Warsaw to Smolensk to \n     memorialize the 1940 massacres, killing all 96 passengers;\n       (2) honors the life and legacy of the late President of \n     Poland Lech Kaczynski and the lives and legacies of all Poles \n     who perished in the plane crash on April 10, 2010;\n       (3) honors the lives and legacies of the more than 22,000 \n     Polish government officials, military officers, and civilians \n     who were executed by the NKVD 70 years ago, between April and \n     May 1940;\n       (4) expresses deep sympathy for the surviving family \n     members of those who perished at the hands of the NKVD in \n     1940 and for the surviving family members of those who \n     perished in the tragic plane crash of April 10, 2010;\n       (5) supports the people of Poland as they restore \n     leadership in the institutions of the Government of Poland \n     that were impacted by the crash of April 10, 2010; and\n       (6) requests that the Secretary of the Senate transmit an \n     enrolled copy of this resolution to the Ambassador of Poland \n     to the United States.\n\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to honor the lives of President Lech \nKaczynski, his wife, and 94 others who perished in a plane crash on \nApril 10, 2010. President Kaczynski was a steadfast supporter of \nadvancing freedom and prosperity in Poland and throughout Central and \nEastern Europe and was a close friend of the United States. It is with \ntragic irony that this devastation has occurred at a time of solemn \nremembrance of the massacre of Polish officers and civilians in the \nKatyn Forest and elsewhere 70 years ago. Together with the Polish \nnation and friends of Poland worldwide, I mourn this unbelievably \ntragic loss. With these sentiments in mind, I am introducing this \nresolution honoring the lives of President of Poland Lech Kaczynski, \nhis wife, and 94 others who perished on April 10, 2010 in a plane crash \nwhile en route to memorialize those Polish officers, officials, and \ncivilians who were massacred by the Soviet Union 70 years ago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/12/senate-section/article/S2212-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2212-S2213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 477--HONORING THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND LEGACY OF CESAR \n                             ESTRADA CHAVEZ\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ (for himself, Mr. Reid, Ms. Stabenow, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. \nBoxer, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Schumer, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \nBingaman, Mr. Brown of Ohio, Mr. Udall of New Mexico, and Mr. Wyden) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.
