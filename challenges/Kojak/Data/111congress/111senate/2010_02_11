Mr. President, one of the most gratifying things about \nspending a good deal of time in the Senate, as I have, is the optimism \nthat comes from seeing talent renew itself year after year. I have had \nthe good fortune of having many talented staffers over the years, and \nthe staff I have now is an incredible group. But every one of them will \ntell you that when Kyle Simmons gets up from his tidy desk and walks \nout of his office this Friday, the office they return to on Monday will \nbe a very different place.\n  It has been said that no one is indispensable, and that may be true. \nBut few of us can imagine S-229 without Kyle Simmons in it. So it will \ntake some adjusting. And part of that adjustment involves doing \nsomething this week that Kyle never did. We are going to speak well of \nhim. We are going to talk about his many virtues. We are going to make \nhim a little uncomfortable. Because every single person on my staff \nknows what it's like to be singled out for a good piece of work, or for \ngoing above and beyond the call of duty; everybody, that is, except our \nchief of staff. Now it is our turn.\n  The first thing to say about Kyle is that he is humble. And that is \nreally saying something in this town. Most people in Washington look in \nthe mirror in the morning and think they see a future President. Not \nKyle. If he looks in the mirror at all in the morning, I would imagine \nthat what he sees is the son of a Baptist minister who was blessed with \na privilege he didn't seek and who has tried to earn that privilege \nevery single day, regardless of how well he did the day before. As he \nused to tell his father, ``Dad, I'm always just one mistake away from \nlooking for a job.''\n  He had a modest upbringing. But he excelled at everything. One day \nwhen Kyle was about 10 years old, he made his way over to the Tate's \nCreek public golf course and picked up a club. Soon\n\n[[Page S546]]\n\nenough, he was a better golfer than his dad. It was sign of things to \ncome--a sign that for him, as for so many others in this country before \nand since, success would come not from who he knew or where he came \nfrom, but from hard work and the determination to succeed.\n  When Kyle showed up in Washington, he didn't have any connections. He \ndidn't have an Ivy League degree. He didn't even have a job. All he had \nwas some furniture he got from his grandfather, and a lot of talent. He \ngot evicted from the first place he rented because the owner of the \nbuilding wanted to tear the building down. As his old friend and \nroommate at the time put it, ``We were just two country bumpkins in a \ncrowd . . . We just wanted to pay our electric bills.''\n  There were times, I am sure, when back home didn't look so bad. And \nafter a series of jobs outside government and a brush with politics \nduring the 1992 Presidential campaign, Kyle decided he had been in \nWashington long enough. And so he moved back home to Kentucky, but this \ntime with enough experience under his belt to run a corporate \ncommunications shop in Louisville and that is just what he was doing \nwhen I first met him on an elevator at the old Seelbach Hotel.\n  I had just lost my press secretary, and we struck up a polite \nconversation--the second thing you notice about Kyle is that he is \nunfailingly polite--and then we pulled a Cheney on him. We asked him if \nhe wouldn't mind coming up with a list of candidates for us, which he \ndid with characteristic diligence. And when he had gone through his \nlist, we asked him if maybe he would be interested in the job. Soon \nafter that, he was sitting at a desk in the Russell Senate Office \nBuilding.\n  He was a quick study. Not even a year had passed before I knew that \nKyle was the guy I wanted to manage my next campaign. I sent him down \nto the office I have always used out on Bishop Lane in Louisville, and \nhe did a flawless job. In a year when Bill Clinton got reelected and \ncarried Kentucky for the second time, Kyle got me reelected by 12 \npoints. It was a landslide, a truly remarkable feat.\n  After that, he just went from success to success. After returning \nfrom Kentucky, I put him in charge of my office. It was one of the best \ndecisions I ever made. Nothing rattled him, and he was always, always, \nthinking of the one thing that no one else had thought of.\n  Whether it was taking apart what I had thought to be a terrific idea \nand patiently explaining to me why it wasn't such a good idea, or \nmapping out a legislative or political strategy when everyone else was \nready to take a break, he became the calm navigator in the middle of \nthe storm--the one person in the office who never took his eye off the \ndestination we had set. And when it came to smoking out some unforeseen \nproblem or vetting some proposal for potential pitfalls, he was, and \nis, quite simply, the best I have ever seen. It was a skill I always \nthought I was pretty good at. But Kyle was better. And it is impossible \nto overstate the value of that kind of mind in politics.\n  Many of the people who might be listening to me right now are \nprobably asking themselves why they have never heard of this guy. That \nis no accident. Kyle was never in it for himself. I know as well as I \nknow the sun's coming up tomorrow that through three Senate elections, \ntwo whip races, two leader races, and countless legislative efforts in \nbetween, that he never put his own interests ahead of my own. He was as \nloyal as he was effective. He has made me look better than I am for 15 \nyears. And nearly everything I have accomplished over that time I owe, \nin large part, to him.\n  He always deflected attention. And if he was suspicious of anything, \nit was the glory seekers, the people who like to talk about themselves. \nIt is something he just never did. He kept his own counsel and kept to \nhimself. As his mother used to say, ``Kyle can keep silent in 30 \ndifferent languages.''\n  But if you ever do get Kyle to talk about his accomplishments, he \nwill probably tell you that his proudest professional achievement was \nfinding a talented group of people in Washington, DC, who had the same \nattitude about the limelight and about empty praise that he does. He \nwill tell you the thing he's proudest of is the staff he put together--\nand that he will soon leave behind.\n  But he was always the one who set the example.\n  On any given day over the past few years, any visitor to our office \ncould be excused for wondering who the tall gentleman was out in the \nreception room asking one of our new staff assistants whether she'd \nfound an apartment yet, and whether it was in a safe neighborhood.\n  ``I'd never be able to look your parents in the eye if anything ever \nhappened to you,'' he would say.\n  Anyone who had the privilege of sitting in one of our morning staff \nmeetings could be excused for wondering who the guy was at the end of \nthe table who seemed to know absolutely everything--from the \nlegislative details to the fact that some of the Senate pages would be \ngraduating later that day, that one of them was from Kentucky, that his \ndad had just died, and that our No. 1 priority in the office that day \nwould be to make that young man feel like a million bucks.\n  Any visitor to our office could be excused for being astonished at \nseeing that same tall gentleman walk away from a room full of CEOs to \nfocus on a staff issue or at seeing him sneak out during an important \nvote so he could get home just a little while to see his little girl \nbefore she went to bed.\n  Anyone would be amazed how he could manage such a high-pressure \nenvironment with such efficiency, focus, and vision, without ever \nlosing his sense of humor. He inspired confidence in the staff and he \ninspired loyalty.\n  Everything I ever asked him to do he did well, especially when he had \nevery excuse not to. I asked him to manage a campaign, even though he \nhad never managed a campaign before. I asked him to run my office, even \nthough he had never run an office before. I asked him to put together a \nleadership staff, even though he had never done that before. He had \nnever done any of these things, but he excelled at every one, and he \nnever needed the praise. I assure you, that kind of person is in very \nshort supply in Washington.\n  Someone once said, the best business in the world would be to buy \nsomeone for what they are worth and to sell them for what they think \nthey are worth. It was never that way with Kyle. He was always worth \nmore than he thought he was, and that is why he will succeed at \nwhatever he chooses to do.\n  In the meantime, he leaves a legacy. I cannot tell you how many \nSenators have come up to me over the past week to tell me how much they \nwill miss his counsel, his advice, and his steady hand. He has left a \nlot of himself in this place, and it is the better for it.\n  Above all, though, Kyle leaves his example. It is the example of \nsomeone who showed you could be committed to winning and gracious at \nthe same time; that you could be intensely focused, without losing \nsight of the human beings around you. It is that combination of \naggressiveness and caution, political savvy and humanity that anyone \nwho has worked with Kyle has come to admire and will miss.\n  Now that he is leaving, I am just as confident our office will carry \non as it always has because he leaves a fantastic team behind. That is \nbecause Kyle's solution to everything was to throw the smartest people \nin the room at the problem, to find the best talent but not just any \ntalent. He only wanted people who would rather be on a team than on the \nstyle pages of the Washington Post--in other words, people like him: \nhonest, intelligent, kind, straightforward people with humility, a deep \ncommitment to excellence, and always a sense of humor.\n  You do not get those qualities in Washington. You bring them here. In \nKyle's case, that means he brought them from a quiet street in \nLexington, KY, and, more specifically, from the home of Bill and Barbie \nSimmons.\n  Anyone who ever spent any time at the Calvary Baptist Church, where \nKyle's dad served as pastor, could tell you there was one thing Bill \nSimmons could always count on when he climbed into the pulpit, whether \nhe was presiding over a Sunday service, a funeral, a wedding--you name \nit--Mrs. Simmons would always be out there, always sitting in the same \nspot. She was always there as a point of reference, as a point of \ncomfort for her husband. When I think of what Kyle has meant\n\n[[Page S547]]\n\nto me over the past 15 years, I cannot help but think that is exactly \nwhat he has been to me. He has been that steady presence in the midst \nof it all. As long as he was there, the team was confident things would \nturn out well, and they always did.\n  To me, he has been more than a staffer. He has been a colleague, a \nconfidant, and a dear friend.\n  Kyle once summed up his approach to the job, and I would like to \nshare it because every Senator should be so fortunate as to have a \nchief of staff who would write such a thing. It is from a letter he \nleft on the chair of my other chief of staff, Billy Piper, the day \nBilly took Kyle's job in the personal office 7 years ago.\n  After a brief introduction, here is what Kyle wrote:\n\n       Billy . . . while you sit here you are no longer simply \n     Billy Piper. You are Billy Piper, Senator Mitch McConnell's \n     chief of staff. Carry the privileges and responsibilities \n     just as you have throughout your outstanding career--with \n     humility and honor. . . .\n\n  Kyle went on:\n\n       . . . it's a constant struggle while balancing the demands \n     on your time to remember your audience: the people of \n     Kentucky, the staff who looks to you for leadership, and \n     Senator McConnell. . . . We're only here for a short period \n     of time--and few of us have made it to where you now sit. Do \n     us proud.\n\n  He was honored to serve the Senate and his country. Yet, at the end \nof that service, he knew he had a more important job still. It was the \njob of husband and father. That is why, to paraphrase Macbeth, nothing \nbecame Kyle's service to the Senate more than the leaving of it. His \nfirst love was and is his dear wife Carrie and their beautiful daughter \nAva and the Senate could not compete with that--as much as it tried to, \nespecially these last few months.\n  So he has made the right decision, as he usually does. But that does \nnot change the fact that he leaves behind an office and a boss who will \nmiss him terribly.\n  Kyle, thank you so very much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S547-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, there is nothing I can say to assuage the \nanguish that my friend, the Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, now \nfeels. It is a unique relationship that comes with our staff members, \nespecially someone who has been with us as many years as Kyle has been \nwith Leader McConnell. These people become part of us. As we can see, \nKyle Simmons has become part of Mitch McConnell.\n  My dealings with Kyle Simmons are meetings that are held in my office \nor in Senator McConnell's office, and if there were a way to describe \nmy dealings with Kyle Simmons, it would be to go to the dictionary, \nunder the Hs, and go to the word ``humility,'' and there would be Kyle \nSimmons. He is just as Mitch McConnell described him. He is a man who \nhas loads of humility. He does not talk very often. But whenever he \ntalks, we listen.\n  So I wish you the very best, Kyle, in the things you do, and I \nrecognize that your boss, Mitch McConnell, was speaking for the entire \nSenate in our relationships with our staff. But, of course, even though \nthere are many relationships with our staff, I think the relationship \nbetween Senator Mitch McConnell and Kyle Simmons, as we can see, is \nvery unique.\n  The best of luck to you, Kyle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S547-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S547]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following the leader remarks of Senator \nMcConnell and myself, the Senate will proceed to a period of morning \nbusiness, with Senators permitted to speak for up to 10 minutes each. \nWe are going to lay down our jobs bill today so we can begin its \nconsideration when we return after the recess. There is no question the \nsnow has interfered with our work. It would be nice if we could say: \nOK, then, we are just going to move on next week and pretend next week \nwas this week, but as I told somebody outside before I came in here, \nwhen we leave Washington, we do not go home to relax and take it easy. \nWe have constituencies in the State of Minnesota, the State of \nKentucky, the State of Illinois, the State of Nevada. We have to take \ncare of it. We have appointments and things we have to do, and we \nschedule them long ahead of time.\n  So we are going to come back after the Presidents Day recess \nenergized and make up for this snow day, snow week, and do the very \nbest we can. The jobs bill we are moving forward on is not as big as \nthe one in different elements of the legislation, but it is one that is \nextremely important. It is going to deal with jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs--\nfour times--because all four elements of our jobs bill will deal with \ncreating jobs immediately, as the Congressional Budget Office said, \ncreating jobs immediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S547-4", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S547-S548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do wish to comment about the health care \ndebate. One Republican Senator said during this debate what we need is \nto ``get out of the way and allow the market to work.'' Well, we had an \nexample of it working pretty well for the insurance industry a couple \ndays ago. In fact, a large insurance company in California, insuring \nalmost 1 million people, individuals, decided they would raise their \nrates this year 39 percent--1 year. I think it is fair to say it is a \nlittle above inflation.\n  Well, when someone talks about get out of the way and let the market \nwork, they are talking about doing nothing. That is what it means. \n``Allowing the market to work'' is a code word for letting greedy \ninsurance companies--companies that care more about profits than \npeople--get richer while people who can already barely afford their \ncoverage lose their coverage altogether.\n  Cover this with the fact that these insurance companies--and this \ninsurance company--are not subject to any antitrust laws. The only \nbusiness in America not subject to antitrust laws other than Major \nLeague Baseball is the insurance industry. So one is raising its rates \nby 39 percent. That is many times more than the rate of inflation. And, \nit is reserving the right to raise them again whenever they feel like \nit. Instead of just once a year, they can raise it more than once a \nyear if they want to. They can do whatever they want, and they do \npretty much whatever they want.\n  What does this mean? It means people will not be able to afford \ncoverage at all in many instances. It means more people will be living \none accident, one illness, one injury away from a pink slip or losing \neverything.\n  It goes without saying, in the year 2008, 750,000 bankruptcies were \nfiled in America. Eighty percent of those bankruptcies were because of \nhealth care costs, and almost 70 percent of those people who filed \nbecause of health care costs had health insurance.\n  A lot of companies are hurting in this economy. But this California \nhealth care company is not one of them. Last year, its parent company \nraked in eight times what it made in the same quarter the year before. \nWhat is this all about?\n  It is not the first time we have seen this happen. Just 2 months ago, \nanother exceedingly profitable insurance company raised its rates with \nthe full knowledge it would mean 650,000 people would not be able to \nafford the coverage.\n  That is as many people who are in some of our States.\n  That is what happens when we allow the health insurance market to \nwork the way it does. That is what happens when we sit back and wait \nfor insurance company executives to act out of the goodness of their \nhearts instead of acting in the interests of their wallets. That is why \nwe need health reform like the bills already passed in the House and in \nthe Senate that will rein in insurance company abuses and make coverage \nmore affordable for millions of Americans and provide coverage for some \n30 million who have no health insurance.\n  Health care costs take up a larger slice of our economy than ever \nbefore, and it is not slowing down. In less than a decade, it is going \nto be $1 of every $5 we spend. In less than a decade, half of a \nfamily's income will be spent on health care premiums.\n  It doesn't have to be that way. Californians don't have to be priced \nout of\n\n[[Page S548]]\n\na healthy life. We don't have to let greedy health insurance executives \ndrag down our future, but that is what they are doing and have done.\n  I, once again, urge Republicans to work with us in good faith to fix \nour broken system. The President has reached out: Come on down. Tell us \nwhat plans you have. I encourage those Republicans to listen to the \nAmerican people, two-thirds of whom said last week they want Congress \nto finish the job we started with health care reform.

Now I wish to speak about another great Federal \nemployee.\n  Across the country, Americans are receiving their W-2 forms and \ntaking stock of their finances in advance of April's tax filing \ndeadline. For families, the ritual of filing income taxes repeats \nitself each year, and, admittedly, it isn't very much fun.\n  Taxes have been an emotional and thorny subject in American history \never since colonial patriots rallied around the cry of ``No Taxation \nWithout Representation.'' Indeed, though federal tax rates for personal \nincome are low compared to most other developed countries, complaining \nabout paying taxes remains one of our national pastimes.\n  This is understandable. It is linked to the strong national attitude \nin our country that taxpayers' money should never go to waste. When \nAmericans grumble about taxes, I believe it is not because they oppose \nthem in general; rather, it is because they want to make sure that \ntheir money is spent wisely, fairly, and without unnecessary waste.\n  One of the chief complaints about taxes in years past was that filing \nwas a time-consuming and confusing process. Many can remember those \ndays sitting in front of a pile of forms and receipts, punching away at \na calculator, pencil in hand, and a 1040-form covered in eraser marks.\n  Thankfully, because of this week's honoree, most Americans--more than \n95 million filers--avoided this headache last year by filing their \ntaxes electronically.\n  Terrence Lutes was awarded the 2005 Service to America Medal for \nCitizen Services for leading the development of the Internal Revenue \nService's e-File program.\n  Terry, who spent nearly 30 years working at the IRS, served as \nassociate chief information officer for IT Services before retiring \nfive years ago.\n  E-File not only makes it easy for taxpayers to file online and \nreceive a refund in as little as ten days; it also cuts processing \ncosts by 90 percent compared to paper filing. This benefits the \ntaxpayers two-fold. They save time and energy individually and reduce \nthe amount of their own money spent collecting their taxes.\n  Terry, who holds degrees from Eastern Kentucky University and the \nUniversity of Colorado, first became involved with electronic filing in \n1996. As the head of the IRS's Electronic Tax Administration, he became \nthe government's evangelist for online tax filing. E-File had been \navailable for years, but it was costly for the IRS to operate and \ndifficult for taxpayers to navigate.\n  While redesigning the e-File system, Terry and his team focused on \ncreating innovative public-private partnerships to reduce--and \neventually eliminate--the direct cost to the taxpayer of filing online. \nHe oversaw a workforce of over 6,500 employees, and carefully managed a \nbudget of $1.5 billion. Terry cultivated relationships with software \ncompanies and tax-preparation businesses, and the results paid off.\n  In 2005, when Terry retired after a long and distinguished career in \npublic service, more than half of all tax returns were filed online for \nthe first time. Today, this number continues to rise. For most \nAmericans, what used to be a stressful experience is now fast, simple, \nand less expensive.\n  Thanks to Terry, the way Americans pay their taxes is forever \nchanged.\n  Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr., one of the great Supreme Court justices \nof the early twentieth century, once said that ``taxes are the price we \npay for a civilized society.'' I am glad to know that great Federal \nemployees such as Terrence Lutes at the IRS continue to work hard every \nday ensuring that our tax collection system is as efficient and \nresponsive as possible.\n  When I go online to file my own tax return this year, I will be \nthinking of these outstanding public servants at the IRS and all who \nwork in the Federal government.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kaufman, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Lieberman pertaining \nto the submission of S.

Mr. President, today I want to highlight several recent \nmedia reports uncovering very serious errors and possible fraud by the \nUnited Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n  First of all, let me define what we are talking about here, because \nit has been around for a long time but a lot of people have forgotten. \nWay back in 1988, the United Nations formed the IPCC--the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The whole idea was to try to \ndetermine whether manmade gases--anthropogenic gases, CO2, \nand methane--caused global warming, and if in fact global warming is \ntaking place.\n  It is hard on a day such as today, and the last few days, to be \ntalking about global warming. I often say: Where is it when you need \nit? But nonetheless, you need to know three things about the IPCC: No. \n1, the Obama administration calls it the gold standard of climate \nchange science; No. 2, some say its reports on climate change represent \nthe so-called consensus of scientific opinion about global warming; and \nNo. 3, the IPCC and Al Gore were awarded the Nobel prize in 2007 for \n``their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about \nmanmade climate change.''\n  Put simply, what this means is that in elite circles the IPCC is a \nbig deal. So when ABC News, The Economist, Time magazine, and the Times \nof London, among many others, report that the IPCC's research contains \nembarrassing flaws and that the IPCC chairman and scientists knew of \nthe flaws but published them anyway--well, you have the makings of a \nmajor scientific scandal.\n  In fact, when Climategate first came out and it was discovered that \nthey had been cooking the science at the IPCC, the UK Telegraph said: \nThis is very likely the greatest scientific scandal of our generation.\n  So where to begin? Well, how about with the IPCC's claim that the \nHimalayan glaciers would melt by 2035. It is not true. That is right; \nit is simply false. Yet it was put into the IPCC's fourth assessment \nreport. These assessment reports come out every year, and that is what \nthe media normally get. They are not scientific reports, they are \nassessments that are made for policymakers. Here is what we know:\n  According to the Sunday Times, the claim about the Himalayas was \nbased on--keep in mind we are talking about their statement that by \n2035 the glaciers would melt--that claim was based on a 1999 story in a \nnews magazine which in turn was based on a short telephone interview \nwith someone named Syed Hasnain, who is a very little-known Indian \nscientist.\n  Next, in 2005, the activist group World Wildlife Fund cited the story \nin one of its climate change reports. Yet despite the fact that the \nWorld Wildlife Fund report was not scientifically peer reviewed, it was \nstill referenced by the IPCC. It was still in their report.\n  Third, according to the Times:\n\n       The Himalayan glaciers are so thick and at such high \n     altitude that most glaciologists believe it would take \n     several hundred years to melt at the present rate. Some are \n     actually growing and many show little sign of change.\n\n  Lastly, when finally published, the Sunday Times wrote:\n\n       The IPCC report did give its source as the World Wildlife \n     Fund study but went further, suggesting the likelihood of the \n     glaciers melting was ``very high.''\n\n  The IPCC, by the way, defines this as having a probability of greater \nthan 90 percent.\n  So there you have that. But there is more. According to the Times:\n\n       The chairman [Rajendra Pachauri] of the leading climate \n     change watchdog was informed that claims about melting \n     Himalayan glaciers were false before the Copenhagen summit.\n\n  We all remember that Copenhagen summit in the middle of December. I \nwas there for 2 hours; many were there for 2 weeks. Now to continue to \nquote from the Times article:\n\n       . . . [he] was told that the Intergovernmental Panel on \n     Climate Change assessment that the glaciers would disappear \n     by 2035 was wrong, but he waited 2 months to correct it. He \n     failed to act despite learning that the claim had been \n     refuted by several leading glaciologists.\n\n  So why was the Himalayan error included? We now know from the very \nIPCC scientist who edited the report's section on Asia that it was done \nfor political purposes. It was inserted to induce China, India, and \nother countries--this was at Copenhagen--to take action on global \nwarming. According to the UK's Sunday Mail, Murari Lal, the scientist \nin charge of the IPCC's chapter on Asia, said this:\n\n       We thought that if we can highlight it, it will impact \n     policymakers and politicians and encourage them to take some \n     concrete action.\n\n  In other words, that is the motive she did it for. In other words, \nthe Sunday Mail wrote that Lal ``admitted the glacier alarmism was \nindeed purely to put political pressure on world leaders.''\n  This is what we have suspected and has been documented in the recent \nClimategate scandal. But there is still more. The glaciologist, Dr. \nHasnain, who originally made the alarmist 2035 claim, works for Dr. \nPachauri at his think tank in India. According to ABC News:\n\n       The glaciologist now works at the Energy and Resources \n     Institute in New Delhi, whose director is none other than \n     Rajendra Pachauri. Could this explain why Pachauri suppressed \n     the error in the Himalayan passage of the IPCC report for so \n     long?\n\n  Specifically, after the meeting in Copenhagen. So what has the IPCC \ndone to correct this fiasco? I went into the IPCC report to see if a \ncorrection had been made. Well, the 2035 claim is still there. It is \nstill there now. It has been denied, but it is still there. There is a \nnote attached that says the following:\n\n       It has, however, recently come to our attention that a \n     paragraph in the 938-page Working Group II contribution to \n     the underlying assessment refers to poorly substantiated \n     estimates of rate of recession and date for the disappearance \n     of Himalayan glaciers. In drafting the paragraph in question, \n     the clear and well-established standards of evidence, \n     required by the IPCC procedures, were not applied properly.\n\n  I had to read this twice to understand what it said. The IPCC says \nthe glacier alarmism came about because of poorly substantiated \nestimates. Well, that is one way of putting it. To me, from what we \nknow now, the leadership of the IPCC lied about the Himalayas. They \nknew it was false, but for political purposes they kept it in.\n  I could go on and on, but let me cite a few more examples. The UK \nTelegraph recently uncovered more problems. This is the entity that \nsaid that is probably the greatest scientific scandal of our \ngeneration. The IPCC's report from 2007 found observed reductions in \nmountain ice in the Andes, Alps, and Africa--all caused, of course, by \nglobal warming. In an article entitled ``UN Climate Change Panel Based \nClaims On Student Dissertation and Magazine Article,'' the Telegraph \nreported the following:\n\n       One of the sources quoted was a feature article published \n     in a popular magazine for climbers which was based on \n     anecdotal evidence from mountaineers about the changes they \n     were witnessing on the mountainsides around them. The other \n     was a dissertation written by a geography student, studying \n     for the equivalent of a master's degree at the University of \n     Berne in Switzerland that quoted interviews with mountain \n     guides in the Alps.\n\n  So that is the source they had. The article further reveals:\n\n       The IPCC report made use of 16 nonpeer reviewed WWF \n     reports. One claim, which stated that coral reefs near \n     mangrove forests contained up to 25 times more fish numbers \n     than those without mangroves nearby, quoted a feature article \n     on the WWF website. In fact, the data contained within the \n     WWF article originated from a paper published in 2004 in the \n     respected Journal Nature. In another example a WWF paper on \n     forest fires was used to illustrate the impact of reduced \n     rainfall in the Amazon rainforest, but the data was from \n     another Nature paper published in 1999.\n\n  On top of this, we find that the IPCC was exaggerating claims about \nthe Amazon. The report said that 40 percent of the Amazon rain forest \nwas endangered by global warming. But again, as we have seen, this was \ntaken from a study by the WWF--the World Wildlife Federation--and one \nthat had nothing to do with global warming. Even worse, it was written \nby a green activist.\n  That is the statement they made--40 percent of the Amazon rain forest \nwas\n\n[[Page S550]]\n\nin danger. So again, we have the gold standard of climate research and \na body that was awarded the Nobel prize of 2007. How can the world's \npreeminent climate body fall victim to such inaccuracy and, it must be \nsaid, outright fraud? I am sure for many in this body this information \nis shocking, but for me I am not at all surprised.\n  Five years ago, I sent a letter to Dr. Pachauri specifically raising \nthe many weaknesses in the IPCC's peer-review process, but Dr. Pachauri \ndismissed my concerns. Here is how Reuters reported his response:\n\n       In the one-page letter, [Pachauri] denies the IPCC has an \n     alarmist bias and says ``I have a deep commitment to the \n     integrity and objectivity of the IPCC process.'' Pachauri's \n     main argument is that the IPCC comprises both scientists and \n     more than 130 governments who approve IPCC reports line by \n     line. That helps ensure fairness, he says.\n\n  Here is Dr. Pachauri defending it.\n  Given the significance of the reports, Dr. Pachauri should come clean \nand respond directly to the numerous charges made against himself and \nthe IPCC. And given that Dr. Pachauri has testified before Congress, \nincluding the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, we \nshould hear directly from him as soon as possible as to how he can \nsalvage the IPCC's vanishing credibility.\n  How did we get to this point? I have been documenting deceit of this \nkind for several years now. But I must say that a great turning point \noccurred just a few months ago, when thousands of e-mails from the \nUniversity of East Anglia's climatic research unit, or CRU, were leaked \nto the media. The CRU is one of the world's most prestigious climate \nresearch centers. The e-mails appear to show some of the world's \npreeminent climate scientists manipulating data, violating information \ndisclosure laws by deleting e-mails, and blocking publication of \nresearch contrary to their own. They published only the research that \nwould verify their positions interms of global warming, in other words.\n  This revelation sparked several investigations, including one by the \nUK's Information Commissioner's Office. The office recently concluded \nthat the CRU broke the UK's Freedom of Information Act. However, as the \nTimes of London reported:\n\n       The Information Commissioner's Office decided that UEA \n     failed in its duties under the Act but said that it could not \n     prosecute those involved because the complaint was made too \n     late . . . The ICO is now seeking to change the law to allow \n     prosecutions if a complaint is made more than six months \n     after a breach.\n\n  It is a little late but none the less a good change to make. The \nTimes further reports on the details, noting:\n\n       In one e-mail, Professor Jones [former director of the CRU \n     who has now stepped down because of the scandal] asked a \n     colleague to delete e-mails relating to the 2007 report by \n     the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. He also told a \n     colleague that he had persuaded the university authorities to \n     ignore information requests under the act from people linked \n     to a Web site run by climate sceptics.\n\n  Climate skeptics, so you understand the terminology that is used \nhere, those are people like me who have looked at this and realize the \nscience is cooked. I think most people agree with that now.\n  As we know, Climategate is just the beginning. Time magazine \nreported--let's keep in mind, this is Time magazine; the same magazine \nabout a year ago that had a picture of the last polar bear standing on \nthe last ice cube saying: It is coming and you ought to be real worried \nabout it.\n  As we now know, Climategate was just the beginning.\n  Time magazine reported that `Glaciergate' is a ``black eye for the \nIPCC and for the climate-science community as a whole.'' In the article \nposted online from Thursday, January 21, 2010, Himalayan Melting: How a \nClimate Panel Got It Wrong, Time reports:\n\n       The mistake is a black eye for the IPCC and for the \n     climate-science community as a whole. Climate scientists are \n     still dealing with the Climategate controversy, which \n     involved hacked e-mails from a major British climatology \n     center that cast doubt on the solidity of evidence for global \n     warming.\n\n  The Economist newspaper, which had accepted the IPCC climate \n``consensus,'' essentially claimed that it had been duped by the IPCC. \nHere's the Economist:\n\n       The idea that the Himalaya could lose its glaciers by \n     2035--glaciers which feed rivers across South and East Asia--\n     is a dramatic and apocalyptic one. After the \n     Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said such an \n     outcome was very likely in the assessment of the state of \n     climate science that it made in 2007, onlookers (including \n     this newspaper) repeated the claim with alarm. In fact, there \n     is no reason to believe it to be true. This is good news \n     (within limits) for Indian farmers--and bad news for the \n     IPCC.\n\n  The Economist finds that, ``This mixture of sloppiness, lack of \ncommunication, and high-handedness gives the IPCC's critics a lot to \nwork with.''\n  Seth Borenstein with the Associated Press, a reporter whose \nobjectivity I have questioned at various times, asked the IPCC to \nrespond to Glaciergate. Borenstein reported in his January 20, 2010, \narticle, UN Climate Report Riddled with Errors on Glaciers:\n\n       ``The credibility of the IPCC depends on the thoroughness \n     with which its procedures are adhered to,'' Yvo de Boer, head \n     of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, told The \n     Associated Press in an e-mail. ``The procedures have been \n     violated in this case. That must not be allowed to happen \n     again because the credibility of climate change policy can \n     only be based on credible science.''\n\n  Borenstein also quotes Roger Pielke, Jr.'s concerns with the \nsignificance of the errors, writing, ``However, Colorado University \nenvironmental science and policy professor Roger Pielke, Jr. said the \nerrors point to a `systematic breakdown in IPCC procedures,' and that \nmeans there could be more mistakes.''\n  Further troubling is the revelation of several instances in which the \nIPCC relies on nonpeer reviewed work, mainly from leftwing pressure \ngroups. As the Wall Street Journal reports in an article from January \n18, ``Climate-Change Claim on Glaciers Under Fire'':\n\n       The citation of an environmental advocacy group as a source \n     within the IPCC report appears to be a rare, but not unique, \n     occurrence. That same chapter on Asian climate impacts also \n     cited work from the World Resources Institute, which \n     describes itself as an `environmental think tank.' Most of \n     the thousands of citations supporting the rest of the \n     voluminous IPCC report were from scientific journals.\n\n  Let me add also that Professor Bob Watson--first, Bob Watson was the \npredecessor to Pachauri. He said:\n\n       It is concerning that these mistakes have appeared in the \n     IPCC report . . . Dr. Pachauri must take full responsibility \n     for that.\n\n  I think it is interesting to those of us who have been stuck in \nWashington for the last 3 days because of the weather--it is a record; \nwe have not had anything like this, the snowfall and temperatures, in \nthe recorded history of Washington DC--that they are now talking about \nstarting a new agency under NOAA. That is the National Oceanographic \nand Atmospheric Administration. That is all we need is one more \nbureaucracy to talk about global warming.\n  I might add, today there is supposed to be an EPW hearing on global \nwarming, but it was canceled by the blizzard. A lot of things have been \nhappening recently, and I think it is very important that people \nunderstand how serious this matter is.\n  I have to add one thing, since I think I have 6 minutes left, about \nmy daughter Molly. My wife and I have been married 50 years. We have 20 \nkids and grandkids, I say to my friend in the chair. Six of those were \nup here because of a little adopted Ethiopian girl. My granddaughter \nand her brothers were making a igloo. They were stuck here with nothing \nelse to do. If you want to see it, it is down at Third and \nIndependence. Someone took the sign off, but the sign said: ``Al Gore's \nNew Home.'' I thought I would throw that out.\n  One last thing, in winding this up, about how serious this is. It \nbecame evident that the votes to pass the very expensive cap-and-trade \nbill, the largest tax increase in the history of America, somewhere \nbetween $300 and $400 billion a year--it would cost every taxpaying \nfamily in my State of Oklahoma some $3,000 a year--the fact is, the \nvotes are not there, not even close. They may be up to 20 votes, but it \ntakes 60 to pass it. We know that.\n  When this happened, President Obama said: Fine. If Congress is not \ngoing to pass this bill, I can do it administratively through an \nendangerment finding of the Clean Air Act.\n  The Clean Air Act was passed many years ago. The Clean Air Act talks \nabout pollutants such as SOx, NOx, and\n\n[[Page S551]]\n\nmercury. If he can have an endangerment finding saying that \nCO2 can be considered to be a pollutant, we can regulate it \nand do it through regulation.\n  I personally asked in a public hearing, live on TV, Lisa Jackson, \nAdministrator of the EPA, I said: If you do an endangerment finding--\nwhich they have now done, but this is before then--is it accurate to \nsay that is based on the science of the EIPC?\n  She said yes.\n  Now we have an endangerment finding based on science totally \ndiscredited, on the IPCC. I have no doubt in my mind that once March \ngets here and lawsuits start getting filed, the courts are going to \nlook at this and say: Wait a minute. An endangerment finding that is \ngoing to totally change the United States of America is based on \nscience that has been refuted in the last few months.\n  This is very serious. It is something that could be very expensive \nfor America.

Madam President, I thank the Chair and all of my friends \nfor giving me this opportunity to speak.\n  For Americans, the world changed on September 11, 2001. We learned--\nat the cost of thousands of innocent lives--that treating terrorism as \na law enforcement matter won't keep Americans safe.\n  My real concern is that this administration doesn't understand that \nevery day now is like September 12. We cannot afford to revert back to \na 9/11 mentality. Instead, we need to treat the terrorists as what they \nare--not common criminals but enemy combatants in a war.\n  I rise today to speak about my concerns with current terror-fighting \npolicies of this administration and the vital importance of \ncongressional oversight. Protecting this Nation from terrorist attack \nis our highest duty in government. In our great democracy, \ncongressional oversight plays a critical role in ensuring that our \ngovernment protects our citizens from terror attacks. Unfortunately, \nsome in the White House don't agree.\n  Just this morning, a White House spokesperson on MSNBC charged that \n``politicians in Congress'' should keep their opinions to themselves \nwhen it comes to one of our most vital national security interests--\ncounterterrorism. I note in the previous administration, my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle were quite free to speak about their \nviews on the policies. Mr. Brennan, the Homeland Security adviser, \nwrote an editorial in USA TODAY critical of congressional criticism of \nthe administration's counterterrorism policies and called them fear-\nmongering that serve the goals of al-Qaida.\n  I welcome comments of substance from the administration and from the \nother side on the criticism and the points I make, but you are not \ngoing to be able to silence the legislative branch. To do so is \nunworthy of the democracy we defend. One might believe that some were \ntrying to shift attention away from the decisions that were made in \nrecent years.\n  The bottom line is that my real beef is not with the White House \nspokespeople--although it is disappointing when the National Security \nAdviser claims that I have not told the truth about what he said--but \nwith the dangerous policies of the administration. Clearly, my \ncomplaints are not directed at the men and women of the intelligence \ncommunity--which was an insinuation by the White House spokesperson--\nbecause I believe the men and women of the intelligence community are \ndoing their very best job under at best difficult circumstances. What I \nam concerned about is major broader policies over which they have no \ncontrol have been changed in a way to make their job more difficult, \nand we should not be making their job more difficult.\n  One of the dangerous cases of ``ready, fire, aim'' and national \nsecurity policies was the President's pledge to close the terrorist \ndetention facility at Guantanamo Bay without any backup plans for the \ndeadly terrorists housed there or how to handle them or how to treat \nthem. There has been a temporary suspension of transfers of Gitmo \ndetainees to Yemen and Saudi Arabia, but we understand the larger \neffort to transfer and release other dangerous Gitmo detainees \ncontinues.\n  Let me be clear. The previous administration released terrorists and \nsent them back to their homeland, some for rehabilitation, and 20 \npercent of them--1 out of 5--have returned to the battlefield and a \ncouple of them apparently were coaching and training the ``Underpants \nBomber.'' That was a big mistake. Stop making the mistakes. We can \nlearn from the mistakes we have made in the past. If we send more back, \nthey will be attempting to kill more Americans. We shouldn't compromise \nour security here at home and the lives of our soldiers overseas to \ncarry out a campaign promise. If a campaign promise doesn't square with \nnational security, I humbly suggest that national security should \nprevail.\n  There is another case, the administration's decision to end or to \nbypass military commissions for detainees who are ready to plead \nguilty, as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was, to move him to New York City for \nthe show trial. I will address that later. But the administration \ncontinues to prepare to try senior al-Qaida detainees in U.S. article \nIII criminal courts rather than the military commissions that Congress \ndesigned for these difficult and complicated cases, to be used in a \ncourtroom that we constructed at Gitmo.\n  History has shown that civil criminal trials of terrorists \nunnecessarily hemorrhage sensitive classified information. The East \nAfrica Embassy bombing trials made Osama bin Laden aware of cell phone \nintercepts, and surprisingly al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden started using \ndifferent methods of communications. The trial of the first World Trade \nCenter bomber Ramzi Yousef tipped off terrorists to another \ncommunications link that provided enormously valuable information. \nWell, their use of that link that we were able to compromise was shut \ndown because they learned about it. Similarly, the trial of the ``Blind \nSheik'' Omar Abdel Rahman provided intelligence to Osama bin Laden. The \ntrial of Zacarias Moussaoui resulted in the inadvertent disclosure of \nsensitive material. That is why former Attorney General Michael \nMukasey, who tried some of these cases, said you cannot prevent a \ndefense attorney from getting classified, highly confidential \ninformation in the course of an article III criminal trial. We know for \na fact these civilian trials have aided the terrorists by giving them \ninformation on our Intelligence Committee.\n  The military commission system--and we passed a measure to regulate\n\n[[Page S552]]\n\nthe sign-in law in 2009--was designed to protect our sensitive \nintelligence sources and methods and to comply with the laws of war. \nWhy abandon them? It will come as no surprise to my colleagues that I \nalso disagree with the administration's ``ready, fire, aim'' strategy \nof handling the Christmas Day bomber.\n  On December 25, when Abdulmutallab landed on our shores, rather than \nincorporate intelligence into his interrogation, he was, after 50 \nminutes of brief questioning, Mirandized and offered a lawyer. Not \nsurprisingly, he clammed up for 5 weeks. Intelligence is perishable and \nthat 5 weeks was time that our intelligence system should have been \noperating on the questions he was only 5 weeks later answering. I don't \nknow what purpose there was in Mirandizing him. That is an exclusionary \nrule. The only reason to offer Miranda rights is so you can use the \nwords of the suspect against him. There is plenty of evidence of this \nguy who had strapped chemical explosives to his legs, set them off, and \nburned himself in front of 200 witnesses. It doesn't matter what he \nsays, you can convict him. Why weren't our intelligence agencies \nconsulted on the important decision of whether to Mirandize him? At \nleast the FBI agents questioning him should have had the benefit of the \nintelligence that other agencies knew. Who is running the war on \nterrorism? I am afraid it is the Justice Department or the White House. \nWhy did the White House announce what the few of us who were notified \nof his cooperation warned not to disclose? Not only did they disclose \nthat information the day after we were advised, they disclosed the fact \nthat Abdulmutallab's family came here to pressure him. Why on Earth \nwould you do that? What message does that send? Unfortunately, to the \nfamily, they now have targets on their backs, because the terrorists \nknow that they have convinced a member of their family to talk. What \ndoes it say to future sources? We are going to be concerned if they \nprovide information that our intelligence agencies asked for that they \nwill be identified by the White House and put at great risk.\n  The handling of the Christmas Day bomber also showed something else. \nWhen the President took away the powers of the CIA to question terror \nsuspects, he said: We will handle it in the White House. We found out \non December 25, 11 months after he announced it, that there was no high \nvalue detainee interrogation operation set up. They had no plans on how \nto do it. These people are supposed to be interrogating high value \ndetainees and for a year they didn't set it up until after the attack.\n  Our intelligence chiefs testified early this month in an open hearing \nthat there will be attempts by terrorists to attack again. Yet the \nadministration waited until after the attack to begin the process of \nsetting it up. These are all important policy questions to raise. If \nthe White House had its way, I wouldn't be asking them, but I am asking \nthem because I am very fearful that our security has been lessened, and \nthat this is a subject this body must address.\n  Article I of the Constitution created a legislative branch to help \nensure that nobody in government is above oversight and being held \naccountable. I as a Senator have a right and responsibility as a Member \nof this body and as a representative of the people of my State to shine \na light on policies that I think need to be changed, and I will \ncontinue to do so regardless of what is said about me. I am concerned \nthat these policies of the administration have moved us back to a pre-\n9/11 mentality. That failed in the past and it will again.\n  In terms of the debate, my colleagues from California and Vermont \nhave raised questions in a letter. They said we ought to try these \nterrorists in an article III court because the rule of law must \nprevail. Well, I agree, but we have a law. It is called the military \ncommissions law that was passed and signed into law last year by the \nPresident that carries out the laws of war. Those are places which are \nmuch safer in terms of handling the terrorists, in terms of handling \nclassified information.\n  Finally, they say that we should not--they strongly believe we ought \nto bring all of these people to article III courts and the prosecutors \nand everybody can handle those. It is not the prosecutors or the \nintelligence community we are worried about, No. 1. It is the \ncost, because the terrorist trial is going to bring undesirables here, \nand the city of New York figures it is going to have to spend over $2 \nmillion a year. They do not want it. Nobody else wants it.\n\n  I tell you, even more important, when Khalid Shaikh Mohammed was \napprehended, he said: My lawyer and I will see you in New York. He \nwants to come to New York or Washington or someplace where he can get a \nlot of media attention--and believe me, were he to be tried here, he \nwould get a lot of media attention--because he wants to be able to \nspread his message to others who might be vulnerable that they need to \njoin him in the jihad.\n  I also pointed out that disclosure of sensitive information has and \nwill be released if you try him in an article III court because any \ndefense attorney bound to provide the best defense for their clients \nwill have to get into what the intelligence community knew, how they \nknew it about him, and that is a disaster. That is why I welcome the \ndiscussion and I urge a change in policy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, it is so interesting to notice the \nchange of approach. When President Bush was in office and we were \nfighting terrorism, Democrats would come to the floor and question \ninterrogation and prosecution and be reminded over and over again by \nthe Republican side of the aisle that we were literally interfering \nwith national security and the authority of the Commander in Chief. I \ntook those criticisms lightly because we do have a responsibility in \nCongress to speak out as a separate branch of government if we disagree \nwith the Executive. Now to hear the other side, they have completely \nswitched their position. Now they believe it is fair game to question \nthe decisions that are being made on a daily basis by this President of \nthe United States relative to our national security.\n  What my friend from Missouri, who has every right to come to the \nfloor and speak his mind representing his State, has failed to mention \nis one basic fact: Since 9/11, 195 terrorists have been convicted in \narticle III courts in the United States of America. Decisions were made \nby Republican President George W. Bush to prosecute suspected \nterrorists in article III courts, and, yes, that would involve Miranda \nwarnings because they believed that was the most effective place to try \nthem.\n  There was an alternative, so-called law-of-war approach, to use \nmilitary commissions. How many of these suspected terrorists were \nactually tried before military commissions since 9/11? Three. Madam \nPresident, 3 have been convicted before military commissions, 195 in \nthe courts of our land.\n  Now come the Republicans to say: We want to stop any conviction in \nany criminal court in America. We believe the people should only be \nconvicted by military commission.\n  I take a different view. I believe this President, this Attorney \nGeneral, and all of the people involved in national security should \nhave the options before them: Use the best forum available to bring out \nthe facts and to result in a conviction.\n  Do I fear our court system will be used by these alleged terrorists? \nThey may try. They have not had much luck. When Zacarias Moussaoui, the \nso-called 19th 9/11 terrorist, was tried in Virginia, I don't think it \nchanged America one bit. I don't think it changed the way we live and \nthe security we have. Incidentally, he was convicted and is serving a \nlife sentence in a supermax prison, one of our Federal penitentiaries.\n  Those who argue that we should never consider it ignore the obvious. \nLook at the list of terrorists convicted in Federal courts aside from \nZacarias Moussaoui: Ramzi Yousef, the mastermind of the 1993 World \nTrade Center bombing; Omar Abdel Rahman, the so-called Blind Sheik; the \nal-Qaida sleeper agent Ali Al-Marri from my State of Illinois, where he \nwas arrested; Ted\n\n[[Page S553]]\n\nKaczynski, the Unabomber; and Terry Nichols, the Oklahoma City \ncoconspirator. Our courts work. Why would we choose to tie the hands of \nthis administration to choose the most effective place to try a \nterrorist?\n  This notion, too, about keeping Guantanamo open, that it was just \nPresident Obama's idea, no, it happened to be Senator McCain's idea as \nwell, his opponent in the Presidential election. He called for the \nclosing of Guantanamo, as well as GEN Colin Powell, who was head of not \nonly our State Department but head of national security under former \nPresidents. It is an indication to me that this, on a bipartisan basis, \nis something that should be done and done in a careful way. I would \nagree with that. But let's be honest. There has been a bipartisan \nconsensus that this is a good thing to do to make America safe.\n  The last point I would like to make on this issue is that we have a \nresponsibility to tell the world that those who are accused of \nterrorism will be tried in our courts or before our military \ncommissions in a way that respects due process so that at the end of \nthe day, we do not have an outcome where people question whether we \napplied the principles and values to these trials as we apply them to \nother trials involving Americans.\n  For those who argue they should be given the back of the hand, \nignored, no warnings, no due process, at the end of the day we will not \nbe stronger if we follow that counsel and that advice regardless of the \noutcome and afraid America's intentions will be questioned. I want us \nto be strong in this world, not fearful and shuddering and quivering \nbefore these alleged terrorists. We need to stand up strong, be safe as \na nation, gather the information.\n  This so-called Christmas Day bomber who was found on this plane, \nwhether he should have been Mirandized or not, the fact is, after a \nshort period of time his family was brought to where he is being held \nin a Federal penitentiary--I might add, in Michigan--and after meeting \nwith them, he gave even more information. To argue that he has not been \nhelpful and not forthcoming I think states something the record does \nnot reflect.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S553-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S553]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SNOWFALL IN WASHINGTON\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I first came here as a student in 1963. \nIt is a great city. I went to college here, law school here. I lived a \nbig part of my life, at least part time, in Washington, DC. I never \ncould get over how people in this town reacted to snow. I am convinced \nthat infants born in Washington, DC, are taken from the arms of their \nloving mothers right when they are born into a room where someone shows \na film of a snowstorm with shrieking and screaming so that those \nchildren come to believe snow is a mortal enemy, like a nuclear attack, \nbecause I have seen, for over 40 years here, people in this town go \ninto a full-scale panic at the thought of a snowfall. We joke about it. \nThose of us from parts of the country that get snow and know how to \nlive with it cannot get over how crazy the reaction is many times. But \nin fairness, this has been a heck of a snowstorm. It is the largest on \nrecord in Washington, DC.\n  I wish to say a word on behalf of the people of the District of \nColumbia and all of the surrounding suburbs but especially for those \nwho work on Capitol Hill, the Capitol Police as well as those in the \nArchitect's office, who have literally been working night and day to \nmake sure visitors who still come to this Capitol in the middle of a \nblizzard--I saw them yesterday coming up to take pictures of our \nCapitol dome--can come here safely. They have done an exceptional job. \nToday is no exception. Many of the members of our staff in the Senate \nand the folks who work here came trudging through the snow, and it was \nnot easy to get here. I wish to say a word of thanks to all of them for \nthe special sacrifice they have made and to say to the folks in \nWashington, DC: This was a heck of a snowstorm. You had every right to \nbe concerned. Some of the other ones, maybe not, but this one was the \nreal deal.\n\n  Madam President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to say one last word about an \nissue that affects my State and many others too. We received news today \nthat the foreclosures of houses in Illinois have increased dramatically \nover last year--a 25-percent increase in foreclosures in Illinois over \nthe last year. The same thing is true of many other States. The States \nhit the hardest are Nevada, Arizona, California, Florida, Utah, Idaho, \nMichigan, Illinois, Oregon, and Georgia.\n  We have to do more. The current system we have to deal with \nforeclosures is not working well. I met this morning with Treasury \nSecretary Geithner and gave him some ideas. I hope my colleagues will \njoin me in coming up with approaches that will try to save people from \nthis terrible outcome of foreclosure. Many people have lost their jobs \nand cannot pay their mortgages. Understandable. Maybe we can help them \nstay in their houses as renters or some other circumstance. Some have \nseen the value of their home start to decline to the point where the \nvalue of the home is less than the outstanding mortgage and there is no \nincentive to continue to sacrifice and make a mortgage payment for a \nhome that is worth a fraction of its original value.\n  Those are realities. But the reality of foreclosure is obvious. I was \nwith Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky in Evanston, IL, a few days ago. We \nwent down Gray Street and saw homes that had been good, solid, middle-\nclass homes now boarded up literally for years that have become a \nblight on that neighborhood, dragging down the value of every other \nhome and threatening the safety of the neighborhood as they become drug \nand crime havens. We are also seeing a phenomena like that in places \nsuch as Marquette Park in Chicago where the depopulation of \nneighborhoods is leading to commercial flight--food deserts in the city \nof Chicago brought about by foreclosures.\n  These banks have not done enough, period. They have not stepped up to \ntheir responsibility. I tried to change the Bankruptcy Code to give us \na fighting chance for a bankruptcy judge to rewrite a mortgage to avoid \nforeclosure, and I was defeated by the banks. They have a powerful \nlobby on Capitol Hill even to this day despite what we have gone \nthrough.\n  This foreclosure situation has gone from bad to worse. I don't \nbelieve America can truly recover economically until we address this \nissue in a forthright manner. I look forward to working with the \nTreasury Secretary and the administration to do that when we return \nfrom the Presidents Day recess.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to share a few thoughts on a \nmatter of concern; that is, our national security and the procedure by \nwhich we are handling people we arrest who are attacking this country. \nIt will be a bit of a follow-on to what Senator Bond of Missouri had to \nsay. I disagree with my distinguished colleague, Senator Durbin, the \nassistant Democratic leader in the Senate. He is a member of the \nJudiciary Committee. I think he is wrong about that. I serve on the \nJudiciary Committee, too, and I would like to share a few thoughts.\n  First, there has been a full-scale attempt to assert that President \nBush tried most of the terrorists or terrorism-related cases that \ndeveloped over the years in the normal civilian courts. That is true to \nsome degree. I notice that in the 195 cases Senator Durbin said were \ntried in the Federal courts, he counted the Unabomber and Terry \nNichols, one of the ones who blew up the Oklahoma City Federal \nBuilding. There is a big distinction: The Unabomber was not officially \nat war with the United States, had not declared war on the United \nStates as al-Qaida has, and the United States had not declared war on \nhim or on Terry Nichols, who was unknown, I suppose, to anybody at the \ntime he committed that crime and was tried. A lot of the other cases \ndeal with such things as aiding a terrorist by providing money to some \nterrorist organization that supports terrorism, violating various\n\n[[Page S554]]\n\ncomplex Federal laws, and they are tried in Federal courts. They are \nAmerican citizens, and they are tried here. That is the reason some of \nthe cases that have been cited were tried in Federal court.\n  Another reason of significant import that cases were tried in Federal \ncourt rather than in military commissions was not because President \nBush and his staff desired it but because we ended up with full-scale \nchallenges of the military commissions as they were set up originally \nafter 9/11. It took some time to get them set up. They were challenged. \nThe U.S. Supreme Court concluded that a number of procedures conducted \nin the military commissions did not meet constitutional muster, did not \ncomply with international agreements that the United States was a party \nto, and they said: You have to stop. So the military revamped what it \nwas doing. The Congress passed the Detainee Act to legitimize the \nmilitary commission trials and make sure it complied with the Supreme \nCourt so we could get on with it.\n  We had some 5,700 people in Guantanamo. It was never the plan of the \nBush administration, ever, to try those people in civilian courts. In \nfact, Congress appropriated the money. We built courtrooms with video \ncameras and security at the Guantanamo base and prison. We had them set \nup so trials could be conducted, press people could come and see the \ntrials, subject to national security questions that may arise, and do \nthose trials in that fashion.\n  But after President Obama got elected, he directed that Attorney \nGeneral Holder evaluate whether we should do that anymore or not. \nFirst, he stopped them--he issued an order to stop it--and then he \nasked that a review be conducted. Mr. Holder conducted a review and he \ndecided, and that report was, it would be presumed the people being \nheld in Guantanamo--many of whom, most of whom were captured on the \nbattlefield in Iraq and Afghanistan and other places in that area of \nthe world--would be tried in civilian courts. This was an absolute \nreversal of that.\n  Last year, I offered legislation that was passed by both Houses of \nCongress and signed by the President that said, if you are part of al-\nQaida, you are presumed to be at war with the United States, and it is \nnot necessary, in a military commission trial, to put on all kinds of \ntestimony, take weeks to prove we are at war with al-Qaida. That is \nsimply already a fact; we have declared war. Congress has authorized \nthe use of military force against al-Qaida, and they are attacking us. \nThat is what war is.\n  So John Brennan, the President's Deputy National Security Adviser, \nwhich apparently in this administration is a pretty big position--I \nguess these kind of personal Presidential staff people are what you \nmake of them--has been very public. He has made a series of statements \nwhich demonstrate this administration has learned no lessons from their \nmishandling of the Christmas Day bomber--Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab--who \nwas captured on Christmas Day, attempting to blow up a plane. Not only \ndid Mr. Abdulmutallab have recent intimate knowledge of terrorist \noperations in Yemen, but, in fact, he came directly from Yemen, having \nbeen provided a bomb by al-Qaida, as they claimed credit for and \napparently he has acknowledged.\n  He was an operative of al-Qaida. He had no legal claim to protections \nof the American criminal justice system, in any case. Even if he had \nbeen a citizen of the United States, which he was not a citizen, he had \nno right to be tried in civilian court in the United States because he \nwas an agent and an operative and an unlawful combatant directly \nconnected with al-Qaida. So this is a big deal. This is a matter that \nhas to be analyzed and thought through, and I am concerned the \nadministration is not listening.\n  The combination of these factors about his background made his \ncapture a unique intelligence opportunity--one of the most important \nopportunities since 9/11 because al-Qaida had moved a large part of its \noperation to Yemen, using it as a training base. We did not know enough \nabout it. It is very important we learn everything we can about how \nthey are operating in Yemen, who the leaders are, and how they could be \nattacked and neutralized. So the decision to treat him as a civilian \nwas very wrong.\n  The Department of Justice immediately began to treat him as a common \ncriminal being investigated by the FBI. They gave him his rights after \n50 minutes. In truth, colleagues, as a prosecutor myself, he should \nhave been given his rights, probably--normally, you would expect them \nimmediately. There may be some exceptions that could have allowed this \nnot to occur immediately, but, normally, when a civilian is arrested \nand you ask him a single question, that individual who is in custody is \nentitled to Miranda rights then. Miranda rights are not just that you \nhave a right to remain silent. Miranda rights say you have a right to \nremain silent, and we will appoint you a lawyer. You have a right to \nhave one, and we will appoint you one if you don't have the money. \nPeople tend to clam up when they are told that.\n  So they offered him an attorney and did not treat him as the rare \nintelligence asset he was. That decision, it is indisputable, I truly \nbelieve--and this is not politics we are talking about--jeopardized the \nkind of fresh, timely intelligence that saves lives and prevents \nfurther attacks on the homeland of our country.\n  Mr. Brennan says one of the reasons the administration classified \nAbdulmutallab as a civilian was because he was captured on U.S. soil. \nThis comment is truly startling and makes no sense. As Deputy National \nSecurity Adviser to the President, Mr. Brennan ought to be aware that \nbecause Abdulmutallab is an al-Qaida operative, he is an unprivileged \nenemy belligerent--in our common, more current definition of the term--\nand, thus, he is automatically eligible for a military trial.\n  Indeed, the amendment I offered last year to the Military Commissions \nAct would permit this administration to do this without even having to \nreestablish the obvious: that al-Qaida is at war with the United \nStates. So for the President, Mr. Holder or Mr. Brennan to persist in \narguing that the law or past precedent somehow justified their \ntreatment of Abdulmutallab as an ordinary criminal is wrong.\n  But Mr. Brennan has gone further than simply confusing the law. He \nhas confused reality. In his recent op-ed in USA Today, he defiantly \ndeclares the administration made the right call on Abdulmutallab and \nthat providing captured terrorists with civilian due process, civilian \nlawyers, and the right to remain silent has no negative impact on our \nability to gather intelligence.\n  I dispute that. That is totally illogical. I don't know how many \ncases Mr. Brennan has prosecuted--not many. I prosecuted thousands; \nsupervised them and tried them myself--but there is no doubt that you \nlose intelligence when you appoint a person a lawyer and tell them they \nhave a right to remain silent. We are virtually the only country in the \nworld that does this. It is not considered a constitutional right. It \nis something the court thought would be a good idea, to keep people \nfrom being abused by police, and so they set up this rule. It is not \npart of fundamental due process. It wasn't even a rule until 50 years \nago. We never did that. Canada doesn't do it, France doesn't, Germany \nor Italy. We don't have to give them.\n  Mr. Brennan says: ``There is little difference between military and \ncivilian custody other than an interrogator with a uniform.'' Not so. \nHe argues: ``The suspect gets access to a lawyer and the interrogation \nrules are nearly identical.'' That is absolutely false.\n  I have been disappointed at the response the Attorney General has \ngiven to members of our committee, but when the National Security \nAdviser says something such as that--and I confronted him with it in a \nhearing earlier and he persists in making that kind of statement.\n  Mr. Brennan has also said previously that ``there are no downsides or \nupsides in particular cases'' and that because we are a nation of laws, \ncriminal courts are the preferred venue. Not so--at least that this is \na preferred venue. We are a nation of laws, and our laws and \ninternational law allow for the trial of unlawful combatants in \nmilitary commissions. Attorney General Holder admitted that himself in \na hearing when answering questions asked of him. I said: Mr. Holder, \nthe decision to try these people in civilian court rather than military \ncommissions is a policy decision, and basically\n\n[[Page S555]]\n\nhe said yes to that. It is not required under our law.\n  I can tell you--and not with speculation and it is not a theory but a \nfact--that criminal defendants will routinely stop talking and \nproviding information when you give them Miranda and appoint them a \nlawyer. The first thing a lawyer is going to do, even in a case such as \nthis, is to advise his client not to make any more statements, if he \nhas made any. If he says he wants a lawyer, the questioning must stop \nuntil one is produced. That is what it means to try a person in \ncivilian court. It is different.\n  You better believe terrorists who are trained to exploit our system \nwill do everything in their power to use that system against us, if we \nlet them. When Khalid Shaikh Mohammed--mastermind of the 9/11 attack, \nthat so horrible day--was captured, he immediately asked for a lawyer. \nHe already knew. But he wasn't given one. Instead, he was interrogated \nat length over a period of time as a military combatant. These \ninterrogations revealed critically important information that helped \nfoil other attacks that could have been levied against the United \nStates.\n  When Abdulmutallab was questioned, he was questioned for only 50 \nminutes before being given a lawyer, and then he stopped talking. So we \nare told: Weeks later, he started talking again. Don't worry, Jeff. \nQuit complaining. Five weeks later, now he has started talking. We got \nhis daddy to come in, and maybe we can do a plea bargain with him or \nsomething and he will talk.\n  Well, you can do that if they are in military custody. That is not \nonly done in civilian custody, No. 1. No. 2, what did they have to \npromise him to get him to provide information? Did they promise him \nleniency? Did his lawyer demand it? Did his lawyer demand a written \nplea agreement before he allowed him to speak?\n  That is what will happen in most cases. I don't know what happened in \nthis one. But we are not talking about just this case. We are talking \nabout the policy of whether it is better to treat somebody as an \nunlawful combatant if they come from al-Qaida or in a civilian trial in \nAmerica. Fresh, immediate intelligence is awfully valuable many times, \nand it can grow stale very quickly, although other intelligence can be \nextremely important, even if the person you have captured waits 6 \nmonths to give it to you. You just never know. But the truth is, the \nmore intelligence, the sooner obtained, enhances our national security. \nThings that are unnecessary, that are not required by law, that delay \nthe obtaining of intelligence and delay the amount you get is damaging \nto our national security.\n  So that is the policy question we are dealing with--this decision to \nput vitally important intelligence at great jeopardy. Nevertheless, Mr. \nBrennan insists that military interrogations are the same as those \nprovided to civilians. But when a civilian asks that the interrogation \nstop, it must stop at that moment. This is not true in the military \nsituation.\n  Well, let me back up a little bit. A person apprehended on the \nbattlefield, a prisoner of war, who is a lawful combatant, wearing a \nuniform, fighting the United States in a lawful manner, according to \nthe laws of war, cannot be excessively interrogated, cannot be tried \nfor any crime but can be held until the war is over, whether it is 1 \nyear or 10 years. That is the law of the world and the law of the \nUnited States. But if they are unlawful combatants, as these malicious, \ndevious, murdering al-Qaida thugs are--they do not wear a uniform, they \ndo not comply with the laws of war, they attack innocent civilians \ndeliberately to spread terror--they are in violation of the rules of \nwar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair, and I ask unanimous consent for 3 \nadditional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  What would have happened to Abdulmutallab if he were handled by the \nmilitary? He would have been interrogated by people in short order who \nwere intimately familiar with the situation that was developing in \nYemen. They would have been able to ask him questions without a lawyer \nbeing present. He did not have to have a lawyer. They could use the \nlegal interrogation techniques that Congress has passed into law and \ndirected the military to use in these kinds of interrogations--and no \nmore--or they would be in violation of the law. He would not be abused. \nThen eventually he would be tried, or not tried, as the military and \nthe national security would dictate.\n  But if you arrest him and put him in a civil situation, he \nimmediately has to be advised of his rights, immediately given a \nlawyer. He is then entitled to a speedy trial. He is entitled to demand \ndiscovery and information from the government about how they caught him \nand who provided the information. He could demand to go to trial and be \nable to speak out and use it as a forum to promote their agenda. There \nis a huge difference between the two.\n  For Mr. Brennan to act as if there is no difference, and for my \ncolleagues to say President Bush tried these people, before we ever got \nthe system up and running in a healthy way, is disingenuous. It is not \naccurate. It is not correct in a rational discussion of how this would \nbe.\n  This is what President Obama said in an important ``60 Minutes'' \ninterview about these terrorists:\n\n       Now, do these folks deserve Miranda rights? Do they deserve \n     to be treated like a shoplifter down the block? Of course \n     not.\n\n  Amen, Mr. President. Of course they are not entitled to Miranda \nrights. Of course they are not entitled to be treated like a shoplifter \ndown the block. But when they decided to try Abdulmutallab in a \ncivilian court, that is exactly what they decided to do--to treat him \nwith all the rights and rules an American citizen would have who is \ncharged with a shoplifting offense.\n  We raised this issue last fall, back in September, with the Director \nof the FBI, about Miranda. I asked him:\n\n       So, if you're going to try terrorists in Federal court, \n     they should be Mirandized, right?\n       If you want the statement, a particular statement at a \n     particular time admissible in the Federal court, generally \n     that--that has to be Mirandized.\n\n  In fact, you can't even ask him questions lawfully until you provide \nhim the Miranda rights. If he says anything that is of value to the \nprosecution, it is dismissible.\n  Then what about this dramatic event in the Judiciary Committee? \nSenator Lindsay Graham, a very experienced Senator who still remains a \nJAG officer in the Air Force--after many years he still goes off to do \nhis duty 2 weeks a year--he asked this dramatic question to the \nAttorney General.\n\n       If we captured bin Laden tomorrow, would he be entitled to \n     Miranda warnings at the moment of capture?\n\n  Attorney General Holder:\n\n       Again, I'm not--that depends.\n\n  He never gave a full answer.\n  I thank the Chair and believe we have to get our heads straight on \nthis matter and cease to provide the kind of due process rights that \nAmerican citizens get and provide the kind of legitimate due process \nrights that a military commission provides--and they are great. But \nthey are not the same. Understand, we are at war, and it creates a \ndifferent dynamic in how the cases are processed.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I withhold--noting the absence of a \nquorum request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S555-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S555-S557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           BUDGET DISPARITIES\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, when President Obama delivered his \nfirst State of the Union Address several weeks ago, I tell you I was \npleasantly surprised by his remarks on energy policy. In addition to \ncalling for bipartisan legislation, the President indicated his support \nfor more nuclear energy and new oil and gas development. I think those \nare all positive steps. They are taking us in the right direction, not \nleast because they would draw strong support in Congress, and I think \nthey would help create jobs all across the country at a time when we \nare looking at how we can boost the economy and create jobs. This is \ncritically important.\n  Having listened to the President's ideas, I looked forward to seeing \nhow\n\n[[Page S556]]\n\nthe administration would begin to act on them, how this would all play \nout in his new budget. When that document came out last Monday, I \nexpected to at least see some progress in each of the areas mentioned \nduring the State of the Union Address. Instead, I found some \ndisparities--some were small; some were rather striking--between the \nPresident's words to Congress and the agencies' requests from us.\n  This disconnect is both disappointing and perhaps a little difficult \nto explain. At the very least, it is apparent that the vision the \nPresident presented to Congress does not match what some of his \nagencies have in mind. I do not believe these are welcome shifts. Quite \na few of the budget proposals would impair our ability to establish a \ncomprehensive energy policy that addresses climate change and reduces \nour dependence on foreign oil. Instead of promoting bipartisanship--\nwhich I think we all want to try to do--I am concerned these same \nproposals would only deepen the divisions we have within Congress.\n  Let me fill out some of the details. Let's start with nuclear energy. \nDuring his remarks, the President indicated his support for a ``new \ngeneration of safe, clean nuclear powerplants in this country.'' To the \nadministration's credit, I believe it did follow through on that one in \nthe budget request. As I have said before, allowing the Department of \nEnergy to guarantee more loans for nuclear plants is a step in the \nright direction.\n  But I remind him, it has been a year, and this administration has yet \nto help finance a single nuclear project. That certainly is not due to \nlack of ability because the DOE has already had the authority to \nguarantee $18 billion in new projects. It certainly is not due to the \ncost because, if carried out properly, this important support would not \ncost American taxpayers a single dime. But I believe the administration \ntook a step backwards in its budget, away from that progress when it \nchose to abandon the Yucca Mountain project. The end of the nuclear \nfuel cycle is just as important as the beginning. Yet DOE is abandoning \nour best option for a repository and further exposing taxpayers to \nbillions for the government's breach of contract.\n  We also need to make sure in America we are producing the raw \nmaterials used to generate nuclear energy. Here again, the \nadministration took a step back last year by withdrawing roughly 1 \nmillion acres of uranium-rich lands in Arizona. As a result, our Nation \nhas lost access to some of its highest grade uranium reserves. This is \nkind of familiar territory for us. We should know by now that following \nthe same path for nuclear energy that we have been following for oil \nwill not work. It is not going to help improve our energy security. It \nrisks trading our dependence on foreign oil for a similarly devastating \ndependence on foreign uranium.\n  I appreciate the administration's direction with the loan guarantees \nwith nuclear. I, again, support that. But when we turn to the \ndiscussion about where we go with oil and gas, I cannot say the same \nfor domestic oil and gas production--at least when it comes to this \nbudget and the various proposals for tax hikes, new administrative \nfees, and efforts to make the permitting process actually more \nburdensome.\n  During his State of the Union Address, the President called for tough \ndecisions to be made regarding new development. I had actually hoped he \nmeant that his agencies were preparing to push forward with a plan that \nwould allow America to develop more of its resources. But it appears I \nwas mistaken. Instead of seeking to increase production, the budget \nrequest includes at least 21 new taxes and fees for the oil, natural \ngas, and coal industries--21 new taxes and fees. Collectively, these \nincreases would raise producers' costs of business by an estimated $80 \nbillion.\n  That is going to translate into higher energy costs for consumers, \nfewer jobs for the American people. We cannot forget what basic \neconomics tells us: When you tax something, you get less of it. So we \nwill probably become even more dependent on foreign energy as well.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a list of all these 21 tax increases and \nfees for oil, gas, and coal producers be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nTax Increases and New Fees Proposed for American Oil, Natural Gas, and \n Coal Producers In the Administration's Fiscal Year 2011 Budget Request\n\n       1. Repeal enhanced oil recovery credit;\n       2. Repeal marginal well tax credit;\n       3. Repeal expensing of intangible drilling costs;\n       4. Repeal deduction for tertiary injectants;\n       5. Repeal passive loss exception for working interests in \n     oil and natural gas properties;\n       6. Repeal percentage depletion for oil and natural gas;\n       7. Repeal the Section 199 manufacturing deduction for \n     income attributable to domestic production of oil, gas, or \n     primary products thereof;\n       8. Increase geological and geophysical amortization period \n     for independent producers to seven years;\n       9. Repeal expensing and exploration and development costs \n     for coal;\n       10. Repeal percentage depletion for hard, mineral fossil \n     fuels;\n       11. Repeal capital gains treatment of certain coal-related \n     royalties;\n       12. Repeal the Section 199 manufacturing deduction for \n     income attributable to domestic production of coal and other \n     hard mineral fossil fuels;\n       13. Levy new fees on applications for permits to drill \n     (APDs)\n       14. Authority to collect $10 million in fees for on-shore \n     oil and gas production inspection on federal lands, and \n     parallel request for $10 million in fee collections under MMS \n     budget;\n       15. $4.00 per acre fee on ``non-producing leases'' in both \n     federal lands and waters;\n       16. Repeal of EPACT '05 provisions incentivizing production \n     of deepwater gas;\n       17. Repeal mandatory royalty relief to deepwater oil and \n     gas production;\n       18. Proposed increase in royalty from 12.5% to 20-30%;\n       19. Modify rules for dual capacity taxpayers to effectively \n     create double taxation on income derived from foreign \n     holdings;\n       20. Repeal LIFO (last in, first out) accounting procedure;\n       21. Reimpose Superfund taxes disproportionately on the oil \n     and natural gas industry.\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. To be fair, these proposals that were laid out do not \nnecessarily come as a total surprise to us. Many of these were also \npart of last year's budget. Last September there was a senior official \nfrom the Treasury Department who raised some eyebrows. He was \ntestifying and said that somehow America overproduces oil and gas--\noverproduces oil and gas.\n  As we continue to import about 60 percent of our total supply of oil \nand even some of our natural gas, that claim is incredible to me. Our \nNation clearly imports too much oil, and we use too much oil. But we \ncertainly do not produce too much of it.\n  The administration is pursuing at least some of these tax increases \nand fees in order to ``end fossil fuel subsidies.'' Those are the words \nthey use. This is part of an agreement reached with the G20 last year. \nBut interestingly, the G20 seems to have a very different idea of what \nthat actually means.\n  According to the group, developed countries such as the United States \nand Canada only indirectly subsidize fossil fuels such as with certain \ntax treatment, and even these quasi-tax subsidies are small in \ncomparison to the developing or underdeveloped countries.\n  If there are any direct fossil fuel subsidies that this \nadministration could then eliminate, you have to ask the question: What \nwould those be? As nearly as I can tell, there are two programs that \nwould technically qualify, by the G20's definition, as direct fossil \nfuel subsidies. The first one is LIHEAP.\n  Madam President, you are very familiar with that program, and I think \nyou and I would be in complete agreement that this program, which helps \nneedy Americans afford home heating oil and gas, should certainly not \nbe eliminated. I think we have some considerable support in the \nCongress defending LIHEAP. The President, Vice President, much of the \nCabinet, and dozens of other Senators certainly have gone on the record \nsupporting it.\n  The second direct fossil fuel subsidy in your region is the \nNortheastern Home Heating Oil Reserve. Again, I do not think the \nadministration considered either of these programs when agreeing to \nphase out fossil fuel subsidies, but that is what they are--they are \nsubsidies.\n  To return to the budget request, the Department of Interior notes \nthat:\n\n       Repealing fossil fuel tax preferences helps eliminate \n     market distortions, strengthening incentives for investments \n     in clean renewable and more energy efficient technologies.\n\n  This is another exercise in semantics and some political buzzwords. \nWhen\n\n[[Page S557]]\n\nthe government gives actual subsidies and gives actual tax breaks to \nrenewable energy development, these are entitled ``incentives for \ninvestment.'' When the government refrains from taxing oil and gas \nproducers more than they are already taxed, it is not an incentive for \ninvestment anymore. But now we are calling it a ``market distortion.''\n  I lay this out to hopefully be able to verbalize my concern.\n  When the President spoke before the Congress at his State of the \nUnion Address, when he spoke about tough decisions on new oil and gas \nexploration, I had hoped we would finally begin to be using more of our \nresources to meet our own energy needs. But from looking at the new \nbudget, it looks more as though our energy producers will be the ones \nwho will be making the tough decisions. They are going to be making a \ntough decision as to whether they continue to operate here, whether \nthey shut down, whether they head overseas or whether they produce our \nenergy.\n  The final area I wish to address is the issue of climate change. \nDuring his address, the President called on the Congress to develop \ncomprehensive energy and climate legislation. But a few days later, \nwhen the budget came out, the EPA requested more than $40 million in \norder to begin regulating greenhouse gas emissions on its own.\n  Here in the Senate we have at least 41 Members already on record as \nopposing that approach. That is about as bipartisan as any climate bill \nhas been--as we have been--in this Congress. By allowing the EPA to \nmove forward, the President is actually limiting Congress's ability to \ndevelop a bipartisan climate bill. Instead of debating cap and trade or \na carbon tax, we are going to spend at least some of our time talking \nabout the EPA's regulations. As I have said many times before, EPA's \nactions will harm our economy at a time when we can least afford it.\n  I also believe the debate over climate policy belongs here. It \nbelongs in the Senate. It belongs in the House. It belongs here in \nCongress because that is where the best interests of our constituents \ncan fully be represented.\n  The truth of the matter is the administration is looking to have it \nboth ways. On the one hand, its budget assumes a cap-and-trade bill \nwill pass and on the other it is seeking millions of dollars to impose \nthese backdoor climate regulations. I hope the administration will \nchange its mind on the matter and decide to work with us as we work \ntoward a balanced and comprehensive bill. But I think we recognize that \nthe threat of regulations has not worked. I do not think it will work. \nI think it is time to take that command-and-control approach off the \ntable.\n  Some may wonder why I have taken the time to point out that the ideas \nin the President's State of the Union Address do not entirely match the \npriorities that were outlined in the administration's new budget. This \nis not intended as a criticism of the President. I am ready to work \nwith him on the ideas he has offered to see if we can make some real \nprogress for the American people. But, instead, I raise these issues \nbecause I believe they help illustrate why we have had such a tough \ntime agreeing on a path forward. I am happy to work with the President \nand his administration on nuclear energy, on offshore development, and \nwork toward bipartisan legislation. But I am not willing to support \nmany of the energy-related proposals we are seeing now within the \nadministration's new budget.\n  Again, you might ask the question, why does it all matter? It matters \nbecause the budget is filled with programs that are authorized by \nCongress which are supposed to reflect not only our priorities but the \npriorities of the American people. And while it may not be readily \napparent, the budget does send the signal about whether our work here \nis going to be continued by the executive branch. If the agencies seek \nto promote just some of our goals, and actually hamper others, that \nwill only make Senators more cautious about what they are willing to \nsupport, especially if it is part of a comprehensive package.\n  Madam President, I am going to close this evening by simply \nreaffirming what I have said before. I am ready to work with the \nPresident on the ideas he has offered up during his State of the Union \nAddress to help make those tough decisions on offshore development, to \nensure a new generation of nuclear powerplants is built, to play a \nconstructive role in bipartisan legislation.\n  But the energy proposals contained in the budget also make me \nquestion whether all of those priorities would receive equal treatment \nif put into law. I hope the agencies would carry out all of Congress's \npriorities--not just some--that could be contained in a bipartisan \nenergy bill. The President's address several weeks ago makes me think \nthat, in fact, this is all possible. But the new budget makes me \nquestion whether, in fact, that is the case.\n  With that, Madam President, I thank the Chair for the time and yield \nthe floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S557-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S557-S558]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EARTHQUAKE IN HAITI\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, bad things can bring out the best in \npeople, and I rise today to speak about our response to the earthquake \nthat devastated Haiti last month and, in particular, about the \ncompassionate efforts that Rhode Islanders have made to help those who \nsuffered through this tragedy.\n  The 7.0 scale magnitude earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, \n2010, is the first great natural disaster of the new decade. Even \nbefore the quake struck, the small island nation of Haiti faced \nsignificant challenges as the poorest country in the Western \nHemisphere.\n  Haiti has been wracked by years of political strife and the constant \nthreat of hurricanes and tropical storms. This most recent catastrophe \nhas led to, for us, almost unimaginable suffering on the part of the \npeople of Haiti. On February 3, Haiti's Prime Minister Jean-Max \nBellerive announced that over 200,000 people had been confirmed dead. \nThe U.N. has estimated that over 3 million people have been directly \naffected by the disaster. In the capital of Port-au-Prince alone, over \n700,000 people have been displaced, with over 480,000 departing the \ncity altogether.\n  Even before the quake, many Rhode Islanders were helping down in \nHaiti. One constituent, Natalhie Gooding, a CPA from Warwick, was down \nthere volunteering her time at an orphanage for young Haitian girls in \nPort-au-Prince. She was there when the quake hit. Days went by before \nher husband Michael and her children were able to communicate with her. \nAs people with families around us--I know the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer and I certainly can share the intense concern that family must \nhave gone through hearing the news coming out of Haiti for hours and \nfor days and knowing that their wife and their mom was down in the \nmiddle of that and not hearing from her. As my colleagues can imagine, \nit was a traumatic experience. Fortunately, as it turned out, Natalhie \nwas safe and she is now back in Rhode Island with her family. But as I \nacknowledge our relief efforts after the quake, I also wish to \nacknowledge and commend all of the volunteers from Rhode Island and \nelsewhere who were so generously helping in Haiti even before the \nearthquake struck.\n  The response of the United States to this tragedy has been \nremarkable. In the weeks since the earthquake, the United States has \nprovided over $439 million in emergency humanitarian assistance. The \nDepartment of State, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the \nDepartment of Defense, and other government entities have all \ncontributed to this effort. Water distribution, sanitation, and hygiene \nprograms, food assistance, logistical support, provisions for shelter, \nand essential medical services have all been top priorities. The United \nStates military has sent aircraft and ships to Haiti, including the \nUSNS Comfort hospital ship and the aircraft carrier USS Carl Vinson. \nThese vessels are providing medical treatment facilities and \nhumanitarian assistance. In addition, the 22nd Marine Expeditionary \nUnit and the\n\n[[Page S558]]\n\nArmy's 82nd Airborne Division have contributed 5,500 troops to \ndistribute humanitarian aid and provide search, rescue, and security \nsupport.\n  We have also seen extraordinary generosity from the American people, \nfrom the millions of dollars individuals and businesses have donated to \nhelp the victims of the quake to the volunteers who have selflessly \ntraveled to Haiti to lend their valued expertise. Americans, with our \nspirit of generosity, have tried to help in any way they possibly can.\n  The outpouring of support in my State of Rhode Island for those \naffected by this catastrophe has been overwhelming. Many Rhode \nIslanders have generously donated to organizations to give whatever \nthey can to the relief of this devastated country. At the Blessed \nSacrament School in Providence, a school some of whose students have \nfamily members and loved ones in Haiti, the 270-plus students of this \nsmall school, pre-K to 8th grade, raised over $1,680 for the Red Cross \nin a single day. Students and parents at the Frenchtown Elementary \nSchool in East Greenwich raised close to $1,700 for the Save the \nChildren relief organization to help those in Haiti. At the St. Mary \nAcademy Bay View in Riverside, fifth graders have produced handmade \nyarn dolls which they are selling to raise money for the victims of the \nearthquake.\n  This month, students of the University of Rhode Island launched a \n``URI Helping Haiti Campaign'' with the goal of raising $100,000 for \nPlan USA, a Rhode Island-headquartered relief organization that \nprovides direct humanitarian assistance to 1.5 million children in 49 \ncountries across the globe, including, of course, Haiti.\n  Ten members of the Rhode Island National Guard's 143rd Airlift Wing \nflew to Haiti in January to assist in the relief efforts. The 143rd's \nlatest humanitarian mission before this was in New Orleans assisting in \nthe aftermath of one of our own country's greatest natural disasters, \nHurricane Katrina. This time they flew to Haiti to provide medical \ntransportation and evacuation assistance.\n  In January, even the Rhode Island Democratic and Republican parties \nput politics aside and came together to host a joint fundraiser to \nbenefit the humanitarian relief efforts led by the Clinton-Bush Haiti \nFund.\n  Rhode Island doctors such as Christopher Born, Sachita Shah, Stephen \nSullivan, and Helena Taylor, of Rhode Island Hospital, traveled to \nHaiti in the days after the earthquake to provide critical medical \nservices to those injured. These doctors lacked the medical equipment \nthere that we here take for granted and they were also forced to use \nrudimentary medical procedures to treat the numerous patients who had \nlined up for assistance. But they did it, and they made a difference.\n  These stories represent only a small fraction of the generosity that \nRhode Islanders and the American people have exhibited in the weeks \nfollowing the earthquake. It is truly inspiring how Americans have \njoined together to help the people of Haiti in this time of need. I \nknow that the world is watching this example of America's generosity, \ngood will, and professionalism. I am proud of the many contributions \nthat came from my small State.\n  The thoughts and prayers of Rhode Islanders and indeed all Americans \nwill continue to be with those who have suffered and are still \nsuffering in this catastrophe as the recovery and rebuilding begins to \ntake shape. I know the generosity and the good work will continue.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S558-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S558-S559]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF SUSAN CARBON\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I came to speak because there are \nSenators--anonymous Senators--who are blocking the confirmation of \nSusan Carbon, who has been nominated to be the new Director of the \nOffice of Violence Against Women. Susan is from my home State of New \nHampshire. For 2 months, the Office of Violence Against Women was \ndenied leadership and direction, not because there are Senators who \nthink Susan Carbon is unqualified for this position but because they \nbelieved that blocking her confirmation somehow gains them leverage on \ncompletely unrelated pet issues. I understand that, hopefully, finally \ntoday, after the issue had been raised in the press, that hold has been \nlifted.\n  Blocking the confirmation of Susan Carbon as Director of the Office \nof Violence Against Women is a perfect example of what people see as \nwhat is wrong with Washington.\n  Every 2 minutes, someone in this country is a victim of sexual \nviolence. Every 52 seconds, a woman is victimized by a spouse or a \npartner. These crimes devastate victims' lives. They shatter families. \nThey often create fear in whole communities. The Office of Violence \nAgainst Women leads our Nation's efforts to prevent these deadly crimes \nand to identify, capture, and punish the perpetrators.\n  The Office of Violence Against Women works with law enforcement, with \nvictim advocates, with the health care community, and so many others. \nIt provides financial and technical assistance to communities across \nthe country that are working to end domestic violence, sexual assault, \nand stalking.\n  I am sure every Senator in this body personally knows someone who has \nbeen the victim of domestic violence or sexual assault. I am sure all \nSenators know how hard their local police and victim advocates work to \nstop domestic and sexual violence. They know how much the communities \nin their States appreciate the assistance they get from the Office of \nViolence Against Women. I would bet almost every Senator, at one time \nor another, has taken credit for the funding that the Office brings \nback to organizations within their home States.\n  Yet despite a unanimous vote by the Judiciary Committee back on \nDecember 3 of last year that recommended Susan Carbon's confirmation, \nunnamed Senators have blocked her confirmation for 2 months.\n  President Obama's choice to lead our country's efforts against \ndomestic and sexual violence happens to be a State court judge from New \nHampshire. It might interest some of the Republican Senators in this \nbody to know--those who are blocking her confirmation--that it was Judd \nGregg, the senior Republican Senator from New Hampshire, who first \nrecognized Susan's capabilities and potential. In 1991, then-Governor \nGregg appointed Susan Carbon to be a part-time district court judge. \nAfter I became Governor, I appointed Susan to be a full-time judge. \nBecause of her commitment to ending domestic violence and her expertise \nin family law, she was named the supervisory judge of the family \ndivision in New Hampshire, a position she still holds.\n  Susan Carbon is exceptionally qualified to serve as the Director of \nthe Office of Violence Against Women. She is the leading voice in New \nHampshire on domestic violence and family law, and she has been the \ndriving force behind so many of New Hampshire's efforts to strengthen \nlegal protections for victims of domestic violence.\n\n  Susan also has become a national leader on domestic violence. She \nfrequently serves as a faculty member for the National Judicial \nInstitute on Domestic Violence, and she chaired the project which \nproduced the guidebook for professionals and their work around domestic \nviolence court orders.\n  I do not know what political party Susan Carbon belongs to and it \ndoes not matter because she is a good and decent person who is anxious \nto take on the responsibility of leading the Office of Violence Against \nWomen.\n  I ask Senators who think about blocking such nominations in the \nfuture to imagine what it is like to explain to a nonpartisan, earnest \npublic servant, eager to assume a new position of national leadership, \nthat her confirmation is being blocked because one or two anonymous \nSenators want a new Federal building or some other project in their \nStates or want a defense contract awarded to a certain company or \nbecause they are mad at Attorney General Eric Holder for some unrelated \nissue.\n\n[[Page S559]]\n\n  These Senators, cloaked in anonymity, were not punishing Attorney \nGeneral Holder by blocking Susan Carbon's confirmation. These Senators \nwere punishing the victims of domestic and sexual violence in States \nacross this country. They were punishing the police officers who put \ntheir lives at risk every time they enter homes plagued by domestic \nviolence. They were punishing community groups that are working to \nprevent domestic and sexual violence. What these Senators did by \nblocking the confirmation of the Director of the Office of Violence \nAgainst Women for 2 months was, simply and plainly, wrong.\n  I hope the news that her confirmation is moving forward is a correct \none. I hope that for the 70 or so other good public servants who are \njust trying to serve this country who have been nominated, that their \nnominations will also go forward so we can make sure people are in the \npositions they should be to run this government on behalf of the \ncitizens of this country.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

But if we offered instead the Grassley-Baucus \namendment which was filed earlier today, that would include the \nunemployment extension. That was one of the features of that Baucus-\nGrassley amendment.\n  So if this consent were granted, it would allow us to work on that \npackage rather than the version that the leader of the majority is \ngoing to offer here shortly that includes only four of those \nprovisions.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I do not accept the modification.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me add that unemployment insurance does not expire \nuntil February 28.

Mr. President, I rise today to express my continued \nconcern over the humanitarian situation in Haiti after the catastrophic \nJanuary 12, 2010, earthquake. While the destruction has proved to make \nthe aid and relief situation on the ground complicated and difficult to \nnavigate, President Obama's promise to the people of Haiti that ``you \nwill not be forsaken; you will not be forgotten'' has rung true to \ndate.\n  The global outpouring of support, in resources, money and people on \nthe ground has been encouraging. American contributions and activities, \nin particular, have been exemplary. All Americans should be proud of \nhow we have responded to help our neighbors who are truly facing the \ndirest of situations. Countless U.S. Government agencies and the \nmilitary quickly swung into action, managed by Operation Unified \nResponse and Joint Task Force Haiti, and have moved with an impressive \nand coordinated effort.\n  I would like to make a special mention of the efforts carried out by \nMarylanders.\n  The USNS Comfort, which we are proud to have based in Baltimore \nHarbor, provides a mobile, flexible, and rapidly responsive afloat \nmedical capability for acute medical and surgical care, with a 550-\nperson medical team and a capacity of 250 hospital beds and room to \ntreat 1,000 people. The day after the earthquake, the Comfort was \nordered to assist in the humanitarian relief efforts as a crucial part \nof Operation Unified Response. Upon its arrival in Haiti on January 20, \nthe crew of the Comfort immediately began critical lifesaving medical \ntreatment early that day, and on the following day, the first baby was \nsafely born aboard.\n  Four weeks after the earthquake, the Comfort remains on station and \nis operating at maximum capacity. Surgeries are being performed around \nthe clock and the intensive care units and wards are filled. Navy Dr. \n(CAPT) Jim Ware, the medical group commander, noted upon arrival, ``We \nhave never had that number on the ship, but we can do it,'' capturing \nthe spirit of the all the U.S. troops on the ground in Haiti. Yet these \ncommitted men and women are certainly facing a daunting challenge--the \nComfort has cared for more patients in the last 5 days than it did \nduring all of the two wars in Iraq. In less than a week, it has changed \nfrom a dormant hospital floating in Baltimore into one of the busiest \nU.S. Department of Defense medical facilities in the world and we \napplaud them for their work.\n  I have always been heartened by good work done by the many \ninternational aid organizations based in Maryland. IMA World Health, \nLutheran World Relief, and the Associated Jewish Community Federation \nof Baltimore are just a few of many agencies that are providing \ncritical supplies and volunteers on the ground.\n  We are grateful for good news from these agencies, such as the safe \nreturn of IMA employees Sarla Chand, Ann Varghese and IMA President \nRick Santos, who were trapped for 55 hours under the rubble of a \ndestroyed hotel. In Haiti to work on treatment of tropical diseases \nthat afflict much of the population, they wanted to stay and help with \nearthquake relief as soon as they were freed from the rubble. While \nthey have now returned home to Maryland, their colleagues at IMA have \nfollowed suit, sending 80 boxes of relief supplies, each with \nmedication and supplies to treat common illnesses of 1,000 people for 2 \nmonths.\n  The Baltimore-based Catholic Relief Services was already providing \nvital lifesaving and development programming before the earthquake \nstruck and was tapped by the Vatican to head up all of the Church's \nefforts in Haiti. The 313 permanent staff members on the ground are \npart of the lead agency providing aid in partnership with the 82nd \nAirborne Division. They have distributed food to more than 200,000 \npeople through relief distribution sites in Port-au-Prince, and are \ncoordinating with local agencies to speed up the distribution. They \nhave worked tirelessly to open three operating rooms at St. Francois de \nSales Hospital in Port-Au-Prince, where volunteer medical teams are now \nperforming up to 200 operations a week, with at least one Baltimore \nbased doctor already working there--Dr. Guesly Delva, a native of \nHaiti.\n  It is important to remember that donations made by ordinary citizens \nare what allow these wonderful organizations to continue doing their \nimportant work. I am proud that Marylanders have pitched in. Catholic \nRelief Services has raised more than $38 million in donations, \nincluding generous second collections from local parishes. Text \ndonations by Maryland residents to the Red Cross and other worthy \norganizations carrying out aid and relief projects are in the top 10 \npercent nationwide. These organizations will continue to need support \nover the coming months, so I am pleased to see the U.S. Congress, with \nmy support, moved quickly to pass the Haiti Assistance Income Tax \nIncentive--HAITI--Act, which allows U.S. taxpayers to make charitable \ncontributions to Haiti relief programs before March 1, 2010, and claim \nthose contributions on their 2009 income tax return.\n  The earthquake and the reconstruction effort further underscore the \nneed for smart and effective U.S. development aid to countries mired in \npoverty, like Haiti. I am heartened to see that the newly confirmed \nUSAID Administrator Raj Shah was in place to skillfully manage the \ngovernment-wide aid process. But more must be done to strengthen and \nempower the U.S. Agency of International Development. This is precisely \nwhy I was an original cosponsor to the bipartisan Foreign Assistance \nRevitalization and Accountability Act of 2009, S. 1524. Reforming our \nforeign assistance matters and can have a direct effect on how people \nwithstand and move on after disasters.\n  If the U.S. has the best trained and most equipped development agency \nin the world, the foreign aid we deliver and implement will foster \nsustainable development, enabling the governments of these countries to \nhave the infrastructure and capacity to better manage the situation \nwhen tragedy strikes. I am glad this legislation has passed through \ncommittee and I look forward to working with my colleagues in both the \nSenate and the House to ensure effective development assistance is a \nkey part of U.S. foreign policy.\n  As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I will \ncontinue to closely monitor the situation and help provide the needed \nassistance and resources to our Haitian neighbors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S560-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S560-S561]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ANTITERRORISM TOOLS AND INFORMATION SHARING\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the December \n25, 2009, attempted bombing of Northwest flight 253, and the steps we \nmust continue to take to improve the effectiveness of our Nation's \nantiterrorism tools and interagency information sharing and \ncommunication. On December 25, 2009, a Nigerian national, Umar Farouk \nAbdulmutallab, attempted to detonate an explosive device while onboard \nNorthwest flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit. The device did not \nexplode, but instead ignited, injuring Mr. Abdulmutallab and two other \npassengers.\n  As a result of their heroic actions, the flight crew and passengers \nwere able to restrain Mr. Abdulmutallab and the plane safely landed. \nMr. Abdulmutallab was not on the U.S. Government's terrorist Watch List \nbut he was known to the U.S. intelligence community.\n\n[[Page S561]]\n\n  Following the December 25, 2009, attempted bombing, President Obama \ndirected that a number of actions be taken and that government \nofficials conduct a complete review of the terrorist watch listing \nsystem. The White House made public a summary of the preliminary \nreport, and the President issued several directives to the Director of \nNational Intelligence and the National Counterterrorism Center, NCTC, \nas well as to a number of Departments and Agencies.\n  Since the December 25, 2009, attempted bombing, the State Department, \nthe Transportation Security Administration and the Customs and Border \nPatrol have also made a number of changes to their procedures, \nincluding the addition of new and enhanced screening procedures.\n  Information sharing and interagency communication have come a long \nway since the tragic events of September 11, 2001, and our ability as a \ngovernment to share information and coordinate our actions to detect \nterrorist threats and protect the American people is better today than \nit was on September 11. Our intelligence, law enforcement and homeland \nsecurity communities have successfully disrupted and prevented numerous \nterrorist threats.\n  But the attempted bombing of Northwest flight 253, the January 20 \nfull Judiciary Committee hearing, and the Terrorism and Homeland \nSubcommittee hearing I chaired in April 2009 on information sharing, \nprove that our ability to detect, disrupt and prevent terrorist threats \nstill has gaps.\n  As chairman of the Terrorism and Homeland Security Subcommittee, my \nfirst hearing was on information sharing. I said at that time that I \nwas concerned that the U.S. Government did not have in place ``a \ncomprehensive strategy to overcome bureaucratic hurdles to sharing of \ninformation that could prevent a terrorist attack.'' It is clear that \nterrorism-related information on Mr. Abdulmutallab was available, but \nno one acted on that information enough to challenge him before he \nboarded the airplane.\n  We face evolving terrorist threats to our Nation, and our enemies and \ntheir supporters are clever, resourceful, diverse and dangerous. We \nneed to be able to detect tomorrow's plots whether they are in the air, \non land or from the sea.\n  As a result, I am going to continue to work to ensure that we remove \nthe cultural, institutional and technological obstacles that impede our \nability to prevent the next terrorist attack. Having access to the \nright information has little or no value if it is not pushed, on an \nongoing basis, to the specific agencies that have the responsibility to \nboth analyze it and take follow-up action, as necessary. When new \ninformation is added to our databases, relevant data must be able to \nfind other relevant data. We need to explore real-time connections that \ncan constantly update analysts to ensure that information is sent and \nseen before terrorists are able to board airplanes.\n  During the January 20 full Judiciary Committee hearing, I sought \nanswers on who in our government is responsible for analyzing terrorism \ninformation and taking the necessary follow-up actions to protect the \nAmerican people. The FBI Director indicated that NCTC was responsible \nfor analyzing threat information and nominating known or suspected \ninternational terrorists to the Terrorist Screening Center for watch \nlisting purposes. The Department of Homeland Security stated that it \nwas a ``consumer'' of that information. But clearly, no one followed up \nto conduct further screening to prevent Mr. Abdulmutallab from boarding \nthe plane. The President has ordered the Director of National \nIntelligence to ``reaffirm and clarify roles and responsibilities,'' \nand he has directed that NCTC ensure that there is a process to \n``prioritize to pursue thoroughly and exhaustively terrorism threat \nthreads,'' to include ``follow-up action.''\n  We must make sure that our law enforcement, intelligence, and \nhomeland security professionals clearly know who is responsible for \ntaking follow-up actions on terrorist threats to protect the American \npeople, and that those officials have the authorities they need to act.\n  At the same time, as I have said previously, we must make sure that \nour government uses its scare resources wisely, and that it strikes an \nappropriate balance between national security and protecting civil \nliberties. We have now begun consideration of the fiscal year 2011 \nbudget. We need to ensure that we have well-qualified and highly \nskilled airport screeners and security personnel, and that they have \nall the tools they need to do their jobs effectively. Mistaken \nprofiling, however, that improperly relies on racial and ethnic \nfactors, and not on a broad and valid set of behavioral indicators of \npotential terrorist activity, will waste resources, harm innocent \nindividuals, and impede commerce.\n  And while technology can play a crucial role in helping to prevent \nterrorists from bringing explosives onto our airplanes, the first \npriority must be to identify potential terrorists and keep them off our \nairplanes.\n  The memory of 9/11 has been seared in our hearts and our minds, but \nit does not blind us to the wisdom that we must fight our enemies while \nremaining true to the fundamental principles and values upon which this \ngreat nation was founded. The men and women of our Armed Forces and \ntheir families have sacrificed much to protect and preserve the \nAmerican way of life and what this nation stands for. The ongoing \nthreat from al-Qaida and other terrorists who intend to harm us is \nreal. However, we do not need to choose between security and liberty. \nLegitimate debate will continue on how we should strike the balance \nbetween the two at this time in our Nation's history.\n  But we must reject what the 9/11 Commission described as the ``false \nchoice'' between security and liberty. Whether the issue is information \nsharing, airport screening procedures, or the use of technology, we can \nprotect the American people from harm while preserving civil rights and \nliberties.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S561-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S561-S562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             90TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE LEAGUE OF WOMEN VOTERS\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to commemorate the League of \nWomen Voters on the occasion of the 90th anniversary of its founding. \nCarrie Chapman Catt and many of the same women leaders who were part of \nthe women's suffrage movement founded the League of Women Voters in \nChicago on February 14, 1920, during the convention of the National \nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association. The convention was held 6 months \nbefore the 19th amendment to the U.S. Constitution was ratified. The \n19th amendment, of course, gave women the right to vote after a 72-year \nstruggle.\n  According to the league's Web site:\n\n       [T]he League began as a ``mighty political experiment'' \n     designed to help 20 million women carry out their new \n     responsibilities as voters. It encouraged them to use their \n     new power to participate in shaping public policy. From the \n     beginning, the League was an activist, grassroots \n     organization whose leaders believed that citizens should play \n     a critical role in advocacy. It was then, and is now, a \n     nonpartisan organization.\n\n  The league is proudly nonpartisan; it neither supports nor opposes \ncandidates or political parties at any level of government. But the \nleague is actively engaged on issues of vital concern to its members \nand the broader public.\n  The league has a long, rich history that grows more illustrious with \neach passing year. For the past 90 years, the league has played an \nactive role in educating not just women but the entire American public \nabout our democracy and about those individuals who are candidates for \nelective office. Carrie Chapman Catt founded the organization with a \ncall to women of all parties and political leanings to come together in \norder to help pass legislation that would protect and aid major \npolitical movements in the future. Her nonpartisan organization would \nsoon take on a prominent role in politics through its efforts on behalf \nof citizen education and advocacy. Today, there are more than 850 \nchapters across the country advancing Carrie Chapman Catt's original \nidea, including 16 local leagues in Maryland.\n  The League of Women Voters continues to play an important role in \nhelping shape public policy by ensuring that the public is well-\ninformed. Not only has the league been active on the policy front, but \nit has helped make our democracy stronger by sponsoring debates that \neducate citizens and by\n\n[[Page S562]]\n\nmaking voter information easily accessible. The league's election \ninformation Web site--vote411.org--is an invaluable resource for many \nAmericans, providing information on voter registration and on local, \nState, and national issues.\n  The league has been instrumental in promoting democracy and civil \nsociety abroad, too. After World War II, for instance, the league \nsupported efforts to establish the United Nations, U.N., and became one \nof the first organizations in the country officially recognized by the \nUnited Nations as a nongovernmental organization, NGO. The league also \nsupported the creation of the World Bank, the International Monetary \nFund, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the Marshall plan. \nThe league maintains official observer status at the U.N. today and has \nspecial consultative status to the Economic and Social Council. The \nleague served as an NGO delegate to the United Nations Framework \nConvention on Climate Change in December. Through its Global Democracy \nProgram, the league has sponsored cultural exchange programs and \nleaders from Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Colombia, and \nBrazil.\n  Throughout my career in public service, I have participated in many \nLeague of Women Voters debates, and I have seen first-hand the impact \nthat the league has had on educating the voters about the issues that \nmost directly affect them. We are a stronger democracy thanks to the \ncontinuing efforts of the League of Women Voters.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing the profound impact the \nLeague of Women Voters has had on our Nation throughout its 90-year \nhistory. I look forward to working with the league in the future to \nensure that Marylanders and all Americans have the information they \nneed to make informed decisions on election day. And I welcome and \nsupport the league's ongoing efforts to ``export'' what is best about \nour democracy to countries around the world. We are fortunate indeed \nsuch an organization exists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S562-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           VOTE EXPLANATIONS\n\n  Mr. THUNE.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \nhonoring the memory of Clu Cotter, Kevin O'Conner, Tom Stolberg and \nDennis Donovan. Clu Cotter, Kevin O'Connor, and Tom Stolberg, employees \nof the California Department of Fish and Game, and Dennis Donovan, a \nhelicopter pilot, tragically lost their lives on January 5 as a result \nof a helicopter crash that occurred during an aerial deer survey in \neastern Madera County.\n  Mr. Clu Cotter was the California Department of Fish and Game \nassociate wildlife biologist stationed in Fresno. He studied the North \nKings and San Joaquin deer herd populations, and rare carnivores in the \nhigh Sierra. He was often called on to hike or ski into remote rugged \nareas for his work. He was admired by his colleagues for his positive \nattitude and devotion to his family, as well as his humor and \nendurance. In his spare time, he was an avid outdoorsman with a keen \nsense of adventure and a deep love for nature. In 1985, he used his \noutdoor survival expertise to successfully rescue a group of hikers who \nwere caught in a lightning storm in Yosemite National Park. A devotee \nof cyclocross, a form of bicycle racing that combines elements of cross \ncountry cycling and mountain biking, Mr. Cotter was renowned as one of \nthe most accomplished mountain and distance bicyclists in Central \nCalifornia. Mr. Cotter is survived by his wife Marni Cotter and two \nsons Ren and Jamie. He was 48 years old.\n  Mr. Kevin O'Connor was a Supervising Biologist in the California \nDepartment of Fish and Game region 4 office. After graduating from the \nUniversity of California at Davis in 1993, he worked for the U.S. \nForest Service in central and northern California. He later joined the \nDepartment of Fish and Game and was promoted to senior wildlife \nbiologist in 2005, a position in which he oversaw wildlife management \nin nine counties. He was a dedicated scientist who did extensive work \non the ecological reserves of the San Joaquin Valley and with protected \nand game species in the southern Sierra Nevada range. He sought to \nelevate the quality of scientific information used for wildlife \nmanagement and other activities, such as timber harvest. His expertise \nand leadership qualities earned him the respect of his colleagues. Mr. \nO'Connor is survived by his wife Keri; daughters Kayleigh, Michelle, \nMcKenna; and son Aidan. He was 40 years old.\n  Mr. Tom Stolberg joined the Department of Fish and Game in 2004 as a \nscientific aide in the wildlife management office in Fresno. Tom was \nthe first person most people talked to when contacting Wildlife \nManagement, and soon became expert in providing the public sound \ninformation on hunting, and wildlife in general. Tom also assisted with \nwildlife habitat projects, capturing deer for telemetry studies, and \nmanaging special public hunts. A man of many talents and interests, \nranging across hunting, medieval reenactments, metalworking, gourmet \ncooking, and more, he was described by his mother as a walking \nencyclopedia who could speak with authority on everything from sewing \nto World War II history. An Eagle Scout, he remained active in the Boy \nScouts by leading young people on trips through Yosemite National Park. \nHe will be fondly remembered for his professionalism, intellect, and \nhis warm and gregarious personality. Mr. Stolberg is survived by his \nparents, brother, and sister. He was 31 years old.\n  Mr. Dennis Donovan, a Navy veteran, was an experienced pilot who had \nbeen flying since 1964. He served three combat tours in Vietnam and \nworked as a naval flight instructor in Florida, and for the USGS and \nMercy Air. He worked for Landalls Aviation for almost 30 years and had \nflown for State and Federal agencies, including the California \nDepartment of Fish and Game for survey flights. Mr. Donovan is survived \nby his wife Arlene; two sons Matthew and Douglas; and five \ngrandchildren. He was 70 years old.\n  I offer my heartfelt condolences to the families, friends, and \ncolleagues of Clu Cotter, Kevin O'Connor, Tom Stolberg and Dennis \nDonovan. They valiantly sacrificed their lives in the pursuit of \nscience, conservation and public service. Their exemplary service \nepitomizes the commitment and courage that Department of Fish and Game \nemployees exhibit on a daily basis, often with little or no fanfare, in \ntheir effort to enhance the public enjoyment of California's abundant \nand diverse native wildlife, fish and plant species and their natural \ncommunities. Their goodness, dedication and accomplishments are \nappreciated and will not be forgotten.\n  We shall always be grateful for the sacrifice that Clu Cotter, Kevin \nO'Connor, Tom Stolberg and Dennis Donovan made in giving their lives to \nhelp make California a better place. They will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S562-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S562-S563]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING BRUBAKER ELEMENTARY SCHOOL\n\n Mr. HARKIN.

Traveling across this country, I have met countless men \nand women who have lost jobs these past two years. I have met small \nbusiness owners struggling to pay for health care for their workers; \nseniors unable to afford prescriptions; parents worried about paying \nthe bills and saving for their children's future and their own \nretirement. And the effects of this recession come in the aftermath of \na decade of declining economic security for the middle class and those \nwho aspire to it.\n  At the same time, over the past two years, we have also seen reason \nfor hope: the resilience of the American people who have held fast--\neven in the face of hardship--to an unrelenting faith in the promise of \nour country.\n  It is that determination that has helped the American people overcome \ndifficult periods in our Nation's history. And it is this perseverance \nthat remains our great strength today. After all, our workers are as \nproductive as ever. American businesses are still leaders in \ninnovation. Our potential is still unrivaled. Our task as a Nation--and \nour mission as an Administration--is to harness that innovative spirit, \nthat productive energy, and that potential in order to create jobs, \nraise incomes, and foster economic growth that is sustained and broadly \nshared. It's not enough to move the economy from recession to recovery. \nWe must rebuild the economy on a new and stronger foundation.\n  I can report that over the past year, this work has begun. In the \ncoming year, this work continues. But to understand where we must go in \nthe next year and beyond, it is important to remember where we began \none year ago.\n  Last January, years of irresponsible risk-taking and debt-fueled \nspeculation--unchecked by sound oversight--led to the near-collapse of \nour financial system. We were losing an average of 700,000 jobs each \nmonth. Over the course of one year, $13 trillion of Americans' \nhousehold wealth had evaporated as stocks, pensions, and home values \nplummeted. Our gross domestic product was falling at the fastest rate \nin a quarter century. The flow of credit, vital to the functioning of \nbusinesses large and small, had ground to a halt. The fear among \neconomists, from across the political spectrum, was that we could sink \ninto a second Great Depression.\n  Immediately, we took a series of difficult steps to prevent that \ncatastrophe for American families and businesses. We acted to get \nlending flowing again so ordinary Americans could get financing to buy \nhomes and cars, to go to college, and to start businesses of their own; \nand so businesses, large and small, could access loans to make payroll, \nbuy equipment, hire workers, and expand. We enacted measures to stem \nthe tide of foreclosures in our housing market, helping responsible \nhomeowners stay in their homes and helping to stop the broader decline \nin home values.\n  To achieve this, and to prevent an economic collapse, we were forced \nto use authority enacted under the previous Administration to extend \nassistance to some of the very banks and financial institutions whose \nactions had helped precipitate the turmoil. We also took steps to \nprevent the collapse of the American auto industry, which faced a \ncrisis partly of its own making, to prevent another round of widespread \njob losses in an already fragile time. These decisions were not \npopular, but they were necessary. Indeed, the decision to stabilize the \nfinancial system helped to avert a larger catastrophe, and thanks to \nthe efficient management of the rescue--with added transparency and \naccountability--we have recovered most of the money provided to banks.\n  In addition, even as we worked to address the crises in our banking \nsector, in our housing market, and in our auto industry, we also began \nattacking our economic crisis on a broader front. Less than one month \nafter taking office, we enacted the most sweeping economic recovery \npackage in history: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. \nThe Recovery Act not only provided tax cuts to small businesses and 95 \npercent of working families and provided emergency relief to those out \nof work or without health insurance; it also began to lay a new \nfoundation for long-term growth. With investments in health care, \neducation, infrastructure, and clean energy, the Recovery Act has saved \nor created roughly two million jobs so far, and it has begun the hard \nwork of transforming our economy to thrive in the modern, global era.\n  Because of these and other steps, we can safely say that we've \navoided the depression many feared. Our economy is growing again, and \nthe growth over the last three months was the strongest in six years. \nBut while economic growth is important, it means nothing to somebody \nwho has lost a job and can't find another. For Americans looking for \nwork, a good job is the only good news that matters. And that's why our \nwork is far from complete.\n  It is true that the steps we have taken have slowed the flood of job \nlosses from 691,000 per month in the first quarter of 2009 to 69,000 in \nthe last quarter. But stemming the tide of job loss isn't enough. More \nthan 7 million jobs have been lost since the recession began two years \nago. This represents not only a terrible human tragedy, but also a very \ndeep hole from which we'll have to climb out. Until jobs are being \ncreated to replace those we've lost--until America is back at work--my \nAdministration will not rest and this recovery will not be finished.\n  That's why I am continuing to call on the Congress to pass a jobs \nbill. I've\n\n[[Page S568]]\n\nproposed a package that includes tax relief for small businesses to \nspur hiring, that accelerates construction on roads, bridges, and \nwaterways, and that creates incentives for homeowners to invest in \nenergy efficiency, because this will create jobs, save families money, \nand reduce pollution that harms our environment.\n  It is also essential that as we promote private sector hiring, we \ncontinue to take steps to prevent layoffs of critical public servants \nlike teachers, firefighters, and police officers, whose jobs are \nthreatened by State and local budget shortfalls. To do otherwise would \nnot only worsen unemployment and hamper our recovery; it would also \nundermine our communities. And we cannot forget the millions of people \nwho have lost their jobs. The Recovery Act provided support for these \nfamilies hardest hit by this recession, and that support must continue.\n  At the same time, long before this crisis hit, middle-class families \nwere under growing strain. For decades, Washington failed to address \nfundamental weaknesses in the economy: rising health care costs, \ngrowing dependence on foreign oil, an education system unable to \nprepare all of our children for the jobs of the future. In recent \nyears, spending bills and tax cuts for the very wealthiest were \napproved without paying for any of it, leaving behind a mountain of \ndebt. And while Wall Street gambled without regard for the \nconsequences, Washington looked the other way.\n  As a result, the economy may have been working for some at the very \ntop, but it was not working for all American families. Year after year, \nfolks were forced to work longer hours, spend more time away from \ntheir loved ones, all while their incomes flat-lined and their sense of \neconomic security evaporated. Growth in our country was neither \nsustained nor broadly shared. Instead of a prosperity powered by smart \nideas and sound investments, growth was fueled in large part by a rapid \nrise in consumer borrowing and consumer spending.\n\n  Beneath the statistics are the stories of hardship I've heard all \nacross America--hardships that began long before this recession hit two \nyears ago. For too many, there has long been a sense that the American \ndream--a chance to make your own way, to work hard and support your \nfamily, save for college and retirement, own a home--was slipping away. \nAnd this sense of anxiety has been combined with a deep frustration \nthat Washington either didn't notice, or didn't care enough to act.\n  These weaknesses have not only made our economy more susceptible to \nthe kind of crisis we have been through. They have also meant that even \nin good times the economy did not produce nearly enough gains for \nmiddle-class families. Typical American families saw their standards of \nliving stagnate, rather than rise as they had for generations. That is \nwhy, in the aftermath of this crisis, and after years of inaction, what \nis clear is that we cannot go back to business as usual.\n  That is why, as we strive to meet the crisis of the moment, we are \ncontinuing to lay a new foundation for prosperity: a foundation on \nwhich the middle class can prosper and grow, where if you are willing \nto work hard, you can find a good job, afford a home, send your \nchildren to world-class schools, afford high-quality health care, and \nenjoy retirement security in your later years. This is the heart of the \nAmerican Dream, and it is at the core of our efforts to not only \nrebuild this economy--but to rebuild it stronger than before. And this \nwork has already begun.\n  Already, we have made historic strides to reform and improve our \neducation system. We have launched a Race to the Top in which schools \nare competing to create the most innovative programs, especially in \nmath and science. We have already made college more affordable, even as \nwe seek to increase student aid by ending a wasteful subsidy that \nserves only to line the pockets of lenders with tens of billions of \ntaxpayer dollars. And I've proposed a new American Graduation \nInitiative and set this goal: by 2020, America will once again have the \nhighest proportion of college graduates in the world. For we know that \nin this new century, growth will be powered not by what consumers can \nborrow and spend, but what talented, skilled workers can create and \nexport.\n  Already, we have made historic strides to improve our health care \nsystem, essential to our economic prosperity. The burdens this system \nplaces on workers, businesses, and governments is simply unsustainable. \nAnd beyond the economic cost--which is vast--there is also a terrible \nhuman toll. That's why we've extended health insurance to millions more \nchildren; invested in health information technology through the \nRecovery Act to improve care and reduce costly errors; and provided the \nlargest boost to medical research in our history. And I continue to \nfight to pass real, meaningful health insurance reforms that will get \ncosts under control for families, businesses, and governments, protect \npeople from the worst practices of insurance companies, and make \ncoverage more affordable and secure for people with insurance, as well \nas those without it.\n  Already, we have begun to build a new clean energy economy. The \nRecovery Act included the largest investment in clean energy in \nhistory, investments that are today creating jobs across America in the \nindustries that will power our future: developing wind energy, solar \ntechnology, and clean energy vehicles. But this work has only just \nbegun. Other countries around the world understand that the nation that \nleads the clean energy economy will be the nation that leads the global \neconomy. I want America to be that nation. That is why we are working \ntoward legislation that will create new incentives to finally make \nrenewable energy the profitable kind of energy in America. It's not \nonly essential for our planet and our security, it's essential for our \neconomy.\n  But this is not all we must do. For growth to be truly sustainable--\nfor our prosperity to be truly shared and our living standards to \nactually rise--we need to move beyond an economy that is fueled by \nbudget deficits and consumer demand. In other words, in order to create \njobs and raise incomes for the middle class over the long run, we need \nto export more and borrow less from around the world, and we need to \nsave more money and take on less debt here at home. As we rebuild, we \nmust also rebalance. In order to achieve this, we'll need to grow this \neconomy by growing our capacity to innovate in burgeoning industries, \nwhile putting a stop to irresponsible budget policies and financial \ndealings that have led us into such a deep fiscal and economic hole.\n  That begins with policies that will promote innovation throughout our \neconomy. To spur the discoveries that will power new jobs, new \nbusinesses--and perhaps new industries--I have challenged both the \npublic sector and the private sector to devote more resources to \nresearch and development. And to achieve this, my budget puts us on a \npath to double investment in key research agencies and makes the \nresearch and experimentation tax credit permanent. We are also pursuing \npolicies that will help us export more of our goods around the world, \nespecially by small businesses and farmers. And by harnessing the \ngrowth potential of international trade--while ensuring that other \ncountries play by the rules and that all Americans share in the \nbenefits--we will support millions of good, high-paying jobs.\n\n  But hand in hand with increasing our reliance on the Nation's \ningenuity is decreasing our reliance on the Nation's credit card, as \nwell as reining in the excess and abuse in our financial sector that \nled large firms to take on extraordinary risks and extraordinary \nliabilities.\n  When my Administration took office, the surpluses our Nation had \nenjoyed at the start of the last decade had disappeared as a result of \nthe failure to pay for two large tax cuts, two wars, and a new \nentitlement program. And decades of neglect of rising health care costs \nhad put our budget on an unsustainable path.\n  In the long term, we cannot have sustainable and durable economic \ngrowth without getting our fiscal house in order. That is why even as \nwe increased our short-term deficit to rescue the economy, we have \nrefused to go along with business as usual, taking responsibility for \nevery dollar we spend. Last year, we combed the budget, cutting waste \nand excess wherever we could, a\n\n[[Page S569]]\n\nprocess that will continue in the coming years. We are pursuing health \ninsurance reforms that are essential to reining in deficits. I've \ncalled for a fee to be paid by the largest financial firms so that the \nAmerican people are fully repaid for bailing out the financial sector. \nAnd I've proposed a freeze on nonsecurity discretionary spending for \nthree years, a bipartisan commission to address the long-term \nstructural imbalance between expenditures and revenues, and the \nenactment of ``pay-go'' rules so that Congress has to account for every \ndollar it spends.\n  In addition, I've proposed a set of common sense reforms to prevent \nfuture financial crises. For while the financial system is far stronger \ntoday than it was one year ago, it is still operating under the same \nrules that led to its near-collapse. These are rules that allowed firms \nto act contrary to the interests of customers; to hide their exposure \nto debt through complex financial dealings that few understood; to \nbenefit from taxpayer-insured deposits while making speculative \ninvestments to increase their own profits; and to take on risks so vast \nthat they posed a threat to the entire economy and the jobs of tens of \nmillions of Americans.\n  That is why we are seeking reforms to empower consumers with the \nbenefit of a new consumer watchdog charged with making sure that \nfinancial information is clear and transparent; to close loopholes that \nallowed big financial firms to trade risky financial products like \ncredit defaults swaps and other derivatives without any oversight; to \nidentify system-wide risks that could cause a financial meltdown; to \nstrengthen capital and liquidity requirements to make the system more \nstable; and to ensure that the failure of any large firm does not take \nthe economy down with it. Never again will the American taxpayer be \nheld hostage by a bank that is ``too big to fail.''\n  Through these reforms, we seek not to undermine our markets but to \nmake them stronger: to promote a vibrant, fair, and transparent \nfinancial system that is far more resistant to the reckless, \nirresponsible activities that might lead to another meltdown. And these \nkinds of reforms are in the shared interest of firms on Wall Street and \nfamilies on Main Street.\n  These have been a very tough two years. American families and \nbusinesses have paid a heavy price for failures of responsibility from \nWall Street to Washington. Our task now is to move beyond these \nfailures, to take responsibility for our future once more. That is how \nwe will create new jobs in new industries, harnessing the incredible \ngenerative and creative capacity of our people. That is how we'll \nachieve greater economic security and opportunity for middle-class \nfamilies in this country. That is how in this new century we will \nrebuild our economy stronger than ever before.\n\n                                                        Barack Obama,  \nThe White House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S569-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXECUTIVE REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following executive reports of nominations were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. DORGAN for the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n       *Lillian A.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose \na 50 percent tax on bonuses paid by TARP recipients, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, in the years leading up to the \nfinancial crisis, risky and reckless bonus-laden pay packages ruled at \nWall Street banks.\n  After crashing our economy, these too-big-to-fail banks needed the \nBush administration and the American taxpayer to bail them out.\n  The Temporary Asset Relief Program, TARP, pumped billions and \nbillions of taxpayer dollars into the financial system to stabilize our \neconomy and prevent another Great Depression.\n  The Obama administration continued the TARP program while also taking \nnecessary and swift action passing the Recovery Act.\n  But unemployment remains high even as our economy begins to recover, \nand Wall Street is back to its old ways.\n  Insurance giant AIG got $182.3 billion in bailout money. Last \nWednesday, AIG paid $100 million more in bonuses to its employees.\n  Goldman Sachs got $10 billion directly from TARP and another $12.9 \nbillion in taxpayer aid through the AIG bailout. Goldman will pay its \nemployees bonuses worth $16 billion.\n  The average banker at Bank of America got a $400,000 bonus one year \nafter the bank took $45 billion from TARP. The average worker in Ohio \nmakes just over $41,000 a year.\n  The Federal Reserve has taken extraordinary steps and made trillions \nof dollars available in low-interest loans to American banks. Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac are just about the only buyers today for mortgages \nin the secondary market.\n  Big banks received hundreds of billions of dollars from U.S. \ntaxpayers in half a dozen ways to stabilize their finances and increase \nfinancing to businesses and consumers.\n  Our economy is reliant on small businesses, which account for more \nthan 65 percent of jobs created in our Nation.\n  But despite the banks' rapid recovery, their small business lending \ncontinues to decrease, month after month.\n  In November 2009, the U.S. Treasury Department reported that the 22 \nlargest financial institutions receiving taxpayer assistance reduced \nlending by $10.5 billion over the previous six months.\n  These same banks reduced small business loans by another $1 billion \naccording to a report released in December 2009.\n  I have heard from too many small business owners--from Youngstown to \nMansfield, from Athens to Elyria--that they simply can't access the \ncredit they need to hire workers or expand business.\n  For 10 years wealthy bankers were partying like it was 1999. When the \neconomy came crashing down the middle class was forced to sacrifice \ntheir money and their children's money to save the banks and unfreeze \ncredit. They are still waiting for Wall Street to live up to their end \nof the bargain.\n  That is why today I introduced The Wall Street Bonus Tax Act, which \nwould use Wall Street's excess to fund small businesses.\n  The Wall Street Bonus Tax Act imposes a 50 percent excise tax for \n2010 on bonuses awarded at financial institutions that received TARP \nassistance.\n  The revenue generated by the tax would go to the Small Business \nAdministration to implement a direct small business lending program to \nhelp small businesses in towns like Bucyrus and Dublin.\n  Wall Street's lavish bonuses were made possible by the taxpayers' \nmoney--money that was supposed to be lent to businesses.\n  Instead of patting themselves on the back, the banks should be making \nloans that help the middle class recover.\n  This bill is a critical step in that direction.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 3009. A bill to require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \ncoins in recognition of and to commemorate the 1863 Invasion of \nPennsylvania, the Battle of Gettysburg, and President Abraham Lincoln's \nGettysburg Address; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, today, I have sought recognition to offer \nlegislation supporting the 150th anniversary of the Battle of \nGettysburg. This legislation will serve to commemorate three historic \nevents in our country: the 1863 Invasion of Pennsylvania, the decisive \nBattle of Gettysburg, and President Lincoln's famous Gettysburg \nAddress.\n  On November 19, 1863, President Abraham Lincoln chose Gettysburg for \nhis most famous address because the battle was the turning point of the \nCivil War. The safety and security of Pennsylvania's capital, \nrailroads, industries, and citizens were at stake. The resulting Battle \nof Gettysburg was the largest and costliest of the Civil War and of the \ncountry to date with 51,000 Union and Confederate casualties. Soldiers \nfrom the U.S. Regular Army and volunteer units from Pennsylvania, \nAlabama, Arkansas, Connecticut, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, \nIndiana, Louisiana, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, \nMinnesota, Mississippi, Ohio, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, \nNorth Carolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, \nVermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and Wisconsin served during this \ncampaign and battle. Their sacrifices should not be forgotten.\n  This legislation will authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to mint \nand issue commemorative Gettysburg coins in three denominations: $5 \ngold, $1 silver, and half-dollar silver. These coins will only be \ndistributed during the calendar year of 2013, the 150th anniversary of \nGettysburg, and will have surcharges of $35, $10, and $5 respectively. \nThe revenue generated from these surcharges will be divided between the \nGettysburg Foundation and the Army Heritage Center Foundation to help \nfinance their respective nonprofit programs dedicated to supporting the \nhundreds of thousands of visitors who walk the Gettysburg grounds each \nyear and to preserve the memory of those who served and the history \nthat they made.\n  These two foundations are nongovernmental, member-based, and publicly \nsupported nonprofit organizations that are dependent on funds from \nmembers, donations, and grants for support. The foundations use such \nsupport to help create and sustain the Gettysburg National Military \nPark and the Army Heritage and Education Center. The Gettysburg \nFoundation is recognized as the official partner of Gettysburg National \nMilitary Park and the Army Heritage Center Foundation is recognized by \nthe Secretary of the Army as the lead agency supporting the development \nof the Army Heritage and Education Center.\n  The Gettysburg Act will greatly benefit our nation by preserving this \nhistoric battle ground for countless visitors from across the nation \nand from around the world. It will help fund battlefield preservation \nand rehabilitation\n\n[[Page S571]]\n\nprojects at Gettysburg National Military Park by restoring \napproximately 27 acres of battlefield to its 1863 appearance. This act \nwill help preserve the hallowedness of the ground by relocating 12 \nmonuments to their original locations, where the veterans themselves \nplaced these monuments several generations ago. Visitors to Gettysburg \nwill benefit from increased educational programming at both the Army \nHeritage and Education Center and the Gettysburg Battle Visitor Center \nas the act helps facilitate the continued expansion of the Army \nHeritage and Education Center and construction of the Army Heritage \nMuseum, both of which are dedicated ``to telling the Army story . . . \none Soldier at a time.''\n  The importance of the 1863 Campaign in Pennsylvania, the Battle of \nGettysburg, and Lincoln's address stretch well beyond the Commonwealth \nof Pennsylvania and stand as an enduring reminder of how our nation was \nreborn out of the Civil War as a stronger Union more dedicated to its \nideals of freedom and liberty. I urge each of my colleagues to join \nSenator Casey and myself in supporting this legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S571-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S571]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 415--CALLING FOR A RENEWED FOCUS ON THE GOVERNMENT OF \nTHE ISLAMIC REPUBLIC OF IRAN'S VIOLATIONS OF INTERNATIONALLY-RECOGNIZED \n   HUMAN RIGHTS AS FOUND IN THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS\n\n  Mr. CASEY (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Kaufman, Mr. \nLevin, and Mr. Kerry) submitted the following resolution, which was \nconsidered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, this past week, New York Times columnist \nGail Collins noted that ``Washington was immobilized by snow on Friday. \nThis is highly unusual. Normally, Washington is immobilized by \nsenators.''\n  Sadly, Gail Collins is right. The unprecedented abuse of Senate rules \nby Republicans has overwhelmed the legislative process. The same week \nthat Washington saw a large snow storm shut down the city and close the \nFederal Government, we saw the unprecedented action of a minority \nblocking Senate confirmation of every single executive branch nominee. \nLast week, we saw Republicans require the Senate to debate for 30 hours \none Department of Labor nominee in lieu of conducting other business \nand I use the term ``debate'' generously since during that time one \nMember spoke in opposition to her confirmation. This Congress, we have \nseen the minority require the Senate clerk to read lengthy bills out \nloud. And, most significantly, the minority has used the filibuster at \nan unheard of level in the history of this body.\n  The U.S. Senate cannot continue to function this way. That is why \ntoday I am introducing a bill to change the Standing Rules of the \nSenate to reform the cloture procedure in the U.S. Senate. I am \nintroducing this bill as a member of the majority party in the Senate. \nI note, however, that this bill is identical to the one I first \nintroduced in 1995, when I was a member of the minority party in the \nSenate. So this legislation is not about one party or the other gaining \nan advantage. It is about the Senate as an institution operating more \nfairly, effectively, and democratically.\n  I will explain the details of my proposal shortly. But first I would \nlike to provide some historical background.\n  In 1995, for the first time in 8 years I found myself a member of the \nminority party in the Senate. At the beginning of that Congress, \nalthough Republicans outnumbered Democrats 53 to 47, I introduced \nlegislation to change the Senate rules regarding the filibuster. My \nplan would have ensured ample debate and deliberation--the original \npurpose of the filibuster--but it would have allowed a bill, over time, \nto be passed by a simple majority vote. Unfortunately, my proposal did \nnot pass.\n  In the intervening years, it has become even more apparent that for \nour government to properly function, we must reform and curb the use of \nthe filibuster.\n  I readily acknowledge, changing the Senate rules is a tall order; and \nmy goal is not to change the rules halfway through the 111th Congress. \nInstead, it is to lay down a marker and to focus attention on the \nunprecedented level of obstruction that occurs in the Senate today. The \nsad reality is that, today, because of the promiscuous use of the \nfilibuster, the ability of our government to legislate and to address \nproblems is severely jeopardized.\n  The filibuster was once an extraordinary tool used in the rarest of \ninstances. When many people think of the filibuster they think of the \nclimax of the classic film ``Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,'' when Jimmy \nStewart's character singlehandedly uses a filibuster to stop a corrupt \npiece of legislation favored by special interests.\n  The reality is that in 1939, the year ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington'' was filmed, there were zero filibusters in this body. In \nthe 1950s, there was an average of just one filibuster per Congress.\n  Yet, over the past half century, the use of this device has grown \nexponentially. The concerns I raise today are not new. The problem, \nhowever, has become far more serious.\n  In 1982, my good friend and colleague Senator Dale Bumpers of \nArkansas said this about procedures like the filibuster:\n\n       Unless we recognize that things are out of control and \n     procedures have to be changed, we'll never be an effective \n     legislative body again.\n\n  During the 2 years of that Congress, the 97th, there were 31 \nfilibusters, as measured by the number of cloture motions filed.\n  In 1985, former Senator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri remarked:\n\n       The Senate is now in the state of incipient anarchy. The \n     filibuster, once used, by and large, as an occasional \n     exercise in civil rights matters, has now become a routine \n     frolic in almost all matters. Whereas our rules were devised \n     to guarantee full and free debate, they now guarantee \n     unbridled chaos.\n\n  During that Congress, the 99th, there were 40 filibusters.\n  In 1994, former Senator Charles Mathias of Maryland said:\n\n       Today, filibusters are far less visible but far more \n     frequent. The filibuster has become an epidemic used whenever \n     a coalition can find 41 votes to oppose legislation. The \n     distinction between voting against legislation and blocking a \n     vote, between opposing and obstructing, has nearly \n     disappeared.\n\n  During that Congress, the 103rd, right before I first introduced \nlegislation to modify the filibuster, there were 80 filibusters.\n  Remarkably, from 1995 through 2008, the number of filibusters per \nCongress has increased 75 percent. In the last Congress, the 110th \nCongress, there were an astonishing 139 motions to end filibusters.\n  In the current 111th Congress, now near its midpoint, there have been \n74. Last year alone, in one year--2009--there were 67 filibusters. In \njust 1 year, Republicans tripled the amount of filibusters that \noccurred in the entire 20-year period between 1950 and 1969.\n  I would also point out that, according to a study by UCLA Professor \nBarbara Sinclair, in the 1960s, just 8 percent of major bills were \nsubject to a filibuster. In the last Congress, 70 percent of major \nbills were targeted.\n  The simple fact is that, today, rather than an unusual event, the \nfilibuster, or the threat of a filibuster, has become a routine \noccurrence. Let me repeat these figures. In the 1950s, an average of \none bill was filibustered in each Congress. In the 104th Congress, when \nDemocrats were in the minority, there were 82 filibusters. In the last \nCongress, 139 bills were filibustered. In the current Congress, there \nhave already been 74 filibusters.\n  What was once a procedure used very rarely and judiciously has become \nan almost daily procedure used routinely and often recklessly.\n\n[[Page S573]]\n\n  A quarter century ago, faced with 40 filibusters in the course of one \nCongress, Senator Eagleton remarked that the Senate was in a situation \nof ``unbridled chaos.''\n  Sixteen years ago, faced with 80 filibusters in one Congress, Senator \nMathias warned that the Senate was facing an ``epidemic.''\n  In this Congress, we are on pace to far surpass those earlier \nnumbers. At the current pace, we will face approximately 140 \nfilibusters in the 111th Congress. It is no accident that Norm \nOrnstein, the esteemed Congressional scholar, wrote an article in 2008 \ntitled ``Our Broken Senate.''\n  And, it is not just scholars. Editorials throughout the country have \nrecognized that the use of the filibuster must be changed. The Newark \nStar-Ledger called the filibuster a ``rule that cripples our \ndemocracy.'' The San Jose Mercury News recently noted that the \n``Senate's abuse of filibuster rule threatens democracy.'' The \nSacramento Bee wrote that it is ``time to bust up [the] filibuster.''\n  The extraordinary number of filibusters by Republicans are not just \nstatistics. Behind each filibuster is an attempt by Republicans to \nblock the majority from passing legislation and confirming nominees to \nhelp everyday working Americans.\n  In the 71 years since Hollywood filmed ``Mr. Smith Goes to \nWashington,'' the aim of the filibuster has been turned completely \nupside down. Seven decades ago, Jimmy Stewart, ``Senator Smith,'' was \nthe little guy using the filibuster to battle the special interests. \nToday, it is the special interests that are using the filibuster to \nkill legislation that would benefit the little guy.\n  What is particularly striking, moreover, is not just the sheer number \nof filibusters today. It is the fact that this once rare tactic--what \nwas once a dramatic challenge to majority rule only used in \nextraordinary circumstances--is now used or threatened to be used on \nvirtually every measure and every nominee. To quote Norm Ornstein:\n\n       The Senate has taken the term ``deliberative'' to a new \n     level, slowing not just contentious legislation but also \n     bills that have overwhelming support.\n\n  For example, late last year, the Republicans filibustered a motion to \nproceed to the Defense Appropriations bill for the sole purpose to \ndelay a vote on health care reform. In other words, Republicans risked \ndenying our troops the resources they need at a time of war for no \nother purpose than to delay the Senate. After a filibuster and delay, \nthe bill passed 88 to 10.\n  The Republicans filibustered a motion to proceed to a bill to extend \nunemployment compensation. After delaying and then grinding Senate \nbusiness to a halt, the bill passed 97 to l. In other words, \nRepublicans filibustered a bill they fully intended to support, simply \nin order to stall or stop business in the Senate.\n  Similarly, the Republicans filibustered the agriculture \nappropriations bill that funded key agriculture, conservation, and \nnutrition programs. That bill passed 84 to 11.\n  The Republicans filibustered the Credit Card Holders Bill of Rights. \nThat bill passed 92 to 2.\n  The Republicans filibustered the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act. \nThat bill passed 84 to 4.\n  As the Defense Appropriations bill and unemployment compensation bill \nexamples show, in many cases Republicans have filibustered motions to \nproceed. This is truly remarkable. In fact, last Congress there were \nover 50 filibusters of motions to proceed to consider bills. \nRepublicans filibustered efforts for this body to consider efforts to \nprovide low-income home energy assistance, efforts to strengthen the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission to ensure our children are not \nexposed to unsafe toys, and efforts to ensure women are guaranteed \nequal pay for equal work. In all of these cases and many others, \nRepublicans objected to this body even bringing up for debate and \ndeliberation important issues that matter to the American people.\n  There is absolutely no purpose to filibuster a motion to proceed \nexcept delay and obstruction. If one does not like a piece of \nlegislation, one has an opportunity to offer amendments to try to \nimprove the measure. But one cannot do that if the Senate is prevented \nfrom even considering a bill.\n  One of the most striking features of the abuse of this extraordinary \ntool by Republicans is how quickly it has become accepted that \nliterally any legislation needs 60 votes to pass the Senate. If 41 \nsenators do not like a bill, it does not get a vote. Newspapers and \npundits regularly pronounce that 60 votes are ``needed to pass the \nbill'', even as we all know, only 51 Senators are, in fact, needed.\n  So accepted is this extraordinary abuse by the minority, that after \nthe most recent election in Massachusetts, the media regularly \npronounced that Democrats going from a 20-seat majority to an 18-seat \nmajority was the equivalent to losing majority status. A Philadelphia \nMetro newspaper headline asked: ``How will Dems recover after losing \nmajority?'' CNN reported: ``Brown's election tips Senate balance of \npower to GOP.'' The New York Times reported that ``Brown's Senate win \nhas cost them their razor-thin advantage.'' One paper, the Village \nVoice, even wrote satirically, ``Scott Brown wins Mass. Race, Giving \nGOP 41-59 Majority in the Senate.'' When the rules are abused in such a \nmanner that a majority of 18 seats is now treated as the equivalent to \nbeing in the minority, it is time to change the rules.\n  This is not how it is supposed to be. To be sure, the Founders put in \nplace a system of checks and balances that made it difficult to enact \nlegislation. A bill must pass in both Houses of Congress. It is then \nsubject to the President's veto power. A law can be challenged in \ncourt. These are all very significant checks.\n  What was never intended, however, was that a supermajority of 60 \nvotes would be needed to enact virtually any piece of legislation. \nIndeed, the Framers of the Constitution were very clear about \ncircumstances where a supermajority is required. There were only five: \nratification of a treaty, override of a veto, votes of impeachment, \npassage of a constitutional amendment, and the expulsion of a Member.\n  James Madison specifically rejected the idea that more than a \nmajority would be needed for decisions. Responding to anti-Federalist \narguments that the Constitution should have required more than a \nmajority, Madison argued that such rules would lead to minority rule, \nsomething inconsistent with fundamental republican principles. As he \nwrote in Federalist No. 58:\n\n       That some advantages might have resulted from such a \n     precaution, cannot be denied. It might have been an \n     additional shield to some particular interests, and another \n     obstacle generally to hasty and partial measures. But these \n     considerations are outweighed by the inconveniences in the \n     opposite scale. In all cases where justice or the general \n     good might require new laws to be passed, or active measures \n     to be pursued, the fundamental principle of free government \n     would be reversed. It would no longer be the majority that \n     would rule; the power would be transferred to the minority.\n\n  James Madison would be appalled by the current abuse of the \nfilibuster to impose minority rule.\n  Proponents of the filibuster regularly quote the oft told story of \nGeorge Washington's description of the Senate to Thomas Jefferson. \nJefferson had returned from France and was breakfasting with \nWashington. Jefferson asked Washington why he agreed to have a Senate. \n``Why,'' asked Washington, ``did you just now pour that coffee into \nyour saucer before drinking it?'' ``To cool it,'' said Jefferson. \n``Even so,'' said Washington,'' ``we pour our legislation into the \nSenatorial saucer to cool it.''\n\n  As one author recently noted, however, the increasing use of the \nfilibuster has converted the Senate from the ``saucer'' George \nWashington intended, in which scalding ideas from the more passionate \nHouse of Representatives might ``cool'' into a ``deep freeze and a dead \nweight.''\n  At issue is a fundamental principle of our democracy--rule of the \nmajority in a legislative body. As Alexander Hamilton noted in the \nFederalist Papers, ``The fundamental maxim of republican government . . \n. requires that the sense of the majority should prevail.''\n  Mr. President, elections should have consequences. My feeling in 1995 \nwas that if the Nation elects a majority of Republicans to the Senate, \nas it did, then after the minority has an opportunity to make its case, \nthe majority should prevail. And, it should be the same when the people \nsend a majority\n\n[[Page S574]]\n\nof Democrats to the Senate. If the people do not like how the majority \nis governing, then they have the ability to change the composition of \nthe Senate at the next election.\n  Fifteen months ago, a sizable majority of voters sent Democrats to \nWashington to implement real change and reform. It is no surprise that \npeople are now frustrated. Largely, because of the filibuster their \nhopes for change have been frustrated. Instead, the public sees nothing \nbut gridlock.\n  Because of Senate rules, a minority as small as one Senator can block \naction by the majority. Even when a party is resoundingly repudiated at \nthe polls, that party retains the power, thanks to the filibuster, to \nprevent the majority from legislating and effectively governing. \nRegrettably, the filibuster has become a bludgeon that the minority \nuses to thwart the will of the majority, to mire the Senate in \nprocedural impasses and repeatedly to hold the entire Senate hostage \nfor extended periods of time. Today, even simple, noncontroversial \nbills and nominations are not permitted to come to a vote. This is \nwrong. As a result of the filibuster, the legislative process itself \nhas been overwhelmed.\n  The legislation I introduce today would amend the Standing Rules of \nthe Senate to permit a decreasing majority of Senators to invoke \ncloture on a given matter. On the first cloture vote, 60 votes would be \nneeded to end debate. If the motion does not get 60 votes, a Senator \ncan file another cloture motion and two days later have another vote; \nthat vote would require 57 votes to end debate. If cloture is not \nobtained, a Senator can file another cloture motion and wait two more \ndays; in that vote, 54 votes would be required to end debate. If \ncloture is still not obtained, a Senator could file one more cloture \nmotion, wait 2 more days, and--at that point--just 51 votes would be \nneeded to move to the merits of the bill.\n  Let me be clear, this proposal has absolutely nothing to do with \nlimiting minority rights. Under this proposal, a determined minority \ncould slow down any bill. In this way, proper deliberation is ensured. \nSenators would have ample time to make their arguments and attempt to \npersuade the public and a majority of colleagues. However, a minority \nof members would no longer be able to stymie the majority by grinding \nthe Senate to a halt, as sadly too regularly happens today.\n  Mr. President, this is hardly radical legislation. There are \ncurrently numerous rules and laws that forbid the filibuster in \nnumerous circumstances. For example, we cannot filibuster a federal \nbudget resolution. We cannot filibuster a resolution authorizing the \nuse of force. We cannot filibuster international trade agreements. We \ncannot filibuster a reconciliation bill.\n  Reform of the filibuster should not be a Democrat or Republican \nissue. Indeed, it was the former Republican Majority Leader Bill Frist \nwho said when he nearly shut this body down over the use of \nfilibusters: ``This filibuster is nothing less than a formula for \ntyranny by the minority.''\n  A majority in this body--whether Democratic Senators, Republican \nSenators, or a bipartisan coalition of Senators--should be allowed to \nwork its will. When a given party wins the Presidency and both houses \nof Congress by significant margins, that party should be allowed to \ncarry out its agenda, and then should be held accountable in the next \nelection.\n  But, I do not see how we can effectively govern a 21st century \nsuperpower when a minority of just 41 senators can dictate action--or \ninaction--not just to the majority of senators but to a majority of the \nAmerican people. This is all the more true when you consider that those \n41 senators could come from small states and represent as little as 15 \npercent of the American population. This is not democratic. Certainly, \nit is not the kind of democracy envisioned and intended by our \nFounders. Instead, it is a sure-fire formula for national paralysis, \ndrift, and decline.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in restoring the best traditions of \nthe United States Senate, a legislative body committed to debate and \ndeliberation, but also one guided by our Founders' bedrock democratic \nprinciples of majority rule.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator from Iowa yield?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Yes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a \ncosponsor on this bill.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S574-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S574-S575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 417--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL \n                 ENGINEERS WEEK, AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Bingaman, and Mrs. \nGillibrand) submitted the following resolution, which was referred to \nthe Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation:\n\n                              S. Res. 417\n\n       Whereas engineers use their professional, scientific, and \n     technical knowledge and skills in creative and innovative \n     ways to fulfill the needs of society;\n       Whereas engineers have helped to address the major \n     technological and infrastructural challenges of our time, \n     including providing water, defending the Nation, and \n     developing clean energy technologies that are needed to power \n     the American people into the future;\n       Whereas engineers are a crucial link in research, \n     development, and the transformation of scientific discoveries \n     into useful products and jobs, as the people of the United \n     States look more than ever to engineers and their \n     imagination, knowledge, and analytical skills to meet the \n     challenges of the future;\n       Whereas engineers play a crucial role in developing the \n     consensus engineering standards that promote global \n     collaboration and support reliable infrastructures;\n       Whereas the sponsors of National Engineers Week are working \n     together to transform the engineering workforce through \n     greater inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities;\n       Whereas the 2009 National Academy of Engineering and \n     National Research Council report entitled ``Engineering in K-\n     12 Education'' highlighted the potential role for engineering \n     in primary and secondary education as a method to improve \n     learning and achievement in science and mathematics, increase \n     awareness of engineering and the work of engineers, help \n     students understand and engage in engineering design, build \n     interest in pursuing engineering as a career, and increase \n     technological literacy;\n       Whereas an increasing number of the approximately 1,500,000 \n     engineers in the United States are nearing retirement;\n       Whereas National Engineers Week has developed into a formal \n     coalition of more than 100 professional societies, major \n     corporations, and government agencies that are dedicated to \n     ensuring a diverse and well-educated engineering workforce, \n     promoting literacy in science, technology, engineering, and \n     math, and raising public awareness and appreciation of the \n     contributions of engineers to society;\n       Whereas National Engineers Week is celebrated during the \n     week of George Washington's birthday to honor the \n     contributions that the first President, who was both a \n     military engineer and a land surveyor, made to engineering; \n     and\n       Whereas February 14, 2010, to February 20, 2010, has been \n     designated as National Engineers Week by the National \n     Engineers Week Foundation and its coalition members: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of National Engineers \n     Week to increase understanding of and interest in engineering \n     careers and to promote technological literacy and engineering \n     education; and\n       (2) continues to work with the engineering community to \n     ensure that the creativity and contributions made by \n     engineers can be expressed through research, development, \n     standardization, and innovation.\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the goals and \nideals of National Engineers Week, which will be celebrated next week \nfrom February 14 to February 20.\n  As the only serving Senator who has worked as an engineer, I am proud \nto sponsor resolution acknowledging the essential role engineers play \nand the important work they do.\n  I would also like to thank Senators Collins, Bingaman, and Gillibrand \nfor joining me in introducing this resolution.\n  Just as importantly, I would like to acknowledge the leadership of \nCongressman Lipinski of Illinois, who for many years has been \nintroducing this resolution in the House of Representatives. I know he \nplans to do the same again this year when our local weather will permit \nit.\n  Launched in 1951 by the National Society of Professional Engineers, \nNational Engineers Week began as a way to call attention to the immense \ncontributions engineers make to society.\n  It is also a time to emphasize the importance of learning science, \ntechnology, engineering, and mathematics\n\n[[Page S575]]\n\nskills--something I have spoken about many times on this floor.\n  Since its inception, the support for National Engineers Week has \ngrown significantly.\n  This year, nearly 100 professional societies, major corporations, and \ngovernment agencies are working together with the National Engineers \nWeek Foundation to bring attention to this important program.\n  If we hope to encourage more young people to pursue engineering--to \nhelp us tackle issues of health, safety, and energy--it is absolutely \ncritical that we teach them what engineering is all about.\n  National Engineers Week brings 50,000 engineering volunteers into \nclassrooms to teach students that engineering can be fun, that \nengineers make a difference, and that anyone can become an engineer.\n  It is especially important that we get this message out to girls, \nwomen, and many minorities who are underrepresented in engineering \ncareers. We will all benefit from greater diversity in STEM fields.\n  I believe that encouraging a new generation of engineers is vital to \ncontinuing our economic recovery.\n  Engineers have always been our country's problem solvers and it is \nfitting that we celebrate National Engineers Week in conjunction with \nthe birthday of President George Washington--one of our Nation's first \nengineers.\n  I wish to thank my colleagues for joining with me in supporting this \nimportant week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S575-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S575]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3310.

Mr. President, I support the nomination of Ms. Caryn \nWagner to be Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, DHS, and urge my colleagues to confirm \nher. The Intelligence Committee unanimously approved the nomination by \nvoice vote on December 10, 2009.\n  The Under Secretary of Intelligence and Analysis leads the Office of \nIntelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security, which \nis among the youngest elements of the U.S. intelligence community. The \nmain responsibilities of the Office are to ensure that information \nrelated to homeland security threats is (1) collected, analyzed, and \ndisseminated to homeland security customers in the Department, at the \nState, local, and tribal levels; (2) shared as appropriate with private \nsector entities; and (3) provided to other intelligence community \nagencies. The Under Secretary of the Office leads these efforts, \nprovides homeland security intelligence and advice to the Secretary and \nother senior officials in the Department of Homeland Security, and \nserves as the Department's senior interagency intelligence \nrepresentative.\n  The cases of Najibullah Zazi in New York and David Headley in \nChicago, both U.S. persons allegedly involved in plotting terrorist \nacts and having ties to noted terrorist groups overseas, show the \nthreat of violent Islamist radicalization occurring in this country is \nreal. The Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002 to\n\n[[Page S588]]\n\nfocus on the threat of terrorist activity in the United States, a \nmission that is vitally dependent on good, accurate, actionable \nintelligence.\n  Nonetheless, the Office of Intelligence and Analysis has experienced \nnumerous problems in its short tenure and members of the Intelligence \nCommittee and the Homeland Security Committee have frequently raised \nconcerns. Of particular note have been the Office's ill-defined \nplanning, programming and budget processes; a gross overreliance on \ncontractors to the point that 63 percent of the workforce was \ncontractor personnel as of this summer; and a lack of a strategic plan. \nOn a number of occasions the Office has produced and disseminated \nfinished intelligence that has been based on noncredible open source \nmaterials or focused intelligence resources on the first amendment \nprotected activities of American citizens.\n  Clearly, the Office is in need of strong leadership from an Under \nSecretary with an extensive background in management and intelligence.\n  The Intelligence Committee is confident that Ms. Wagner is such a \nperson and is up to the challenge of setting the DHS Office of \nIntelligence and Analysis on a proper course. If confirmed, among her \nfirst tasks will be to review a draft plan to restructure and refine \nthe Office's mission, which will be a good first indication of how Ms. \nWagner will manage the organization.\n\n  Ms. Wagner's distinguished career in public and private service \nprepares her well for this position. Ms. Wagner is currently an \ninstructor in intelligence resource management for the Intelligence and \nSecurity Academy, LLC.\n  She retired from the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \non October 1, 2008, where she served as budget director and \ncybersecurity coordinator. Prior to that, Ms. Wagner served in the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence as an Assistant Deputy \nDirector of National Intelligence for Management and the first chief \nfinancial officer for the National Intelligence Program. She assumed \nthis position after serving as the executive director for Intelligence \nCommunity Affairs.\n  Ms. Wagner has also previously served as the senior Defense \nIntelligence Agency Representative to the U.S. European Command and \nNorth Atlantic Treaty Organization as well as the Deputy Director for \nAnalysis and Production at DIA. She was also formerly the staff \ndirector of the Subcommittee on Technical and Tactical Intelligence at \nthe House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and a signals \nintelligence and electronic warfare officer in the U.S. Army.\n  President Obama nominated Ms. Wagner on October 23, 2009. After \ncompleting the prehearing procedures, the Intelligence Committee held a \nconfirmation hearing on the nomination on December 1, 2009. As part of \nthe confirmation process, Ms. Wagner was asked to complete a committee \nquestionnaire, prehearing questions, and posthearing questions for the \nrecord. The answers she provided have all been posted to the \nIntelligence Committee's Web site. The Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernment Affairs Committee also held a hearing on Ms. Wagner's \nnomination on December 3, 2009.\n  In sum, I am confident that Caryn Wagner will be an asset to the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and to the intelligence community. I \nlook forward to working with her and I urge the Senate to approve Ms. \nWagner's nomination.\n\n\n                    Nomination of Andre Birotte, Jr.\n\n  Mr. President, nominations in this Chamber are moving at a snail's \npace.\n  Last week, it took us three votes--spanning 3 days--to move only two \nnominations.\n  Last Thursday, we had a cloture vote on Martha Johnson, the nominee \nto lead the General Services Administration. The Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee reported her to the floor unanimously \nlast June, but since then her nomination has been blocked on the floor \nfor 7 months. Seven months of a hold. And then once cloture was \ninvoked, 94 Members of this body voted to confirm her.\n  Unfortunately, the minority's blocking of noncontroversial nominees \nis becoming the rule rather than the exception.\n  Last Tuesday, I spoke about two nominees for posts in the \nintelligence community--Caryn Wagner to be the Under Secretary of \nIntelligence and Analysis at the Department of Homeland Security, DHS, \nand of Ambassador Phil Goldberg to be the Assistant Secretary for \nIntelligence and Research at the Department of State.\n  Neither nomination is controversial. Both were reported out of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee by voice vote. And both of these posts \nare critical to efforts to protect the security of our Nation.\n  Yet both nominations are still blocked on the floor.\n  Today, I rise to speak on yet another noncontroversial nomination \nthat members of the minority are blocking.\n  Andre Birotte, Jr., is the nominee to be the U.S. attorney for the \nCentral District of Los Angeles. He was reported out of the Judiciary \nCommittee by voice vote.\n  He is highly qualified, and he is not controversial.\n  Mr. Birotte is a former Federal prosecutor in the office who \ncurrently serves as the inspector general for the Los Angeles Police \nCommission. In this role, he has the often unenviable job of \ndetermining whether disciplinary action is necessary against law \nenforcement officials who have been accused of official misconduct. His \nposition requires him to review the facts and follow where they lead--\neven in highly sensitive situations.\n  In this tough role, Mr. Birotte has stood out for integrity and \nevenhandedness. He has earned the overwhelming respect and support of \nboth law enforcement officers and the civil rights community.\n  Mr. Birotte is tough. He is independent. He has management \nexperience. He has prosecution experience. And I believe he will make \nan excellent U.S. attorney.\n  He will also be the first African-American U.S. attorney in the \ncentral district. It is my hope that his historic appointment as the \nlead Federal law enforcement official in Los Angeles will be one more \nstep forward for a city that has known both great progress and, at \ntimes, acute disappointment in race relations.\n  For all of these reasons, I would like to see him confirmed as soon \nas possible.\n  This nomination is not just important to me because of the strength \nof the nominee, however. I also believe it is essential that we get \nthis Office's leader into place.\n  The U.S. Attorney's Office in the Central Distric of California is \nthe second largest in the country. Only the Office in the District of \nColumbia is larger, and that is because it has unusual responsibility \nfor both local and Federal crimes.\n  The central district office employs more than 250 Federal \nprosecutors. They bear responsibility for prosecuting violations of \nFederal law across seven counties--Los Angeles County, Orange County, \nRiverside County, San Bernardino County, San Luis Obispo County, Santa \nBarbara County, and Ventura County--that span more than 40,000 square \nmiles. The district includes Los Angeles and 34 other cities, with a \ncombined population of more than 18 million.\n  It is a huge operation.\n  As in all of the U.S. attorneys' offices, the prosecutors in the \nCentral District of California are busy.\n  In the past year alone, the U.S. Attorney's Office has brought in \nover $150 million in judgments, won significant convictions against \nleaders of gangs and fraudulent enterprises, and placed people behind \nbars for crimes committed around the world.\n  Let me give you a few examples, all from 2009 and 2010:\n  Central District prosecutors secured a $46 million restitution order \nin a case against a former real estate appraiser who committed massive \nmortgage fraud.\n  They put the leader of a $64 million Ponzi scheme behind bars for 300 \nmonths and won a $44 million restitution order against him.\n  They indicted 88 members and associates of a street gang called the \nAvenues on various charges, including the 2008 murder of a Los Angeles \ndeputy sheriff; they indicted 24 people on gang-related drug \ntrafficking in an investigation known as Operation Knockout; they took \ndown an international sex trafficking ring that was forcing Guatemalan \ngirls into prostitution in\n\n[[Page S589]]\n\nLos Angeles; they put a foreign national behind bars for 78 months for \nparticipating in the transport of over 9,000 illegal aliens to and from \nLos Angeles; and they obtained a conviction and 16-year prison sentence \nagainst the founder of a domestic terrorist group that was planning \nattacks on U.S. military operations.\n  All of those prosecutions have occurred in the last 13 months alone.\n  Andre Birotte is a highly qualified individual who has been nominated \nnot to lead an office embroiled in the politics of Washington, but \ninstead that bears responsibility for investigating, prosecuting, \ndeterring, and preventing Federal crimes against Americans and their \nfamilies.\n  I do not believe the leadership of this office should get caught up \nin an unrelated dispute. If someone objects to Mr. Birotte, I hope they \nwill come forward. Otherwise, I hope that we can move forward quickly \nto confirm this nominee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/11/senate-section/article/S589-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed to the \nconsideration of S. Res. 415.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \nresolution by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 415) calling for a renewed focus on \n     the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran's violations \n     of internationally-recognized human rights as found in the \n     Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, today I rise to express support for the \npeople whose voices have been silenced by the Government of Iran. For 8 \nmonths, violence has been waged against peaceful protesters. Free \nspeech, free expression, and a free press have been suppressed, and \naccess to information and news has been limited through the jamming of \ninternational broadcasting and restrictions on the Internet.\n  According to a joint statement released by the United States and the \nEU on Monday, since the flawed Iranian election in June, there have \nbeen large scale detentions and mass trials of peaceful demonstrators; \nthreatened executions of protestors; intimidation of family members of \nthose detained; and the continued denial of peaceful expression, \ncontrary to universal norms of human rights.\n  This statement was issued in advance of today's protests in Iran \nmarking the 31st anniversary of the Islamic revolution, in anticipation \nof widespread violence and additional arrests which are occurring as we \nspeak. These and other events in Iran represent blatant violations of \ninternational standards for human rights. This is why I have come to \nthe floor today--to condemn the repression of the Iranian people, and \nto call on the government of Iran to bring its unconscionable behavior \nto an end.\n  On December 23, the Senate unanimously passed a resolution condemning \nthe government of Iran for ongoing human rights abuses and for \nsuppressing freedom of speech, assembly, expression, and the press. \nThis resolution, which I introduced along with Senators Lieberman, \nMcCain, and others, reiterated the concerns that we also conveyed in \nthe Victims of Iranian Censorship, or VOICE Act, which authorized \nfunding for the development of technology to circumvent online \ncensorship in Iran.\n  Despite these and other international expressions of solidarity with \nthe Iranian people, the government of Iran has become even more brutal \nin recent weeks. In a statement released on January 24, Human Rights \nWatch called the situation in Iran a ``human rights disaster.'' \nProtestors are not the only group which has been targeted. The Iranian \nauthorities have also launched an aggressive campaign against the \npress.\n  On Monday, Iranian state media reported the arrest of seven \nindividuals charged with espionage for alleged ties to the U.S.-funded \nFarsi-language radio station, Radio Farda. These allegations and \narrests coincide with a large-scale crackdown on independent media that \nhas intensified in the past week. In the lead-up to today's \ndemonstrations, Radio Farda broadcasts have been jammed, and there have \nbeen widespread service disruptions to the Internet and text message \nservices. These and other government efforts have impeded the free flow \nof information, news, and basic means of communication.\n  This is why I will join Senator Casey and others in introducing \nanother resolution denouncing the atmosphere of impunity in Iran for \nthose who employ intimidation, harassment, or violence to restrict \nbasic freedoms of speech, expression, assembly, and the press. I am \nalso proud to co-sponsor legislation introduced today by Senators \nMcCain, Lieberman, Casey, Bayh, Durbin, Gillibrand, Kyl, Collins, \nGraham, and Brownback which gives the President the ability to impose--\nat his discretion--sanctions against those Iranians who have committed \nhuman rights abuses or acts of violence against civilians engaged in \npeaceful political activity.\n  Unfortunately, the grave and deteriorating human rights situation is \nnot the only concern of the international community with regard to \nIran. In a speech earlier today, the Iranian president declared Iran a \n``nuclear state'' due to its ongoing enrichment program. The UN has \nspoken in one voice--on three separate occasions--repudiating Iran's \nongoing enrichment of nuclear material in violation of its \ninternational obligations.\n  As the United Nations considers a fourth round of sanctions against \nIran, the United States has imposed a new round of unilateral \nsanctions. Just yesterday, Treasury announced sanctions targeting the \nIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, or IRGC, for its involvement in \nspearheading Iran's nuclear and missile programs. As the IRGC continues \nto consolidate control over the Iranian economy, including the \ntelecommunications sector, it is crucial to ensure that the Government \nof Iran is held to account for its ongoing violations of international \nlaw and activities which have made it a growing threat to global \nsecurity.\n  The people taking to the streets in Iran are some of the most \ncourageous in the world, and Congress will continue to reiterate its \nsupport for their right to have their voices heard. We will not sit \nidly by as the Government of Iran continues to deny its people \nessential freedoms and human rights, and we will put the Iranian \nGovernment--or any government which aims to silence its people--on \nnotice that its behavior is unacceptable to the United States.\n  As President Obama stated in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech:\n\n       We will bear witness to the quiet dignity of reformers . . \n     . to the hundreds of thousands who have marched silently \n     through the streets of Iran. It is telling that the leaders \n     of these governments fear the aspirations of their own people \n     more than the power of any other nation. And it is the \n     responsibility of all free people and free nations to make \n     clear to these movements that hope and history are on their \n     side.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, first, I thank my friend, the Senator from \nDelaware, for his strong statement. I thank him for his support of \nfreedom and democracy in Iran. I thank him for his longtime advocacy of \nhuman rights. I and others are pleased to have the opportunity to work \nwith him in a common cause of human rights and democracy. I thank the \nSenator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have a colloquy \nwith the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman, and I am aware of the \ntime constraints of being in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today is the 31st anniversary of the \nIslamic Republic. Unfortunately, it is a record that many would rather \nforget--31 years of economic potential lost, stolen by a corrupt elite. \nWe know what has gone on over the last 31 years.\n  Right now, as we speak, if anyone watching wants to turn on cable \nnews,\n\n[[Page S590]]\n\nturn on FOX News, they will see videos coming out of Tehran of innocent \npeople, young and old, being beaten and tortured and taken away to \nprison where unspeakable things are done to them as the people of Iran \nare standing up and demonstrating, again, their commitment, their \ncourage, their sacrifice on behalf of a free and open democracy and \nsociety. We are watching as Iranian men and women, many not more than \nyoung boys and girls, are rounded up in their homes and dormitories, \nhauled away unlawfully to face torture and other abuses in the darkest \ncorners of the country where the eyes of the international community \nstruggle to see. These are unacceptable, unspeakable crimes that are \nbeing committed on the Iranian people, and we and the world must stand \nup against it. I appreciate being part of an effort, along with my \nfriend from Connecticut--both sides, a bipartisan effort--to take \naction on the part of these people in Iran. Turn on FOX News, I say to \nmy friends. They will see the videos coming out of Tehran of the \nbrutality that is being inflicted on innocent Iranians who are trying \nto just have the God-given right to freedom and democracy.\n\n  I thank my friend from Connecticut. This resolution we are submitting \ntoday has two parts. It would require the President to compile a public \nlist of individuals in Iran who, starting with the Presidential \nelection last June, are complicit in human rights violations against \nIranian citizens and their families. No matter where in the world these \nabuses occur, I want to stress this will be a public list. You will \nknow their names. You will know their faces. You will know what they \nhave done. And we will make them famous. They are war criminals, and \nthey should be taken to The Hague for trial. The bill would then ban \nthese Iranian individuals from receiving U.S. visas and impose on them \nthe full battery of sanctions under the International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act. That means freezing any assets and blocking any \nproperty they hold under U.S. jurisdiction, et cetera.\n  This Nation has always stood for the human rights of people \nthroughout the world. We stood up for the people behind the Iron \nCurtain. We provided Lech Walesa with a printing press. Now we need to \nhelp the Iranian people with the means to use the Internet to \ncommunicate, to resist.\n  I hear back and forth that the Iranian people are without a leader. \nThey have leaders. They have thousands and thousands of leaders who are \nin the streets right now demonstrating for freedom and putting their \nvery lives at risk.\n  I thank my colleague from Connecticut and ask him if he has \nadditional comments on this disturbing reality that is unfolding before \nour eyes as we stand on the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Arizona, Mr. \nMcCain, first for his leadership on this issue, which is consistent \nwith a lifetime of support for America's freedom agenda, for the \nprinciples that are enshrined in our Declaration of Independence and \nthat have always been at the center of our foreign policy when it has \nbeen at its best.\n  This is a day of history. It is a day of history on the streets of \nTehran and other cities in Iran on this 31st anniversary of the Iranian \nrevolution.\n  I heard a report today. It encapsulates what has happened to that \nrevolution. Today, apparently, the granddaughter of Ayatollah Khamenei \nwas arrested as a street protester. When they realized who she was, \nthey immediately let her go.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield? I also heard that the wife of one \nof the opposition leaders was beaten in the streets today. Did the \nSenator hear that?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I say to my friend, I did. That is the \nwife of the former Prime Minister, I believe, Mr. Mousavi. His wife was \nbeaten on the streets of Tehran today.\n  This is a day of history in Tehran, and I hope we can make it a day \nof history in the U.S. Congress because if this legislation which \nSenator McCain and I and a bipartisan group of other Senators introduce \nis adopted, it will be the first time we impose economic sanctions on \nIranian leaders for the human rights abuses of their own people.\n  We have come full circle. We have obviously been concerned about \nIran's sponsorship of terrorism. It is still the No. 1 state sponsor of \nterrorism in the world, according to the State Department. Second, its \nnuclear weapons program menaces its neighbors in the world. But as so \noften happens with countries that threaten their neighbors in the \nworld, that have no regard for human life, ultimately we come back to \ntheir core. And the core of the Iranian regime is rotten. It is rotten \nbecause it treats its own people not just with disrespect but with \nbrutality. As my friend from Arizona has said, look at the television. \nLook at YouTube. Read the Internet, the text messages about what is \nhappening on the streets of Iran as we speak today: remarkable \ndemonstrations of courage by the people coming out to protest, to \nsimply ask for their freedom, and unbelievable brutality against them \nfor doing nothing more than asking for their universal human rights.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask my friend, I believe that last year \nan attempt was made to establish some kind of relationship and dialog \nwith the Iranian Government--in other words, to have an unclenched \nfist. Will my friend comment on what success that has been?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Yes, indeed. I thank the Senator from Arizona. \nPresident Obama adopted the policy of reaching out to the Iranian \nregime. Personally, I thought he did the right thing. What he got in \nreturn for his outstretched hand was a clenched fist.\n  I think the only thing constructive that has come out of this attempt \nto engage the Iranians, to begin a new chapter, to give them a peaceful \nway to avoid conflict with the rest of the world, the only constructive \nresult of it is that we see that the problem in the relations between \nthe United States and Iran is not the United States, it is the \noppressive, extremist regime in Tehran.\n  I think it is clear that President Obama has not only been \ndisappointed but grows impatient and, I will say from what I perceive, \nangered by what has happened. That explains the increasing move, \nincluding just in the last day or two, of the imposition of new \nsanctions on companies related to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps \nand individuals. This regime will not stop its nuclear weapons program, \nin my opinion, will not stop its support of terrorist killers, will not \nstop suppressing the human rights of its people unless it feels pain, \nunless it feels that perhaps its regime is in jeopardy. We can only do \nthat now with tough sanctions, such as those that are proposed in the \nlegislation we introduce today.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Connecticut, isn't \nit also true that there are certain elements who say: Don't do these \nthings--the sanctions and actions we are trying to take--you only hurt \nthe Iranian people. Isn't it true that the demonstrators in the streets \nof Tehran were chanting: Obama, Obama, are you with us or are you with \nthem?\n  What would be the effect on the Iranian people if we impose these \nsanctions?\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The Senator from Arizona is very clear that these \nsanctions directed against the thugs in the Iranian Government who \nbrutally suppress the rights of their own people will be very popular \nwith the people of Iran. In my opinion, the economic sanctions that \nwould be imposed in the legislation that passed the Senate unanimously \nabout 10 days ago--those sanctions are tough, but if we have any hope \nof achieving an end to the Iranian nuclear weapons program through \ndiplomacy, it has to be coupled with tough economic sanctions or else \nwe will be left with no alternative but military action.\n  There is a difference between the regime in Iran and the people of \nIran. The people of Iran want a change in the regime, it is clear. \nThere is nothing inherently at odds between the American people and the \npeople of Iran. As a matter of fact, we have all sorts of histories and \nvalues and goals in common. The problem is the extremist, brutal, \naggressive regime in Tehran, and the sooner it goes, the better.\n  I hope the people of Iran hear this legislation we are introducing \ntoday, under the leadership of Senator McCain, as an expression of \nunanimity across party lines and ideological lines\n\n[[Page S591]]\n\non behalf of the people of America that we stand with the people of \nIran against the Government of Iran as it attempts to suppress the \npeople.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Finally, I would like to ask my friend, we were together \nin Munich over the weekend. The Foreign Minister of Iran came and \nspoke. I wish everyone in the world could have seen that performance--\none, a complete denial that they are on the path to acquisition of \nnuclear weapons, and, perhaps as important, a denial that any human \nrights abuses were taking place anywhere in that country. It was a \nremarkable display of hypocrisy and outright lying.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I was with Senator McCain. It was such \na baldfaced lie because we see Mr. Motaki get up and say Iran is the \nmost democratic regime in the entire Middle East region and beyond and \nsays, with regard to our complaints and the Europeans' complaints about \nthe suppression of the rights of the Iranian people, the execution of \npolitical demonstrators, the jailing of thousands of peaceful political \nprotesters, that is the law and if they violated the criminal law, they \nwould be punished for it. When somebody is so detached from the truth \nas we know it from what we see with our own eyes, it is hard to trust \nthem otherwise.\n  I wish to add a word. If we adopt this proposal, as I believe we can \nand will when the general Iranian sanctions bill comes back from \nconference, we will have taken a significant first step in the \ndirection of penalties on the Iranian regime for human rights abuses of \nits own people.\n  I want to use this, and I ask my friend if he agrees that the impact \nof this legislation would be magnified many times over if our allied \ngovernments around the world, particularly in Europe, which has a \ntradition of support for human rights, also joined us in adopting laws \nthat impose targeted sanctions against human rights abusers in Iran? It \ndoes not require previous U.N. Security Council action. There is \nnothing stopping our Congress or the EU from imposing targeted human \nrights sanctions as quickly as possible. I ask my friend if that would \nnot make the power of what we hope to do in Congress many times more \neffective against the tyrants in Tehran.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I know we are running out of time, but I want to say to \nmy friend that history does repeat itself. There was a time during the \nCold War when Ronald Reagan spoke out and mentioned Natan Sharansky's \nname and he was beaten for it. People said he shouldn't have done that, \nbut Ronald Reagan said: Take down this wall. People said that was \nprovocative toward the Soviet Union. You know what Natan Sharansky \nsaid, after he was released from the prison? He said: Those words \nreverberated throughout the gulag and gave hope for democracy and \nfreedom, and made them even more steadfast and encouraged them in the \nface of the brutality they underwent in the Soviet gulag.\n  That is the same message we are sending to the Iranian people with \nthis legislation. I hope we will enact it soon. We will not slack nor \nwill we give up until the Iranian people have their God-given rights \nrestored to them.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, over the past several months, the \nIranian government has carried out an unprecedented campaign of \nrepression and violence against the Iranian people. Its targets have \nspanned everyone from religious clerics to women's rights advocates, as \nwell as bloggers, students, photographers, children's advocates, human \nrights activists, journalists, and members of the political opposition. \nIn fact, according to Reporters Without Borders, Iran now has more \njournalists in prison than any other country in the world.\n  The targets of the Iranian regime's crackdown have suffered numerous \nand varied human rights abuses. Some have been dragged out of their \nhomes and away from their families in the middle of the night, \ndisappearing without charge and without process of law. Others have \nbeen beaten and tortured while in government custody, and in some \ncases, sexually abused. Still others have been prosecuted in mass \ntrials by revolutionary courts and punished with draconian prison \nsentences, for no reason other than their political beliefs. And some \nhave been executed. Human Rights Watch has rightly condemned Iran's \ncrackdown ``a human rights disaster.''\n  These abuses are ongoing. Just in the last few hours, despite the \nefforts of the Iranian government to control the flow of information \nfrom their country, videos have gone up on YouTube showing peaceful \nprotesters on the streets of Iranian cities being violently broken up, \nand individual Iranian citizens brutally beaten, by members of the \nIranian security forces.\n  These human rights abuses are a clear violation of multiple \ninternational agreements signed by the Iranian government, such as the \nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.\n  To be clear, this isn't about the outside world dictating our values \nto Iran. This is about the failure of Iran's own leaders to live up to \nthe international human rights obligations that they themselves \nvoluntarily committed to, both through the international agreements \nthey have signed and through their own constitution. All we are asking \nof Iran's leaders is that they respect their own laws. Unfortunately, \nit is increasingly clear that Iran's government does not respect its \nobligations--whether with regard to human rights record or its nuclear \nactivities.\n  The legislation that we are introducing today has a clear purpose; \nnamely, to shine a bright light onto the human rights abuses being \ncommitted in Iran as we speak, and make clear to the people who are \nperpetrating them that there is going to be a cost to be paid for doing \nso.\n  I am very encouraged that this legislation has already won the \nsupport of a broad bipartisan coalition of cosponsors--many of whom \nunfortunately could not be here today because of the weather. They \ninclude Senators Durbin, Kyl, Bayh, Collins, Casey, Brownback, \nGillibrand, Graham, and Kaufman.\n  I would especially like to thank my colleague Senator McCain for his \nleadership on this issue. As he mentioned, Senator McCain sought to \nattach an earlier version of this legislation as an amendment to the \ncomprehensive Iran sanctions bill that was then on the floor of the \nSenate and that the Senate unanimously passed. Although we were unable \nto attach Senator McCain's amendment to the broader sanctions bill at \nthat time for procedural reasons, I remain very hopeful that the human \nrights legislation we are introducing today will become part of the \ncomprehensive Iran sanctions bill when the House and Senate meet in \nconference.\n\n  And I hope that President Obama will aggressively apply these \nsanctions once they are signed into law.\n  More broadly, I hope that the Obama administration will make human \nrights a centerpiece of our Iran policy in the days and weeks ahead. I \nunderstand that, on Monday, there will be what is called a ``Universal \nPeriodic Review'' of Iran's human rights record at the U.N. Human \nRights Council in Geneva, and that the administration hopes to use this \nevent to shine a spotlight on the human rights abuses that are being \ncommitted there. I welcome that initiative, and appeal to other \ncountries to support it as well.\n  Finally, I would like to appeal to our international partners, in \nparticular in the European Union, to join us in imposing these kinds of \ntargeted sanctions against human rights abusers in Iran. We all know \nwhat the Iranian regime has been doing to its people, and I hope that \nEuropeans in particular--given the importance they attach to human \nrights--will not turn a blind eye to these abuses. We don't need to \nwait for a U.N. Security Council resolution to do this. There is \nnothing stopping the EU from imposing target human rights sanctions \nright now.\n  Mr. President, this is a piece of legislation that has significance \nif it is adopted, in effect, we hope, but this is also our way--the 10 \nof us who have sponsored this legislation, and I would guess every \nMember of the Senate when it comes to a vote will vote for it--to say \nto two groups of people, first, the government in Iran, that we see \nwhat you are doing, we know what you are doing, it is intolerable, it \nis unacceptable, and you will be punished for it; and secondly, to say \nto the people of Iran--who have the courage to be in the streets \nprotesting and asking for\n\n[[Page S592]]\n\nthe rights their government is supposed to give them according to \ninternational treaties that Iran itself has signed--we are with you.\n  The struggle for freedom and justice against tyranny is often a long \none, it is always a hard one, but history tells us that, in the end, \nfreedom and justice prevail. That means the people of Iran will prevail \nover the totalitarian government that now brutally rules them.\n  I thank the Chair, I thank my friend from Arizona for his leadership, \nand I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution \nbe agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be \nlaid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, and any \nstatements related to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 415) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 415\n\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     violated international standards for human rights by using \n     violence to disperse peaceful assemblies by its own citizens;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     suppressed peaceful commemorations by members of Iran's Green \n     Movement at the anniversary of Iran's Islamic revolution on \n     February 11, 2010;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran's \n     sustained campaign of violence against Iranian citizens who \n     have peacefully protested the irregularities in the flawed \n     Iranian presidential elections of June 12, 2009 has \n     demonstrated to the world that the present Iranian regime is \n     fully capable of widespread violence against its own \n     citizens;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran \n     currently has 65 journalists and bloggers imprisoned, more \n     than any single country in the world, according to Reporters \n     without Borders and in the past week arrested 10 journalists;\n       Whereas the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran has \n     restricted access to the internet, including its recent \n     announcement to permanently block Google's Gmail service;\n       Whereas Iranian citizen's right to due process has been \n     violated, with the judiciary detaining government critics and \n     religious minorities, and ordering executions of peaceful \n     demonstrators;\n       Whereas the use of arbitrary detention and the infliction \n     of cruel and degrading punishments by the Iranian authorities \n     are in direct violation of Articles 7, 9 and 10 of the \n     International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) \n     as well as Articles 22 (the right to human dignity), 36 \n     (Sentencing in accordance with the law), 38 (prohibition of \n     torture) and 39 (the rights of arrested persons) of the \n     Iranian Constitution.\n       Resolved, That the Senate of the United States:\n       (1) pays tribute to the courageous advocates for democracy \n     and human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran who are \n     engaged in peaceful efforts to encourage democratic reform;\n       (2) notes that it is the right of the people of the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran to peacefully assemble and to express their \n     opinions and aspirations without intimidation, repression, \n     and violence;\n       (3) supports freedom of speech in the Islamic Republic of \n     Iran as elsewhere and the ability of journalists and bloggers \n     to report without repression by government authorities;\n       (4) desires that the men and women of Iran be able to enjoy \n     due process in the Iranian judicial system including the \n     right to a fair trial;\n       (5) expresses serious concern over the Government of the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran's brutal suppression of its citizens \n     through censorship, imprisonment, and continued acts of \n     violence;\n       (6) denounces the atmosphere of impunity in the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran for those who employ intimidation, \n     harassment, or violence to restrict and suppress freedom of \n     speech, freedom of expression, freedom of assembly, and \n     freedom of the press;\n       (7) urges the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to \n     fully observe the ICCPR, which has been ratified by the \n     Islamic Republic of Iran and states, ``Everyone shall have \n     the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include \n     freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of \n     all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing \n     or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media \n     of his choice''.\n       (8) calls upon the Islamic Republic of Iran to abide by the \n     resolutions adopted by the U.N. General Assembly, in \n     particular the resolution on the situation of human rights in \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran of December 2009;\n       (9) communicates deep concern that, despite the Islamic \n     Republic of Iran's standing invitation to all thematic \n     special procedures mandate holders, it has not fulfilled any \n     requests from those special mechanisms to visit the country \n     in four years and has not answered numerous communications \n     from those special mechanisms, and strongly urges the \n     Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran to fully cooperate \n     with the special mechanisms, especially the Special \n     Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, \n     the Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or \n     degrading treatment or punishment, the Special Rapporteur on \n     the promotion and protection of the right to freedom of \n     opinion and expression, the Special Rapporteur on the \n     situation of human rights defenders, the Working Group on \n     Arbitrary Detention and the Working Group on Enforced or \n     Involuntary Disappearances;\n       (10) encourages the UN Human Rights Council to fully \n     examine these issues during its Universal Periodic Review of \n     the Islamic Republic of Iran on February 15, 2010.\n\n  Mr. REID.
