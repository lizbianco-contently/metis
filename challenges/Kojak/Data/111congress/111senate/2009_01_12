Mr. President, for more than 25 years, the State of \nKentucky was represented in the Senate of the United States by a \nterrific man and a great legislator, Wendell Ford.\n  Senator Ford was known by all as a moderate, deeply respected by both \nsides of the aisle for putting progress ahead of politics. Senator \nFord, some said, was not flashy. He did not seek the limelight. He was \nquietly effective and calmly deliberative.\n  In 1991, Senator Ford was elected by his colleagues to serve as \nDemocratic whip, the No. 2 position in the caucus. For 8 years, he \nstruck the perfect balance as an advocate for Kentuckians and also a \nnational Democratic leader.\n  When Senator Ford retired from the Senate in 1998, I had the honor of \nreplacing him as the Democratic whip.\n  Wendell Ford is not only a genuine Kentucky legend, he is a wonderful \nman, and I continue to enjoy his visits back to Washington, DC.\n  Until this week, Senator Ford was the longest serving Senator in the \nhistory of the State of Kentucky. We have had some outstanding Senators \nfrom the State of Kentucky.\n  Now that honor belongs to my friend, the Republican leader, Mitch \nMcConnell.\n  Senator McConnell came to the Senate 2 years after I came to \nCongress. In 1984, he was elected to the Senate in a historic election \nstill famous for its advertising--the most memorable of the spots \nfeaturing some real bloodhounds, always in search of the opponent of \nMitch McConnell, the incumbent Senator from Kentucky. Today, if you go \nto a seminar on politics, almost always they will show that ad as being \none of\n\n[[Page S276]]\n\nthe classic political ads in the history of our country.\n  Senator McConnell won that first race by a razor-thin margin, but he \nquickly became a leader among his Republican colleagues in the Senate \nin general.\n  Senator McConnell chaired the Republican Senatorial Campaign \nCommittee during the 1998 and 2000 election cycles, served as \nRepublican whip following the 2002 midterm elections, and now has \nserved as the Republican leader since 2006.\n  I became the Democratic whip in 1998 and have been the Democratic \nleader since 2004. Our careers in the Senate have been very similar. \nDuring this period of time I was majority whip; he was. Back and forth, \nthere was a lot of changing going on. So I have had a lot of \ninteraction with Senator McConnell because of our respective jobs.\n  It is well known that in our positions as minority and majority \nleaders--both as whips and as the leaders--he and I have had \ndisagreements at various times. Behind the scenes, though, it is a \ndifferent situation. In places where the cameras do not record our \ndiscussions, in private conversations, as we have to have, we are not \nonly friends but determined partners in the legislative process. We get \na lot of work done very quickly.\n  We just completed a meeting that took about 20 minutes, where I think \nthe record will ultimately reflect that 20 minutes was truly well spent \nworking out some of the problems of this Senate.\n  So I say, we are not only friends but determined partners in the \nlegislative process of the Senate. That does not mean we always see eye \nto eye. Everyone knows that is not the case. But in the words of \nPresident-elect Obama, we are able to disagree without being \ndisagreeable.\n  We respect each other's commitment to making our country stronger, \nand I think we have a special understanding of the unique challenges of \nkeeping our respective caucuses together and striving toward the same \ngoals.\n  At the University of Louisville, Mitch McConnell has worked with \nfaculty to create a center for public service, to educate and prepare a \nnew generation to answer the call of public service.\n  A little more than a year ago, Senator McConnell invited me to be a \nguest at the McConnell Center at the University of Louisville. After a \nterrific program with young and aspiring academics, he presented me \nwith a real Louisville Slugger baseball bat, with my name inscribed on \nthe ``sweet spot.'' That is where these great hitters have used these \nbats for generations to hit the ball as far as they can and as sharply \nas they can.\n  On that day at the McConnell Center, Senator McConnell and I spoke \nfrankly and openly about the joys and difficulties of our jobs to these \nfaculty members and these students. I, in fact, told the students an \nold story about President Lincoln that has been told many times, but it \nis always important because he sets the standard for what politics is \nall about as far as getting along with people, as finely written about \nin some detail in the ``Team of Rivals,'' this best-selling book. What \nPresident Lincoln said, when he was being criticized for being \nsolicitous of members of the Confederacy, was: ``Am I not destroying my \nenemies by making friends of them?''\n  Well, Senator McConnell and I both understand that through friendship \nand mutual respect we can find common ground to achieve common goals \nand to reach for the common good of the American people--common ground, \ncommon goals, common good.\n  My wife Landra and I are pleased to call him and his lovely wife--and \nthat, certainly, is an understatement--Elaine Chao our friends. Elaine, \nof course, is a national leader in her own right, having served for 8 \nyears as our Nation's Labor Secretary and also formerly as the Director \nof the Peace Corps. I have such great respect for Peace Corpsmen and \nespecially someone who is able to lead that very elite group. So I have \nonly high regard for Mitch and Elaine. They are a wonderful couple and \ndo so many good things for our country.\n  So I congratulate the Republican leader, a Kentuckian whose love of \nhis State and its university athletic programs is well known and who \nnow adds the distinction of being the longest serving Senator from the \nState of Kentucky to his long and impressive career.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/12/senate-section/article/S276-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I thank my good friend, the majority \nleader, for his very kind remarks about what has now become a rather \nlengthy period of service in the Senate. He and I came here at roughly \nthe same time, and, as he indicated, came to the Congress at roughly \nthe same time. We have shared a few positions on each side of the aisle \nthat are remarkably similar no matter which party you represent.\n  I noted with interest last week the photograph at the White House of \nthe living former Presidents who had all had lunch together, and I was \nthinking, as the majority leader was speaking, we are in a rather \nlimited fraternity, too--so far it is a fraternity; it will be a \nsorority at some point as well as a fraternity; a brotherhood or \nsisterhood, if you will--of people who have held these jobs which have \ntheir own unique set of challenges that are quite similar whether you \nare leading the Republicans or leading the Democrats.\n  I wish to thank the majority leader for his very kind remarks not \nonly about me but about my wife's public service as Secretary of Labor, \nwhich will be coming to an end at noon on January 20, along with the \ncurrent administration. I also wish to express my gratitude to the \nmajority leader for coming down to the University of Louisville back in \n2007. The students enjoyed it immensely. In fact, their last magazine \nabout the program of the center has a very large picture of the \nmajority leader and a lengthy article including a Q and A session he \nhad with the students.\n  So I am grateful for his friendship and look forward to working with \nhim in this Congress to advance the interests of our Nation.\n  A few months prior to this body's convening last week, I was grateful \nto be chosen by my colleagues to serve once again as the Senate \nRepublican leader.\n  I would also like to thank the people of Kentucky for giving me \nanother term in the Senate. I am certainly privileged Kentucky has sent \nme to the Senate five times now to speak for them and for their \ninterests, and I intend to work harder than I ever have over the next 6 \nyears to justify their confidence.\n  At such a time as this, after the people of Kentucky have spoken, I \ncannot help but think of great Kentuckians in the past who the people \nof my State have selected to represent their interests.\n  Some we know from the history books, such as Henry Clay. Although he \nwas Speaker of the House, Secretary of State, and a three-time \nPresidential candidate, we know him best as the Senator from Kentucky--\nthe Great Compromiser who staved off civil war. Or take John \nBreckinridge. Elected to Congress from Virginia, he resigned that seat \nto move to Kentucky, which at the time was America's western frontier. \nA key architect of Kentucky's early State government, Breckinridge went \non to serve as a Senator from Kentucky, and then as our young Nation's \nAttorney General under Thomas Jefferson.\n  Moving to modern times, I can think of other legendary Senators from \nKentucky whose footsteps still echo in these halls.\n  Kentucky still fondly remembers the career of public service carved \nout by A.B. Chandler. He would be the first to tell you he made his \nmark not as a Senator but as a two-term Governor, or in the job he \nresigned the Senate to hold: commissioner of baseball. No matter what \nthe job, with his winning personality, he was better known throughout \nthe State by his nickname ``Happy.''\n  I am sure he would be happy to see his grandson, Congressman Ben \nChandler, continuing his family's tradition of service to the people of \nKentucky.\n\n[[Page S277]]\n\n  I have also spoken on this floor before of my admiration and respect \nfor John Sherman Cooper, the conscience of the Senate in his day. I \nwill always remember the man who mentored me as an intern in my first \njob on Capitol Hill and helped me navigate these hallways decades later \nas a freshman Senator.\n  Of course, there is Alben Barkley, the first and, until recently, the \nonly Kentuckian to be elected his party's leader. After 12 years \nleading Senate Democrats through the Great Depression and World War II, \nhe became America's 35th Vice President.\n  Alben Barkley held the record as Kentucky's longest serving Senator \nfor over 40 years--until it was broken by a man who, like him, rose \nfrom humble beginnings to become famous across the Commonwealth.\n  That Senator was Wendell Ford, a man many of my colleagues have had \nthe honor to know and work alongside. Wendell was the senior Senator \nfrom my State when I was first elected, and I got to watch him up close \nfor 14 years. Over those years, I learned why Wendell is the first and \nonly Kentuckian to be elected successively Lieutenant Governor, \nGovernor, and Senator. It is because even while he attained high \noffice, he never forgot the lessons he learned working alongside his \nparents on their farm. Countless times he reminded voters he was ``just \na country boy from Yellow Creek.'' And Kentuckians respected him for \nproving that a country boy could walk the halls of power, dine with \nkings and Presidents and still come back to Yellow Creek and be right \nat home.\n\n  Wendell Hampton Ford was born in Daviess County, KY, and grew up on \nhis family's 250-acre farm in the little town of Thruston. The Ford \nfamily raised cattle, hogs, and chickens and grew tobacco and corn. \nYoung Wendell was no stranger to work. He did his part by milking 30 \ncows by hand twice a day every day. Decades later, whenever anyone told \nhim he had a strong handshake, Wendell would tell them: ``I milked at \nan early age.''\n  I know Wendell would credit his parents with teaching him everything \nhe needed to know to succeed in life. Ernest Ford was a farmer, an \ninsurance company owner, and a chairman of the Daviess County \nDemocratic Party. He served in both the Kentucky State House and \nSenate. His mother, Irene Ford, worked harder than anyone on the family \nfarm. She picked strawberries, she snapped green beans, and she canned \neverything that you could can. She could cook a pork tenderloin that \nwas so good, Wendell recalls, ``We'd say it'd make you swallow your \ntongue.'' She was devoted to her family, her friends, her neighbors, \nand her church.\n  Wendell remembers:\n\n       Mother never disliked anyone. She never would say anything \n     unkind about anybody. And mother worked very, very hard. . . \n     . if there's anyone that ever went to heaven, my mother is \n     there.\n\n  Now, I am going to guess that maybe through his father's political \nconnections, Wendell scored a plum prize as a young child: he became a \npage in the Kentucky State House. The way they inducted pages back then \nis a little different from how we do it in the U.S. Senate today. \nWendell's sponsor, a representative from Taylorsville, had young \nWendell come and stand on his desk on the House floor. He gave a speech \nabout what a good little kid he was, and when he was done, the entire \nchamber applauded, making Wendell a page by acclamation. After an \nintroduction to politics like that, is it any wonder Wendell decided he \nwanted more?\n  Wendell was also lucky enough to meet one of the great Kentuckians I \nmentioned earlier--Alben Barkley--back when, obviously, Senator Ford \nwas young. At the Seelbach Hotel in my hometown of Louisville, he heard \na speech from the Senator and future Vice President. Like Barkley, \nWendell always wanted to be around people--a trait that would serve him \nwell as a public servant.\n  Like most Kentuckians, Wendell Ford loves basketball. He played on \nthe basketball team for Thruston Elementary School and he played on the \nteam for Daviess County High School. But while in high school, Wendell \nbroke his arm. That ended his basketball career, and that threatened to \nend his involvement with the team, the friendships he had made, and his \nseat on the bus to all the away games. So to stay involved, Wendell \nfilled an open slot on the school's cheerleading team. He got to keep \ngoing to the games, he got to keep up his friendships, and he ended up \nbeing voted ``most talkative'' in the Daviess County High School senior \nclass of 1942.\n  After high school graduation, Wendell attended the University of \nKentucky. Then, in 1944, he was drafted into the U.S. Army, and SGT \nWendell Ford reported for duty at Fort Hood, TX. But he was not the \nonly Ford to trade in his bluegrass for a 10-gallon hat and make that \ntrip. By his side was his lovely bride Jean, who met Wendell when they \nboth worked at the J.C. Penney store in Owensboro the summer after \nWendell's high school graduation. They married in September 1943 just \nafter Wendell had turned 19. Jean hailed from the town of West Point in \nHardin County. She could hardly have known then how her life would turn \nout or how she and her husband would become respected across the \nCommonwealth.\n  Oftentimes, my colleagues and I will talk about our wives or our \nhusbands and what we will be doing over the next recess. You will \nfrequently hear spouses' first names tossed around, like my wife's name \nis Elaine. But after 50 years of marriage, Wendell only referred to his \nbride as ``Mrs. Ford.'' It is a testament to the fact that the country \nboy from Yellow Creek remains forever a country gentleman.\n  After the end of World War II and an honorable discharge from the \nservice, Wendell graduated from the Maryland School of Insurance. He \nand Jean returned to Owensboro, where his family had moved after \nselling the farm. Wendell entered the insurance business with his \nfather and started to take an interest in what was happening in his \ncommunity.\n  It all started with a razor. That is what Wendell was looking to buy \non a lunchtime errand when he ran into a friend who invited him to a \nJaycees luncheon.\n  In my travels across Kentucky, I have met many who know and remember \nWendell from his days with the Jaycees. Devoted to fostering leadership \nand community service, the Jaycees have done a lot for Kentucky and for \nthe Nation. Once again, the man who played a role that cannot be \nignored is Wendell Ford.\n  A lot of beliefs that would come to characterize Wendell Ford's \ncareer came from the creed of the Jaycees. That creed states that only \nfaith in God gives meaning and purpose to human life, that government \nshould be of laws rather than of men, and that service to humanity is \nthe best work of life.\n  Wendell would rise rapidly in his career, again and again, no matter \nwhat the arena, and his time in the Jaycees was no different. That \nfirst meeting at the request of a friend led to Wendell becoming a \nmember. By 1954, he was the Kentucky Jaycees State president at 31. In \n1956, he led the Kentucky Jaycees to their national convention in \nKansas City with one goal: they wanted to return home with a Kentuckian \nas the organization's national president--a Kentuckian named Wendell \nFord.\n  Kentucky has a rich history of colorful, memorable campaign ads, but \nit took Wendell Ford, as a candidate for the Jaycees' national \npresident, to come up with a brilliant ad by piggybacking his name on \nperhaps the most famous rock-and-roll song of all time. By convention's \nend, every Jaycee delegate went home singing a familiar tune with the \nwords ``shake, rattle, and roll'' replaced with ``shake, rally with \nFord.'' Wendell remembers:\n\n       We kept them up all night with that record. And I guess \n     [we] made it even better, because we won.\n\n  To work the crowds at the convention, Wendell bought two new suits \nfor $35 apiece, one black and one gray. By rotating jackets with each \npair of pants, he had four different outfits for the 4 days of the \nconvention. Whether it was the song or the suits or both, Wendell went \nhome the first Jaycees national President from Kentucky, and his \nnetwork from that organization became the foundation for one of the \nCommonwealth's most successful political careers.\n  By the late 1950s, Wendell had caught the eye of Bert Combs, who had \nrun for Governor of Kentucky but lost to ``Happy'' Chandler. Combs was \nplanning to run again, and he wanted the\n\n[[Page S278]]\n\nimpressive Jaycees president to be the youth chairman of his campaign. \nAfter winning that race, Bert Combs made Wendell his administrative \nassistant, a job he held from 1959 to 1961.\n  But soon the time came for Wendell to emerge from the ranks of \npolitical staffers and run for office himself. In 1965, he ran for a \nState senate seat representing Daviess and Hancock Counties, and \nclearly he was not afraid of a challenging race. The reason I say he \nwas not afraid of a challenging race, the guy he ran against in the \nprimary, a fellow named Cap Gardner, was not just any incumbent \nSenator, he was the State senate majority leader. I was in law school \nat the University of Kentucky at the time, and I remember reading about \nthe primary in which the majority leader of the Kentucky State Senate \nwas upset by an impressive young man named Wendell Ford. He won that \nrace by 305 votes--after a recount.\n\n  In those days, Kentucky was very much a one-party State, so winning \nthe Democratic primary for most any office was tantamount to winning \nthe election. In most counties, you could hold Republican Party \nmeetings in a phone booth. It is not that way anymore, which I think is \nfor the better--I think a competitive, two-party system makes both \nparties better, and that, in turn, serves the people best--but the \nDemocratic Party ruled Kentucky then, and after Wendell won the \nprimary, he easily won the general. For the first time, but not the \nlast, he became Senator Ford. As a freshman Senator, he sponsored 22 \nbills, all of which became law. That is a record of success few \nlegislators would dare seek to duplicate.\n  But Wendell didn't plan on staying in the State senate too long. Just \n2 years later, in 1967, he ran for Lieutenant Governor, and once again \nhe ruffled some feathers amongst the more established politicians of \nthe Commonwealth who didn't understand why this country boy from Yellow \nCreek couldn't settle down and wait his turn. In the primary, Wendell \nfaced Robert Matthews, the incumbent State attorney general. I am sure \nthe entrenched political forces in Kentucky expected and perhaps even \ndesired Matthews to win, but Wendell wasn't going along with their \nprogram. He defeated Matthews in the primary--barely--36.1 percent to \n35.9 percent. Wendell went on to win a similarly close race in the \ngeneral election, defeating Thomas Ratliff and becoming the Lieutenant \nGovernor of Kentucky.\n  But at the same time, something unusual happened. You heard me say \njust a minute ago that in those days Kentucky was very much a one-party \nState, but in 1967, Kentuckians elected a guy named Louie Nunn to be \nKentucky's first Republican Governor since World War II. At that time, \ncandidates for Governor and Lieutenant Governor in my State ran \nseparately. So while the Democratic candidate for Governor lost, \nWendell Ford quite remarkably won, and he instantly became two things: \nthe top-ranked Democrat in State government and, of course, a real \nthorn in the side of Governor Nunn.\n  Wendell had to beat a Republican tide--a rare tide in those days--to \nbecome Lieutenant Governor. He was clearly a man of great talent and \nambition who was not yet done making his mark on Kentucky politics. So \nnaturally he looked next to the top job in State government, the office \nof Governor.\n  In that era, Kentucky Governors were forbidden to succeed themselves \nby running for a second term. In fact, Kentucky retained that term \nlimit for Governors right up until the 1990s--one of the last States to \ndo so. So Wendell would not have to face Governor Nunn in the 1971 \nelection. He would, however, have to face a different Governor, his \nfriend and mentor, former Governor Bert Combs.\n  Everybody in Kentucky thought Governor Combs, who had subsequently \nhad a distinguished career as a U.S. court of appeals judge after his \nterm as Governor, was a lead pipe cinch to be the next Governor of \nKentucky, or at the very least to win the Democratic primary for sure. \nBut once again Wendell Ford beat everybody's expectations. Bert Combs \nresigned his judgeship to run for Governor and couldn't believe what a \ntough race his former administrative assistant gave him. When a mutual \nfriend of the two candidates said to Combs that he had taught Wendell \nwell, Combs replied, ``Yes, I taught him too damn well.'' Wendell beat \nBert Combs 53 percent to 44 percent in the primary and went on to \neasily win the general election. On December 7, 1971, he was sworn in \nas Governor of Kentucky.\n  Right from the start, Governor Ford's guiding belief as Kentucky's \nchief executive was that the only reason for the existence of \ngovernment at any level was to serve people. Wherever he felt that \nwasn't happening, he believed there must be change.\n  Throughout his term, no bill that Governor Ford supported failed to \npass. He commanded the forces of the State government below him the way \na general commands his troops. But Governor Ford didn't ask anyone else \nto work harder than he did himself. His work ethic back then was \nlegendary, and I think some of my colleagues can attest to the fact \nthat he kept right at it after he joined us here in the Senate.\n  As Governor, a 14-hour workday was routine, a 16-hour day frequent, \nand an 18-hour day not uncommon.\n  When Governor Ford used to fly here to Washington for official \nmatters, he was all business. Time in the car or the plane was spent \nreading memos or writing speeches. Dinner was a cheeseburger and fries \nin the hotel room.\n  As early as possible the next morning, Wendell was up and flying home \nto Kentucky where he would put in an extra-late night at the State \ncapitol to make up for time missed.\n  Once he had successfully enacted the major points of his platform--\nincluding shrinking and streamlining State government, creating the \nState's first environmental protection agency, and enacting a severance \ntax on coal--Wendell Ford decided he was not finished serving the \npeople of Kentucky just yet.\n  I have already said at that time, a Kentucky Governor could not run \nfor a second term. So Wendell looked to the U.S. Senate election in \n1974 where he would have to take on incumbent Republican Senator Marlow \nCook.\n  The 1974 election came on the heels of the Watergate scandal and \nRichard Nixon's resignation. It goes without saying it was a very hard \nyear for Republicans. But even if it had been an easy year for \nRepublicans, Governor Ford would have been very hard to defeat.\n  So Wendell won over Marlow Cook pretty handily, and Governor Ford \nbecame Senator Ford. I should point out, I actually used to work for \nSenator Cook as a legislative director in the early part of his one \nterm.\n  Senator Cook graciously agreed to step aside a little bit early for \nSenator Ford. So Wendell's tenure in this Chamber began on December 28, \n1974. At this point, the Wendell Ford so many of my colleagues know and \nadmire emerges, as he spent an incredibly successful and fruitful 24 \nyears here.\n  After my election in 1984, I served alongside him for 14 of those \nyears. Obviously, Wendell Ford and I did not stand on the same side of \nthe aisle. But we always stood together for the people of Kentucky.\n  With Wendell, whether you agreed or disagreed, you always knew where \nyou stood with him. Even if you disagreed--which we often did--Wendell \nknew how to disagree without being disagreeable.\n  I remember one joke he liked to tell about how seriously we \nKentuckians take our horseracing. He liked to say that one day on the \nrunning of the Kentucky Derby, a man walking in Churchill Downs noticed \na box with an empty seat in it. He stopped and said to the little old \nlady sitting next to it: This is the first empty seat I have seen \ntoday. Bear in mind, this is at the Derby.\n  She replied: Well, it belonged to my husband, but he died.\n  The man said: It seems a shame to let such a good seat go to waste. \nWhy didn't you give it to one of your relatives?\n  The lady said: I would have, but they are all at the funeral.\n  That is how important the Derby and the horse industry are to the \nBluegrass State. Wendell Ford enjoyed telling that story.\n  With his sense of humor, a penchant for storytelling that rivaled his \nchildhood hero Alben Barkley, and his ability to establish friendships \nand trust, Wendell quickly became a leader\n\n[[Page S279]]\n\namongst his Senate colleagues. He served a stint running the Democratic \nSenatorial Campaign Committee.\n  By 1987, he had risen to become chairman of the Senate Rules \nCommittee. That position put him in charge of the inaugural ceremonies \nat the Capitol for both Presidents George H.W. Bush in 1989 and Bill \nClinton in 1993. Kentuckians were proud to see one of their own on the \ninaugural platform just footsteps away from the new President.\n  Wendell was chairman of the Joint Committee on Printing where he \nworked to trim the costs of Government printing and implemented the \nfirst ever program for the use of recycled printing paper. That may not \nbe the type of issue that grabs the biggest headlines, but, obviously, \nofficial Washington uses a lot of paper. Wendell was ahead of his time \nin making these environmentally friendly efforts that are commonplace \nnow, and he saved taxpayers millions of dollars.\n  Wendell could see the absurdity of some of what goes on in Washington \nand knew just when to break the tension with a little humor. One former \ncolleague has spoken of one of the many times the Senate has continued \nin session until 3:30 or 4 o'clock in the morning, with debate still \ngoing on on the Senate floor. At one of these times, Wendell nudged the \nSenator next to him and said: You know, the people back home think that \nwe are the ones who won.\n  Wendell even appeared once on the cable channel MTV on a program \ncalled ``Rock the Vote'' because of his sponsorship of the motor voter \nlaw. That MTV appearance made him very popular with his grandchildren. \nSurely the number of U.S. Senators who have appeared sandwiched in \nbetween videos for Whitney Houston and Billy Ray Cyrus is very small.\n  In 1990, Wendell's colleagues, as my friend the majority leader \npointed out, elected him to be No. 2 in their party in the Senate, the \nSenate whip. He held that slot until his retirement in 1999. Wendell \nwas elected by acclamation and without opposition. That is obviously a \nposition of great responsibility and honor, and it speaks to the \nrespect Wendell commanded from his fellow Senators.\n  After his election as whip, he said: In Kentucky, we are known for \nour horses. I plan on being a workhorse and not a show horse.\n  I think knowing Wendell's work ethic, no one doubted he would give \nhis all to the job.\n  In March of 1998, Wendell became the longest serving Senator in \nKentucky history, breaking the record of the man he had seen giving a \nspeech more than 50 years earlier, Alben Barkley. That is just another \naccomplishment in a long list that he has amassed over his \nextraordinarily successful tenure in both State and Federal Government.\n  Wendell Ford served in this body for 8,772 days, a record that stood \nfor nearly 11 years until January 10, this past Saturday. He never lost \nan election for public office. Kentucky sent him to the U.S. Senate \nfour times, and he was the first statewide candidate to carry all 120 \ncounties.\n  How does a country boy from Yellow Creek achieve such success at the \nhighest levels of American politics? I think because no matter where he \nended up, Wendell Ford never forgot from where he started from. Even in \nhis final months in the Senate, he still got goose bumps every time he \nlooked up at the Capitol dome on his way to work. He remained the same \nman, partial to a cigarette and a down-home tale.\n  When his duties didn't require him to be in Washington, he would \nreturn home to Kentucky, as he did most weekends throughout his Senate \ncareer. A 3-day weekend was a perfect chance to go to the house he and \nhis family owned by Rough River Lake and do some reading and fishing. \nHe once said his idea of a vacation was ``not shaving and not wearing a \nsuit.''\n  Wendell Ford never forgot the truly important things in his life--his \nwife Jean, their children and grandchildren, and the simple pleasures \nof his native Kentucky.\n  Many of my colleagues will remember his trademark greeting when he \nwalked into a room. He would say: How are all you lucky people doing? \nSometimes that would be shortened to simply: Hey, Lucky!\n  But Wendell never lost sight that he was truly the lucky one for \nreceiving the trust of the people of Kentucky many times over. He would \nbe the first to tell you that, and Kentucky and our Nation are lucky as \nwell for having had his many years of service.\n  Over the next 6 years, as I work my hardest to better the lives of \neveryone in Kentucky and the country, I am going to remember the \nlessons learned from Wendell Ford's long career. I will remember how \nhis life is a testament to the success anybody in America can attain, \neven a country boy from Yellow Creek. I will remember what an honor it \nis to continue in the tradition of Wendell Ford and so many other fine \npublic servants who have come from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. Their \nservice will continue to remind me every day that with energy, \ndetermination, and principle, being the Senator from Kentucky is the \nbest job I could ever hope to have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/12/senate-section/article/S279-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, those who have been listening and \nwatching for the last few minutes got one good lesson on why Senator \nMcConnell has been here for over 24 years. This is a day to honor him, \nbut he spent virtually all of his time honoring someone else.\n  It is a remarkable and rare event that Senator McConnell could serve \nlonger than Wendell Ford, the man he just honored, longer than Henry \nClay, longer than John Sherman Cooper, and longer than Alben Barkley. \nBut all of us know longevity by itself is not a transcending virtue, \nbut it is an indication of one of the most transcending virtues; and \nthat is, the people of Kentucky for the last 24 years have seen \nsomething special in Mitch McConnell, something that is good for \nKentucky, in the opinion of Kentuckians, and something that is good for \nour country. I have seen that, too, but for a longer period of time \nthan 24 years; 40 years, to be exact.\n  I remember when Mitch McConnell came to Washington, not the time he \nwas an intern but as the legislative director for Senator Marlow Cook. \nLegislative director is a little bit of a puffed-up title for the job \nat that time, because in the office of Senator Baker of Tennessee, \nwhere I had been the year before, there was only one legislative \nassistant. So we were legislative directors of usually one or two \npeople at a time, which may seem pretty hard for staff members in this \nSenate to understand.\n  I remember that by 1969, I moved over to work for Bryce Harlow in the \nNixon White House. Howard Baker, who had been a good friend of Marlow \nCook, the new Senator from Kentucky, came to me and said: Marlow Cook \nhas a bright young man working for him; you ought to get to know him.\n  So I did, 40 years ago.\n  We both stayed in Washington for a while. We both went home after a \nfew years, and in 1978, 30 years ago, we both were elected to an \nexecutive position in our home States--I as Governor of Tennessee, and \nMitch McConnell as the county executive of Jefferson County, which is \nLouisville, the big county there.\n  Then, in 1984, as the record shows and we all know, he was elected to \nthe U.S. Senate, the only Republican in the country that year, I \nbelieve, who was able to defeat an incumbent Democrat.\n  When Senator McConnell and I were young staff assistants in the \nSenate, the leaders of the Senate were Senators Dirksen and Mansfield. \nThere have been many great leaders of the Senate since that period of \ntime. All of those leaders who were good--and most of them were--knew \nthis body, knew the Senate. They knew human nature instinctively, but \nthey had one other quality, and this is another quality\n\n[[Page S280]]\n\nSenator McConnell has. They had great respect for our country.\n  Last July, I brought onto the Senate floor a group of teachers of \nU.S. history. They were selected, one from each State, under a program \nthat is called Presidential Academies for Teachers of United States \nHistory. Since a Senator may bring onto the floor before it convenes \nanybody he chooses, there were 50 of us here. I showed them Daniel \nWebster's desk, which is right next to me. I talked with them about \nHenry Clay, and I showed them Jefferson Davis's desk in the back.\n  As you can imagine, these outstanding teachers were awestruck being \non the floor of the Senate. They were the only ones here. After about a \n30-minute visit, one of them--I think it was the teacher from Oregon--\nsaid to me: Senator Alexander, what would you like for us to take back \nto our students about this visit?\n  I found myself saying: I hope you will tell them that I get up every \nmorning--and I think most of us here do--and come to work hoping that \nby the end of the day, we can make this country a little better place. \nI am not sure what it looks like on television. I am not sure what it \nlooks like on the front pages of the newspapers. But that is my motive, \nand that is the motive of most of us here.\n  That has been the motive of Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. Yes, \nbeginning his 25th year in the Senate is a rare distinction, especially \nbecause he is from a State that has produced so many outstanding \nSenators and a State that even today and through most of the last 24 \nyears has been a very competitive State with Democrats and Republicans \nboth having a chance to be elected. Mitch McConnell gets up every day, \ncomes into work--and it is usually very early--thinking about how to \nmake this country a little better before the end of the day--and that \nis usually very late. That quality is even more important than his more \nthan 24 years of service.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my dear friend from Tennessee \nfor being on the Senate floor today and for his overly kind comments \nabout my tenure. We have indeed been friends for 40 years.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it is a privilege today, and really a \njoy, to rise to join in the celebration of Senator Mitch McConnell and \nhis many terrific years of service to this country and to the people of \nthe State of Kentucky. For those folks who watch from the gallery or \nwatch at home, I will tell you what you see is what you get. He is \nkind, he is thoughtful, he is calm, he is patient, but I will also tell \nyou he is persistent. You could not have a better friend in the Senate \nor in this life than Mitch McConnell or his wonderful wife Elaine.\n  We have heard a bit about the history of Kentucky, we have heard a \nbit about Wendell Ford, but when you put this into historical \nperspective and you do the searches and you see who the top names are \nin Kentucky when it comes to politics, the names that come up are Henry \nClay, Abraham Lincoln--because he was born in Kentucky--and Mitch \nMcConnell.\n  Now, Henry Clay was the greatest of the Old Senate Chamber. People \nwho watched the swearing in of the Senators earlier this month saw \nSenators taking their oath in this Chamber but also going back for a \nreenactment in the Old Senate Chamber. In that Old Senate Chamber the \nnames were Clay, Calhoun, and Webster. When one of them would rise to \nspeak--and people would come from all around--they would say: Clay is \nup, Calhoun is up, Webster is up, and people would run. Well, today, \nthe running occurs when people say: Mitch is on the phone; Mitch is \ncalling. You want to know: How can I help? What are his ideas? You know \nthey are good for the country. Henry Clay was called the great \ncompromiser. He was called the great pacifier. Those names were given \nto him because of his ability to bring others to agreement. The exact \nsame thing can be said of Mitch McConnell in this, the new Senate \nChamber.\n  Now, Mr. President, we left that Old Senate Chamber in 1859 and moved \nto this beautiful Chamber, and this marks the 150th year of that move. \nThere is actually a little booklet, the ``United States Senate Chamber \n1859-2009,'' and it talks about when we left and made the procession. \nWe have heard about some previous Kentucky Senators, but the Senator \nwho gave the speech when we left that Senate Chamber in 1859 was also \nfrom Kentucky. It was Senator John Crittenden, and some of his comments \nare in this booklet.\n  Well, I will tell you, in the new Senate Chamber, since 1859--now 150 \nyears--Mitch McConnell truly and clearly is the man of the Senate. Just \nlike Henry Clay, he came from humble beginnings. We talk about humble \nbeginnings, but few people know that Mitch McConnell, at the age of 2, \nhad polio. He was nursed back to health by his mother, who helped teach \nhim how to walk and then how to run. It is through her hard work and \nhis dedication and his persistence that he has become the man we know \ntoday.\n  In early November of this past year, George Will wrote an article \npraising Senator McConnell, but he quoted Abraham Lincoln, when he \nwrote:\n\n       I hope to have God on my side but I must have Kentucky.\n\n  I will tell you, Mr. President, for those of us on this side of the \naisle, we must have Mitch McConnell. The Senate would just not be the \nSenate. We have been blessed time after time after time that the people \nof Kentucky have seen fit to send Mitch McConnell back to the Senate.\n  In his speech when the Senate moved from the Old Senate Chamber to \nthe new Senate Chamber, Senator Crittenden said:\n  Senators are the representatives of the States of this mighty union. \nNo matter under what sky we may sit; no matter what dome may cover us; \nthe great patriotic spirit of the Senate of the United States will be \nthere and I have an abiding confidence that it will never fail in the \nperformance of its duty.\n  Well, Mr. President, this applies to Senator McConnell because his \ngreat patriotic spirit will always be here, and those who know him have \nan abiding confidence that he will never fail in the performance of his \nduty.\n  Mr. President, Senator McConnell is a champion. He is a champion for \nKentucky and he is a champion for America; for a stronger America, a \nbetter America, a safer America, and an America where any boy or girl \ncan, through hard work and persistence, grow up to be a leader of this \ngreat Nation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I would like to express my deep \nappreciation to the Senator from Wyoming for his overly kind and very \ngenerous comments about my work here, and also say, Mr. President, to \nthe people of Wyoming, how fortunate they are to have Senator Barrasso \nrepresenting them.\n  I have seen a lot of new Senators come into this body over these 25 \nyears. I have never seen one make a mark quicker. So I know the people \nof Wyoming deeply appreciate their junior Senator. They demonstrated \nthat a couple of months ago in the election, and they really could not \nhave made a wiser choice. I value my colleague from Wyoming, and I \nthank him so much for his very kind and generous remarks.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask I be recognized as in morning \nbusiness for such time as I shall consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/12/senate-section/article/S280-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S280-S282]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  TARP\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I was somewhat shocked last October when\n\n[[Page S281]]\n\nthe vote came up and actually 75 Senators in the Senate and about 75 \npercent of the House of Representatives voted to give an unelected \nbureaucrat $700 billion to do with as he wanted with no accountability. \nI believe that 20 or 30 years from now, historians will look back and \nsay that was the most outrageous vote, maybe in the history of these \ninstitutions. The administration has now requested the second $350 \nbillion sometime this week.\n  If you are a reasonable person and were to assume that a major event \nin the financial world has prompted the negotiations that led to the \ndecision to release the second $350 billion, you would be wrong. The \ntrue reason Congress may be asked to release the second $350 billion--\nit is just politics. It is a hot potato; nobody wants it, but they all \nwant the money, and that is what we are faced with now. Again, no event \nin the financial world has prompted the request for the second $350 \nbillion.\n  I was critical of the Bush administration, and particularly of \nSecretary Paulson, since the October 10 vote giving Paulson, an \nunelected bureaucrat, $700 billion to do with as he wished. It is hard \nfor me and it is hard for most Americans to understand, when they talk \nabout these huge numbers--billion dollars and trillion dollars, \nwhatever it means. But I think the time has come to count the actual \nnumber of families who file tax returns in America and, if you do your \nmath, with your $700 billion it comes to $5,000 a family. That is what \nwe are talking about. This is not a little deal. It is huge. I think, \nif people look at some of the things that have happened since then, it \nis the fault of passing the $700 billion bill; that precipitated all \nthe problems we have.\n  Congress is asked as an institution to prepare to say yes to the next \n$350 billion in deficit spending simply because we received a letter of \nassurances. I do not know what letters of assurance are, or what a \nletter of assurance is, but I suppose it is the same kind of assurance \nwe got from Secretary Paulson when he said to us we have to have $700 \nbillion, and it has to be used to buy damaged assets.\n  The letters of assurances are a bunch of promises on paper and that \nis not sufficient justification for this institution to let go of the \n$350 billion in taxpayers' money. Congress needs to put itself back in \nthe process when we are talking about this kind of money. That is why I \nintroduced legislation, S. 64, with a bipartisan group of Senators. \nThat says the executive branch can only have access to the remaining \n$350 billion if Congress approves the submitted plan and votes on that \nplan.\n  What is so bad about that? This is the way we have been doing \nbusiness for years and years. The administration will make a request. \nThat is what they do in the budget process. It comes to Congress. We \nevaluate that and determine whether we, who are elected \nrepresentatives, believe it is something that should take place.\n  We have already seen the legislation we passed last fall is a blank \ncheck for one person to do whatever he wants with billions of dollars. \nTake, for instance, the auto bailout. The interesting thing about the \nauto bailout is everyone expressed all this outrage over the auto \nbailout. I said back in October, when 75 percent of the Members of the \nHouse and the Senate voted to give Secretary Paulson $700 billion to do \nwith as he wished: Who is going to be next in line to be bailed out? I \nsuggested aviation, then the auto industry and farmers and everybody \nelse. That is exactly what did happen. So those people who expressed \nsuch outrage with the auto bailout should stop and realize, if it had \nnot been for that vote to turn loose and turn over $700 billion, that \ncould not have happened.\n  People talk about whatever it was, $15 billion or whatever it was in \nthe auto bailout. That only constituted 2 percent of the $700 billion. \nThat is what we have to keep our minds on, as to what precipitated the \nproblem we have now.\n  We were told what was going to be done with the money. Paulson came \nto us in September and said if we didn't immediately come through with \n$700 billion--that is what he said it would take to buy bad assets--the \ntotal economy would collapse. It was a panic scenario.\n  Then the plans changed and Paulson began--and this happened right \nafter he got his hands on the $700 billion. He didn't use it to buy \ndamaged assets. He used it to pass out to various financial \ninstitutions--banks. It is my belief the rationale for releasing any \nmore of the $700 billion no longer applies. As a matter of fact, a \nprominent economist from the Reagan administration last Wednesday said \nthe first $350 billion did absolutely no good, in terms of dealing with \nthe recession we are currently in.\n  It was clear to me at the time it was a mistake to sign a blank check \nto one man for such a tremendous amount of money. Although there are \nstill significant challenges in the financial markets, it appears the \nthreat of the financial crisis spinning so out of control that we face \nanother Great Depression--which was the original justification for the \ngrant of such sweeping authority--has subsided. Has the need to allow \none person, whether it is Secretary Paulson or Timothy Geithner, to \ngive away hundreds of billions of taxpayers' dollars to banks subsided \nas well? That is a question that needs to be asked, and that answer is \nyes.\n  I fully understand the severity of the ongoing financial crisis that \nerupted in this past year. I am fully aware of the need to take \nextraordinary actions in such situations. From the rescue of Bear \nStearns in March to the announcement of the bank equity purchase \nprogram in mid-October, to two bailouts for AIG, to hundreds of \nbillions extended to Citigroup, the U.S. Government has, indeed, \nundertaken extraordinary efforts to calm financial markets. However, it \nis clear to me and many of my colleagues that the Treasury accessing \nthe remaining $350 billion would do little to fix the recession we are \nin now.\n  It is time for the U.S. Government to cease announcements of new \nprograms or plans designed to inject confidence in markets. Moreover, I \nthink confidence would be better instilled by halting the announcement \nof new billion dollar programs designed to fix markets. I understand \nthe need to move in accordance with changing conditions. I simply think \nthe time has come to stop having the Government trying to fix markets. \nThe markets are going to have to fix themselves.\n  That is going to take some time. It is not going to be a pleasant \nprocess, but we are fooling ourselves if we think we can come up with \nsome easy shortcut to solving these problems.\n  One of the major causes of this crisis was the accumulation of far \ntoo much debt on the part of some financial institutions. The U.S. \nGovernment can make the same mistake. We are now anticipating an \nastounding $1.2 trillion deficit this year alone, and that is before \nany accounting of the roughly $800 billion stimulus proposal.\n  I can remember so many people in this body criticizing President Bush \non his deficits. If you take the total deficits in the Bush \nadministration and add them up and divide by 8, the years he has been \nin there, the average is $247 billion. Now we are looking at $1.1 \ntrillion.\n  This massive debt accumulation poses a serious threat to future \nstability and economic growth. We are on track to have a budget deficit \nthis year that exceeds the size of the entire Federal budget only a few \nyears ago. However, we can immediately make progress on reducing that \ndeficit amount by not releasing the $350 billion. That is something \nthat deserves sufficient debate.\n  Finally, as a fiscal conservative, the thing that concerns me about \nthe $700 billion bailout is it permanently changed the perception about \nwhat is ``big'' in big government from now on. What is another $50 \nbillion here or another $100 billion there, after we give $700 billion \nto banks? What is the big deal about a trillion dollar deficit or $800 \nbillion stimulus package or a multibillion health care proposal or \nwhatever plan is dreamed up around here to spend the taxpayer money on, \nonce we gave $700 billion to an unelected bureaucrat with no oversight. \nWe have simply lost our perspective. People now think that the amount \nhas changed.\n  I will close by noting the cost of the following defining events in \nthe 20th century, much our shared history, and compare them with the \n$700 billion bailout, to hopefully bring a little perspective to the \ndebate over the request for the second half of the $700 billion \nbailout.\n\n[[Page S282]]\n\n  The Marshall Plan was a long time ago, but if you bring it up-to-date \nthat would amount to $115 billion. This is after inflation. The race to \nthe Moon, $237 billion; the entire Korean war, $454 billion; the New \nDeal, $500 billion; the Vietnam war, $698 billion; and then 8 years in \nIraq, in the liberation of Iraq--people were complaining about how much \nmoney it cost--it is less than the $700 billion we are talking about \nhere.\n  We cannot put on fast track the remaining $350 billion in this \npackage. Congress is going to have to actively debate any further \nfunding.\n  What my legislation does, first of all, if we do not do anything at \nall, if we sit back and act like everything is fine and wait until the \nproposal comes to us, then the only thing we can do under the law we \npassed in October of this past year is to have a resolution of \ndisapproval.\n  If the leadership, if Senator Reid and the leadership decide we \nshould not have a vote on that, I am sure they will have procedural \nways to have this kept from having a vote, but even if there is a vote, \nthey would have that control. That doesn't do any good at all. The only \nway to do it is to pass this bill that says we cannot spend the last \n$350 billion until they come forth with a program, we evaluate it, we \ntake our prerogative as given to us in the Constitution and determine \nwhether this is a wise expenditure of these funds.\n  I hope I will have several others wanting to join S. 64. Who can \nargue with accountability?\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on President-elect \nObama's nomination of Eric Holder to be the Attorney General of the \nUnited States. It is nothing new in Washington for it to be said of a \nnominee that he or she is the best person for a job. That happens all \nthe time. We have all heard it. It will surprise no one in this room or \nelsewhere in Washington to know it is not always the case. But in this \ncase, for this appointment at this time, I believe it is true. I \nbelieve Eric Holder is the best person to be Attorney General of the \nUnited States.\n  It is hard to overstate the significance of the work of the \nDepartment of Justice to the American people.\n  It is hard to overstate how vital it is that the American people have \nconfidence in that Department, from the Attorney General down to the \nmost junior line attorney. It is hard to overstate the importance of \nour trust that this great Department makes decisions on the merits, \nproceeds on the facts and the evidence and the law, and carefully \nprotects itself from political interference.\n  The Bush administration has compromised the American peoples' faith \nin their Department of Justice by compromising the integrity of the \nDepartment at its highest levels. We need that back.\n  What we need now is an Attorney General who first, understands the \ninner workings of the Department so he can set the ship right; second, \nwill be fiercely independent and will make decisions based on the facts \nand the evidence and the law, not on politics or pressure from the \nWhite House; and third, has the temperament and experience to be strong \nand fair through all of the pressures that mount up on that office. \nEric Holder is the best possible person for this difficult job at this \ndifficult time.\n  We all know Mr. Holder's long and distinguished experience at the \nJustice Department and within the justice system. He has been a line \nattorney in the Public Integrity Section, prosecuting corrupt public \nofficials of both parties; he has been a judge nominated by President \nRonald Reagan; he has been the Deputy Attorney General, the No. 2 \nposition in the Department; he has been the U.S. attorney for the \nDistrict of Columbia; and he has been a highly regarded attorney in \nprivate practice. One would be hard pressed to find a more experienced \ncandidate. It is no surprise, then, that so many organizations and \nindividuals who work with the criminal justice system every day have \nendorsed Mr. Holder's nomination, including the National Fraternal \nOrder of Police, the National District Attorneys Association, the \nNational Association of Police Organizations, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the National Association of Assistant \nUnited States Attorneys, the National Center for Victims of Crime, the \nNational Organization for Victim Assistance, and Mothers Against Drunk \nDriving.\n  Mr. Holder's experience is unquestionable, but it is not only \nexperience that makes him the right person for this uniquely \nchallenging post. I know Eric Holder. When I was a U.S. attorney, he \nwas my colleague, as the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, \nand then my boss when he became Deputy Attorney General. I have great \npersonal confidence in him. In our work at the Department, the U.S. \nattorneys saw firsthand in Eric, over and over, the qualities of \ntemperament, intelligence, judgment, and independence that are \nessential for an Attorney General and especially for an Attorney \nGeneral who takes office during a time when the Department is in \ndistress.\n  As I know Eric Holder, so also do I know the damage and destruction \nthat was wrought by the Bush administration on our Department of \nJustice. In the Judiciary Committee, under the distinguished leadership \nof Chairman Patrick Leahy, we worked hard to find out what has been \ndone there and to bring it to light. My colleagues, Senator Schumer of \nNew York and Senator Feinstein of California, deserve particular credit \nin that struggle.\n  Because I had worked in the Department, I was familiar with many of \nthe institutions, the traditions and the practices of the Department \nthat have been cast aside or ignored. The result? The result was a \ndamaged institution, its reputation compromised, its integrity \nchallenged, and its morale sadly diminished. Now, more than anything \nelse, someone needs to put that right. Eric Holder has the knowledge, \nthe experience, and the character to do that.\n  I have listened with a great deal of interest to some of the things \nthat have been said in this Chamber about Eric Holder and his \ncharacter. Indeed, there has been a not-so-subtle effort to question \nwhether Mr. Holder is sufficiently independent of political influence \nto serve this Nation as our Attorney General. I cannot speak to the \nmotivations behind this effort, but I can say this: Eric Holder is a \nman who spent 12 years as a line prosecutor prosecuting corrupt \npoliticians of both parties. He is a man who was sufficiently \npolitically independent for President Ronald Reagan to nominate him as \na judge. This is a man who, as U.S. attorney for the District of \nColumbia, indicted and convicted Dan Rostenkowski, the Democratic \nchairman of the Ways and Means Committee, one of the most powerful men \nin Washington. This is a man who recommended to Attorney General Janet \nReno that she appoint an Independent Counsel to investigate President \nClinton's Secretary of the Interior, Bruce Babbitt. This is a man who \nadvised Attorney General Reno to expand the scope of the investigation \nby Kenneth Starr into the Monica Lewinsky affair investigation.\n  It is not just me with this confidence in Eric Holder and in his \nindependence, his character, his judgment, and his temperament. Let me \nread what former Attorney General William Barr, former Deputy Attorney \nGeneral James Comey, and former Federal Bureau of Investigation \nDirector Louis Freeh have said about him.\n  In a letter to Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Specter, Mr. Comey \nwrote this:\n\n       From my professional and personal association with Mr. \n     Holder, I believe him to be a man of strong character, and \n     first-class ability. I think he has the institutional \n     knowledge, humility, and integrity to be a fine Attorney \n     General.\n\n  My colleagues will remember that James Comey was the Deputy Attorney \nGeneral for Attorney General Ashcroft. He was the Acting Attorney \nGeneral at the time of that sickening raid by the White House Chief of \nStaff and White House Counsel Alberto Gonzales at the\n\n[[Page S283]]\n\nhospital bedside of stricken Attorney General Ashcroft. He is the man \nwho stood up against the warrantless wiretapping program and stopped it \nuntil it was brought right. He is the center, by all accounts, of what \nwould have been essentially the resignation of the attorneys at the top \nof the Department of Justice if the White House had not blinked and \nbacked down. This is a man who knows something about independence and \nintegrity, and he vouches for Eric Holder.\n  Louis Freeh, who was the Director of the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation, wrote this:\n\n       I am certain that Eric has the highest legal competence, \n     total integrity, leadership, and, most importantly, the \n     political independence to discharge faithfully the immense \n     trust this Nation reposes in its Attorney General . . . In \n     all of Eric's interactions with me as FBI Director, as well \n     as in his close coordination with my Deputy and other \n     Assistant Directors who also had extensive and sometimes \n     daily contact with him, Eric always displayed total \n     integrity, courageous leadership, complete fairness, and, \n     once again and most importantly, political independence.\n\n  Former Attorney General Bill Barr, former Deputy Attorney General \nGeorge Terwilliger, and others wrote that:\n\n       Mr. Holder's 30-year professional career has consistently \n     been characterized by unfailing integrity and a commitment to \n     political independence . . . Eric Holder is the right man at \n     the right time to protect our citizens in the critical years \n     ahead.\n\n  There is a powerful record behind Eric Holder of political \nindependence. The measure of independence is not whether you decide \nagainst the President or your party on every question, every time; the \nmeasure is whether you decide against the President or your party when \nthe facts and the law direct it. In my view, Eric Holder has met that \nstandard. And in the view of Republican Attorney General and Deputy \nAttorney Generals and people who have served with distinction and know \nhim well, they agree he has fully met that standard.\n  I take the Senate's role in the confirmation process very seriously. \nI believe the Judiciary Committee must and, under the leadership of \nChairman Leahy, will closely examine Mr. Holder's record and his \nqualifications. It is our duty. At the end of that process, I believe \nthe majority of colleagues will agree with me and with so many others \nthat Eric Holder is the right person at the right time to restore our \nDepartment of Justice to its rightful standing as the defender of what \nis good and what is honorable and what is true in our Nation.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding we are in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/12/senate-section/article/S283-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S283-S285]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ERIC HOLDER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, last month, President-elect Obama \ndesignated Eric Holder to be the next Attorney General of the United \nStates. When President-elect Obama made this choice, there was virtual \nuniversal praise from both sides of the aisle.\n  Republican Orrin Hatch of Utah, the former chair of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, said Eric Holder was ``an excellent choice,'' in \nhis words, and that ``I intend to support him.'' My colleague, Senator \nJeff Sessions of Alabama, said, ``I think his instincts on law and \norder are good'' and that he was ``disposed to support'' Eric Holder. \nSenator Tom Coburn of Oklahoma said: ``I think it's a good choice.''\n  It is not hard to see why the initial response to Eric Holder's \nselection was so positive. After all, Mr. Holder had been confirmed \nunanimously by the Senate in 1997 for the position of Deputy Attorney \nGeneral.\n  As the No. 2 person at the Justice Department, Mr. Holder supported \nbroadening the authority of independent counsel Ken Starr, a difficult \ndecision that was criticized by many Democrats. Mr. Starr's \ninvestigation led to the impeachment of President Clinton. And Mr. \nHolder recommended the appointment of a special prosecutor to \ninvestigate Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, a member of President \nClinton's Cabinet.\n  Earlier in his career, Eric Holder had been appointed by President \nRonald Reagan to serve as a judge. He was later appointed by President \nClinton to be the U.S. attorney in Washington, DC. In that position, he \nearned a reputation for independence. He prosecuted public officials of \nboth political parties during the 12 years he served as a career \nprosecutor in the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section.\n  So it is no wonder Mr. Holder's nomination to serve as Attorney \nGeneral was met initially with strong bipartisan praise.\n  Unfortunately, some Senators are now questioning the character of \nEric Holder. What has happened? Why the change? Why the initial \npositive reaction of a man who has served as a prosecutor, as a judge, \nas the No. 2 man in the Department of Justice, someone who has faced \nthousands of decisions, a person who was first appointed under a \nRepublican President, then a Democratic President? Why this change?\n  Well, it is attributable in part to someone who has surfaced again on \nthe American political scene and has been very vocal in his criticism \nof Eric Holder. That person is Karl Rove. I am sure we all recall Karl \nRove. He used to be President Bush's top political strategist. Today he \nworks as a high-priced political consultant.\n  In a TV interview last month, Mr. Rove called Eric Holder ``the one \ncontroversial nominee'' among President-elect Obama's Cabinet choices. \nA Washington Post reporter who had been covering the Holder nomination \nsaid in an interview:\n\n       Word on the street is that Karl Rove is going to be helping \n     lead the fight against Eric Holder when his nomination for \n     Attorney General heads up to the Senate.\n\n  That is unfortunate. I am confident, however, that at the end of the \nday, when Eric Holder comes before the Senate Judiciary Committee this \nweek for his nomination hearing, he will answer the questions directly \nand show the Senate and the American people that he is an excellent \nchoice to be our next Attorney General.\n  I met with Eric Holder in my office last month. I had similar \nmeetings with President Bush's Attorney General nominees: Michael \nMukasey, Alberto Gonzales, and John Ashcroft.\n  In my meetings with all four of these nominees, I asked each of them \nabout their views on issues that were central to the mission of the \nDepartment of Justice. I asked them about a variety of different \nissues: human rights, civil rights, civil liberties, national security, \nand access to justice. I tried to take the measure of each man, and to \ngain a sense of whether they would have the independence and integrity \nfor the job.\n  In my opinion, Eric Holder stood head and shoulders above the others. \nLet's take one example, but a critically important example, the issue \nof torture.\n  The late historian Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., said this about the \ntorture policy of the Bush administration:\n\n       No position taken has done more damage to the American \n     reputation in the world--ever.\n\n  Historian Schlesinger, of course, has written about the American \nhistory of the 19th and 20th centuries, and I think he understood as \nmuch if not more than others that some of the graphic scenes and \ndetails of torture under the Bush administration have created, \nunfortunately, sad memories among people across the world.\n  Sadly, that policy of torture was aided and abetted by the last two \nAttorneys General. Instead of defending the rule of law, the Bush \nadministration's Justice Department set aside our treaty obligations \nand redefined torture with evasive words and with a wink and a nod.\n\n  During his confirmation hearings, Gonzales told me it was legally \npermissible for the United States of America to subject detainees to \ncruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. But cruel, inhuman, and \ndegrading treatment are clearly prohibited by the Torture Convention, a \ntreaty we ratified and are bound to obey.\n\n[[Page S284]]\n\n  I drafted legislation to overturn this Bush administration policy and \nmake it clear that cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment is prohibited \nin all circumstances. I will tell my colleagues that my bill did not \npass, but a virtually identical bill introduced by Senator John McCain, \nwhich I was proud to cosponsor, did pass overwhelmingly. It was obvious \nthat Senator McCain was the right person to carry this issue. His \nexperience as a detainee and prisoner of war during the Vietnam \nconflict gave him more credence on this issue than anybody else on the \nSenate floor. He stood and spoke not only for the American people but \nfor a great tradition in American law. He was criticized and there were \nobjections from Vice President Cheney and others, but Senator McCain's \nposition prevailed in the Senate.\n  After Alberto Gonzales departed as Attorney General under a cloud of \nscandal, I had hoped that the Justice Department would be able to turn \na new page with the nomination of Michael Mukasey. He had served as a \nFederal district court judge. He was an accomplished attorney. He was \nsomeone who I thought came to this job with the capacity to put \nperspective on some of the most contentious issues. During his \nconfirmation hearing on the second day, I asked Mr. Mukasey a simple, \nstraightforward question: Is the torture technique known as \nwaterboarding legal?\n  Now, waterboarding is a torture technique that was used as long ago \nas the Spanish Inquisition in the 15th century. Following World War II, \nthe United States prosecuted Japanese military personnel as war \ncriminals when they were accused of waterboarding U.S. prisoners. The \nJudge Advocates General, the highest ranking lawyers in the U.S. \nmilitary, told me and testified unequivocally that waterboarding was \nillegal. But Mr. Mukasey, at his confirmation hearing for Attorney \nGeneral, refused to answer my question and to this day still refuses to \nacknowledge that waterboarding is torture.\n  President-elect Barack Obama has made it clear that he will reclaim \nAmerica's role as champion and defender of fundamental human rights. He \nsaid--and I quote my former Senate colleague, President-elect Obama:\n\n       No administration should allow the use of torture, \n     including so-called `enhanced interrogation techniques' like \n     water-boarding, head-slapping, and extreme temperatures. It's \n     time that we had a Department of Justice that upholds the \n     rule of law and American values, instead of finding ways to \n     enable the President to subvert them. No more political \n     parsing or legal loopholes.\n\n  I believe Eric Holder will fulfill the President-elect's commitment. \nWhen I met with Mr. Holder, I asked him the same simple question I had \nasked Michael Mukasey: Is waterboarding illegal? Without hesitation, \nMr. Holder looked me straight in the eye and said--and I quote--\n``Senator, waterboarding is torture.''\n  After hours of questioning Michael Mukasey on that simple, obvious \nfact when he refused to answer straightforwardly, here we have a \nnominee for Attorney General who has made it clear that America is \ngoing to return to the values we have held dear for generations, and I \nthink returning to those values will help restore our position and \ncredence in the world.\n  Indeed, Mr. Holder has spoken out repeatedly about this issue--not \njust in meeting with me privately. For example, last June in a speech \nbefore the American Constitution Society he said:\n\n       Our needlessly abusive and unlawful practices in the ``war \n     on terror'' have diminished our standing in the world \n     community and made us less, rather than more, safe.\n\n  Alberto Gonzales, the former Attorney General, said the United States \ncould engage in cruel, inhuman, and degrading treatment. Listen to what \nEric Holder said during his speech to the American Constitution \nSociety:\n\n       We must declare without qualification that it is the law, \n     policy, and practice of the United States Government that we \n     do not torture people and we do not subject people to cruel, \n     inhuman, or degrading treatment.\n\n  What a stark contrast from the evasive words we heard from Alberto \nGonzales and the refusal of Attorney General Michael Mukasey to address \nthis issue directly.\n  I can assure my colleagues that Eric Holder will bring about a \nwelcome change in the Department of Justice and a welcome change that \nour Nation is anxious to see. He possesses the experience, the wisdom, \nand the integrity to be an outstanding Attorney General. He is a leader \nwho can rebuild the morale within the Justice Department and restore \nfaith among the American people in this important agency. We all \nremember that chapter in the history of the Department of Justice when \nso many U.S. attorneys were unceremoniously dismissed from their \npositions, many of whom had never had any criticism leveled at them for \ntheir professional work. Questions have been raised over and over as to \nwhether this was just a political move or what. The fact is, I am sure \nit took its toll on the morale of the department. We have a chance with \nEric Holder to restore it. It is critical because without faith in our \nsystem of justice, our democracy is in danger.\n  I wish to address one final matter that some of my Republican \ncolleagues have talked about: the pardon of Marc Rich in the closing \ndays of the Clinton administration. In January of 2001 President \nClinton issued a pardon for Marc Rich, who had been convicted of tax \nevasion and who had fled the country. Presidents have the power to \nissue pardons and commutations, and they seek the advice of the Justice \nDepartment on which requests to grant and which to reject. On January \n19, 2001, the last full day of the Clinton Presidency, the White House \ncalled Eric Holder at the Justice Department to ask him his opinion \nabout Marc Rich. Without spending much time examining the pardon \nrequest, Eric Holder indicated he did not oppose it.\n  In retrospect, when I asked him directly in my office, Mr. Holder \nadmitted that comment was a mistake. He acknowledged that the Rich \npardon should not have been granted and that he should have sought the \ninput of other Justice Department officials about this recommendation. \nIt was a lapse in judgment, and Mr. Holder has openly acknowledged it.\n  Now, many of us who have spoken out on the Senate floor have \noccasionally said things we wish we hadn't said. We are, as a matter of \ncourse, given permission to revise and extend our remarks if we make a \nmistake, but it is rare in public life. Senators do it, Congressmen do \nit, and occasionally elected officials do it--to just say flat out, ``I \nmade a mistake.'' Eric Holder has been open and honest about that. I \nvalue that. In the thousands of decisions he faced as the No. 2 man in \nthe Justice Department, there are only a handful that have even raised \na question, and he has been open and honest in saying that this was not \nthe right thing to do.\n  There is probably no one in America more disappointed by that pardon \nof Marc Rich than the man who prosecuted him, James Comey. You may \nremember Mr. Comey; I sure do. He is a Republican who served for a few \nyears as the Deputy Attorney General at the Justice Department under \nJohn Ashcroft. He was the one who stood up to President Bush and \nrefused to authorize the President's secret surveillance program during \nthe critical period when John Ashcroft was hospitalized and Mr. Comey \nserved briefly as the Acting Attorney General. Earlier in his career as \nan assistant U.S. attorney in New York, Mr. Comey was the prosecutor in \ncharge of the Marc Rich case. He knows the case better than any of us. \nHe strongly opposed the pardon of Marc Rich by President Bill Clinton, \nas did his colleagues in the U.S. Attorney's Office in New York. \nHowever, Mr. Comey sent a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee a \nfew weeks ago in support of the nomination of Eric Holder. I wish to \nread from it. He said:\n\n       I have come to believe that Mr. Holder's role in the Rich \n     and [co-defendant Pincus] Green pardons was a huge \n     misjudgment--\n\n  Mr. Comey wrote to the committee--\n\n     one for which he has, appropriately, paid dearly in \n     reputation.\n\n  Mr. Comey went on to say:\n\n       Yet I hope very much he is confirmed. I know a lot of good \n     people who have made significant mistakes. I think Mr. \n     Holder's may actually make him a better steward of the \n     Department of Justice because he has learned a hard lesson \n     about protecting the integrity of that great institution from \n     political fixers. I'm not suggesting errors of judgment are \n     qualification for high office, but in this case, where the \n     nominee is a smart, decent, humble man who knows and loves \n     the department and has demonstrated his commitment to the \n     rule of law across an\n\n[[Page S285]]\n\n     entire career, the error should not disqualify him. Eric \n     Holder should be confirmed as Attorney General.\n\n  That statement of support is from James Comey, a Republican, and the \nchief prosecutor of Marc Rich who was entrusted with major \nresponsibilities in the Department of Justice under President Bush. He \nis a man who knows that Department very well.\n  Mr. Comey's opinion is also shared by Larry Thompson, another \nprominent Republican who served for several years as Deputy Attorney \nGeneral under President Bush. Mr. Thompson had this to say about Eric \nHolder and the Rich pardon:\n\n       There's no way you can have a high-profile job in \n     Washington like the deputy attorney general without \n     attracting some kind of controversy. That matter has been \n     fully investigated, and it should be put behind him.\n\n  Let me also read the statement of another high-profile Republican, Ed \nRogers, who served in two Republican White Houses. Mr. Rogers said:\n\n       Under the Constitution, the President's authority to pardon \n     is unlimited. There was no deceit or malfeasance by Holder. \n     Everyone knows this was Bill Clinton's initiative. Eric \n     Holder is innocent.\n\n  Then he added:\n\n     the Rich pardon is no bar to Eric Holder being an effective \n     Attorney General--even though we Republicans and some in the \n     media will enjoy rehashing it.\n\n  You can question Eric Holder's judgment in the Marc Rich case, but \nyou can't question his integrity, his independence, and his character.\n  A few days ago the Senate Judiciary Committee received a letter of \nsupport for Eric Holder from 10 prominent Republican lawyers, including \nformer Attorney General William Barr and former chief counsel to \nSenator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania, Michael O'Neill. This is what \nthe letter said:\n\n       Due to his character and experience, Eric today enjoys the \n     endorsement of literally thousands of law enforcement \n     officials from across the country, including NAPO (the \n     National Association of Police Organizations), NDAA (National \n     District Attorneys Association), PERF (Police Executive \n     Research Forum), NSA (National Sheriffs' Association), NAAUSA \n     (National Association of Assistant U.S. Attorneys), and NOBLE \n     (National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives). \n     . . . As former federal prosecutors and senior officials of \n     the Department of Justice we are profoundly aware of the \n     challenges that the Department and the country are facing. \n     Eric Holder is the right man at the right time to protect our \n     citizens in the critical years ahead.\n\n  It is worth noting that Eric Holder also has the public support of \nformer FBI Director Louie Freeh, as well as the National Fraternal \nOrder of Police, which is the world's largest organization of sworn law \nenforcement officers.\n  One final point: Eric Holder is a historic selection. If confirmed, \nhe would be the first African-American Attorney General in our Nation's \nhistory. When I was growing up, there were laws in some States that \nprevented African Americans from drinking out of the same water \nfountains as Whites, attending the same schools, and using the same \nrestrooms, restaurants, swimming pools, and other public \naccommodations. It is one more measure of how far America has come that \nwe now have a chance to confirm a distinguished African American to be \nthe top law enforcement officer in America.\n  After 8 years of the Justice Department trampling the Constitution \nand often putting politics over principle, we now have a chance to \nconfirm a nominee with strong bipartisan support who can restore the \nJustice Department to its rightful role as the protector of our laws \nand renew America's faith in our system of justice.\n  This week, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which the \nPresiding Officer also serves--we will have an opportunity to ask \nquestions of Mr. Holder. I will be asking him many of the same \nquestions I have asked of former Senator Ashcroft, Mr. Gonzales, and \nMr. Mukasey.\n  The answers, I am sure, will be significantly different, showing that \nwe are about to launch a significant change in America, a change which \nthe American people voted for overwhelmingly in November and a change \nthat will be carried forward in a very positive way at the Department \nof Justice by Eric Holder as our next Attorney General.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/12/senate-section/article/S285-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S285-S287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MITCH McCONNELL\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President. I rise today to honor my good friend Mitch \nMcConnell, the Senate minority leader whose strong leadership, sterling \nexample and wise counsel have earned him an honored position within the \nranks of the extraordinary public servants who now serve or have served \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  Senator McConnell is the second Kentuckian to lead his party in the \nU.S. Senate, the first being Senator Alben Barkley, who led Senate \nDemocrats from 1937 to 1949. Mitch is now the longest-serving \nRepublican Senator in Kentucky history, eclipsing the previous record \nheld by the legendary Senator John Sherman Cooper.\n  Today, Senator McConnell has been serving as a U.S. Senator for \nalmost a quarter century. During that time, four U.S. Presidents, \nscores of colleagues, and several crises have come and gone, but Mitch \nhas carried on with courage, boldness and steadfastness. He has \nweathered the most turbulent political seas and has always been a \ncalming influence on his Senate colleagues while at the helm.\n  Few would have predicted that Senator McConnell would have such \nstaying power when he was first elected to the Senate in 1984 by a \nrazor-thin margin--less than half a percentage point. But political \npundits and prognosticators often only skim the surface or state the \nobvious and give short shrift to the characteristics that matter most \nin the making of an outstanding leader.\n  In other words, they didn't really know Mitch McConnell. They didn't \nknow about how he overcame polio at age 2, undergoing an intensive \ntherapy regimen at the Roosevelt Warm Springs Institute for \nRehabilitation and obeying doctors' orders not to walk or run for 2 \nyears. That took determination, and Mitch showed that early on.\n  Senator McConnell's service to his State and Nation is as varied as \nit is impressive. After serving as a student body president and \ngraduating with honors at the University of Louisville College of Arts \nand Sciences in 1964, he went on to law school at the University of \nKentucky, where he was elected president of the Student Bar Association \nand earned a law degree.\n  He followed that by working as an intern for Senator John Sherman \nCooper and as a chief legislative assistant to Senator Marlow Cook, \nwhich provided him with invaluable experience in Washington, DC. Other \nstints followed: He was deputy attorney general under President Gerald \nR. Ford and a county judge-executive in Kentucky until he was sworn in \nas a U.S. Senator on Jan. 3, 1985.\n  In whatever position Senator McConnell has served, he has unfailingly \nserved with distinction. I have had the good fortune of working with \nMitch for years, dating back to his election as a freshman Senator, \nwhen he became the first Republican to win a statewide race in Kentucky \nsince 1968. In fact, Mitch was the only Republican in the Nation in \n1984 to defeat a Democrat incumbent.\n  To his considerable credit, Mitch has been defying the odds ever \nsince. For example, during his tenure as chairman of the National \nRepublican Senatorial Committee during the late 1990s and early 2000s, \nthe Republicans controlled the Senate--in large part due to his \nleadership.\n  Mitch McConnell is a conservative's conservative who gets high marks \nfrom the American Conservative Union and all who know him. Moreover, he \nis a scholar and able defender of the Constitution and this great \ncountry. Knowing just how deadly terrorists can be, he is deadly \nserious about protecting America. He also is an outspoken advocate of \nthe first amendment and a tremendous parliamentary tactician. When \nMitch McConnell talks, people listen and pay heed--almost always with \nexcellent results.\n  As good a Senator as Mitch is, he is an even better man--one who \nplaces principals above partisanship. His love for his State and our \nNation is second to none. He also is loyal, honest and unflappable, \nwhich explains why he is held in such high esteem by his Senate \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  Mitch is a devoted family man. He is the proud father of three \nbeautiful daughters and the loving husband of outgoing U.S. Secretary \nof Labor Elaine Chao. And he is utterly devoted to the people of \nKentucky he so ably\n\n[[Page S286]]\n\nrepresents and honors with his stellar service.\n  At this time, I wish my colleague and dear friend success, health and \nhappiness as he continues his leadership and service in the 111th \nCongress. I am grateful for the opportunity I have had to work with him \nover the years and look forward to continuing to serve together in \ntackling the tremendous challenges confronting our great Nation.\n  I honor him and his wife Elaine for their service and sacrifices and \nask for God's blessings on them both. both.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, this is a day for all Kentuckians and \nAmericans to celebrate the man I proudly call my best friend in the \nSenate.\n  Today we mark an historic occasion for the Commonwealth of Kentucky \nand the Senate, as my colleague, my friend, and my party's leader, \nMitch McConnell, becomes the longest serving Senator in Kentucky \nhistory.\n  Back in 1984, when Mitch first won election to this Chamber by just \nover 5,000 out of over 1.2 million votes cast, some may have doubted \nthat the Jefferson County judge executive and newly-elected Senator \nwould go on to become the leader and statesman he is today. But some of \nus had little doubt.\n  It was easy to tell Mitch was special from the beginning. In 1984, he \nwas the only Republican challenger in the country to defeat a \nDemocratic incumbent in a Senate race. In Kentucky he was also the \nfirst Republican to win a statewide race since 1968.\n  Mitch went on to prove that his initial victory was not just luck. \nSome of my friends may not know what a prominent role Mitch has played \nin Kentucky's political history. He has helped to build the thriving \ntwo-party political system that Kentucky has today.\n  Mitch worked with the focused determination that is his trademark \nhere in the Senate and aggressively recruited Republican candidates at \nevery level throughout the State. He made his case to the people of \nKentucky, explaining his philosophy and his mission.\n  As a Republican, he was certainly swimming upstream at first. But \nover time, the people responded.\n  Twenty-four years later, he remains as popular as ever back home. \nLast November, Kentuckians elected him to a record fifth term and \nawarded him nearly 1 million votes the most ever won by a Kentuckian in \na statewide race.\n  And why shouldn't Kentucky continue to send Mitch McConnell to our \nNation's Capital to fight for them? Look at all he has accomplished on \ntheir behalf.\n  No. 1 on the list is his effort to pass the tobacco buyout one of the \nmost significant events in the agricultural history of Kentucky. I \ncan't stress enough that the tobacco buyout, passed in 2004, has helped \nthe livelihoods of tens of thousands of Kentucky tobacco farmers, their \nfamilies, and the many towns and communities in which they lived. The \ntobacco buyout will inject $2.5 billion into Kentucky over 10 years to \ntobacco quota holders and growers, allowing them to transition to other \ncrops, continue the farming way of life, and provide for their \nfamilies. After many obstacles and years of frustration, I was proud to \nwork closely with Mitch on this effort to sign the buyout into law. \nMany thought it couldn't be done. But we knew it could.\n  Then there are the millions of Kentuckians who have benefited from \nMitch's work to strengthen higher education. I know firsthand his \ndedication to Kentucky's universities. He understands that by improving \nthem, we not only help students but entire communities by developing \njobs and building a better workforce.\n  During his time in the Senate, he has secured over $320 million for \nresearch and infrastructure in Kentucky's universities. And I know he \nis not finished yet, as that remains one of his highest priorities.\n  All of us on this side of the aisle recognized Mitch's ability, and \nwe have unanimously chosen him to be the Republican leader.\n  Leading the Senate is like herding cats. Senators are not the kind of \npeople who are easily led. We are all used to leading ourselves.\n  It takes a special kind of man to lead all these class-president \ntypes, to balance the different personalities and issues that can come \nout of our conference. It takes vision and clarity to be able to define \nour principles and our mission, to codify them in a way that every \nMember can get on board, and to communicate them to our colleagues and \nthe country. And it takes considerable wisdom to maneuver past the many \nlegislative obstacles and parliamentary land mines that lay in wait in \nthe Senate. Mitch McConnell is the right man for the job, and I am \nproud of him as he continues to lead our party in the Senate.\n  And Kentucky is proud of him, too, as only the second Kentuckian in \nhistory and the first in over half a century to become a Senate floor \nleader. In that role, he is able to do even more for Kentucky.\n  Mitch has graced this Senate with his leadership, commitment to \nprinciple, and his trademark determination for 24 years now 8,775 days, \nto be exact. He is now Kentucky's longest serving Senator.\n  On a personal note, I want to say that I couldn't ask for a better \npartner in my work to improve our State. Mary and I will always be \nthankful for his friendship and that of his wife, our great Secretary \nof Labor, Elaine Chao.\n  Kentuckians could not have a better Senator fighting on their behalf. \nOur State is lucky to have him, and so is this Senate. I congratulate \nhim on reaching this very significant milestone.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleagues in celebrating \nthis remarkable achievement of our dear friend, the senior Senator from \nKentucky and the minority leader of the Senate, Senator McConnell. And \nI apologize that I wasn't able to join the rest of my colleagues in \ntheir tribute earlier.\n  Twenty-four years is a long time in politics and in the case of my \nfriend from Kentucky, it is historic.\n  But as someone who sits at the desk his father did before him--who \ntreasures this institution--I know there is a difference between the \nlength of our service and the quality of our service. And let there be \nno doubt that throughout his two-and-a-half decades here, Senator \nMcConnell has tirelessly dedicated himself to the latter.\n  My friend and I may not agree on everything. But we both realize the \nextraordinary privilege and opportunity this is.\n  When this institution works, it works because of people like Mitch \nMcConnell.\n  Having served with him for the past 24 years and during our time at \nthe Rules Committee, I had the privilege of seeing my colleague's \nremarkable talent very closely.\n  Everyone in this Chamber knows how difficult the moment was after the \nPresidential election in 2000. The country was terribly divided along \npartisan lines and feelings in this institution were raw.\n  As chair and ranking member of Rules, the responsibility fell to \nSenator McConnell and me to count the electoral votes--typically a \nceremonial duty but one fraught with tension in the wake of the closest \nPresidential election in American history.\n  We would soon oversee together President Bush's first inaugural as \nwell.\n  That we were able to get back to business in such short order was a \ntribute to Mitch McConnell's temperament and commitment to this \ninstitution.\n  And there was some very important business to be done--not the least \nof which was reforming our nation's voting laws to ensure there \nwouldn't be a repeat of Florida ever again. Together, and over a series \nof months, he and I wrote the Helping America Vote Act.\n  It was a difficult, delicate process--but the hard work paid off.\n  Civil rights hero John Lewis called HAVA the most important voting \nrights law since the Voting Rights Act passed in 1965. In part because \nof Senator McConnell's commitment to working together--to working \nthrough difficult issues instead of setting them aside--today Americans \nhave more confidence in their right to vote privately and \nindependently.\n  We also managed the McCain-Feingold bill to reform our campaign \nfinance laws on the floor of the Senate--another challenge that took \nconsiderable effort on the part of Democrats and Republicans to work \ntogether. To set aside those differences and focus on what was at \nstake.\n\n[[Page S287]]\n\n  Senator McConnell did not support the McCain-Feingold bill in the \nend. But he was passionate about there being a fair process.\n  As another Kentucky son once said, Justice Louis Brandeis, ``We are \nnot won by arguments that we can analyze, but by tone and temper--by \nthe manner, which is the man himself.''\n  To me, that is Mitch McConnell--a conservative to the marrow but \nsomeone who has never forgotten why we come here:\n  To make a difference.\n  So I congratulate my colleague and his family for reaching this \nremarkable milestone. May you continue to expand on it for many years \nto come. Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/12/senate-section/article/S287-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume the motion to proceed to S. 22, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 22) to designate certain land as components of \n     the National Wilderness Preservation System, to authorize \n     certain programs and activities in the Department of the \n     Interior and the Department of Agriculture, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 10 minutes. I have conferred with the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. \nCoburn, who was scheduled to speak first. That is satisfactory with \nhim. I further ask unanimous consent that Senator Coburn be recognized \nat the conclusion of my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania is recognized.\n\n\n                        Report on Foreign Travel\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to speak \nbriefly about foreign travel which I undertook over the past recess, \nfocusing principally on the Mideast and on Europe.\n  My group arrived in Jerusalem on December 26, late in the evening on \nFriday. The next day, the hostilities arose in Gaza. I had an occasion \nto discuss this matter with a number of officials in Israel and also \nwith Prime Minister Fayyad of the Palestinian Authority.\n  As is well known from the news reports, the Israeli action was taken \nin response to shelling by Hamas on Israel over a protracted period of \ntime. Israel's action was legal under international law, Article 51 of \nthe United Nations charter which expressly recognizes the right of \nself-defense under circumstances where a nation is attacked. And that \nwas the factual matter there. In speaking to Israeli President Peres \nand Israeli Prime Minister Olmert, the point was made that Israel was \ntaking this action only as a last resort to protect Israeli citizens.\n  It is highly significant that the Palestinian Authority, which has \nhad its differences with Hamas, has backed the Israeli position. We had \na discussion with Palestinian Authority Prime Minister Fayyad, who said \nthat the Palestinian Authority was convinced that Israel had acted \nproperly and that the Palestinian Authority would do what it could to \nmaintain quiet within the Palestinian Authority's jurisdiction in the \nface of any demonstrations which might occur.\n  It is worth noting that Egypt has backed the Israeli action, noting \nthe aggressive stand taken by Hamas, and Saudi Arabia, too, has noted \nHamas's inappropriate conduct.\n  We visited in Vienna with Ambassador Schulte and discussed at some \nlength the International Atomic Energy Agency efforts to conduct \ninspections on what is going on in Iran with respect to any efforts by \nIran to create a nuclear weapon.\n  A year ago, I had an opportunity to meet with IAEA Director Mohamed \nElBaradei. He was out of town when we were there. I had a conversation \nwith him by telephone on the issue of the efforts by the IAEA to \nconduct the inspections and that at the moment Iran is not cooperating \nand, further, international action needs to be taken to be sure Iran \ndoes meet its obligations under international agreements and that there \nare adequate safeguards to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear \nweapon.\n  When we were in Syria, Iran's activities on that subject were \ndiscussed with Syrian President Bashar al-Asad. On the Iranian subject, \nPresident Asad urged that action be taken to try to get the \ninspections, and that would be a more productive line than challenging \nwhatever rights Iran had asserted.\n  In our discussions with President Asad, the subject of a potential \nIsrael-Syria peace treaty was discussed. The Syrians have made it plain \nthat they are interested in a return of the Golan Heights. Only Israel \ncan decide for itself whether it is willing to give up the Golan with \nrespect to whatever strategic advantage the Golan may have. Obviously, \nit is a different world strategically today than it was in 1967 when \nIsrael captured the Golan Heights.\n  It is my view that there could be substantial advantages for Israel \nin terms of Syrian concessions in a number of directions to leave \nLebanon as a sovereign nation without efforts to destabilize Lebanon \nbut withdrawing any Syrian support from Hezbollah and also from Hamas. \nWhen we discussed with President Asad the issue of Hezbollah and Hamas, \nhe said if the Palestinian issue could be resolved, those other matters \nwould fall into place.\n  There is also the potential advantage of trying to move Syria away \nfrom the influence of Iran. That is not an easy matter. But if there \nwere to be an Israeli-Syrian peace treaty--and I think that can happen \nonly with the participation of the United States--the prospect would be \npresent of improving that situation of trying to separate Syria from \nIran.\n  In Brussels, we had a meeting with General Craddock, who is the NATO \ncommander there. We discussed a variety of subjects, as described in a \nmore extensive report that I will ask to have printed in the Record.\n  With respect to our discussions with General Craddock, the key point \nwas the issue of what is going on in Afghanistan. General Craddock made \nthe point that there cannot be a military victory in Afghanistan but \nthe military can be successful in securing the situation, that there \nwill have to be improvements in the Afghanistan Government in dealing \nwith the people of Afghanistan. General Craddock commented that he \nthought it would be a protracted period of time where we would have to \nhave substantial NATO forces, in addition to those provided by the \nUnited States, to find a resolution of the issues in Afghanistan.\n  I was accompanied on my trip by my legislative director, Chris \nBradish, my military escort, Phil Skuta, and by Dr. Ronald Smith, all \nof whom did an excellent job. A very comprehensive trip report has been \nprepared by Mr. Bradish. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord, as if stated in full on the floor, the trip report.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Report on Foreign Travel\n\n       Mr. President, as is my custom, when I return from foreign \n     travel, I file a report with the Senate.\n       From December 25, 2008 to January 5, 2009, I traveled to \n     the United Kingdom, Israel, Syria, Austria, Belgium, Norway, \n     and Iceland. I was accompanied by my wife, Joan, my \n     Legislative Director, Chris Bradish, my military escort, Phil \n     Skuta, Colonel, USMC, and Dr. Ronald Smith, Captain, USN.\n\n\n                                 ISRAEL\n\n       I departed the United States on December 25th and made a \n     brief stop in London en route to Israel. We arrived in Israel \n     on the evening of December 26th. This was my twenty-sixth \n     visit to Israel since joining the Senate in 1981. Almost \n     exactly a year after my previous visit to Israel, the \n     domestic political landscape had changed significantly. Prime \n     Minister Ehud Olmert tendered his resignation on September \n     21, 2008, and general elections are set for February 10, \n     2009. One of the major questions being posed to the major \n     parties is how best to approach the peace process.\n       A 6-month truce between Israel and Hamas ended on December \n     19, 2008. United Nations data showed that fewer rockets were \n     fired at Israeli towns in the initial few months following \n     the onset of the truce on June 19, 2008. The New York Times \n     reported on December 19 that, ``more than 300 rockets were\n\n[[Page S288]]\n\n     fired into Israel in May [2008], 10 to 20 were fired in July. \n     . . . In August, 10 to 30 were fired, and in September, 5 to \n     10.'' However, as reported by The Washington Post on December \n     23, 2008, Israeli towns were faced with an increasing barrage \n     of fire as the truce neared its end: ``[H]undreds of rockets \n     and mortar shells . . . have been fired at Israel in the past \n     month.''\n       The day after my arrival, Israel launched air strikes on \n     Gaza in response to the rocket attacks by Hamas.\n       The rockets launched from Gaza as well as those from \n     Hezbollah pose a major threat to Israel's security. To \n     counter this threat, I have long supported full funding for \n     the Arrow Anti-Missile System, the David's Sling Weapon \n     System, and the Counter Terrorism Technical Support Working \n     Group. During my tenure, I have worked to secure more than 80 \n     billion for Israel, to include $1.4 billion for the Arrow \n     Anti-Missile System.\n       On December 28th, I had a working breakfast with the U.S. \n     Ambassador to Israel, James Cunningham. It is worth noting \n     that Ambassador Cunningham is a product of Allentown, \n     Pennsylvania. Ambassador Cunningham's prior posts, notably at \n     the United Nations, provided him a broad experience in \n     dealing with many of the regional players. He briefed me on \n     the situation in Gaza, the upcoming elections in Israel, \n     Iran's influence in the region, and the prospects for peace \n     agreements with Syria and the Palestinians.\n       Following our meeting we departed for Beit Hanassi to see \n     President Shimon Peres. He updated me on the Gaza situation \n     and stated, ``We didn't do it with great pleasure. We didn't \n     have any choice.''\n       I asked if negotiations on a peace agreement could come to \n     fruition with the Palestinian Authority with Hamas in the \n     position it is in. Peres believed it was possible. We \n     discussed the four outstanding issues that need to be \n     addressed to achieve an agreement: security, borders, \n     refugees and Jerusalem.\n       When asked about the prospect for an agreement with Syria, \n     President Peres did not express enthusiasm, citing Syria's \n     troubling alliance with Iran and the concern that Damascus \n     may not be sufficiently interested in a peace agreement. He \n     stated that Syria cannot have Lebanon and the Golan at the \n     same time.\n       I asked the President about what can be done on the Iran \n     front. His best advice was to keep the price of oil low as \n     that will generate lower revenues for Tehran. Broader energy \n     independence is critical. Peres stated, ``Kill the oil, kill \n     your enemies . . . . Oil produces pollution and craziness . . \n     . . don't shoot at mosquitoes, dry the swamp.'' Peres advised \n     us not to deal with Tehran until after Iran's May elections.\n       I have pushed for greater consideration of the Russian \n     proposal to enrich Iran's uranium. President Peres indicated \n     that there is a broader opportunity for the U.S. to engage \n     Russia. He indicated Russia is concerned about American's \n     missile defense activities in Europe and regional hegemony. \n     He suggested using missile defense as an avenue to turn the \n     U.S.-Russian problem into cooperation against Iran.\n       Peres shared with me his views on future economic issues \n     and stated there will be five great industries: energy, \n     water, stem cells, homeland security and education. I asked \n     what Israel hoped for in the new U.S. President. Peres \n     replied that he wanted him to be a great President for the \n     United States.\n       On the afternoon of December 28th, I met with Prime \n     Minister Ehud Olmert. I asked Olmert where Israel and Syria \n     stood on their proximity talks. He said they chose the Turks \n     as mediators because they are good liaisons who are trusted \n     by both sides. Olmert said there had been four rounds in \n     which the issues to be discussed in a potential dialogue were \n     presented such as borders, terrorism and Iran. He said of \n     Syrian President Assad, ``I know what he wants from me and he \n     knows what I want from him.''\n       He expressed disappointment that Syria did not provide \n     clear signals that they were willing to acknowledge what \n     Israel wanted. It was his view that Syria was waiting for a \n     new U.S. President to assume office before seriously \n     engaging. Nonetheless, he said he was committed to carrying \n     out the process.\n       I asked the Prime Minister if Iran knows how dangerous it \n     is for them to obtain a military nuclear capability. He \n     replied, ``Iran feels the weakness of America.'' He suggested \n     the U.S. apply more pressure on Iran by ending business and \n     commerce exchanges, particularly from the European Union. \n     Olmert believes that there are plenty of options between the \n     extremes of doing nothing and utilizing military force. On \n     the question of when to engage Tehran, Olmert's view differed \n     from Peres': ``The sooner the better.''\n       Following my meeting with the Prime Minister, I traveled to \n     our consul general's residence for a briefing on Israeli-\n     Palestinian relations and an update on the Gaza situation. \n     The recent reports indicated there were 280 dead and 600 \n     injured--a figure that would climb. He stated there were \n     demonstrations across the Arab world and clashes in Hebron \n     and the West Bank.\n       We discussed concerns over the potential for a humanitarian \n     crisis in Gaza. The consul general informed me that Israel \n     had provided 40 truckloads of humanitarian aid but a \n     cessation of attacks did not appear imminent. We discussed \n     the financing of Gazans who rely on the UN, Palestinian \n     Authority salaries and Hamas to survive.\n       The consul general told us that the economy in the West \n     Bank has improved under the direction of Salam Fayyad 18 \n     months ago. Payrolls are being met and tourism is getting \n     better due to a spillover from increased tourism in Israel.\n       We were then joined by Prime Minister Fayyad. I asked about \n     the prospects for peace with Israel. The PM indicated that \n     the peace process should be pursued and while it has not \n     happened as quickly as some would like, the Bush \n     Administration deserves credit for some of their efforts.\n       He stated that U.S. support of the Palestinian Authority \n     has had a good impact in terms of helping them govern and \n     provide services and draw support away from Hamas. I pressed \n     him on how the money was being spent and was told it was \n     going toward economic development projects and \n     infrastructure. As a result of the PA's success in \n     controlling expenditures and obtaining more revenue, they \n     anticipate lowering their dependence on foreign assistance by \n     35 percent. He cited some of the efforts: reducing their \n     payroll from 190,000 to 150,000; improving revenue \n     collections such as utility bills; and installing prepaid \n     meters, of which he noted that the city of Janin is using 100 \n     percent prepaid meters.\n       He indicated that the private sector needs to be enhanced, \n     but that it would only be possible when more mobility is \n     permitted in the West Bank. Fayyad stated that the \n     Palestinian Authority must be seen as competent and able to \n     provide for their people.\n       On Gaza, Fayyad indicated that the sentiment is against \n     Hamas because they know this would happen if they continued \n     to launch rockets into Israel. Fayyad said he was upbeat \n     about the prospects for improving life and the situation for \n     Palestinians.\n       The Prime Minister told me that it is very important to \n     deal with Syria and that it cannot be ignored if one is \n     looking for tranquility in the region. We discussed how Syria \n     hosts terrorist entities and acts as a conduit for Hezbollah. \n     He stated that this is a problem and that Iran was also a \n     problem for the region. He believes that Israel will not \n     allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapons capability. He \n     suggested engaging the Russians to make them a real partner \n     in engaging Iran--something President Shimon Peres told me \n     earlier in the day. He said it is not effective for the U.S. \n     to yell at Iran. However, if others such as Russia started \n     getting Iran's attention, it may change Tehran's calculus.\n       On December 29th I traveled to the Knesset to meet with \n     Benjamin Netanyahu. Joining us in the meeting was Yural \n     Steinitz, a member of the defense and foreign affairs \n     committee, and Silvan Shalom, a former foreign minister.\n       On Hamas, Netanyahu stated it would be very difficult to \n     peacefully engage them as their goal is to see Israel \n     destroyed. I asked what could be done to minimize civilian \n     casualties in Gaza. He replied that Gaza should not host \n     terrorists. He further stated that both Abu Mazen and \n     President Mubarak said the Israeli action was the \n     responsibility of Hamas.\n       On Syria, Netanyahu reminded me of when I carried a message \n     from him to President Assad in 1996. There was a concern at \n     the time about troop amassments on the border. I was able to \n     carry the message and according to Netanyahu and Syrian \n     Foreign Minister Muallem, may have helped to prevent a \n     military conflict. He expressed doubt about a potential deal \n     with Syria, citing the difficulty of engaging them while they \n     play host to terrorist entities and do not make any effort to \n     halt transshipment of fighters and weapons through their \n     territory.\n       With regard to the current situation with Iran, the group \n     suggested a review of what happened with Libya. They stated \n     it was not just sanctions or diplomacy, but rather the Libyan \n     calculus that the U.S. and UK would attack. The threat of \n     force, according to them, was the critical factor. Their \n     conclusion was clear: Iran will only give up its nuclear \n     weapons aspirations if the threat of military force is severe \n     enough.\n       Following my meeting at the Knesset we departed for Tel \n     Aviv for our flight to Syria.\n\n\n                                 SYRIA\n\n       We arrived in Damascus on the night of December 29th and \n     were met by Charge d'Affaires Maura Connelly. This was my \n     18th visit to Syria.\n       On December 30th, I received a briefing from Charge \n     Connelly prior to the day's meetings. Later that morning, we \n     traveled to President Assad's palace.\n       President Assad began the meeting by expressing his concern \n     with the situation in Gaza. I asked him if Hamas would ever \n     change its policy or position towards Israel and Jews. Assad \n     indicated that Khaled Mashaal, the head of Hamas who is \n     located in Damascus, has said his group would accept the 1967 \n     borders and that constituted recognition. Assad believes that \n     Hamas has changed, that Mashaal is a moderate within Hamas \n     and the best way to resolve border issues is for the \n     Palestinians to have a referendum.\n       I told President Assad that Prime Minister Olmert had said \n     he would like to see the time come when he could stay at the \n     Four Seasons in Damascus. Assad responded that going back to \n     the pre-1967 border is the key Olmert needs to access such a \n     hotel room and that, ``the Golan is everything for us . . . \n     in every bargain, I put Golan first.''\n       In May 2008, Israel and Syria announced indirect peace \n     negotiations through Turkish mediators. According to a June \n     25, 2008 article by David Ignatius in The Washington\n\n[[Page S289]]\n\n     Post, ``The channel opened in the fall of 2006, just after \n     the summer war in Lebanon that had made both Damascus and Tel \n     Aviv nervous about the destabilizing role of Hezbollah, \n     Iran's proxy in Lebanon.'' I was first told about the secret \n     talks in 2007 by officials in the region.\n       He shared with me the Syrian view on the proximity talks \n     with Israel that have been facilitated by Turkey. He said \n     that they were still at the stage of trying to get a set of \n     principles in place which would allow for discussions but \n     that the violence in Gaza would place this effort on hold.\n       I expressed my concern about Syria's involvement in \n     Lebanon, the prospect of a nuclear Iran, the statements made \n     by President Ahmadinejad regarding his desire to wipe Israel \n     off the map and the transshipment of weapons through Syria to \n     terrorist entities. I told Assad that Damascus has a role in \n     these issues and has the opportunity to act positively.\n       On Lebanon, Assad said they had a positive role in \n     supporting the formation and functioning of a government. \n     According to an October 15, 2008 PBS report, ``In August \n     [2008], Lebanese President Michel Suleiman made an official \n     visit to Damascus, where he and Assad agreed to solidify ties \n     and demarcate their contentious border.'' We discussed the \n     October 15, 2008 agreement signed by Syrian Foreign Minister \n     Walid al-Mouallem and his Lebanese counterpart, Fawzi \n     Salloukh, which formalized diplomatic ties between Syria and \n     Lebanon for the first time since the two nations gained \n     independence, Lebanon in 1943 and Syria in 1946. Syria has \n     pledged to provide an ambassador by the end of 2008, however \n     one had not yet been sent. He stated that their mission in \n     Lebanon had been established and staffed with diplomats and \n     that they are deciding on whom to send to lead the embassy.\n       On Hamas and Hezbollah, Assad suggested that a \n     comprehensive peace would resolve the issues associated with \n     these organizations. Despite reports to the contrary, Assad \n     stated that Syria is not being used to funnel weapons to \n     these groups.\n       On Iran, the President said that Iran is an influential \n     player in the region and one that has supported his efforts. \n     This, combined with no support from the West, leaves him no \n     option but to have positive relations with Tehran. However, \n     he did indicate that Syria has told Iran that it does not \n     support a military nuclear program in Iran should one be \n     active.\n       On the nuclear question, I expressed my concern that the \n     International Atomic Energy Agency, IAEA, has not had \n     sufficient access to Iran and Syria. He responded by saying \n     that Iran is ready for inspectors but that the approach taken \n     to engage Iran is viewed a political game. He indicated Iran \n     is open to inspections but the west must recognize Iran's \n     right to enrich. Assad believed the way to resolve this issue \n     is through some type of broad package. Nonetheless, you \n     cannot discuss the right to enrich with Iran, but you can \n     discuss monitoring.\n       After indicating that a nuclear Iran would not be tolerable \n     and that I would like to see this matter resolved \n     diplomatically, Foreign Minister Walid al Muallem told \n     President Assad of my work during the 1990s to prevent and \n     resolve conflict between Israel and Syria.\n       I again brought up the fate of the missing Israeli \n     soldiers: Gilad Shalit, Guy Hever and Ron Arad. I reiterated \n     my interest in seeing President Assad work to help secure the \n     release of Gilad Shalit, who has been held in Gaza since June \n     25, 2006, and in determining the fate of Guy Hever, the \n     Israeli soldier who disappeared from the Golan Heights in \n     August 1997, and Ron Arad, the Israeli Air Force weapons \n     systems officer whose plane went down in 1986. In December \n     2007, I asked President Assad for his assistance in securing \n     the release of Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev, two Israeli \n     soldiers who were captured by Hezbollah in July 2006. \n     Regrettably, their bodies were returned to their families in \n     July 2008.\n       As I told Gilad Shalit's father in a meeting in Washington \n     this past summer, I remain committed to doing whatever I can \n     to help secure the return of captured Israeli soldiers or, \n     where they have perished, to obtain their remains. I have \n     also requested the assistance of Egyptian President Hosni \n     Mubarak.\n       I also followed up numerous letters I had written to Assad \n     requesting he allow a prayer to be said over the grave of Eli \n     Cohen. He rejected the idea, claiming it would not be \n     possible given that Cohen was hanged as a spy and that Israel \n     remained a Syrian enemy.\n       Following my meeting with the president, I was scheduled to \n     meet with various social and civic leaders. In prior visits, \n     and as recently as last year, I had the opportunity to meet \n     with these leaders. However, I was not able to during this \n     visit as it has become increasingly difficult for Syrians to \n     meet with westerners for fear of retaliation. It is \n     troubling that one year ago, I was able to have a dinner \n     with Syrian citizens and have a meeting with Riad Seif, \n     and twelve months later, Seif is in jail and others did \n     not feel comfortable meeting with me.\n       On the issue of political prisoners, it was apparent that \n     there had been an even greater crackdown. In October, Syria \n     sentenced 12 prominent `dissidents' to 2\\1/2\\ years for \n     calling for democratic reforms and an end to the Baath \n     Party's monopoly on power. The so-called dissidents are part \n     of the Damascus Declaration National Council and are among \n     Syria's leading intellectuals and opposition figures.\n       According to the U.S. State Department's March 2008 report \n     on Syria's human rights practices: ``Although the number of \n     political prisoners and detainees remained difficult to \n     determine due to a continuing lack of official government \n     information, various local human rights groups estimated \n     during the year that a total of somewhere between \n     approximately 1,500 and 3,000 current political prisoners, \n     including accused Islamists, remained in detention. \n     Authorities refused to divulge information regarding numbers \n     or names of people in detention on political or security-\n     related charges.''\n       Since 2006 the government has tried some new political \n     detainees in criminal court, and once convicted on political \n     or security related charges, they are treated like common \n     prisoners. The government did not permit regular access to \n     political prisoners or detainees by local or international \n     humanitarian organizations. Human rights groups reported that \n     many political prisoners serving long-term sentences remained \n     in prison after the expiration of their sentences.\n       Following my meeting with the President, Foreign Minister \n     Walid al Muallem hosted me for a working lunch. The Foreign \n     Minister discussed the situation in Gaza as he was preparing \n     to depart the following day for a meeting of Arab countries. \n     He indicated that 44 children and 80 women had been killed in \n     Gaza as a result of Israel's action.\n       I raised the issue of foreign fighters traversing through \n     Syria. The Foreign Minister said that Syria used to cooperate \n     with the United States but that after the Hariri \n     assassination, and the souring of relations that resulted, \n     cooperation ceased. Muallem asked why Syria should cooperate \n     with the U.S. when the U.S. sanctions Syria. He indicated \n     that Syria and Iraq have cooperated and claimed that Syria \n     had stopped 1,200 fighters.\n       I pressed the Minister on the arrests of what are referred \n     to as ``dissidents.'' He indicated that they had contacts \n     with Syria's enemies and provoking action against the regime.\n       Muallem indicated he had just met with Hamas leader Khaled \n     Meshaal to discuss a possible ceasefire and if Hamas would \n     stop rocket attacks should Israel agree to a cessation of \n     bombing. He said he had also been in contact with EU foreign \n     ministers on the matter. He indicated that Hamas' morale is \n     high given the 2006 war with Hezbollah, but that Hamas and \n     Islamic Jihad are willing to consider a ceasefire.\n       I pressed him on the possibility of a peace agreement with \n     Israel. He expressed, as he has in the past, that the issues \n     on both sides are understood. However, the bombing in Gaza \n     has made it so Syria ``cannot jump to peace with Israel.'' I \n     asked what could be done to move the process forward. He \n     replied that each side must respect the interests of one \n     another and that dialogue is needed.\n       On Iran, Muallem stated that Iran has the right to enrich, \n     and that the world needs to acknowledge that, but that Syria \n     does not approve of Iran having a nuclear weapon. He stated \n     that the U.S. missed opportunities when Rafsanjani and \n     Khatami were in power.\n\n\n                                AUSTRIA\n\n       We departed Damascus on December 31st for Vienna, Austria. \n     The United States has three missions in Vienna: the bilateral \n     mission to the Republic of Austria, the mission to the \n     Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \n     and the mission to the United Nations. During my stop in \n     Vienna, I called on all three U.S. Ambassadors stationed in \n     Vienna.\n       After arriving in Vienna, Ambassador David Girard-diCarlo \n     hosted me for dinner. He briefed me on the mission's dealings \n     with the Austrian government and some of the views and issues \n     of broader Europe. We discussed how the financial crises has \n     impacted Europe as well as the United States. I shared with \n     Ambassador Girard-diCarlo my recent trip to Damascus and \n     Israel and efforts to have the United States more \n     aggressively engage in the peace process in the region.\n       I have known Ambassador Girard-diCarlo for many years. \n     David is a graduate of St. Joseph's University and Villanova \n     University School of Law. He served at Blank Rome LLP for 16 \n     years as managing partner and CEO prior to becoming chairman \n     in 2000, and he also served as chairman and CEO of Blank Rome \n     Government Relations LLC, headquartered in Washington, DC.\n       Ambassador Girard-diCarlo was Pennsylvania Governor Richard \n     L. Thornburgh's appointee to the Board of Directors of the \n     Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority, SEPTA, \n     from 1979-1982 and served as its chairman of the board. In \n     1981, he was elected as chairman of the American Public \n     Transit Association, APTA, for a 1-year term. Ambassador \n     Girard-diCarlo was appointed by former President George Bush \n     in 1990 to serve as a member of the board of the National \n     Railroad Passenger Corporation, AMTRAK, a position he held \n     until 1993.\n       In addition to Ambassador Girard-diCarlo's professional \n     responsibilities, his experience over the past 3 decades \n     involved his active participation in the business and \n     cultural organizations within the communities in which he \n     lived and worked. He served in leadership positions at the \n     Greater Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, the Philadelphia \n     Orchestra and Academy of Music, the Walnut Street Theatre, \n     The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, and the \n     Arizona Heart Foundation--to mention a few. In 1999, he \n     received the Judge Learned Hand Human Relations Award from \n     the American Jewish Committee. He served on the board of \n     Villanova\n\n[[Page S290]]\n\n     University School of Law, from which he received the Gerald \n     Abraham Award for Distinguished Service in 2003. Also in \n     2003, Pope John Paul II conferred upon him the Pontifical \n     Honor of Knight of the Order of St. Gregory the Great for his \n     work with Business Leaders Organized for Catholic Schools.\n       Established as an independent organization under the United \n     Nations in 1957, the International Atomic Energy Agency \n     represents the realization of President Dwight Eisenhower's \n     ``Atoms for Peace'' speech to the U.N. General Assembly in \n     1953. President Eisenhower proposed the creation of an \n     international body to control and promote the use of atomic \n     energy. Today, the IAEA is at the center of the ongoing \n     standoff with Iran over its nuclear program.\n       On January 1, 2008, I met with Ambassador Schulte, the \n     United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations \n     Office in Vienna, the International Atomic Energy Agency, and \n     other international organizations in Vienna.\n       Ambassador Schulte updated me on the IAEA's efforts on Iran \n     and their reported pursuit of a military nuclear capability. \n     He expressed the mission's desire to have Iran respond to \n     directives provided by both the U.N. Security Council and the \n     IAEA to suspend enrichment activities and allow inspections.\n       We discussed how Iran's failure to declare its facility at \n     Natanz has created a significant trust deficit not only in \n     the United States, but internationally. The facility, \n     combined with the revelation that Iran had outside assistance \n     from the A.Q. Khan network, which it previously denied, has \n     compounded the problem. Ambassador Schulte stated that by \n     violating the Non Proliferation Treaty, Iran has given up its \n     rights under the treaty. He further stated that Iran's claims \n     that their efforts are geared towards civilian purposes do \n     not make sense from an economic or infrastructure capability \n     perspective.\n       He was very interested in my recent stop in Damascus and my \n     dialogue with Syrian officials during my tenure. Ambassador \n     Schulte briefed me on the IAEA's response after the reported \n     attack on Syrian infrastructure. He said Syria still denies \n     the facility was of a nuclear nature, but that the IAEA \n     inspectors believe it was. He expressed concern that the \n     international community must ensure that Syria, and other \n     actors, know that this type of behavior will not be tolerated \n     and not forgotten. Ambassador Schulte revealed that Syria's \n     tactics in responding to the IAEA have a stark resemblance to \n     the response Iran has shown.\n       On the evening of January 1st, I spoke with IAEA Director \n     General Mohammed El-Baradei, who I visited last year in \n     Vienna. He updated me on his efforts on Iran and briefed me \n     on the situation vis-a-vis Syria. We discussed how the U.S. \n     and the International Community may better address Iran and \n     resolve the nuclear issue.\n       While in Vienna, I hosted a meeting with Ambassador Julie \n     Finley, the U.S. representative to the OSCE.\n       The OSCE is a major forum for issues of peace, security and \n     human rights in Europe and Central Asia. A legacy of the \n     historic 1975 Helsinki accords, it is the only fully \n     inclusive trans-Atlantic/European/Eurasian political \n     organization. Every state from Andorra to Kyrgyzstan is \n     represented among its 56 participating States. Over more than \n     30 years, commitments to democracy, rule of law, human \n     rights, tolerance, pluralism and media freedoms were hammered \n     out at the OSCE and its predecessor mechanisms--and agreed to \n     by all the participating states.\n       Ambassador Finley briefed me on her view of the Georgian-\n     Russian conflict earlier this year. She indicated that the \n     OSCE has had a mission in the region since 1992 to aid civil \n     society, enhance education and address environmental issues.\n       Ambassador Finley and I discussed the bilateral \n     relationship between the U.S. and Russia and how \n     organizations like the OSCE can better be used to address \n     regional and international matters. As relations between the \n     U.S. and Russia are increasingly strained, Ambassador Finley \n     pointed out that the OSCE could be a forum to positively \n     engage Russia as this is the only regional security \n     organization in which Russia is a full and equal member.\n       We discussed U.S. policy more broadly and how diplomacy \n     could be enhanced to pursue positive outcomes. Ambassador \n     Finley confirmed my belief that dialogue is critical to \n     addressing the challenges we face.\n       We departed Austria the following morning for Belgium.\n\n\n                                BELGIUM\n\n       We landed in Brussels, Belgium on January 2nd. I hosted a \n     meeting with Charge Kate Byrnes and Defense Advisor Randy \n     Hoag. They briefed me on the major issues we are working with \n     NATO: Afghanistan, reinvigorating the alliance, dealing with \n     Georgia and Ukraine, the Balkans and emerging security \n     threats such as cyber attacks and piracy.\n       Burden-sharing remains a concern as it was when I began \n     visiting NATO in the 1980s. During my first visit to NATO in \n     1981, 3 percent GDP spending on defense was the goal for all \n     member countries. Today, only five nations spend more than 2 \n     percent: the United States, the United Kingdom, France, \n     Greece and Turkey. This is a concern not only from the \n     standpoint of the Alliance's health and ability to address \n     issues, but also from the perspective that some are carrying \n     more weight than others.\n       The only time Article V has been invoked was following the \n     September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States. NATO \n     declared that this attack was indeed an attack on the \n     alliance. Today, there are currently 70,000 troops in \n     Afghanistan--51,000 are part of the NATO-led International \n     Security Assistance Force, ISAF. The U.S. provides 20,000 to \n     ISAF. There are concerns that some NATO members are only \n     providing civil or peacekeeping support for Afghanistan and \n     are limiting what their militaries are permitted to do.\n       We discussed the NATO-Russia relationship with a focus on \n     how expansion and missile defense impact the relationship \n     between NATO and Russia as well as the U.S. and Russia. I was \n     told that some member countries view missile defense as \n     provocative and as the alliance progresses that is something \n     that will have to be considered. I was briefed on NATO \n     missile defense as well as U.S. missile defense in Europe and \n     the future of missile defense on the continent.\n       I was told that NATO still has an open door policy, \n     codified in Article X of the charter, which states a nation \n     may appeal for membership provided it meets the requirements \n     and shares NATO values. I was briefed on the expansion \n     opportunities with Albania and Croatia and the potential for \n     nations such as Georgia, Serbia, Macedonia and Ukraine to \n     join the alliance. There is considerable fatigue in Europe \n     over expansion--both at the NATO and EU level. While NATO has \n     26 members and the EU has 27, only 18 members are party to \n     both structures. There are some EU countries which, while not \n     party to NATO, do support the alliance and its efforts--\n     namely Sweden, Finland, Ireland and Austria.\n       We then had the opportunity to discuss the U.S.-Belgian \n     bilateral relationship with Robert Kiene, our First Secretary \n     to the mission. He said the relationship has improved since \n     2003 when the U.S. took military action against Iraq.\n       When we left Washington, D.C., Yves Leterme was the Prime \n     Minister. When we landed in Belgium it was Herman Van Rompuy. \n     On our day of arrival, Van Rompuy received backing from the \n     parliament by a vote of 88 to 45. Belgium like so many other \n     nations is facing an economic crisis to include recession and \n     bank disintegration.\n       Mr. Kiene discussed the recent political changes that \n     occurred in Belgium. He informed us that Belgium, while under \n     the 2 percent GDP spending NATO goal, is very keen on \n     enhancing their ability to contribute to the alliance. We \n     discussed how Section 1206 ``Global Train and Equip'' funds \n     could be used to reward and encourage Belgium as well as \n     enhance forces outside NATO.\n       Belgium played a key role in helping to obtain an EU-wide \n     agreement on arrest warrants and in facilitating extradition \n     of terrorist suspects. A Brussels trial of al-Qaeda-related \n     defendants ended in September 2003 with sentences for 18 of \n     the 23 accused, with another 2004 terrorist-related trial \n     resulting in eight more guilty verdicts. Belgium operates \n     within UN and EU frameworks concerning the freezing of \n     terrorist assets, but has yet to develop a domestic legal \n     framework to act independently. In support of Operation \n     Enduring Freedom, Belgium contributed a navy frigate in the \n     Mediterranean, Airborne Warning and Control (AWAC) crews for \n     surveillance flights over the United States, as well as \n     aircraft for humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. Since \n     2002, Belgium has contributed ground troops to the \n     International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, the UN \n     Security council sanctioned peacekeeping mission in \n     Afghanistan. Belgium currently has 420 troops assigned to the \n     ISAF.\n       Mr. Kiene discussed the efforts of the Belgian government \n     to combat terrorism. On December 11, 2008, Belgian \n     authorities arrested 14 people suspected of Al Qaeda links. \n     The following day, six of the individuals were charged with \n     membership in a terrorist group. The remaining eight were \n     released due to insufficient evidence. As reported by the \n     Christian Science Monitor, ``According to Belgian federal \n     officials, at least some of the detained suspects had \n     traveled to the Pakistan-Afghanistan border for training and \n     were said to have been affiliated with ``important people'' \n     in Al Qaeda.'' According to a December 12, 2008 Associated \n     Press article, the six charged included one who may have been \n     plotting a suicide attack. While Belgium faced with terrorism \n     issues at home, it is also contributing to NATO efforts in \n     Afghanistan.\n       On the afternoon of January 2nd, I hosted General Craddock, \n     Commander of the United States European Command. We discussed \n     Afghanistan, the NATO-Russian dynamic, NATO expansion, the \n     EU-NATO relationship, Kosovo, AFRICOM, and missile defense, \n     among other topics.\n       General Craddock reported that the government and civil \n     society in Afghanistan have not come along fast enough to \n     support and rule the people of Afghanistan. He briefed me on \n     the challenges, from criminal to insurgency to corruption, \n     faced in the various regions of Afghanistan. We discussed how \n     the money from narcotics are fueling those opposed to the \n     U.S. and coalition forces. General Craddock cited a UN report \n     which indicates as much as $500 million in revenue from the \n     drug trade is supporting those opposed to our objectives.\n       General Craddock confirmed the reports that fighters are \n     moving back and forth between Afghanistan and Pakistan and \n     that\n\n[[Page S291]]\n\n     the FATA region in Pakistan is hosting our enemies. General \n     Craddock indicated that if tensions between India and \n     Pakistan flare up, especially as a result of the recent \n     bombing, Pakistan may pull resources from their Western \n     border to engage India to the east. He estimates that \n     Pakistan would need 50,000-100,000 additional troops on their \n     western border to improve the ability to engage enemies in \n     the FATA region. Further, he stated that whatever forces \n     Pakistan uses in the west, they must remain there and hold \n     the territory and prevent it from being re-ceded to \n     combatants.\n       We discussed the proposal of an additional 20,000 troops \n     being deployed to support efforts in Afghanistan, but General \n     Craddock indicated that these forces are contingent upon \n     forces being drawn down in Iraq. This is also true for \n     allies, such as the UK, who may be adding troops to \n     Afghanistan.\n       General Craddock made it clear that the military cannot \n     ``win'' Afghanistan. Rather, it can provide the right \n     security conditions for a civil government to stand up. The \n     government in Afghanistan needs to remove corruption, \n     establish reliable police forces capable of providing public \n     safety, create jobs and provide services such as clean \n     drinking water. He predicted that a presence will be needed \n     in Afghanistan for the next 30-40 years.\n       On Iran, General Craddock stated that Iran does not want to \n     see the Taliban come back to power, but that they do desire \n     the U.S. to remain tied down in the region. Iran's eastern \n     border with Afghanistan remains a major transshipment point \n     for drugs, weapons and oil.\n       General Craddock is dual hatted in Brussels, as he heads \n     NATO and the U.S. European Command. On the latter, he \n     presented three challenges moving forward: (1) Convincing \n     allies to better assist and engage in regional and \n     international problems; (2) define a national strategy vis-a-\n     vis Russia; and (3) resolve European missile defense issues.\n\n\n                                 NORWAY\n\n       On January 3rd, we arrive in Oslo, Norway. The last time I \n     visited Norway was in 1994 during a meeting of the North \n     Atlantic Assembly. This time, I met with representatives from \n     our mission, Deputy Chief of Mission Kevin Johnson and \n     defense attache Don Kepley.\n       I was briefed on the U.S.-Norwegian relationship and some \n     of the difficulties we have had this decade over foreign \n     policy disputes, such as Iraq and our approach to \n     Afghanistan. I was briefed on the status of Norway's decision \n     to buy Lockheed Martin F-35 Joint Strike Fighters and the \n     current political situation in the country. Norway, like the \n     U.S., has a significant global presence and has a history of \n     being active on many foreign policy fronts from Middle East \n     peace to Sri Lanka.\n       Norway is a member of NATO and is contributing to the \n     mission in Afghanistan. They currently have 500 troops \n     deployed which, while not large by number, is significant \n     given their population. In addition to military support, \n     Norway has contributed senior diplomats and significant aid \n     to assist in the building of Afghanistan.\n       We discussed the Norwegian Government's plans to fight the \n     global economic crisis. While its large sovereign wealth fund \n     lost a significant amount of money in the stock market, \n     especially after the fall of Lehman Brothers, Norway is \n     expected to do better than other Nordic and European nations \n     during the economic downturn. Norway, which the CIA estimates \n     has the world's 21st largest oil reserves, will tap into some \n     of its saved oil wealth to provide the country with an \n     economic stimulus. Norwegian Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg \n     said on December 19, 2008 that the stimulus package, ``will \n     include an ever greater increase in funding for public works \n     and construction, and maintenance.''\n       On the day of my arrival, a protest of an estimated 1,000 \n     Norwegians was occurring in front of Parliament and the \n     Israeli embassy. The protestors, who had a similar gathering \n     last week, were expressing their opposition to Israel's \n     actions in Gaza. While Norway was long a strong ally of \n     Israel, the bilateral relationship has soured since the Oslo \n     Accords.\n       The following morning I met with Benson Whitney, the U.S. \n     Ambassador to Norway. We discussed our bilateral \n     relationship, U.S. foreign policy, and our bilateral \n     relationship with Russia and its impact globally.\n       Following the meeting we departed for Iceland.\n\n\n                                ICELAND\n\n       On January 4, 2009, we arrived in Reykjavik, Iceland, where \n     we were met by Neil Klopfenstein, our Deputy Chief of \n     Mission.\n       The following morning I met with Prime Minister Geir \n     Haarde. Prime Minister Haarde graduated from Brandeis \n     University and earned two master's degrees from Johns Hopkins \n     University. We discussed a broad range of topics: Energy; the \n     recent financial crisis and its impacts on the U.S. and \n     Iceland; the situation in Afghanistan; and our relations with \n     Russia.\n       Following the collapse of Iceland's three main banks in \n     October 2008, Iceland was cast into financial turmoil. A \n     December 13, 2008 article in The Economist makes clear the \n     magnitude of the problem: ``[T]he scale of what confronts . . \n     . Icelanders is only just becoming clear. According to the \n     [International Monetary Fund], the failure of the banks may \n     cost taxpayers more than 80 percent of GDP. Relative to the \n     economy's size, that would be about 20 times what the Swedish \n     Government paid to rescue its banks in the early 1990s. It \n     would be several times the cost of Japan's banking crisis a \n     decade ago.'' According to the IMF, Iceland's GDP is expected \n     to contract by nearly 10 percent in calendar year 2009.\n       The Prime Minister was practical in terms of the outlook \n     for 2009 but was optimistic that Iceland would see a \n     turnaround in 2010. He indicated that Iceland has agreed to \n     financing from the International Monetary Fund. The Prime \n     Minister and I shared what each of our respective countries \n     were looking to do in the form of economic stimulus.\n       Prime Minister Haarde thanked me for my work on the \n     judiciary committee and our efforts to ensure businessmen \n     have visas which permit them the freedom to work and meet in \n     the United States. Citing his personal experience during his \n     6 years as a student in the United States, Prime Minister \n     Haarde asked that we do more to ensure those who wish to \n     study in the U.S. have the opportunity. I concurred and feel \n     that it is in our interest to have foreigners, and potential \n     future foreign leaders, spend time and be educated in the \n     United States.\n       We returned to the United States on January 5, 2009.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I know Senator Coburn is near the floor \nand should be appearing shortly. But until he does, I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nrecognized for what time I might consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we had an interesting day yesterday. We \nbrought a lot of people to work, I believe unnecessarily, to adopt a \nmotion to proceed that we could have voted on today.\n  I want to spend some time today outlining what our new, soon to be \nPresident, President-elect Obama, said during his campaign and what he \nsaid to me personally several times about how we fix what is wrong with \nour country. If you go to his Web site or what his transition team has \nsaid, what you will find are some very significant things that both he \nand I have worked on over the past 4 years.\n  He has a plan. It is called the Obama plan for restoring fiscal \ndiscipline. It is a good plan. What does it include? It includes \nconducting an exhaustive line-by-line review of Federal spending and \neliminating Government programs that are not performing or are wasteful \nor are obsolete or are duplicative, paying for new spending \ncommitments--new spending commitments--by cutting other programs--let \nme say that again--paying for new spending commitments by cutting other \nprograms, slashing porkbarrel spending, rooting out redundancy, and \nrequiring all Federal contracts over $25,000, including earmarks, to be \ncompetitively bid, to truly measure program performance without \nideologic slant, and enforcing goals and demanding that new initiatives \nbe selected on the basis of merit, not a political process that rewards \nlobbyists and campaign donors and makes Members of Congress just look \ngood at home.\n  That is President-elect Obama. I don't know anybody outside of \nWashington who would not embrace that message. That is a great message \nfor our country. It is a message that our country needs to heed. It is \none that we need to accomplish. Unfortunately, the first week we are \nback in session, we are doing exactly the opposite. Here we have \nPresident-elect Obama who next week will become President Obama, and \none of his main goals we are working to undermine in the Senate today.\n  I am going to be an ally of the President-elect on these issues. \nEvery opportunity when we are not doing what he suggested we be doing, \nI am going to be raising questions about it. We are going to work hard \nfor the hope and change he promised the American people he would \ndeliver.\n  We have before us a lands package. It is not really a lands package. \nIt has all sorts of stuff in it--165 bills. Initially, it spends $1 \nbillion, but that is not even honest because after 10 years it spends \n$2 billion to $3 billion more on one program alone. CBO has not even \nscored\n\n[[Page S292]]\n\nthis new package. The last package they scored, if appropriated, would \nbe $8 billion. So we have $10 billion to $12 billion in new spending.\n  The opportunity to offer amendments on that has been foreclosed.\n  So I thought, in light of what this bill is and in light of what \nPresident Obama said he would like to see us do, that I would highlight \nsome of the amendments I would have offered had the minority, the \nRepublican Party, the Republican Members of the Senate, been given an \nopportunity to amend this bill.\n  The best tradition of the Senate--the best tradition of the Senate--\nis where the best ideas get debated, the back and forth goes on, and \nthen we settle on what is almost always a compromise but a compromise \nthat is thoroughly debated and where an individual Senator has to put \ntheir stamp of yea or nay on ideas to either make it better or not. \nThat is not available in this bill. As a matter of fact, it hasn't been \navailable for 124 days. It has been available once to Republican \nMembers of the Senate in 184 days.\n  So if we are to accomplish, or at least move in the direction that \nour soon-to-be President would like for us to, one of the things that \nis going to be required for that is taking tough votes. The idea we \ndon't want our Members to have to take tough votes is the height of \ninside political baseball and it wreaks of a lack of courage. As a \nSenator from Oklahoma, if I can't go home and defend my votes in a \ncogent and reasonable manner, I shouldn't be sent back up here. That is \nall there is to it. If Oklahoma citizens believe I have not stood on \nthe principles of which I told them I would try to represent them in \nthis body, they should not send me back to the Senate. But to not have \nthe votes in the first place, so we don't have to defend anything, goes \nagainst not just the culture of the Senate but it goes against the very \ncourage that this whole country was based upon and that is the freedom \nto express and work and try to accomplish what you think is best for \nthe country in the long run.\n  One of the great qualities of our country is this freedom to get out \nand express. Until recently, that freedom has been available in the \nSenate. But this didn't start with Harry Reid. It goes all the way back \nto George Mitchell and Trent Lott and Bill Frist. It has been perfected \nunder our current majority leader. My thought would be that maybe we \nought to take the hard votes rather than ruin the institution. Maybe we \nought to do what the American people would expect us to do.\n  Now, my intent has never been, in all my proceedings on the floor, to \nextend debate. I mean, I think I could accomplish a filibuster if I \nwanted to do that. Having delivered 4,000 babies, I know how to stay up \nall night. My goal is to have the opportunity to do amendments and to \nhave a vote on them. As most people know, agreements to time on \namendments are easily obtained, and limitation on amendments are most \noften very easily obtained.\n  So the fact is we find ourselves on a $12 billion bill that has lots \nof good things in it and has lots of mediocre things that probably \nwould be a priority if we didn't find ourselves with a $1.8 trillion \ndeficit this year and getting ready to pass an $800 billion stimulus \npackage that is about $2,700 per man, woman, and child in this country, \nor about $10,000 per family, none of which is going to be paid for--\nnone of which is going to be paid for. It will ultimately be paid for, \nand here is how it will be paid for. When we look toward our \ngrandchildren, what we are going to find is that not so many of them \nget to go to college because they will not be able to afford to. When \nwe look toward them owning a home, regardless of the housing crisis we \nfind ourselves in now, 30 years from now the ability to earn an income \nbig enough to be able to afford a mortgage is going to be limited \nbecause we have been poor stewards with their taxpayer money. So we \nwill have shackled our grandchildren.\n  So let me spend a minute talking about eliminating wasteful programs, \nor things that are not a priority, and go over a couple of the \namendments we were going to offer simply to point out that we are doing \nthe opposite of what I believe the intent of our new President is going \nto be. I might also add, it wasn't that long ago that all of us were \npaying $4 for a gallon of gasoline. There is no question in my mind \nthat a good portion of that price was because of speculation of the \nvery rich in this country asking the very poor to pay out of their \ndisposable income while they made millions upon billions of dollars \nmanipulating the futures markets. But nevertheless, in this bill, we \nare putting a patch over our eye and limiting our ability in the future \nto increase our energy independence by taking millions of acres of land \nand forever closing them to any source of energy. It would not matter \nwhat any new technology might be, and it would not matter if we could \ndo it totally without any environmental impact, we are closing that \ncompletely off.\n  That set aside, one of the amendments we were going to offer in this \nbill was to strike $3.5 million to go to the city of St. Augustine, FL. \nNow, you might ask, what for? Well, they are going to have a birthday \nparty in 6 years to recognize the 450th year of St. Augustine's \nexistence, the longest Colonial outpost on this continent. I would say \nmaybe that might be a St. Augustine, FL, responsibility or maybe the \nState of Florida, but when we are running a deficit in this country of \n$20,000 per family per year, it seems ludicrous to me that we would \nsend $3.5 million for a party. How does that set with priorities? How \ndoes that set with eliminating wasteful spending? It doesn't. Yet it is \nin here, and we don't have the opportunity to try to take it out.\n  There is $12 million in the bill to build a new facility in Maryland \nfor orchids for the Smithsonian. We may need to do that, but we \ncertainly don't need to do that right now. That is a luxury item. Every \nfamily in this country today is making a reassessment because everybody \nis afraid, and they are going through their budgets and saying: What is \nnecessary? What is excess? What can we do without? Should we be putting \nmoney away in case X happens? Everybody in the country is doing that \nexcept the Congress. So here we have a new orchid building, costing $12 \nor $14 million, I don't remember exactly which, that we are going to \nput in this bill, and we are going to say this is a priority.\n  Now, some will say: Well, we might not appropriate it. We appropriate \n$300 billion a year for things that are not authorized anyway, and most \nof those things are not priority as well. But the fact is, it is a clue \nto the American public that we don't get it; that in this time of \nsignificant economic downturn, in this time of significant debt laying \non to the next generations, we continue to want to do things the \naverage person of common sense would say: How can that be a priority? \nWell, it can't.\n  There is $5 million in here for new botanical gardens in Hawaii and \nFlorida. I don't doubt that could be a great thing that we could do. \nNo. 1, I would ask the question again: Why isn't that a State \nresponsibility instead of a Federal responsibility? If the State of \nFlorida and the State of Hawaii think that is a priority, they ought to \nfund it. No. 2, if it is our priority, if it is our responsibility, is \nthat something we should be funding now; that we should be authorizing; \nwe should be saying it is okay to do this?\n  We are in perilous times. Yet we act like nothing is going on out \nthere; that the average family isn't getting hit hard, that people \naren't worried about their jobs; that 573,000 people didn't lose their \njobs last month. That is how we are behaving.\n  One of the other amendments we would have offered is to prohibit the \nuse of eminent domain both in the national trails, the wilderness \nareas, the new heritage areas, and the new national parks area. It is \none thing for the Government to have its land; it is totally different \nfor it, through the force of law, to take your land away from you and \ntell you what they are going to do with it. There is minimal \nprohibition in this bill for the protection of property rights in this \ncountry--a fundamental freedom guaranteed to every American. This bill \nsteps all over those property rights.\n  We offered a total of 13 amendments, and we would have probably \naccepted 5 or 6, with less than an hour debate on each one of them. We \ncould have been finished with this bill. We could have accomplished it \nlast Thursday or Friday. But because we don't want to have to take \ntough votes or we want to protect a Member from a vote on some\n\n[[Page S293]]\n\npiece of pork that was put in a bill, we have decided to have no votes, \nno debate on any amendment will be the standard for this body. It is \nnot a good day for the Senate. More importantly, it is a terrible day \nfor this country because we are saying that, even though we have great \nhope and promise of change by an incoming President, his own party is \ngoing to step on that--the careerists, the people who think politically \nonly, the people who think short term only about political gain, \ninstead of thinking about what is in the best long-term interests of \nour country.\n  It is interesting to know we have 108 million acres of wilderness in \nthis country right now--more than anywhere else in the world. That \nnumber is actually greater than the amount of developed land we have in \nthis country, which is 106 million acres. It is also interesting to \nknow the Government already owns 653 million acres, and we are going to \ntake, at a minimum, another 2.2 million acres and totally wall it off--\ncan't ride a dirt bike through it, minimal access, can't hunt on it, \ncan't do the things you have always done. If you happen to be \nunfortunate enough to have property next to it, you fall peril to \nhaving the National Park Service fund organizations that are going to \ntake your property rights away, to limit your ability on the land you \nhave that is abutting these areas.\n  As we come into next week, we approach the celebration of a very \ngreat milestone in our country, something that speaks volumes about the \nAmerican system: the installment and swearing in of the first African-\nAmerican President, one who leads on these issues while we in the \nSenate say we are going to keep doing it the way we have been doing it \nregardless of the tremendous hope that he brought to the American \npeople, the hope for change, that we would operate differently. We hope \nhe will lead a Government that operates differently--and I believe he \nwill try. He is a very dear friend of mine. I believe he is going to \ntry to do that as here we sit in the Senate, worrying about the \npolitical consequences of taking a few votes on amendments because we \nmight not look good enough at home.\n  Talk about the lack of courage; talk about the decline that will be \nmanifested in our country if we continue to have leadership that \noperates on the basis of fear instead of courage.\n  My challenge and my hope is that this is the last time we are going \nto see this tactic brought forward in the Senate. My pledge to the \nmajority leader is I will not delay anything if I get an opportunity to \namend it. But if I get no opportunity to amend it, I will delay \neverything because the lack of an opportunity to amend says that over \nhalf of the people in this country, the 160 million who are represented \nby my side of the aisle, have no voice in the matter. It says, if we \ndon't get it, our voice doesn't count.\n  I look forward with great hope to the leadership we are going to see \nat the other end of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. My prayer is that the \nleadership in this body can come up to the same level of character and \ncourage that I believe we will see demonstrated at the other end of \nPennsylvania Avenue.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                                  TARP\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I appreciate the opportunity of sharing \nsome thoughts this afternoon. We are going to be moving forward, \npresumably even this week, with the second tranche. That is the second \nportion of $350 billion of the Wall Street bailout, the TARP money.\n  And we will have that coming up, and there will be an attempt to move \nthat through. I have believed from the beginning that it was unwise for \nthis Congress to allow one individual, the Secretary of Treasury, to \ndisburse $700 billion. The way this is set up, and even with the way \nthe votes might occur in Congress, is very troubling. The whole $700 \nbillion will be spent by the two Secretaries of Treasury, without any \nreal accountability, without any real responsibility.\n  I think Congress is beginning to see the lack of wisdom that we \ndisplayed, the lack of fidelity to the responsibilities of the Senate, \nwhen we passed that bill with so little control. We do not even know \nwhere the money is going, and whether Secretary Paulson, who is a Wall \nStreet guru, is moving money around among friends for friendship \nreasons, or meritorious reasons, or even if he can tell in this rush-\nrush effort to put out money, who is deserving and who is not \ndeserving. It is not being done in an open and transparent way.\n  It is an indication and further proof that we in the Senate and the \nCongress were not rigorous enough when we passed it. I would add one \nmore thing about that. It is something we ought not to forget. I hoped \nnot to bring it up, but Secretary Paulson announced that he was going \nto buy toxic mortgages, bad mortgages from banks, in order to get those \noff their books. He said that most of them would be good and eventually \nthey could be sold for a profit and the taxpayers would not lose any \nmoney, and that would be the way we would do this.\n  Well, within a week--and he was specifically asked at one hearing if \nhe thought we should buy stock in private banks, and he said, no. \nWithin a week or so, he had already changed his mind on that. Instead \nof buying toxic mortgages, he was now going to buy stock in private \nAmerican companies. And, in fact, he has now spent over $100 billion in \none company, AIG, the insurance company.\n  AIG is competing with other American companies. How should they feel, \nI ask you, that the U.S. Government is now providing $100 billion-plus \nto their competitors? What about the banks who did things right and \nwere cautious and managed their money well? How should they feel about \nthe Government injecting capital into their competitors by buying \nstock?\n  And what about those of us who are not of the socialist bend? What \nshould we think about the idea of the U.S. Government buying stock in a \nmultitude of banks, at tens of billions of dollars, and now buying and \ninvesting in automobile companies? Someone said the newspapers are \nnext. Well, I guess they are in trouble. They are not doing well \nfinancially. They can write a lot of editorials. I mean, maybe we ought \nto make them happy and give them money. What I am saying is, where does \nit end?\n  Out of that background, I want to have a little discussion of the \npossibility of a stimulus bill that would add some $800 billion to the \ncurrent level of deficit spending we already have. $800 billion.\n  There is no doubt that our economy is not performing well. We know \nthat economies historically are cyclical; they go through good times \nand bad times. They normally respond. We are clearly going through a \nvery difficult recessionary period. The unemployment rate is \nincreasing, and businesses are struggling. We had a hearing before the \nBudget Committee last Thursday. The Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office testified, and he predicted that this would be a 2-year \nrecession. Someone later asked him: Well, did that include the stimulus \npackage? And he said, no.\n  Well, would the stimulus package help? Spending another $800 billion, \nwould that help? He said: Well, it might. That is a little less than a \nringing endorsement. He did not say that if we did not pass this bill \nthe economy would never recover and we would continue on a downward \nspiral forever. So I would say that.\n  But I do think the Government can play a positive role in helping to \nshorten the length of the recession that we are in.\n  There are some things I am prepared to discuss and see if we can \nagree on. I know President-elect Obama feels very strongly about this. \nHe has been out campaigning, and he made promises to do all he could to \nrecover this economy. He intends to do something, and he promised to do \nsomething. He is going to do something.\n  Now, President Bush has already done some things that I also did not \napprove of. Doing something can be good. But doing something may not be \nso good if you do the wrong things. So I am aware that the new \nadministration wants our country to prosper, and\n\n[[Page S294]]\n\nso do I. If there are reasonable, commonsense steps we can take to do \nthat, I say let us do so without delay.\n  But I want to share some thoughts with you about the fundamental \ntruths that I think all of us in this country know, and especially the \narea where I come from. One of them is that there is no free lunch. \nNobody can get a lunch and say someone did not have to work to put it \non the table. There is nothing free. When something is given, somebody \npays for it.\n  There is another thing that is a truism: one way or the other, debts \nhave to be repaid.\n  You say: Well, you know, sometimes people go bankrupt, you do not get \npaid back. But the whole system is damaged when debts are not paid \nback. The next guy may have to pay higher interest rates because his \nneighbor did not pay his debts and the bank lost money and the bank has \ngot to charge higher interest rates to account for that higher risk.\n  So there are costs out there, and nothing is free in this country. I \nwish to focus on this question first. What is the best thing we can do \nfor America in the long run? What should we, the responsible Senate, \nwhere we're supposed to be the saucer that cools, what should we do and \nhow should we approach this issue?\n  Let's be frank. The stimulus bill, the recovery bill as some are \ncalling it now, may well provide some stimulus to the country. I am not \nsure. But I would say this: at its face, it is a spending bill. It \nspends money in order to create projects that might create jobs, and \nthis is the theory behind the effort to stimulate the economy.\n  We spend the money to try to create jobs. So it relies on the theory \nthat ramping up government spending will flood the country with money, \n$800 billion worth, acting like a booster shot for a sick economy.\n  This is not a new theory. It has been tried before all over the \nworld. Many economists say this type of spending-stimulus simply does \nnot work. They have cited examples of it throughout history.\n  President Bush tried it in February last year, less than a year ago, \nwhen he began the process to send out a $600 check. I think there is a \ngeneral consensus now that the plan that was sold to Congress as a \nstimulus for the economy did not have the desired effect.\n  I wish it were not so. I wish it had. I would point out that I did \nnot think at the time that it would work. I did not vote for it. There \nwere not many of us who did not vote for it, but I was one of the few. \nBut it did not work, in my opinion. It cost $168 billion. Every penny \nof that $168 billion, since we were in a deficit and it was new \nspending on top of what we planned to spend, and we knew we were there, \nis a deficit added to the deficit. As a result, it basically, in one \npiece of legislation, doubled the annual deficit last year.\n  Then we had some more spending that went on later on in the year. I \nwill show this chart in a minute that sort of dramatizes where we are.\n  So I would say both parties have some fingerprints on some policies \nthat have not been very helpful. We did not ask enough tough questions \nwhen President Bush proposed his agenda, and we also did not ask enough \nquestions when they passed the $700 billion bailout in October, in my \nopinion. I hope we do not make the mistake again of rushing to approve \nthe second phase of that along with this $800 billion stimulus package.\n  We need to ask the right questions. We should not be intimidated by \nit. We should not be panicked. The bill does not have to be passed in 1 \nday, or else the country is going to be permanently damaged. We need to \ntry to improve the economy without wasting money or creating long-term \nproblems for the Nation.\n  So there is this effort to continue what Secretary Paulson promoted, \na rhetoric that says we have got to do something and we have got to do \nit in a hurry. We have got to do it now. We are still hearing that. \nWell, I think we don't need to be afraid to say, let's slow this down a \nlittle bit.\n  When something of such historic proportions is on the table, a bill \nof this magnitude, the Senate has a responsibility to carefully \nscrutinize it and to insist on accountability and responsibility of \nevery single dime. That is why we exist. That is why taxpayers send us \nhere. Someone has to ask the tough questions. I do not want to dampen \nanybody's spirits. We have a wonderful new President. He has a positive \nattitude. He is proposing a lot of things and nobody wants to ask a lot \nof grim questions.\n  I am going to ask a few, though, because it is my duty to do so. \nFirst, how big is this plan? How much will it cost? We have heard some \ngeneral numbers. It has been stated, although we still haven't seen any \ndetails, that it might be between $800 billion and $1.3 trillion, which \nis one thousand three hundred billion dollars. That is a lot of money. \nIt would be the single largest Government expenditure of all time. \nConsider the enormity of a trillion dollars. It is the equivalent of \npaying for the Korean, Vietnam, and Persian Gulf wars at once.\n  Then, my next question is: Where will the $800 billion to $1.3 \ntrillion come from? Where will we get it?\n  As I indicated, we are in a deficit now. So we are talking about \nspending another $800-plus billion. Where does it come from? We will \nhave to borrow every single penny of it from whomever will lend us the \nmoney, private investors or foreign countries. We have been depending, \nfrankly, too much on foreign countries. We didn't budget for this $800 \nbillion. We don't have any money in the bank that we can get and pay \nfor it. We don't have any savings we can draw on. All $1 trillion will \nhave to be borrowed. Since loans have to be repaid and you have to pay \npeople to borrow their money--that is what borrowing money is, you \nborrow it from somebody or some country, and they are not going to give \nthe money for nothing--you have to pay them interest. Every bit of it \nwill have to be paid back. Every American over the years, for \ngenerations to come, will have to sacrifice to pay off the debt we \nincur today.\n  The United States is, indeed, deeply in debt already, about $10.6 \ntrillion. My generation probably will not be the one to pay most of \nthat back, nor will even our children. It will probably be our \ngrandchildren who will begin to feel the heavy burden of this debt. We \nshould consider that.\n  Then I will ask this question: What impact will the Obama plan have \non the Federal deficit and the national debt? This spending program, \nvirtually all of it, will increase the deficit, which is the difference \nbetween the money the Government takes in each year and what we spend. \nWe spend more than we take in, so we have a deficit right now. To fund \nthat deficit, we borrow money. Each year we have been running a \ndeficit, and each year the deficit gets added to the total national \ndebt. One might ask: How do these deficits and debts affect me? Well, \nwhen politicians are responsible and deficits are kept small as a \npercentage of the gross domestic product, we probably don't notice the \nimpact. Interest rates remain low, and debt payments are easier to \nmake. But when we have a sustained and systemic habit of growing \ndeficits, the United States becomes a riskier investment for people who \nmight like to loan us money. Interest rates will go up, and more debt \nat higher interest rates means the taxpayers have to pay a larger \npercentage of GDP towards interest on the debt. The most likely way \nthose high payments would be met is by a tax hike. I am not sure that \nis the most likely, but one way those higher interest payments and \nhigher debt payments will have to be paid back might be a tax hike.\n  In 2004, President Bush was criticized because, under his tenure \nafter 9/11, after the economic slowdown, he had a big stimulus package, \nand it led to a deficit of $412 billion. He was savaged for a $412 \nbillion deficit. I thought he did deserve criticism for that. Although \nit is not well known to most Americans, some work was done in the next \nyears to bring that deficit down. By 2007, it was down to $160 billion, \na lot better than $412 billion. That amounted to 1.2 percent of the \ngross domestic product.\n  This chart reflects that. We had a $413 billion deficit in 2004. This \nwas the largest deficit since World War II. President Bush was roundly \ncriticized for it. A lot of people felt strongly about it. The next \nyear the deficit dropped to $318 billion; the next year, it was 248. \nThe year before last, 2007, it dropped to $161 billion. We were heading \nin the right direction.\n\n[[Page S295]]\n\n  Then we had the economic slowdown. Those things have a number of \ndifferent ramifications, one of which is, when the economy slows down, \npeople don't make as much money, so they don't pay as much taxes. So we \nlost about $200 billion; we expect to lose about $166 billion in \nrevenue this year, according to the CBO, as a result of the slowdown. \nBut last year, including the $160 billion stimulus package, sending out \nchecks, the deficit jumped to $455 billion, the highest we have had \nsince World War II as a percentage of the gross domestic product. That \nis a huge number.\n  We had a hearing last Thursday with the Congressional Budget Office \nActing Director. A longtime professional budgeteer by the name of Mr. \nSunshine did a fabulous job, but his remarks weren't so bright and \nencouraging. The Congressional Budget Office projects that even without \nany stimulus package, under current law, the deficit this fiscal year, \nthe one we are already in--we passed the first quarter of it, and it \nends on September 30 of this year--will be $1.2 trillion. Remember, \nlast year it was $455 billion, the highest ever. This year we are \nlooking at $1.2 trillion. Senator Conrad, chairman of the Budget \nCommittee and a Democratic leader in the Senate, a good American, \ncalled that number jaw dropping. What else can one say?\n  That does not even include the stimulus package. If we add the \nnumbers as proposed in the stimulus package, according to Mr. Sunshine, \nthat will reach almost $1.8 trillion. So we are talking about a deficit \nmore than three times the largest amount ever. It may sound fine as a \nbusinessman. I heard today a very prominent American businessman on Joe \nScarborough's show. They asked him about spending and the deficit. He \nsaid: Well, we have to do it. They asked: Isn't this going to create \nfinancial problems in the future? And the only answer he could give \nwas: Well, we will worry about that later.\n  I think it is a little late to worry about spending an extra $800 \nbillion. It is a little late to worry about it later. We need to worry \nabout it when we, the entity responsible for appropriating money, are \ndeciding how much to appropriate and for what purpose. We ought to be \nthinking about it now, before we vote. This includes some of the \nexpenditures for the TARP that they project. That is the $700 billion \nbailout and some other things, some of which are one-time expenditures. \nThey project next year the deficit will be $871 billion. It might look \nlike we made progress, but $871 billion is twice what this number is, \nalmost. The next year, 2011, it will $572 billion.\n  Those numbers still are not the full number because they do not \ninclude, for example, about $40 billion a year for the alternative \nminimum tax fix and several other things. So these are numbers based on \nexisting law, and each year we have not allowed the alternative minimum \ntax to go up. There are other things we extend each year. It does not \ninclude extensions of the current Bush tax cuts which would expire in \n2010. He is not projecting they will be extended, but some of them, I \nam sure, will be. Those numbers are correct, technically, but in \nreality they are going to be larger, in all probability.\n  This deficit, almost $1.8 trillion, amounts to 8.3 percent of the \nentire value of the American economy, the gross domestic product. That \nwould be the highest in real dollar numbers maybe ever. As a percentage \nof the economy, it is the highest since we were in a life-and-death \nstruggle in World War II, with millions of soldiers deployed all over \nthe world putting their lives on the line for this country. We were \nbuilding airplanes and ships and tanks with all the capacity this \nNation had.\n  Today Mr. Sunshine told us the debt payment we are paying each year \nout of tax receipts is $200 billion just to pay the interest on the \nmoney we already owe. Let me say a little bit about that. Interest \nrates are oddly at a very low rate today. It is inevitable, though, \nthat people will stop loaning money to anybody, the U.S. Government or \nanybody else, for 1 or 2 percent. They are going to demand higher \ninterest rates. That is what is going to happen.\n  The CBO predicts that interest rate amount will balloon in a few \nyears to $450 billion a year annually. So the Congressional Budget \nOffice says, as a result of our profligate spending and huge deficits, \nwe now are heading in a few years to a point where we will be spending \n$450 billion a year only on interest. I ask, how big is $450 billion?\n  I will give a couple examples to provide perspectives that are fair \nto consider. The 5 years of the Iraq war cost $500 billion. We are \ncreating a permanent interest rate payment every year that will have to \nbe paid by our children, by our constituents. Our constituents today \nwill be paying $450 billion every year, just on interest, because we \nhad to spend so much today and last year for responses to crises I am \nnot sure justified this kind of spending.\n  I certainly think many of our programs deserve to be reformed, \neliminated, or increased in efficiency, and a lot of savings could \noccur. We have not been doing that. All we have been doing is spending \nmore and more, adding to our debt.\n  Madam President, $450 billion is the equivalent, as I said, of the \nIraq war. It is about one-third of the discretionary spending for our \ncountry every year. My recollection is that our general fund \ndiscretionary spending, including the Department of Defense, is about \n$1.5 trillion. I think that includes the $200 billion or so for \ninterest now. So that number goes up to $450 billion. It would be about \na third of that amount.\n  We spend more on Social Security and Medicare and entitlement \nprograms. That is on a separate accountability factor. But just on the \nDefense Department, Homeland Security, our salaries, highways, \neverything we spend money on--our interest on the debt would be that \nhigh. It is not a little bitty matter. It is a big deal.\n  The Congressional Budget Office predicts that by 2019, the share of \nFederal expenditures allocated to debt payments will increase from 6 \npercent to 13 percent of the entire economy. That does not include the \nstimulus plan the President will be sending to us.\n  So the next question. A trillion dollars is a staggering sum of money \nto borrow and pay back with interest. How do we know it will be spent \nin the most efficient way to jump-start our economy and get the most \nproductivity for the taxpayers?\n  Well, the truth is, we do not. We know this proposal will have two \ncomponents. The so-called tax credits and direct spending. Now, I have \nto tell you, a good bit of this tax cut is temporary and a good bit of \nit is a sales job. Tax cuts, tax credit: What does that mean? Well, \nsome say 40 percent of that will go to people who do not pay taxes. So \nhow do you get a tax cut if you do not pay taxes? The Government sends \nyou a check from the Treasury just as they did last spring. They got \n$600. So you get a check from Uncle Sam that is supposed to stimulate \nthings and somehow help the economy.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, really under the supervision of the \nCongress--and the Congress is under the control of our Democratic \ncolleagues; they have the majority now--the CBO rightfully scores these \nprovisions not as a tax cut but as direct spending. What else can it \nbe? It is a direct spending of taxpayers' money to send individuals a \ncheck to make them happier for the short term. What kind of long-term \nimpact will there be on them, their children, and the economy in the \nyears to come? What will this unwise prospect create?\n  The Wall Street Journal has pointed out many of these ideas are \ntemporary and that temporary tax cuts do not result in positive \neconomic behavior. But a more permanent change, when people know it is \npermanent, does have more of an impact in helping our economy.\n  Permanent tax relief, including--I have to say, please, do not think \nthis is a way to pander to big business. But the corporate tax rate in \nAmerica is one of the highest in the world: 35 percent. In Ireland, I \nthink it is 11 percent. Most European nations--only one or two nations \nhave as high a tax rate on the corporate community, which gets passed \non as a cost of doing business and makes those corporations less \ncompetitive in the world marketplace.\n  We would be in a lot better shape if we could reduce that in a more \npermanent way. Then those companies could see, well, I am saving on my \ncorporate tax rate. I will not have to lay off as many people. I can \nkeep this company\n\n[[Page S296]]\n\ngoing. Maybe we can invest and be more competitive when we export \nbecause I do not have as much of a burden on me, and it would help this \neconomy. So I want to say many economists truly believe the corporate \ntax is not that, if reduced, would actually encourage economic growth \nand create more jobs.\n  So we know that just rapid expenditures of huge amounts of money have \nnever been a very effective way to grow the economy. Are these spending \nprograms--this $800 billion plus--is that going to end cold turkey in 2 \nyears? I have doubts about it. I want to tell you, I have my doubts \nabout the wisdom of our idea that we can jump-start the economy by \npumping $800 billion into it.\n  So they are talking about--you have heard these numbers--well, we are \ngoing to spend a good bit of money on the infrastructure. Everybody \nlikes highways. Everybody knows they are there for generations to come. \nHighways and bridges have good things that can be said about them and \ncan make our lives better. There is always a line formed whenever there \nis highway money with people wanting to build more highways and more \nbridges. Currently, the Federal Government, which spends a lot of money \non highways, spends, according to Mr. Sunshine, around $40 billion a \nyear on highways. OK. States match it on a 20-percent basis; 80 percent \nFederal, States 20 percent. In some areas it is 90 percent Federal, 10 \npercent State. We use this matching mechanism to fund highway \nconstruction in this country, and it amounts to $40 billion a year.\n  We are talking about $300 billion in 2 years? You take the $300 \nbillion, and cut it in two, that is $150 billion each year. So now we \ngo from $40 billion a year for highways to $150 billion? Well, let's \nsay you only spend $100 billion on it. With $200 billion, that is $100 \nbillion more per year for highways, 2\\1/2\\ times what we are currently \nspending.\n  I would suggest those kinds of figures are unrealistic. When the \nchips are down, I doubt we are going to see anything like that much \nmoney being allocated to highways because it cannot be spent. There are \nnot enough asphalt mixers, there are not enough concrete mixers, there \nare not enough dump trucks to actually spend that much money. That is a \nfact. You cannot triple the amount of work. And if you do, the bid per \nmile and the cost per mile is going to go way up. There is going to be \na shortage dealing with everything in construction.\n\n  We simply cannot throw money at road construction and infrastructure. \nIt has to be understood that since some of this is dropping off as a \nresult of economic slowdowns, we can put that back on, and maybe a \nlittle on top, and keep this thing going at a more healthy rate. That \nmay be possible, and I am willing to discuss that. But we ought not to \nsell the stimulus package that is being discussed that somehow the \nbiggest chunk of it is going to get spent on highways. Right? So $800 \nbillion. Maybe $30 billion a year extra; so $60 billion out of $800. So \n$740 billion. Where is the rest of it going to be spent to stimulate \nthe economy, I ask? ``Shovel ready'' they say. I do not know what that \nmeans. But I know you could not start off in the next few months and \ntriple the number of highways built in America. There are not enough \nengineers. There is not enough heavy equipment. There is not enough \nmaterial to do that. If you were to even try, it would drive up the \ncost, and so we would spend a lot of money, a lot more. We would make \nit much more expensive per mile to build highways in America. We have \nto be careful about that.\n  Well, they also talk about how there is going to be more money in \nthis bill for the automobile companies, and maybe a bailout for State \ngovernments. They need more money too, don't they? So why doesn't the \nFederal Government--which sort of prints money--why don't we bail out \nour good friends at the State level? Unemployment insurance is going to \nneed to be expanded. And some are talking about expanding broadband, \nand, of course, hiring an additional 600,000 Government employees. That \nis part of what is being discussed here.\n  As the Washington Post said, of course, many of these items were \nfeatured in President-elect Barack Obama's campaign pledges. There was \na fine column by Mr. E. J. Dionne, who is openly a good, liberal \ncolumnist and has been a pro-Obama writer throughout. Mr. Dionne said \nit has been rather fortunate for the Obama campaign that he can \nutilize--and I am paraphrasing now, but I think this is close to the \nheart of what he said--it is very fortunate for President-elect Obama \nthat all the spending he promised can now be justified, and they can \ncall it a bailout or a stimulus package and not just a big spending \nprogram.\n  So I think we have to ask questions about that. Can we justify this? \nFundamentally, every dollar we spend as part of regular Government \nspending programs or this stimulus program should result in an \neffective return to the taxpayers. We have no money to waste. We are in \na time of unprecedented, incredible deficits. We ought not to waste a \nsingle dollar. Cannot we all agree on that?\n  Finally, my question would be, how will we Americans pay the trillion \ndollars back? There are three ways: cutting spending in the future. I \ndo not hear anybody saying we need to be cutting spending, not on the \nmajority side here. We talk about education, health care, highways, \nexpanding the number of military personnel. All these things cost \nmoney. I do not see any realistic prospect we will see any huge \nreduction in spending, I have to tell you.\n  You could raise taxes. But I do not like raising taxes. I have tried \nto oppose that throughout my career. President-elect Obama says he \nwants to give everybody a tax break. Who is going to raise taxes in any \nsignificant way? Oh, you can tax the rich and get a little out of them \nwhen the economy is doing pretty good. When the economy goes down and \nthe rich income drops dramatically, the country's tax revenue also \ndrops dramatically. So I do not think we are going to get a lot of \nmoney from that.\n  One way for it to happen and would be a result more pernicious than \nmany have thought about would be where we would basically debase the \ncurrency. We would weaken the value of the dollar. So you borrow $100 \nbillion from somebody, and you pay them back $100 billion, but you \nprinted a lot more dollars, so the dollars they get paid back are less \nvaluable than the ones they gave you when you borrowed it. That is a \npretty slick deal, isn't it? That is what you call inflation. There are \nhuge ramifications from that kind of policy that are very damaging to \nthe long-term health of America. We do not need to debase our currency. \nThat is why the price of gold jumped. People get scared the dollar is \nnot going to be worth anything.\n\n  So I think the debate we are about to begin is really about \nindividual responsibility and governmental responsibility. We do need \nto resist the cries of many who have self-interests in this stimulus \npackage.\n  I heard one prominent businessman make a speech recently. He said: We \nare going after this money. Well, if we put it out there, every \nbusiness is going to go after it and be happy to get it. So we have to \nbe responsible. We need to scrutinize it. We need to act in the long-\nterm interests of America.\n  I believe Congress so far has not done well in responding to the \neconomic crisis we are going through. I think everybody pretty well \nuniversally has agreed that the $160 billion send-out-the-checks \nprogram did not benefit the economy. I heard a group of well-known \neconomists recently agree that the first $350 billion--remember, the \nentire Iraq war has cost us $500 billion--that $350 billion in the \nfirst tranche of money that has gone out has not helped the economy. So \nI think we have to be careful. I hope Congress will not fail our \nconstituents again, by making sure that the fiscal illness we are \nliving with now does not damage our children.\n  I know people are hurting. I know people are worried that their job \nmight not exist in the months to come. If you are working at the \nclothing store, I am not sure some of these jobs are going to be that \nhelpful to you. But at any rate, that is the kind of thing we are \ndealing with. People are worried. We are going through a serious \ndownturn. As the CBO expert told us, we are going to come out of this \nin 2 years, in his opinion--and he was firm about it--whether we did \nanything or not. He said a stimulus package might help. Another member \nof the panel said, well, it\n\n[[Page S297]]\n\nshould help, but neither one said it was critical to us coming out of \nthe recession.\n  So whatever we do, whatever monies we spend--and I am not against \nevery idea for stimulating the economy--let's just be sure it is \nproductive. Approving $1 trillion in deficit spending could do more \nharm than good if we don't do it right.\n  It is time that we as a Nation stop living beyond our means. We need \nto get our house in order. We need to know there is no free lunch; that \ndebts will have to be repaid one way or the other--raising taxes, \ncutting spending in the future, debasing the currency. That is \nbasically the way we can reduce the debt, and those are the only ways \nwe can. We are putting a burden to the future. I know some money \ninvested now might make a positive difference. Let's talk about that \nand let's see what we can do. But the numbers being floated out and the \nrapidity with which the program is being proposed creates in my mind a \ngreat danger that much of the money will not be stimulative, as it has \nfailed to be in the past, and that much of it will not produce the kind \nof tangible benefit to which the taxpayers are entitled.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                   Congratulating the Florida Gators\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, the task happily falls to \nsome of us Senators each year in which we can chronicle the success of \nthe national champion in college football. Of course, there were tens \nof millions of Americans watching TV last Thursday night as the No. 1 \nand No. 2 teams ranked in the country in college football played for \nthe BCS National Championship. Of course, in that game, with two high-\npowered offenses, the University of Florida Gators prevailed.\n  I will be offering a resolution for the Senate to pass to present to \nthe University of Florida and to its coach and to the team. They will \nbe coming here for the traditional visit to the White House to visit \nwith the President later on this year. I am joined--although the Senate \nrules prohibit Albert the Alligator from appearing on the floor of the \nSenate, and as my colleague, the Senator from Alabama, over there is \ngiving the Gator chomp, the University of Alabama rolling tide having \nbeen the victims of the Gator chomp in the SEC championship game--I \nmake note that Albert the Alligator, the University of Florida's \nmascot, is safely ensconced back in the cloakroom since the alligator \nis not allowed onto the floor of the Senate. But all of us are \ncelebrating this tremendous victory.\n  I also wish to mention that since the BCS National Championship \nrotates among the major bowls, this year it was the turn for the Orange \nBowl to have not only the Orange Bowl on January 1 but then the \nnational championship game. The entire Orange Bowl Committee, of which \nthe two Senators from Florida are privileged to be ex-officio members, \nhad conducted such a magnificent event, had done it with great aplomb \nand excellence, great hospitality to the two teams involved, to the \nuniversity administrations, and it was all around a very positive \nexperience.\n  For the national champion Gators, I wish to quote a couple of \narticles. From the columnist Greg Cote and the Miami Herald:\n\n       The Gators flat-out won this game and this title, and all \n     the more impressively because it was less by quarterback Tim \n     Tebow's magic (though he was voted game MVP) than by his \n     defense defusing the other team's epic offense.\n\n  Then I quote from the columnist of the Gainesville Sun, Robbie \nAndreu:\n\n       The Florida Gators apparently were right after all. \n     Oklahoma obviously had not seen a defense like Florida's this \n     season. And Tim Tebow? There's no way he is the fourth-best \n     quarterback in the Big 12. With the defense coming up with \n     critical stops when it had to, and with Tebow, Percy Harvin \n     and the offense generating points when the game was on the \n     line, the Gators were clutch in the second half and beat the \n     Sooners 24-14 Thursday night at Dolphin Stadium to give \n     Florida its third national championship, and second in three \n     years.\n\n  Coach Meyer is quoted:\n\n       This is one of the best teams in the history of college \n     football.\n\n  So we celebrate that.\n  Now, since we are dealing with these weighty problems and here we are \ntaking up a stimulus bill--we are taking up this TARP legislation this \nweek--it is good to have a little levity. Indeed, before this game, I \nwent to the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, and I said: Would you \nlike to have a little friendly wager?\n  What we decided was that the losing team's Senator would sing a song \nin front of the winning Senator's constituents, and we agreed in \nadvance that the songs would be that I would sing ``Oklahoma'' if the \nSooners won, and Senator Coburn would sing ``Rocket Man'' by Elton \nJohn--a favorite of this Senator--if the Gators won.\n  So next Wednesday, 2 days from now, circa noontime, we are going to \nhave a gathering of Florida constituents for Senator Coburn and me. I \nsuggested to Senator Coburn that I would even graciously sing a few \nbars of ``Oklahoma.'' Also, if he couldn't follow the words--and we are \ngoing to play ``Rocket Man'' for him--if he couldn't follow the words, \nclearly we could sing a few bars of the Florida alma matur, the Florida \nfight song, ``We Are The Boys From Old Florida.''\n  It is good to have this levity. It is good to have a wholesome sport \nthat is uniquely American that we can get enthused about. It is good \nthat we have athletics that add so much to a university setting, that \nbring out more of a university personality in addition to the studies, \nthe academics, and the research we are so privileged to have in our \nAmerican universities.\n  So, indeed, this Senator is here to say: All hail, Florida, which \ncomes from the alma matur. All hail, Florida. This time, again, the \nGators are the national champions.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Economic Stimulus\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this \nevening to respond to some of the comments that we have been hearing \nfrom colleagues on the other side of the aisle expressing great concern \nabout the spending of a recovery package for America, as we are talking \nabout today.\n  I find it quite extraordinary when I hear colleagues talking about \nobjecting to spending Federal dollars right now--Federal dollars that \nwould add to the deficit--given where we have come from in the last 8 \nyears. I find it quite extraordinary.\n  I remember back when I was in the House of Representatives, serving \nwith the distinguished Presiding Officer, when in 1997 we took some \nvery tough votes and did a lot of hard work under President Clinton. \nActually, we balanced the budget for the first time in 30 years. That \nput us on a course to eliminate the deficit, to strengthen the country, \nto create the right kinds of priorities for the American people.\n  As a result of that action, in 2001, when I came into the Senate as a \nnew member of the Budget Committee, we were debating what to do with \nthe biggest surplus in American history, $5.7 trillion. How should we \naddress the largest surplus we had seen in the Federal budget. At the \ntime, the Democrats on the committee proposed that we divide that \nsurplus into three parts: one, for tax cuts geared to the middle class; \ntwo, for investments to create jobs, invest in education, and future \nopportunities; and three, to help strengthen Social Security. That was \nrejected. Instead, as we all know now, a very large supply-side tax \ncut, trickle-down economics, was passed. My constituents, in January \n2009, are still waiting for it to trickle down to their pockets. But \nthat was put in place, which began a process that has now led us to the \nhighest deficits in the history of the country in just 8 years. That \nwas coupled with a war that was not paid for, over $10 billion a month, \nand certainly the most important thing has been the loss of life. Then \nwe saw just at the end of the year an effort to provide $700 billion in \nwhat has been dubbed the bailout of Wall Street--to date, I suggest, \nnot very effective and\n\n[[Page S298]]\n\nat times outrageous in terms of what has happened with that money.\n  So it is not that the Federal Government has to spend money, it is \nnot that colleagues on the other side of the aisle have not supported \nspending. They supported spending for 8 years. The question is, What \nare we going to spend it on and for whom? Many Americans have seen \ntheir standard of living go down, their jobs go away, their houses go \naway, their opportunities go away, while some have done very well under \na particular kind of spending over the last 8 years. What I suggest is \nthis is not about whether we spend or invest or use Federal dollars; it \nis about our values and priorities. In whom are we going to invest? \nWhere are we going to spend the dollars? I have had so many people in \nMichigan say to me, with all the debates going on: Where is my bailout? \nI am sure you heard that, Mr. President: Where is my bailout? Small \nbusiness owners: Where is my bailout? Individuals. I suggest what we \nare debating is the American people bailout, the investment in America.\n  The people of this country have resoundingly rejected the policies of \nthe last 8 years that have gotten us to where we are today. That is \nwhat elections are about. People have said very loudly: We don't want \nthe same policies; we don't want the same people espousing the same \npolicies going forward as we have seen in the last 8 years.\n  Where have those policies over the last 8 years gotten us? Over the \nlast 8 years, we have not seen a commitment to manufacturing in this \ncountry. Some people say that is only a narrow special interest for a \ncertain number of States in the country. I suggest it is a foundation \nof the middle class in this country. The fact that we have lost 4.1 \nmillion manufacturing jobs due to the policies of the last 8 years--\n750,000 of those jobs just last year--that totally relates to where we \nare in terms of jobs in this country, what is happening in this \ncountry, and what is happening to middle-class people. The economic \nactivity in the manufacturing sector has fallen to its lowest level in \n60 years. That absolutely equates to the challenges we are currently \nhaving in this economy.\n  In 2008, 2.6 million jobs just in general were lost, the worst year \nsince 1945--8 years of policies put forward by the current \nadministration and supported by many people who have been on the floor \nsince we came back into session arguing we should not do something \ndifferent; we should not try a different kind of investment policy; we \nshould not focus on jobs in America, the middle class, and so on; we \nshould keep doing it the way we have been doing it. That is basically \nwhat we are hearing on the floor, the same kinds of things that have \ngotten us to these numbers--1 million jobs lost last month. Last month, \n1 million Americans. As of December, 11.1 million people were \nunemployed. And we wonder why they cannot pay their mortgages and their \nhomes are going into foreclosure. The jobless rate is the highest in 16 \nyears, and we know it is not going to get better quickly. We know at \nleast the first half of this year--possibly the entire year--is going \nto be very tough. We know that. But common sense would say that we do \nnot embrace the same policies that have gotten us to this point if we \nwant to get out of the hole.\n  It is exciting that next week we are going to swear in a wonderful \nnew President who has policies, working with us, working with all of us \ntogether, that will stop digging the hole and begin to bring us out of \nthe hole, even though we know it is a deep hole, and he has certainly \nstressed that, wisely, with the American people. We are going to begin \nto come out of this hole.\n  Over and over again in the last week, we have been hearing colleagues \nobjecting to a change in economic policy and proposing the same old \nthing. The same old thing has put us in a situation where the U.S. \nmedian home price fell 13 percent in the last year, which is the \nfastest pace since the 1930s. That is what the kinds of policies we are \nhearing on the other side of the aisle have achieved.\n  Mr. President, 3,100 foreclosures happen every day. Today, as we have \nbeen in session, 3,100 families have seen their homes foreclosed upon. \nTomorrow, there will be another 3,100 families; the next day, 3,100 \nfamilies. That is what the policies--action and inaction--of the last 8 \nyears have done. One in ten homeowners with a mortgage is either in \nforeclosure or delinquent on payments.\n  Pension plans, if you are fortunate enough to have had a job, worked \nhard all your life, and put money into a pension--maybe you did not \ntake a pay raise in order to make sure you had that pension--have \nsuffered their steepest 1-year drop in 20 years. The average pension \nfund now is holding assets that would cover only about 75 percent of \nwhat had been promised to workers.\n\n  I could go on and on with the numbers, and you know them as well. The \ngood news is the American people have looked around at what has \nhappened, the trickle-down economic policies of the last 8 years--the \nidea that we can't afford to invest in education for the future or \nhealth care or focus on jobs for the future--they have looked at those \npolicies and said, no more, no more, We have had enough.\n  So that brings us to this point, and we will have the opportunity in \nthe next few weeks to bring forward an economic recovery plan that \nfocuses in a very different way. If we are going to do tax cuts, we \nwant tax cuts for middle-class families and those working hard to get \ninto the middle class to benefit from those and that is the policy we \nwill see coming forward.\n  We are going to see policies that will create jobs rebuilding \nAmerica. I have heard colleagues on the other side of the aisle saying: \nOh, my gosh, they want to not only talk about roads and bridges and \nwater and sewer systems, but they want to talk about broadband--the \nidea of connecting rural communities and small businesses to the \nInternet so they can sell around the world, just like big business \ndoes. Oh, my goodness, you mean they want everybody to have access to \nthe Internet, not just some people? Yes, that is true. We believe the \nnew highway, the information highway, that power needs to be available \nto every child, to every small business, to every farmer at the end of \nthe road. Just as we built the electricity systems, the telephone \nsystems of the past, we need to make sure we are building for the \nfuture in America so everyone has access to these new technologies to \nhave opportunity for jobs and income and education.\n  I am also very involved in making sure we can computerize our health \ncare system so we can cut costs from unnecessary paperwork; that we can \nalso provide the very best quality of health care in every hospital, \nlarge and small, whether you live in a small rural area or an urban \nhospital is where you would go or a suburban hospital.\n  We need to focus on jobs rebuilding America and reinvesting not only \nin the upfront construction jobs but in what that will mean to the \nassets that will be there afterwards, which is very much a part of this \nrecovery plan. We know we want to see alternative energy jobs, and \ncertainly I am very involved in the whole effort to create green jobs. \nI am very proud that last year in the budget resolution we included my \ngreen-collar jobs initiative, which now our new President-elect and his \nteam are working to fund as a part of what we need to do to create the \nnew battery technology. This is not just the research but to build the \nbatteries here in the United States; and not only to have wind energy \nbut to build the wind turbines here and create the jobs; and not only \nto have the solar power but to build the solar units or the solar \npanels, to have the equipment, to have the storage from the batteries \nall done here. That is a part of our vision for a recovery package for \nthe future.\n  Because I have been working so closely with advanced manufacturing in \nthe auto industry, I know an interesting statistic is that if everyone \nhad an electric car today--and we would certainly like that to happen \nfrom an environmental standpoint--we would blow up the electrical grid \nin this country, poof. We would be in deep trouble. So part of what we \nneed to have happen is to upgrade so we have a better electric system \nto be able to handle those new vehicles. We need to create a new kind \nof infrastructure so that when you pull up in your vehicle, which would \nget 40 miles per--what shall I say? It is not 40 miles per gallon \nbecause it is not a gallon. It is 40 miles on the road to a\n\n[[Page S299]]\n\ncharge. Wouldn't it be great to be able to pull up and charge it in a \nparking lot or at a parking meter as you went into the store?\n  There are so many ways we need to build and rebuild America for this \nnew technological world we are in, this new green alternative energy \nworld we are in. That is our hope: Jobs, rebuilding America, and \nbuilding for the future. We not only can achieve very important goals \nof energy independence and tackling in a real and meaningful way the \nserious issue of global warming, but we can create jobs in America, \ngood-paying jobs in America. That is what this recovery plan does, and \nI am very excited to work with the incoming administration and to see \ntheir vision and their commitment to working with us.\n  There are so many pieces of this that will be addressed. I will \nmention one other, and that is when I talked earlier about the numbers \nregarding unemployment and housing and pensions and what is happening \nto people, we have seen now close to a decade--8 years--of neglect, of \nnot paying attention to those who have been hurt by the policies that \nhave been in place. So it is very important that we, in fact, recognize \nthat we have more people out of work than there are currently available \njobs--people who have worked all their lives, people who want to work, \nwho recognize the dignity of work but in the short run need some help. \nPart of this package needs to address this as well, whether it is \nunemployment insurance, whether it is food assistance, whether it is \nhelp with health care during a transition or whether it is addressing \nthose who have lost their jobs because of trade. Those priorities \nrepresent the best of America and who we are, our real values and \npriorities as Americans, understanding that we are in a global economy \nand that transition, at best, even if everything was going well, even \nif every policy was going well, has created pain and suffering for \nthose caught in the middle.\n  Unfortunately, because of a series of policies, whether it is not \nenforcing our trade laws fairly, whether it is not addressing health \ncare or seeing the cutbacks in education, and so on, too many people \nhave been hurt and need some help. Too many people have been hurt in \nthe last 8 years. So a very important part of this recovery plan as \nwell is to make sure those families know we see them, we hear them; \nthat, as Americans, we care about them and want to make sure they have \nthe temporary assistance they need while we are creating these jobs in \nthe new economy.\n  There is a lot of work to do, as we all know, and I would conclude by \nsaying that while we may not know how long it will take for us to move \nout of this deep hole we have been placed in, in terms of job loss and \ndeficits, and so on, here is what we do know: The same thing has been \ntried for 8 years and things have only gotten worse every year. So \nthose who would argue that we should have more of the same I think find \nthemselves in a difficult position because the American people want \nchange. They have voted for change, and they expect us to change the \nvalues and the priorities of this country so that we are, in fact, \ninvesting in our people and in a strong America again.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the 25th National \nCowboy Poetry Gathering, which is held every January in Elko, NV.\n  For 25 years, the National Cowboy Poetry Gathering has been providing \na forum for the expression and celebration of the artistic spirit of \nthose that live and work in the rural West. Through both traditional \nand contemporary forms, this gathering has showcased dancers, \nfilmmakers, musicians, storytellers, and poets--each contributing their \nexperience of the western lifestyle. From urban areas to rural ones, \npeople from across the country gather in Elko every year to listen to \nand experience the artistic soul of the authentic cowboy.\n  The first cowboy poetry gathering was held one weekend in January in \n1985. It drew a crowd that included frontier enthusiasts as well as \nskeptics who questioned whether cowboys could also be poets. After that \nfirst gathering, the poetic nature of the cowboy could no longer be \ndoubted, and what started as a small weekend event eventually \ntransformed into a weeklong cultural excursion that draws thousands of \nvisitors and participants from across the globe. It has reinvigorated \ninterest in preserving and spreading the cowboy narrative, inspiring \nother communities to hold similar events throughout the West.\n  The National Cowboy Poetry Gathering has created an environment that \ncontributes a wealth of riches to our shared western heritage. In \nJanuary of 2009 the Western Folklife Center in Elko will host its 25th \ngathering. I would like to congratulate them on this achievement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/12/senate-section/article/S300-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S300]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ROBERT BYRD\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN.

Mr. President, I rise today to commend Majority Leader Reid \nand Republican Leader McConnell for introducing S. Res. 10, an \nimportant piece of legislation which reaffirms unwavering support of \nthe United Statest for Israel and Israel's right to defend itself and \nprotect its citizens. Hamas' unwillingness to renounce violence and \nrecognize Israel's right to exist is the central impediment to \nachieving a lasting peace between the Israelis and Palestinians. I \nstand strongly with the people of Israel in their efforts to cope with \nthe terrorist threat from Hamas. No nation can be asked to endlessly \nturn the other cheek when its people are subject to indiscriminate, \nunprovoked, and lethal missile strikes. Like all people, the citizens \nof Israel have the right to live safely within secure borders.\n  While the responsibility for the current violence rests with Hamas, \nboth sides must take every possible step to avoid harming innocent \ncivilians. Furthermore, both sides must work towards a durable and \nsustainable ceasefire that prevents Hamas from rearming and improves \nthe daily living conditions of the people in Gaza.\n  The current bloodshed in Gaza is also a grave reminder of Iran's role \nin arming, training, and assisting extremist groups like Hamas. The \nIranian regime is the world's most active state sponsor of terrorism. \nThe current violence further underscores the importance of using \naggressive sanctions to deter the Iranian regime from taking future \nactions that destabilize the region and threaten our democratic allies.\n  We have learned as a nation that terrorism and the advocacy of \nextremism are not distant problems but those which we must confront \nvigilantly. Terrorism has no geographic boundaries. We must continue \nour efforts to confront Islamic extremism and to eliminate terrorists' \nability to strike against the United States and our allies. Therefore, \nI wholeheartedly support S. Res. 10, which underscores our Nation's \ncommitment to help provide for Israel's security and to encourage a \nlasting and secure peace in the Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/12/senate-section/article/S300-4", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S300-S301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               NO OIL EXPORTING AND PRODUCING CARTELS ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, as our economy sinks further into \nrecession, OPEC, which controls about 40 percent of the world oil \nsupplies, has announced its biggest single production cut ever. As a \nresult, since December 17 when the cartel announced its record \nproduction cuts, oil prices have risen 40 percent.\n  For decades, the members of OPEC have conspired to manipulate oil \nprices by limiting the number of barrels sold. U.S. antitrust laws \nexplicitly prohibit conspiracies in restraint of trade, which include \nagreements to cut production in an effort to cause prices to rise. \nCartel activity by OPEC members clearly violates U.S. antitrust laws.\n  Unfortunately, OPEC members have escaped liability for their \nantitrust violations. The Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act makes \nforeign states liable under U.S. law for their commercial activities \nbut not their governmental activities. In International Association of \nMachinists v. OPEC, a California district court held that OPEC's cartel \nactivity was governmental activity, not commercial activity, and was \ntherefore immune from the antitrust laws. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit \naffirmed.\n  These court decisions were wrong. Government-owned companies engaged \nin purely business activities are subject to the antitrust laws.\n  That is why Senator Kohl and myself as well as nine other cosponsors \nare reintroducing the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, or \nNOPEC. The legislation reverses these court decisions, making it clear \nthat cartel activity OPEC is commercial activity that is subject to the \nantitrust laws. NOPEC also makes it clear that OPEC members are subject \nto the jurisdiction of U.S. courts.\n  Applying antitrust law to foreign conduct is consistent with current \nlaw. In Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California, the Supreme Court \nheld that U.S. courts have jurisdiction over antitrust suits involving \nforeign conduct by foreign actors if the conduct has substantial \neffects in the United States. Clearly, OPEC's cartel activities have \nsubstantial effects in the United States.\n  The Justice Department has over the years prosecuted many foreign \ncartels in a myriad of industries, including vitamins, marine hose, \nliquid crystal display panels, textiles, construction, food, chemicals, \ngraphite electrodes, ocean shipping and fine arts auctions. Indeed, \nover the past decade, around half of the corporate defendants in cartel \ncases brought by the Justice Department have been foreign-based. In the \nvitamins case, for example, the Justice Department successfully \nprosecuted a cartel of foreign vitamin manufacturers that held meetings \nabroad to allocate market share and set prices--just like OPEC. In many \nof the cases involving foreign cartels, foreign executives have been \nextradited to the U.S. to serve significant prison sentences.\n  Critics have argued that NOPEC would harm U.S. relations abroad or \ndiscourage foreign investment in the United States. However, NOPEC \nleaves the decision to prosecute OPEC members in the hands of the \nexecutive branch by giving the Justice Department sole authority to \nprosecute.\n  NOPEC enjoys strong bipartisan support and has since its first \nintroduction back in 2000. The Senate Judiciary\n\n[[Page S301]]\n\nCommittee has unanimously passed NOPEC on four separate occasions, most \nrecently on May 22, 2007. During the 109th Congress, the legislation \npassed the Senate by a vote of 70 to 23 as an amendment to the Clean \nEnergy Act. It was stripped out in conference. NOPEC passed the House \nlast year by an overwhelming vote of 345 to 72. The bill even has the \nsupport of the conservative Heritage Foundation, which has noted that \nNOPEC ``would place much needed pressure on OPEC.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/12/senate-section/article/S301-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S301]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO EDYTHE SALZBERGER\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to pay tribute to Edythe \nSalzberger, who passed away at the age of 99 last month. Edythe devoted \nher life to the belief that the creative process is both healing and \nlife enhancing. An interest in art created by psychiatric patients led \nher to the Hillcrest Children's Center, a home for emotionally \ndisturbed children, where she began her years of service to the \ndisabled and distressed. A pioneer in the field of art therapy, Mrs. \nSalzberger wrote numerous articles, trained clinicians and other mental \nhealth professionals, established an art therapy program at Chaim Sheba \nMedical Center in Israel, and helped found the Washington chapter of \nwhat later became the American Art Therapy Association. Art therapy is \nbased on the belief that the creative process involved in artistic \nself-expression helps people solve problems, develop interpersonal and \nconflict resolution skills, manage behavior, reduce stress, increase \nself-esteem and self-awareness, and achieve insight. It is used to \ntreat patients of all ages dealing with a host of problems related to \nemotional and mental disorders, substance abuse, trauma, loss, \nneurological injuries, and psychosocial difficulties resulting from \nmedical illness. A life-long painter, Edythe Salzberger combined her \ndesire to create with her desire to help. She will be missed not only \nby friends and family but by all the patients and practitioners of the \nfield she helped pioneer and the respected professional association she \nhelped create.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the obituary of Edythe Salzberger \nfrom the December 15, 2008, edition of the Washington Post printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From washingtonpost.com, Dec. 15, 2008]\n\n             Edythe Salzberger, 99; Pioneer in Art Therapy\n\n       Edythe Woolf Polsby Salzberger, 99, one of the first art \n     therapists in the Washington area, died Dec. 5 of anemia at \n     her home in Chevy Chase.\n       Mrs. Salzberger was a painter in her early years who \n     received an associate's degree from the Rhode Island School \n     of Design in 1931. She studied painting at the Museum of Fine \n     Arts in Boston and later with artists Robert Brackman and \n     William Shulgold.\n       She developed an interest in art created by psychiatric \n     patients and in 1950 began to study projective drawings under \n     the direction of Fritz Wengraf in New York.\n       ``I always struggled between painting as an end in itself \n     and practicing art therapy,'' she once wrote.\n       Moving to Chevy Chase in 1950, she began working as an art \n     therapist in 1957 at Hillcrest Children's Center, a \n     residential treatment facility for emotionally disturbed \n     children. The center, located on Nebraska Avenue NW on the \n     site of what is now the National Presbyterian Church, later \n     closed for lack of funding and was incorporated into the \n     psychiatric services offered by the National Children's \n     Medical Center. She also provided training to clinicians at \n     D.C. General Hospital on the use of art therapy, and \n     established an art therapy program at Chaim Sheba Medical \n     Center at Tel Hashomer in Israel.\n       Art therapy was a relatively new discipline when Mrs. \n     Salzberger began her career, and she became one of the \n     founders of the Washington chapter of what later became the \n     American Art Therapy Association. She published numerous \n     articles in professional journals and produced one of the \n     first films demonstrating the use of art therapy. Titled \n     ``Michael,'' the film was designed for use in university \n     classes.\n       She was born Edythe Woolf in Providence, R.I. In 1931, she \n     married her college sweetheart, Daniel Polsby II, and lived \n     in New Haven and Norwich, Conn., where her husband was a \n     businessman and farmer. She worked on the family farm during \n     World War II, when agricultural workers were hard to find. \n     The farm produced as many as a thousand eggs daily; they were \n     sold under contract to an Army camp on Cape Cod.\n       Her husband died in 1946, and she moved to Chevy Chase with \n     her three sons. She was one of the founders of Temple Sinai \n     in the District and was active in a number of Jewish \n     charitable organizations.\n       She completed requirements for her undergraduate degree at \n     RISD in the late 1950s.\n       In 1966, she married Henry X. ``Hy'' Salzberger, a recently \n     retired Texas department store executive, and moved to \n     Dallas. She helped her husband in the two organizations he \n     founded, Dallas Taping for the Blind and a local radio \n     station for the blind. She also lectured on art therapy at \n     hospitals and at the University of North Texas, and \n     supervised therapists-in-training.\n       When Mrs. Salzberger's husband died in 1994, she returned \n     to Chevy Chase to be closer to family and friends. She also \n     resumed painting.\n       Her son, Nelson W. Polsby, died in 2007.\n       Survivors include two sons, Allen I. Polsby of Bethesda and \n     Daniel D. Polsby of Fairfax County; eight grandchildren; and \n     two great-grandchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/12/senate-section/article/S301-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S301-S303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, In mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday expenses \nbut also have suggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can \ndo now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond \ntoday. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I am a forester and a close job for me is 100 miles round \n     trip per day. Occasionally I can camp out near the job, but \n     not always. I am required by the nature of forest roads and \n     the nature of my business to drive a four-wheel drive pick-\n     up. This is not energy-efficient, but there is nothing I can \n     do to change the nature of my business.\n       I have been a practicing professional forester for over 40 \n     years, and this crisis is not a surprise to me. I have seen \n     it coming since the Wilderness Act was passed in the early \n     1960's.\n       The current energy crisis is merely one part of the larger \n     problem and that being the misanthropic environmental \n     movement that refuses to use and manage our natural resources \n     for the benefit of mankind and particularly our great nation.\n       When I started my career in forestry, Region 6 of the U.S. \n     Forest Service returned timber stumpage dollars to the U.S. \n     Treasury in addition to the counties for roads and schools. \n     The U.S. Congress, under pressure from an ignorant and \n     dedicated misanthropic preservation movement, has relegated \n     the U.S. Forest Service into a hopeless, ineffective agency \n     that now draws money from the Treasury.\n       The U.S. Forest Service has managed to go from a win-win \n     situation to a lose-lose situation in a little over forty \n     years.\n       I have used the following analogy for years: you or me, \n     Senator Crapo, are given a fully stocked grocery store and \n     within a week have gone broke, have rotting produce, have \n     burned down our storage room and are requesting funds from \n     the bank.\n       The U.S. Forest Service burns millions of acres of forest \n     annually. Insect epidemics are destroying millions of acres \n     annually, and the logging industry has been emasculated to \n     the point whereby firefighting is ineffectual i.e. no roads, \n     no tractors, etc.\n       I may have appeared to go off-track with my discussion of \n     forest management issues, but I assure you the issues \n     confronting forestry are the same as those facing other \n     natural resources, both renewable and non-renewable.\n       The oil industry has regulations forbidding drilling in the \n     Arctic, offshore in continental U.S., no refineries, etc.\n       Energy is suffering, no nuclear, no coal-fired, breaching \n     dams, and, in short, these ``well-intentioned'' environmental \n     whackos are more intent on destroying our capitalist system \n     than saving resources.\n       P.S I am working with folks who own the patent rights on a \n     machine that converts forest slash into a powder that we \n     think is the breakthrough for the cellulosic production of \n     ethanol.\n     Lewis, Eagle.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are retired and on a fixed income. We can drive or not \n     as we wish, unlike other folks who work. All of the things \n     you mentioned in your e-mail should be accomplished. Becoming \n     non-dependent on foreign sources for fuel should be a top \n     priority. When our former President said we will start a \n     program to put us on the moon before, the\n\n[[Page S302]]\n\n     population and industry responded. If our leaders will take \n     the same approach to developing our oil sources, wind power, \n     nuclear power, and all other alternative energy, and \n     encourage conservation, I believe the American people and \n     industry will rise to the challenge. Why did we not learn the \n     last time when we all parked in lines on our given day to get \n     gas?\n     Laura, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I cannot understand why Congress cannot see the need to \n     allow the United States to access more of our own energy \n     sources. Yes, we need new alternative fuels, but we also need \n     to become more realistic about our solutions to the energy \n     crisis. We need to combine research and start making use of \n     our own current oil discoveries. We need to start drilling in \n     the places where oil has already been discovered. Why has \n     Congress ridiculed President Bush when he asked the Saudis to \n     produce more oil when Congress refused to do the same right \n     in our own country? He did ask Congress first. I would like \n     to see the Congress invite the scientists who do not agree \n     with man-made global warming to testify and bring their facts \n     forward. Forming an energy policy on an unproven crisis does \n     not make much sense.\n       On another subject, why do the senators only take calls and \n     emails from their home states when all of you represent the \n     United States of America and your actions impact all of us?\n     Gloria.\n                                  ____\n\n       We have let the left with their environmental agenda hijack \n     our country and many [conservatives] are allowing it to \n     happen. If we do not start drilling in ANWR and offshore \n     [and] using coal in place of petroleum, we are going to be in \n     a world of hurt. Alternative energy sources are going to be \n     great when they get here, but that is a generation away. As a \n     country trying to stave off the jihadist and Latin dictators, \n     we had better be self-dependent on our own energy. I hope \n     Congress understands their culpability in this mess as well \n     as the President. How about a reduction in fuel taxes? If the \n     American people continue to be pressed, they will react; \n     there are unintended consequences that may be very surprising \n     to some. Thanks for your service to Idaho.\n     Wade.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are a retired couple. When we were working, we socked \n     lots of our money into various retirement funds and, \n     therefore we are comfortable even with the high energy costs, \n     at least at the present time. Due to our fixed incomes, we \n     watch prices going sky high and this gives us concern.\n       ABC News, June 11, 2008 released the following and I am \n     wondering if you could verify this.\n       ``Congress decides how much oil companies are taxed, what \n     forms of alternative energy development--such as solar and \n     wind power--are subsidized, where oil companies can drill and \n     how fuel efficient our cars need to be.''\n       ``For years, lawmakers have fought over proposals to expand \n     offshore drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and to allow drilling \n     in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska. Republicans \n     have pushed for such increased exploration, but Democrats \n     killed the latest push, saying it would do little to ease gas \n     prices in the short term and could have dire environmental \n     consequences.''\n       ``There is oil in the Arctic but getting it would come at a \n     cost.''\n       ``The Democrats came back with their own hodgepodge of \n     ideas, including giving the president the authority to \n     declare an `energy emergency' and sue OPEC nations, prosecute \n     price gougers and assess a `windfall profit tax' on oil \n     companies. Senate Republicans killed that measure.''\n       ``And for years Congress has ignored proposals to increase \n     fuel-efficiency standards, or CAFE standards. The standards \n     just got their first major overall in three decades with the \n     new legislation calling for automakers to boost fleet wide \n     gas mileage to 35 miles per gallon by 2020.''\n       ``Although the public has clearly moved to the acceptance \n     stage, Congress has not. Congress is still stuck at this \n     anger stage so they want to blame speculators. They are \n     pandering. They want people to feel good about themselves. \n     They want somebody to blame.''\n       ``There is also a lot of money at stake for the \n     politicians. The oil and gas industry is one of the top \n     donors to political campaigns year after year.''\n       ``In 2004, the industry donated more than $25 million to \n     politicians around the country, according to the Center of \n     Responsive Politics.''\n       ``And the bulk of that money--more than $20 million--went \n     to Republicans. Bush's re-election campaign alone received \n     $2.7 million of that money. (Bush also got nearly $2 million \n     from the oil and gas industry in 2000.)\n       ``Washington politicians set the nation's energy policy but \n     could they be doing more?\n       ``This year is also turning out to be a lucrative one for \n     politicians, with more than $14 million from the Industry \n     reported to the Federal Election Commission by the end of \n     April, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.''\n       ``And again, that money is flowing mostly to Republicans--\n     this time about 73 percent of contributions.''\n       ``But there is more money at stake. The oil and gas \n     companies spend millions of additional dollars, hiring a mass \n     of lobbyists to push legislation their way. In the last \n     decade, the Center for Responsive Politics has tracked more \n     than $640 million spent by oil and gas companies on \n     lobbying.''\n       Not all the blame rests with politicians.\n       We Americans are addicted to our cars, driving more than \n     necessary, thanks, at one time, to cheap gas. Instead of \n     living close to our workplaces, we have chosen to live in \n     large suburban developments or in faraway rural areas that \n     require a car for even the simplest of errands. Americans \n     spend more than 100 hours commuting to work each year, \n     according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That is more time than \n     most Americans spend on vacation. In 2003, the average daily \n     commute was more than 24 minutes. And most of that time is \n     spent alone in a car.\n       America has less than 5 percent of the world's population \n     but we consume about 25 percent of the world's energy \n     resources. China and India are rapidly increasing their share \n     of the energy market--which is helping to drive up prices--\n     but America still dominates.\n       Americans have abandoned cities to live in sprawling \n     suburbs that require a car. Americans have also been buying \n     large gas-guzzling cars for decades, most recently big SUVs. \n     Consider this: The Ford F-Series pickup truck has been the \n     best-selling vehicle in the United States for 26 years. \n     (There were occasional months when it was beaten in sales--\n     but always by another truck, usually the Chevrolet \n     Silverado.) Some drivers are changing their habits now.\n       If the OPEC nations decided to increase production by, say, \n     1 million barrels, then there might be some relief in the \n     markets. While such an increase might lead to lower prices at \n     the pump now, it is not a long-term solution. There is only \n     so much oil in the ground, and if more is pumped today there \n     is less for the future. With explosive growth in China, India \n     and elsewhere it is very likely that all the extra oil would \n     quickly be consumed and prices would skyrocket again.\n       Oil prices are high because of worldwide demand. But part \n     of the price spike comes from market moves. The first--and \n     easiest to understand--is that oil is priced in U.S. dollars. \n     So when the value of the dollar falls, as it has in the past \n     year, the price of oil goes up for Americans.\n       But the market is much more complex than that. Many \n     investors--some call them speculators--are pouring money into \n     oil when they had previously ignored it. Basically, many \n     investors are spooked by the subprime housing market and \n     other problems with the financial sectors, and have fled from \n     the stock market. Instead of investing in stocks and bonds, \n     these investors have chosen to place their money in oil, \n     driving up the price.\n       Bill O'Grady, chief investment strategist for energy at \n     Wachovia Securities, said that part of the problem also has \n     to do with the Federal Reserve setting interest rates so low. \n     He said that when inflation is 4 percent but investors are \n     only getting 1 percent for their cash in the bank, they look \n     for other investment options. Normally, real estate would be \n     one of those options. But with that market collapsed \n     investors are turning toward commodities such as gold, corn \n     and oil.\n       Plus, every time there is some geopolitical fear, prices \n     rise. The latest such tension comes as Israel and Iran, the \n     world's fourth largest oil exporter, are having a way of \n     words. Israel has threatened to attack Iran's nuclear \n     program, and Iran has threatened a strong reprisal.\n       This above came from the ABC News--June 11, 2008.\n       I understand there is a very large quantity of oil in North \n     Dakota, Montana and Southern Saskatchewan. What's the problem \n     with going after these? I would appreciate your response to \n     the above. Thanks you for the opportunity to relate these \n     issues to you.\n     Helen, Rupert.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would like to thank all the players in Washington DC for \n     bringing the price of oil up to its current level to help \n     save the environment, I never realized how green the \n     administration and Congress actually were. Allowing jobs to \n     be shipped over seas, borrowing money from China to fund a \n     war that cannot be won, and allowing the housing crisis to \n     occur are all some of the best policies one could think of to \n     raise the cost of fuel for the little guy and at the same \n     time reducing the emission of greenhouse gases. I would like \n     to thank all the millionaires that we have representing us in \n     DC; I am sure they all have fully funded re-election war \n     chests.

My husband works 8 miles \n     from home; our adult daughter works 8 miles from home; our \n     adult son works 12 miles from home; and I spend my time \n     driving to doctor appointments in Meridian and downtown Boise \n     (12-20 miles)--and back. As you mentioned, there is no public \n     transportation.\n       During the summer, our children work almost fulltime, and \n     they each earn approximately $1,000 per month. They both \n     drive high-mileage vehicles, but their gasoline bill is now \n     approximately $120 per month. When the school year begins, \n     they will both cut back on their working hours and increase \n     the number of miles they drive, as they both attend BSU. \n     Their income will drop to approximately $700 per month, and \n     they will be adding approximately 70 miles per week to their \n     mileage, at an estimated additional cost of $70 per month. If \n     their schedules permit, they can carpool to school, leaving a \n     car in Meridian so they can each drive to work in the \n     afternoon. Obviously, this does not leave much room in their \n     budgets for car insurance and other expenses. Fortunately, \n     they live at home with us.\n       My husband and I have greatly reduced the number of times \n     we go out to dinner, and we select more fast-food restaurants \n     lately. We try to run our errands while we are out in \n     Meridian and combine trips. My husband recently had to fly to \n     Florida on business. Normally, we would pay for me to join \n     him; we did not do that this time, as airline tickets are \n     prohibitive. We had already arranged to rent a cabin in \n     California for a week, as our summer vacation, and that trip \n     begins next week. Since we are taking five adults and two \n     cats, we will be driving a Chevy Suburban (ouch!). We have \n     not even estimated what that is going to cost in gasoline, \n     because calculating it would only ruin our vacation. It will \n     be interesting to find out which was the higher cost, the \n     rental of the cabin or the gasoline for the car. Needless to \n     say, we will not be renting a cabin in California for our \n     next vacation if gas prices continue to be this high. We are \n     also seeing the prices of groceries inch up. The cereal boxes \n     and ice cream cartons are smaller, but they run out faster. \n     My husband and I do not have a lot of cushion in our budget \n     to help our children with their budgets. I am unable to work \n     because of health issues (but social security does not want \n     to pay me the disability benefits I earned). My husband's \n     employment at Western States Equipment (Caterpillar) is all \n     that is keeping us afloat.\n       Thank you so much for all that you do for Idaho families, \n     and we hope this information helps you in your endeavors. Any \n     help would be great.\n     Sondra, Kuna.\n                                  ____\n\n       Energy prices affect all aspects of our lives.

Mr. President, during a long and distinguished \ncareer in many fields of public service, Ambassador Kenneth Quinn has \nreceived countless awards and honors. But I daresay that the award he \nwill receive tomorrow from the Department of Defense is the longest \ndelayed and hardest earned of his distinctions. Ambassador Quinn will \nbecome the first civilian ever to receive the Air Medal for Combat \nService, an award created during World War II to honor courageous and \nmeritorious service in aerial combat.\n  From November 1968 to June 1973, Kenneth Quinn served as a Foreign \nService officer in Vietnam. For his first 2 years in that country, he \nwas assigned to Advisory Team 65 in Sa Dec Province, replacing an Army \nmajor as senior adviser to the team. In that capacity, he took part in \nthe same military activities and combat operations as his military \npredecessors. All totaled, he participated in some 250 hours of \nhelicopter combat operations. He served in night helicopter patrols \nover Viet Cong-held sectors and took part in helicopter operations to \ninsert and extract troops from the battlefield. On other occasions, he \ndirected helicopter gunship operations from a command-and-control \nhelicopter flying just several hundred feet above the battlefield, \nrepeatedly coming under enemy fire. On still other occasions, he \nparticipated in ground combat operations, night ambushes, and brown \nwater naval combat operations.\n  This is just one chapter in the remarkably accomplished career of \nthis Dubuque, IA, native. He served for more than three decades in the \nForeign Service, becoming one of the most decorated and respected \nAmerican diplomats of his generation. Ambassador Quinn was one of the \nU.S. Government's top experts on Indochina, having written his doctoral \ndissertation on Pol Pot's regime in Cambodia. Indeed, he is widely \nacknowledged to have been the first westerner to discover and report on \nthe holocaust being perpetrated by the Khmer Rouge. Later, while \nserving as Ambassador to Cambodia, he played a key role in the 1999 \ncapture of the last remaining Khmer Rouge general. Upon his retirement \nas Ambassador to Cambodia, he was presented the Secretary of State's \nAward for Heroism and Valor for protecting Americans citizens exposed \nto danger in Cambodia and for his participation in four lifesaving \nrescues in Vietnam.\n  The common theme in Ambassador Quinn's career has been his commitment \nto serving causes higher than himself. He has undertaken humanitarian \nmissions that have saved countless thousands of lives. In 1978, under a \nspecial exchange program with the Foreign Service, he was allowed to \nreturn to Iowa to join the staff of Governor Robert Ray. He played a \nlead role in the Governor's program to resettle Indochinese refugees in \nIowa, and he served as executive director of the 1979 Iowa SHARES \nProgram, which sent Iowa medical personnel, supplies, and food to \nCambodia during a period of mass starvation there.\n  Following his retirement from the State Department 8 years ago this \nmonth, Ambassador Quinn returned to Iowa to assume leadership of the \nWorld Food Prize Foundation, the Des Moines-based organization \ndedicated to ending hunger around the world by promoting the \nsustainable production and distribution of an adequate and nutritious \nfood supply. The World Food Prize--created by Nobel Peace Prize-winner \nand Iowa native Dr. Norman Borlaug and supported for many years by Iowa \nbusiness leader and philanthropist John Ruan--is the most prestigious \ninternational award recognizing exemplary work in improving the \nquality, quantity, or availability of food in the world.\n\n[[Page S304]]\n\n  Mr. President, Ambassador Quinn has served our Nation as a diplomat, \na soldier, and a passionate humanitarian. At every stage of his \nbrilliant career in public service, he has embodied America's highest \nideals, and he has earned renown for his courage, initiative, and \nselfless dedication. I join with my colleagues in the Senate in \ncongratulating Ambassador Quinn as he becomes, tomorrow in Washington, \nthe first civilian ever to be awarded the Air Medal for Combat \nService.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/12/senate-section/article/S304-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  The following message from the President of the United States was \ntransmitted to the Senate by one of his secretaries:\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/12/senate-section/article/S304-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S304]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT RELATIVE TO THE EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT OF 2008--PM \n                                   2\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Consistent with section 115(a)(3) of the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-343) (the ``Act''), I hereby \ntransmit a report detailing the plan of the Secretary of the Treasury \nto exercise the authority under the Act.\n                                                      George W.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the State of \n     New Jersey memorializing Congress to protect the automobile \n     industry and expand national infrastructure projects and \n     related industries; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \n     Urban Affairs.\n\n                        Senate Resolution No. 37\n\n       Whereas, a number of specialists have warned that the \n     collapse of the national economy could occur if certain stop-\n     gap and long-term actions are not implemented to overcome the \n     problems facing the automotive and machine tool sectors of \n     our economy; and\n       Whereas, the loss of the physical capabilities of the \n     automotive industry, especially its tool sector, could mean \n     the end of America's status as a leading world economic \n     power; and\n       Whereas, while it is in the best interests of our national \n     security to have a strong, vibrant manufacturing and \n     industrial sector, capable of producing the necessary \n     machinery and technology to defend the citizens of the United \n     States and protect our interests abroad, our manufacturing \n     and industrial sector has experienced a dramatic reduction in \n     capacity and production over the last several decades; and\n       Whereas, government has an obligation to promote economic \n     activity through the creation of new capital investment, \n     which will result in the expansion of employment \n     opportunities and help jump-start long-term capital \n     investment by private investors; and\n       Whereas, as government leaders, we must ensure the \n     continued viability of our automotive and machine tool \n     industries, which is a vital element of the State and federal \n     economy; and\n       Whereas, diversification of the productive potential of the \n     automotive and machine tool industries into a broader sector \n     of production, coupled with a shift into the domain of \n     essential capital goods and economic infrastructure, such as \n     the repair, expansion, and improvement of our national \n     railway systems, and the development of other urgently needed \n     infrastructure projects, will save existing manufacturing \n     jobs and create large new areas of employment in \n     infrastructure and manufacturing for our citizenry in a \n     manner comparable to the best of the New Deal programs that \n     rescued the nation and the world from the ravages of the \n     Great Depression; and\n       Whereas, the impact of this intervention will be to provide \n     thousands of productive jobs in the state of New Jersey, \n     repair our infrastructure, and create at least ten million \n     jobs nationally, thus restoring our tax base and increasing \n     the standard of living: Now, therefore; be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the State of New Jersey:\n       l. The Senate of the State of New Jersey respectfully \n     memorializes the Congress of the United States to intervene \n     on behalf of national economic interests to ensure that the \n     productive potential of the automobile industry, with its \n     featured technology and machine tool capability, be \n     protected.\n       2.

A bill to amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to modify \nthe requirements for participation in the visa waiver program and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill on \nbehalf of myself and Senator Kyl to mitigate the immigration and \nsecurity risks associated with the Visa Waiver Program and its \nexpansion.\n  The Visa Waiver Program leaves open both a major gap in our domestic \nsecurity and a way to exploit our immigration laws. The Strengthening \nthe Visa Waiver Program to Secure America Act would give the Department \nof Homeland Security, DHS, new tools to secure the Visa Waiver Program, \nconsistent with the recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission.\n  The bill would set a maximum low visa overstay rate for all visa \nwaiver program countries; require a reevaluation of visa waiver program \ncountries within 1 year; mandate that the administration will lose its \nauthority to continue to expand the program if it does not track 97 \npercent of those exiting and departing at our airports--based on \narrival data, not just departure data; require an audit of the \nelectronic travel authorization system, ESTA; and require current visa \nwaiver countries to report on lost or stolen visas in order to remain \nin the visa waiver program.\n  Senator Kyl and I have held multiple hearings over the years and time \nand time again we have expressed concern and requested improvements, \nbut no changes have been forthcoming in how the Department of Homeland \nSecurity intends to implement this program.\n  The hearings and the recent Government Accountability Office report \nfound that the administration is not doing what it should to secure the \nprogram. Instead, the Visa Waiver Program has continued to expand \nwithout meeting the security needs of our country.\n  In fact, just today the administration has announced that it has met \nthe deadline for the electronic travel authorization system, ESTA, to \nbe fully operational. However, the GAO report found that ESTA--the one \nsecurity check for visa waiver travelers prior to arrival at our \nNation's airports--has not been implemented effectively by the \nadministration to make it a workable system for the airlines and \nembassies.\n  The GAO report also found that the administration is still unable to \ntrack who comes in and out of this country. This is especially \nsignificant given that the program was recently expanded to countries \nwith high visa overstay rates, bringing the number of participating \ncountries to 35.\n  This means that for the citizens of 35 countries--including \nAustralia, Singapore, Slovenia, and the United Kingdom--entering the \nUnited States is as simple as purchasing an airline ticket and arriving \nat the airport with a valid passport in hand.\n  The result is that these travelers not only bypass the interview and \nindividualized security screening process, but they are also lost once \nthey arrive in the U.S. because DHS is only checking when individuals \ndepart at our airports, not if they overstay their visit.\n  It is estimated that 40 percent of the current undocumented \npopulation are people who have overstayed their visas. That means that \nif there are 12 million\n\n[[Page S310]]\n\nundocumented people now in the U.S., 4.8 million people overstayed \ntheir visa. The Visa Waiver Program is the achilles heel of our \nimmigration system.\n  The security risks associated with the Visa Waiver Program are even \ngreater--Our Nation's security experts have stated repeatedly that the \nprogram provides an attractive option to terrorists looking to do \nAmericans harm.\n  At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on September 27, 2007, DNI \nDirector Mike McConnell testified that Al Qaeda is purposefully \nrecruiting Europeans because they do not require a visa to come into \nthis country.\n  As Director McConnell said, this tactic gives Al Qaeda ``an extra \nedge in getting an operative or two or three into the country with the \nability to carry out an attack that might be reminiscent of 9-11.''\n  Secretary Chertoff reiterated these concerns when he stated that \n``terrorists are increasingly looking to Europe as both a target and a \nplatform for terrorist attacks'' against the United States.\n  In an interview with BBC's ``World News America,'' Secretary Chertoff \nacknowledged, ``the first time we encounter [visa waiver travelers] is \nwhen they arrive in the United States and that creates a very small \nwindow of opportunity to check them out.''\n  These security risks are particularly apparent when we look at the \nstatistics on the number of fraudulent and stolen passports and other \ninternational documents.\n  Between January 2002 and June 2004, 28 foreign governments, including \nvisa waiver countries, reported 56,943 stolen blank foreign passports \nto the State Department. And just this summer, a security van in London \nwas hijacked, resulting in the loss of 3,000 blank British passports \nand visas that were destined for overseas embassies.\n  DHS's own Inspector General, Clark Ervin has testified that: ``The \nlost and stolen passport problem is the greatest security problem \nassociated with the Visa Waiver Program. Our country is vulnerable \nbecause gaps in our treatment of lost and stolen passports remain.''\n  The Strengthening the Visa Waiver Program to Secure America Act would \nput necessary security checks firmly in place and provide greater \nprogram oversight.\n  We must act now to secure the Visa Waiver Program. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 203\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Sherman Act to make oil-producing and \nexporting cartels illegal; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, with ten of my \ncolleagues, the No Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act, NOPEC. This \nlegislation will authorize our Government, for the first time, to take \naction against the illegal conduct of the OPEC oil cartel. It is time \nfor the U.S. Government to fight back on efforts to fix the price of \noil and hold OPEC accountable when it acts illegally. Our amendment \nwill hold OPEC member nations to account under U.S. antitrust law when \nthey agree to limit supply or fix price in violation of the most basic \nprinciples of free competition.\n  NOPEC will authorize the Attorney General to file suit against \nnations or other entities that participate in a conspiracy to limit the \nsupply, or fix the price, of oil. In addition, it will specify that the \ndoctrines of sovereign immunity and act of state do not exempt nations \nthat participate in oil cartels from basic antitrust law. I have \nintroduced this legislation in each Congress since 2000. This \nlegislation passed the full Senate by a vote of 70-23 in June 2007 as \nan amendment to the 2007 Energy Bill before being stripped from that \nbill in the conference committee. The identical House version of NOPEC \npassed the other body as stand alone legislation in May 2007 by an \noverwhelming 345-72 vote. It is now time for us to at last pass this \nlegislation into law and give our Nation a long needed tool to \ncounteract this pernicious and anti-consumer conspiracy.\n  Throughout 2007 and 2008, crude oil and gasoline prices marched \nsteadily upwards, peaking last summer at over $140 per barrel for crude \nand well over $4 per gallon for gasoline. In recent months, of course, \nthese prices have plummeted as demand has dropped due to the serious \nglobal economic recession. But the recent declines in crude oil and \ngasoline prices should not fool us--the global oil cartel remains a \nmajor force conspiring to raise oil prices to the detriment of American \nconsumers.\n  The recent actions of the OPEC cartel demonstrate the dangers it \npresents. OPEC is doing everything it can to raise oil prices. On \nOctober 24, 2008, OPEC agreed to cut production by 1.5 million barrels \na day, don December 17 OPEC agreed to a further 2.2 million barrels a \nday production cut. The OPEC cartel makes no secret of its motivation \nfor these production cuts. OPEC President Chaib Khelil put it very \nsimply in an interview published December 23, 2008, ``Without these \ncuts, I don't think we'd be seeing $43 [per barrel] today, we'd have \nseen in the $20s. . . . [H]opefully by the third quarter [of 2009] we \nwill see prices rising.'' In another interview in December, Khelil was \nquoted as saying ``The stronger the decision [to cut production], the \nfaster prices will pick up.''\n  And if the price of crude oil begins to rise again as a result of \nthese actions by OPEC, there is no doubt that millions of American \nconsumers will feel the pinch every time they visit the gas pump. The \nFederal Trade Commission has estimated that 85 percent of the \nvariability in the cost of gasoline is the result of changes in the \ncost of crude oil.\n  Such blatantly anti-competitive conduct by the oil cartel violates \nthe most basic principles of fair competition and free markets and \nshould not be tolerated. If private companies engaged such an \ninternational price fixing conspiracy, there would no question that it \nwould be illegal. The actions of OPEC should be treated no differently \nbecause it is a conspiracy of nations.\n  For years, this price fixing conspiracy of OPEC nations has unfairly \ndriven up the cost of imported crude oil to satisfy the greed of the \noil exporters. We have long decried OPEC, but, sadly, no one in \nGovernment has yet tried to take any action. This NOPEC legislation \nwill, for the first time, establish clearly and plainly that when a \ngroup of competing oil producers like the OPEC nations act together to \nrestrict supply or set prices, they are violating U.S. law.\n  It is also important to point out that this legislation will not \nauthorize private lawsuits. It only authorizes the Attorney General to \nfile suit under the antitrust laws for redress. It will always be in \nthe discretion of the Justice Department and the President as to \nwhether to take action to enforce NOPEC. Our legislation will not \nrequire the Government to bring a legal action against OPEC member \nnations, and no private party will have the ability to bring such an \naction. This decision will entirely remain in the discretion of the \nexecutive branch. Our NOPEC legislation will give our law enforcement \nagencies a tool to employ against the oil cartel--but the decision on \nwhether to use this tool will entirely be up to the Justice Department \nand, ultimately, the President. They can use this tool as they see \nfit--to file a legal action, to jawbone OPEC in diplomatic discussions, \nor defer from any action should they judge foreign policy or other \nconsiderations warrant it.\n  NOPEC will also make plain that the nations of OPEC cannot hide \nbehind the doctrines of ``sovereign immunity'' or ``act of state'' to \nescape the reach of American justice. In so doing, our amendment will \noverrule one 28 year old lower court decision which incorrectly failed \nto recognize that the actions of OPEC member nations was commercial \nactivity exempt from the protections of sovereign immunity.\n  The most fundamental principle of a free market is that competitors \ncannot be permitted to conspire to limit supply or fix price. There can \nbe no free market without this foundation. We should not permit any \nnation to flout this fundamental principle.\n  Some critics of this legislation have argued that suing OPEC will not \nwork or that threatening suit will hurt more than help. I disagree. Our \nNOPEC legislation will, for the first time, enable our Justice \nDepartment to take legal action to combat the illegitimate price-fixing \nconspiracy of the oil cartel. It will, at a minimum, have a real \ndeterrent effect on nations that seek to join forces to oil prices to \nthe detriment of consumers. This legislation will be the first real \nweapon the U.S. Government has ever had to deter OPEC from its \nseemingly endless cycle of supply cutbacks designed to raise price. It \nwill mean that OPEC member nations will face the possibility of real \nand substantial antitrust sanctions should they persist in their \nillegal conduct. It will also deter additional nations who may today be \nconsidering joining OPEC.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our NOPEC legislation so that our \nNation will finally have an effective means to combat this price-fixing \nconspiracy of oil-rich nations.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 204\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize additional resources to identify and \neliminate illicit sources of firearms smuggled into Mexico for use by \nviolent drug trafficking organizations, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Southwest \nBorder Violence Reduction Act of 2009. This important legislation, \nwhich is cosponsored by Senators Hutchison, Durbin, and Feinstein, is \naimed at addressing drug-related violence in Mexico by reducing the \nnumber of weapons that are illegally smuggled into the country.\n  The ongoing violence in Mexico is having a devastating impact on the \ncountry. In 2008, more than 5,300 people were killed in Mexico--this is \ndouble the number in the previous year. During this last year, there \nwere over 1,600 deaths just in Ciudad Juarez. Drug traffickers are \nwarring with each other, assassinations of police and government \nofficials are commonplace, lawyers and journalists have been killed, \nand many innocent civilians have been caught up in the crossfire.\n  Border communities within the United States are also being directly \nimpacted. Many of the people living in this region have strong family \nties to Mexico and the violence makes it difficult to visit loved ones. \nU.S. border hospitals have had to provide medical care to the wounded \nunder armed guard. And in New Mexico, we had to briefly shut down the \nColumbus Port of Entry due to gun battles in the Mexican border town of \nPalomas and provide police escorts to school buses passing through the \narea. At one point this last year, the entire police force in Palomas \nresigned due to threats by drug traffickers and the Chief of Police \nfled to the United States to seek asylum.\n  Besides the horrific human toll this violence is having on \ncommunities throughout Mexico, it also impacts the overall economy of \nthe border region. Everyday thousands of people travel back and forth \nbetween the United States and Mexico for business and pleasure. This \nflow of people and goods is an essential aspect of maintaining healthy \neconomic activity on both sides of the border. However, the current \nsecurity situation is hampering bilateral trade, new business ventures, \nand tourism. In these tough economic times, the violence exacerbates an \nalready bad economic environment.\n  The United States has taken some important steps to help Mexico fight \ndrug traffickers, such as increasing bilateral cooperation and \nproviding substantial financial assistance as part of the Merida \ninitiative. However, there is much more that we can be doing to help \nquell this violence. One key area where more can and should be done is \nwith regard to stopping the flow of weapons being smuggled into Mexico \nfrom the United States.\n  According to the ATF, about 90 percent of the weapons confiscated in \nMexico come from sources within the United States because firearms are \nmuch more readily accessible in the United States than in Mexico. These \nweapons are the so-called ``tools of the trade'' for narco-traffickers. \nThey are the means by which cartels maintain control over drug \ncorridors and the instrument they use to execute their scheme of \nviolence and intimidation.\n  In the four U.S. border States there are about 6,600 licensed gun \ndealers. The vast majority of these dealers act in accordance with the \nlaw, but drug gangs exploit the availability of weapons in the region \nto supply cartels on the Mexican side of the border with illegal high-\npowered weapons.\n  The ATF has a very successful initiative in place to combat \nsouthbound illicit weapons trafficking, know as Project Gunrunner, but \nthey need more resources to adequately tackle the problem.\n  The Southwest Border Violence Reduction Act would provide these much \nneeded resources. Specially, this legislation would authorize $30 \nmillion over 2 years to expand Project Gunrunner teams in the border \nregion and $19 million to assign agents to U.S. consulates in Mexico to \nassist Mexican law enforcement with smuggling investigations.\n  I would also like to make it clear that nothing in this bill limits \nthe sale of firearms or places any additional restrictions on licensed \ndealers. This effort is only focused on enhancing the investigative \ncapabilities of the ATF with regard to arms trafficking in order to \nweed out the bad actors and to ensure that weapons aren't being \nillegally smuggled across the border.\n  The United States has traditionally focused on enhancing efforts to \nprevent illegal narcotics from being smuggled into the county. While we \nobviously need to dedicate resources toward this end, we also should be \ntaking a comprehensive approach that recognizes that the northbound \nflow of narcotics is dependent on the southbound flow of weapons and \ncurrency. Denying traffickers the proceeds of drug sales and the \nability to heavily arm their cartels is essential in reducing the drug \nflow into the United States.\n  It is insufficient to simply rely on Mexican authorities to stop the \nflow of guns going into their country. Drug trafficking is a \ntransnational threat and the solution must involve sustained \ncooperation between the United States and Mexico. We must do more on \nour side of the border to disrupt weapons smuggling if we are going to \nbe successful in combating drug cartels.\n  Instability and violence in Mexico is taking a toll on communities on \nboth sides of the border. I strongly believe that this is an issue that \ndeserves more attention, and I hope my colleagues will support this \nbipartisan legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 205\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to establish a program to help States expand the education \nsystem to include at least 1 year of early education preceding the year \na child enters kindergarten; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I rise to reintroduce the Early \nEducation Act. Early education is critical to preparing children across \nour Nation with the initial skills and abilities to successfully begin \ntheir education. While the amount of support for early education has \nbeen increasing, great discrepancies remain between the quality of \nprograms and the level of access from State to State.\n  This bill is a step forward in making a national commitment to giving \nall children access to high quality pre-kindergarten programs that have \nbeen proven to have a solid impact on a child's success later in school \nand in life.\n  Of the more than 8 million 3- and 4-year-olds that could be in early \neducation, just over half are enrolled in an early education program. \nIn my State of California alone, just fewer than 60 percent of 3- and \n4-year-olds are in some kind of preschool.\n  The result is that too many children enter elementary school \nunprepared to learn.\n  Studies have shown that children who participate in pre-kindergarten \nprograms are less likely to be held back a grade, show greater learning \nretention and initiative, have better social skills, are more \nenthusiastic about school, and are more likely to have good attendance \nrecords.\n  Almost all experts now agree that an early education experience is \none of the most effective strategies for improving later school \nperformance. The National Research Council reported that pre-\nkindergarten educational opportunities are critical in developing early \nlanguage and literacy skills and preventing reading difficulties in \nyoung children.\n  The future of our Nation's economy depends on the next generation of \nworkers, and high-quality early childhood education is key to preparing \nthem for their careers. In the long run, pre-kindergarten programs pay \nfor themselves. Decades of research have proven that early education \nprograms yield between $7 to $16 for every dollar invested.\n   My bill, the Early Education Act, would create a program in at least \n10 States to provide 1 year of pre-kindergarten early education in \npublic schools. The bill would require a dollar for dollar match by the \nStates and would authorize no less than $300 million annually for these \nprograms. These funds would be used by States to supplement--not \nsupplant--other Federal, State or local funds. This bill would serve \nalmost 150,000 children across the country.\n  Our children need a solid foundation that builds on our current \neducation system by providing them with early learning skills. I urge \nmy colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 207. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ndeduction for health insurance premiums; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Health \nInsurance Tax Relief Act to help our Nation's workers and working \nfamilies deal with dramatic increases in health care costs. The \nlegislation would allow taxpayers to deduct their health insurance \npremiums up to $2,000 for individuals and $4,000 for families.\n  While this deduction will certainly not solve all of the problems in \nour health care system, it will provide help for working individuals \nand families who have seen health care premium costs drastically rise. \nSince 1999, the average health insurance premium for workers covering \ntheir families has more than doubled. A recent survey by the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation found that 40 percent of employers that offer health \nbenefits are likely to increase the amount their employees pay in \npremiums.\n  This is an issue of fairness. Current law provides a patchwork of tax \ndeductions for health care costs depending upon an individual's \nemployer, the type of health care plan provided by their employer, and/\nor percentage of income spent on health care, among other things.\n  Unfortunately this patchwork has left out many employees who face \nincreasing premiums or are buying high cost health plans on their own. \nThis legislation rectifies that unfairness and will help people meet \nrising health care costs. It would help those currently purchasing \ncoverage to continue to do so, as well as helping people who are \nuninsured to purchase coverage.\n  This legislation is particularly important for employees in small \nbusinesses. Many small businesses across the country have been forced \nby the rising cost of health care to shift an increasing amount of \nhealth insurance costs to their employees. These are hard working \nAmericans struggling to make ends meet in a weak economy.\n  Now more than ever we need legislation that provides targeted \nassistance to help families pay for health care. I urge my colleagues \nto support my legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mrs. FEINSTEIN):\n  S. 212. A bill to expand the boundaries of the Gulf of the Farallones \nNational Marine Sanctuary and the Cordell Bank National Marine \nSanctuary, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, the Gulf of the Farallones and Cordell \nBank National Marine Sanctuaries Boundary Modification and Protection \nAct will protect one of the world's most biologically-diverse and \nproductive marine regions. I am proud to be joined in this effort by \nCongresswoman Lynn Woolsey and Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n  Established in 1981 and 1989 respectively, the Gulf of the Farallones \nand Cordell Bank National Marine Sanctuaries have helped protect the \nspecial marine waters and coastline that are quintessentially \nCalifornian. My bill will protect an even greater part of my State's \ncoast by expanding the sanctuaries' boundaries to include more of \nnorthern California's great coastal upwelling area, one of only four on \nthe planet.\n  Upwelling areas are places where deeper water comes up to the \nsurface, bringing the nutrients needed by marine algae to grow and \nsupport all higher forms of marine life. Though coastal upwelling areas \ncomprise only 1 percent of the world's ocean they produce 20 percent of \nits fish. The area from Point Arena to Bodega Bay, currently outside \nthe sanctuaries' boundaries, is particularly important since it \nconsistently has the most intense upwelling in all of North America and \nan enormous capacity to support marine life. I am proud that my bill \nwill expand the sanctuaries' boundaries to protect this upwelling area.\n  The unique productivity of this region is illustrated by the \nabundance and diversity of marine life it supports: 36 species of \nmarine mammals, including the endangered blue and humpback whales; \nnumerous coastal and migratory seabirds, including the black-footed \nalbatross; endangered leatherback turtles; and Coho salmon. Expanding \nthe existing sanctuaries to include this area is necessary to protect \nthis remarkable ecosystem from pollution and habitat degradation.\n\n[[Page S314]]\n\n  My bill has broad, local support, including from the California \nCoastal Commission, the California State Lands Commission, the Counties \nof Sonoma, Marin, and Mendocino, and the cities in the expansion \nregion. It is also supported by fishermen, including the Pacific Coast \nFederation of Fishermen's Associations, by far the largest and most \nactive association of commercial fishermen on the West Coast. Fishermen \nrecognize the urgency of passing this legislation to preserve the water \nquality and habitat essential for good fishing.\n  My bill will help preserve an incomparable gem of an ecosystem. I \nlook forward to working with my colleagues to move this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Ms. Snowe):\n  S. 213. A bill to amend title 49, United States Code, to ensure air \npassengers have access to necessary services while on a grounded air \ncarrier, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, today I am pleased to re-introduce the \nAirline Passenger Bill of Rights Act, a critical piece of airline \npassenger safety legislation.\n  Anyone who has traveled recently recognizes that the delays travelers \nare encountering at airports are a national problem that needs our \nimmediate attention.\n  Americans are all too familiar with the numerous horror stories of \npassengers trapped in airplanes sitting on runways for sometimes as \nmuch as 11 hours without adequate food or water, overflowing restrooms, \nand no opportunity to deplane.\n  The delays continue. On the Sunday before Christmas 2008, more than \n250 passengers on a Continental Airlines flight from Houston to Boston \nwere diverted to Bangor, ME, where they spent about 6 hours idling on \nthe tarmac before they were told that they were going to deplane for \nthe night and would have to find shelter and transportation on their \nown.\n  When these passengers returned the next day for their trip home, not \nonly was their flight delayed 5 hours but they also spent another 2 \nhours idling on the tarmac before finally flying to Boston.\n  In 1999, the airlines had an opportunity to address the stranding of \nairline passengers on tarmacs across the country, but despite those \nefforts little has changed.\n  Last March a Federal appeals court ruling struck down New York \nState's Passenger Bill of Rights law, stating that it is up to the \nCongress to set a national Federal standard.\n  To meet this immediate need for Federal legislation, I am re-\nintroducing the Airline Passenger Bill of Rights Act, along with \nSenator Snowe, to give airline passengers basic protections when they \nare facing these delays and disruptions in their travel.\n  This legislation requires airlines to give passengers adequate food, \nwater, facilities, and medical attention when planes are delayed on the \ntarmac.\n  In addition, the bill requires each air carrier to develop an \nemergency contingency plan, to be reviewed and approved by the \nDepartment of Transportation (DOT) that identifies a clear timeframe to \nallow passengers to deplane if they choose and if the pilot deems it \nsafe.\n  Airlines will need to give passengers the option of deplaning every 3 \nhours, with exceptions to maintain passenger safety and airport \nefficiency.\n  Our legislation also includes a few additional provisions from the \nFAA Reauthorization bill passed by the House in the last Congress. Our \nbill requires airports to develop plans to handle stranded passenger \naircraft and creates a DOT hotline for consumer complaints. It would \nalso permit the DOT to levy fines against air carriers or airports that \ndo not submit or adhere to the contingency plans.\n  The European Union enacted a Passenger Bill of Rights in 2005 and \nCanada passed similar legislation last year. It is time for the United \nStates to step up and make a serious commitment to the millions of \nAmericans that rely on safe and effective air travel.\n  As the number of airline passengers is expected to increase to 1.3 \nbillion by 2025, we can't afford a ``business as usual'' attitude when \nit comes to passenger safety and efficiency at our nation's busiest \nairports.\n  Consumers deserve access to food, water, and medical attention when \nstranded on an aircraft tarmac due to delays. Congress has the ability \nto ensure airline passengers' fundamental rights are protected by \nenacting our Passenger Bill of Rights legislation.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this legislation \nin this Congress.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I come to the Senate floor today on behalf \nof the millions of travelers throughout this country. Before I begin, I \nwould like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Boxer for being \nsuch a fantastic partner in this effort; an effort that sets aside \npartisanship to protect America's traveling public. Her aggressive, \nheartfelt leadership on this issue has been so essential in moving this \nlegislation forward and keeping it at the forefront of the public \nconsciousness.\n  To my regret, each one of us is far too familiar with horror stories \nof passengers stranded on airplanes for hours at a time with no access \nto food, water or even functional restrooms. Events like the \nunconscionable delays at JFK Airport in New York in February of 2007 \nare the most commonly referenced, but these sorts of events are \noccurring on a daily basis. Such dramatic incidents prompted calls for \ncongressional action. That call was heard, and its answer is this \nPassenger Bill of Rights before us today. But as time went on, and this \nlegislation before us today languished, the chorus for change grew \nquiet. The reasons why we first proposed the Passenger Bill of Rights \nhave not dissipated; in fact, they have only increased.\n  The 2008 Air Quality Rating report, which quantifies the performances \nof the various airlines when it comes to customer service, indicated it \nwas ``the worst year for airlines Ever.'' Delays continue to escalate. \nIn fact, despite nearly a 10 percent reduction in capacity last year, \ndelays actually climbed to a record high; an average of nearly an hour \nper delay.\n  At a time when airlines are grounding flights without notice and \npassengers face interminable waits in aircraft and on tarmacs with \nlittle or no idea as to when they might depart, there are no safeguards \nin place to protect the rights of America's travelers--the time is now \nfor Congress to do the right thing and finally stand with America's \npassengers. The Federal court system agrees with us; in voiding New \nYork State's own Passenger Bill of Rights, the Second United States \nCourt of Appeals decision indicated that such a Bill of Rights required \n``a Federal standard.'' The airlines declared victory as the New York \nlaw was overturned; according to the airlines, it would herald a jumble \nof changing regulations among different states, making it too difficult \nto navigate. However, when presented with the option of having a \nnational standard by Senator Boxer and myself, they opposed that \nproposal as well. It seems the airlines want carte blanche to treat \npassengers as they wish, with no recourse for that individual. It is \nclear, Congress must take this matter in hand.\n  Simply put, Congress has run out of excuses. The courts have \ndefinitively ruled that this is the Federal Government's \nresponsibility. We have not just a right, but a responsibility to the \nAmerican people to ensure that there is some level of accountability, \nsome minimum standard. If a patron visits a restaurant that does not \noffer some modicum of working restrooms or provide adequate food and \nwater, that customer can leave the restaurant and find another. For the \nairline passenger, that is not an option. They are trapped at the mercy \nof the airline; airlines whose only concern is the bottom line and \ngetting that aircraft off the ground, however long that might take.\n  Waiting for the airlines to alter their customer service model isn't \ngoing to work. Thanks to Congressional prodding, the airlines put into \nplace their voluntary Customer Service Agreement in 1999. They have had \nalmost a decade to follow through with establishing some basic \ncommitment to customer service and failed miserably. That is not my \nconclusion; the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation \nagreed with that assessment. It is clear that after years of refusing \nto adopt a commitment to provide customer service to the American \npeople, the airline industry will\n\n[[Page S315]]\n\nnot take action unless Congress requires them to do so. This time, \nCongress needs to show it is serious about protecting passengers.\n  By our actions, we can show the American people that we are on their \nside and are working to protect their interests. Never again, should a \nfamily be forced to sit on a tarmac for 10 hours, deprived of the most \nbasic of necessities. Canada was able to pass their passenger bill of \nrights legislation, so if Canada can do it, then there is no reason \nthat Congress cannot do the same. By acting swiftly, and with resolve, \nwe can take up and pass an FAA Reauthorization that includes the \nPassenger Bill of Rights, we can restore America's trust in our \nairlines and guarantee them a standard of service we should all be \nentitled to.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. \n        Cardin):\n  S. 214. A bill to amend title XXI of the Social Security Act to \npermit qualifying States to use their allotments under the State \nChildren's Health Insurance Program for any fiscal year for certain \nMedicaid expenditures; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise with co-sponsors Senators Leahy, \nLieberman, and Cardin to introduce and ask your support for the \nChildren's Health Equity and Technical Amendment Act.\n  Since the passage of the Children's Health Insurance Program, or \nSCHIP, in 1997, a group of States that expanded coverage to children in \nMedicaid prior to the enactment of SCHIP has been unfairly penalized \nfor that expansion. States are not allowed to use the enhanced matching \nrate available to other States for children at similar levels of \npoverty under the act. As a result, a child in the States of New York, \nFlorida, and Pennsylvania, because they were grandfathered in the \noriginal act or in Iowa, Montana, or a number of other States at 134 \npercent of poverty is eligible for an enhanced matching rate in SCHIP \nbut that has not been the case for States such as New Mexico, Vermont, \nWashington, Rhode Island, Hawaii, and a number of others, including \nConnecticut, Tennessee, Minnesota, New Hampshire, Wisconsin, and \nMaryland.\n  As the health policy statement by the National Governors' Association \nreads, ``The Governors believe that it is critical that innovative \nstates not be penalized for having expanded coverage to children before \nthe enactment of SCHIP, which provides enhanced funding to meet these \ngoals. To this end, the Governors support providing additional funding \nflexibility to states that had already significantly expanded coverage \nof the majority of uninsured children in their states.''\n  For 6 years, our group of States has sought to have this inequity \naddressed. Early in 2003, I introduced the Children's Health Equity Act \nof 2003 with Senators Jeffords, Murray, Leahy, and Ms. Cantwell and we \nworked successfully to get a compromise worked out for inclusion in S. \n312 by Senators Rockefeller and Chafee. This compromise extended \nexpiring SCHIP allotments only for fiscal years 1998 through 2001 in \norder to meet budgetary caps.\n  The compromise allowed States to be able to use up to 20 percent of \nour State's SCHIP allotments to pay for Medicaid eligible children at \n150 percent of poverty that were part of our State's expansions prior \nto the enactment of SCHIP. That language was maintained in conference \nand included in H.R. 2854 that was signed by the President as Public \nLaw 108-74. Unfortunately, a slight change was made in the conference \nlanguage that excluded New Mexico and Hawaii, Maryland, and Rhode \nIsland and needed specific changes so an additional bill was passed, \nH.R. 3288, and signed into law as Public Law 108-107, on November 17, \n2003. This second bill included language from legislation that I \nintroduced with Senator Domenici, S. 1547, to address the problem \ncaused to New Mexico by the conference committee's change. \nUnfortunately, one major problem with the compromise was that it must \nbe periodically reauthorized. Most recently, this authority was renewed \nthrough fiscal year 2007 in Section 201(b) of the National Institutes \nof Health Reform Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-482. Without future \nauthority, the inequity would continue with SCHIP allotments.\n  This legislation would address that problem and ensure that all \nfuture allotments give these 11 States the flexibility to use our SCHIP \nallotments to pay for health care services of children. In order to \nbring these requirements in-line with those of other States, it would \nalso lower the threshold at which New Mexico and other effected States \ncould utilize the funds from 150 percent of the Federal poverty level \nto 125 percent.\n  There is strong bipartisan support for addressing this inequity. \nLegislation was introduced in the 110th Congress in both H.R. 3584 by \nRepublican Representative Barton, and 141 co-sponsors, and S. 2086 by \nSenator Trent Lott and other Republican leadership to expand the \ncategory of children eligible through this correction to 133 percent of \nthe Federal poverty level.\n  This rather technical issue has real and negative consequences in \nStates such as New Mexico. In fact, due to the SCHIP inequity, New \nMexico has been allocated $266 million from SCHIP between fiscal years \n1998 and 2002, and yet, has only been able to spend slightly over $26 \nmillion as of the end of last fiscal year. In other words, New Mexico \nhas been allowed to spend less than 10 percent of its Federal SCHIP \nallocations.\n  This legislation would correct this problem.\n  The bill does not take money from other States' SCHIP allotments.

Res. 12\n\n       Resolved, That (a) rule XV of the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``6. Notwithstanding action on a first degree amendment, it \n     shall not be in order for a Senator to offer a second degree \n     amendment to his or her own first degree amendment.''.\n        (b) The amendment made by subsection (a) shall take effect \n     at the beginning of the 111th Congress.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today in order \nto reintroduce a resolution I first put forward in the 110th Congress \nthat would prohibit the use of the procedural tactic of filling the \ntree. I feel strongly that this practice contributed greatly\n\n[[Page S316]]\n\nto inefficiencies and ineffectiveness that the United State Senate \nexperienced in the 110th Congress. Commonly known as the ``world's \ngreatest deliberative body,'' the Senate has prided itself on free and \nfair debate on each and every issue that comes before it. \nTraditionally, members have had the right to offer virtually any \namendment on any bill at any point in the legislative process. This all \ninclusive practice of legislating has earned the United States a unique \nplace among modern democracies because of the open arena for ideas and \nsufficient debate.\n  However, in the past 15 years both sides of the aisle have \nincreasingly seen the majority leaders use their authority to seek \nfirst recognition and fill the amendment tree. Republicans and \nDemocrats alike have been equally as guilty of this practice for \nhistory has shown, when there is a problem with this institution, \nbipartisan blame is easily applicable. Beginning in 1993, ``filling the \ntree'' became increasingly prevalent as Senator George Mitchell used it \n9 times in the 103rd Congress, Senator Trent Lott used it nine times in \nthe 106th, and Senator Frist used it 9 times in the 109th. In the \nrecently concluded 110th Congress, Majority Leader Senator Reid filled \nthe tree on 16 different occasions, bypassing the previous record \namount by a significant margin.\n  Regular order in this chamber was sacrificed in this past Congress, \nand in its place was a procedural tactic that prevented passage of \nlegislation that would have been extremely beneficial for this country. \nBills such as FAA Reauthorization--H.R. 2881, Climate Change \nLegislation--S. 3036, and the Energy Speculation Bill--S. 3268 were all \nderailed by this practice. Cloture on each piece of legislation was not \nachieved and caused any further movement on them to be stymied. Blame \nwas placed on Republicans for engaging in obstruction through the use \nof the filibuster to prevent movement to debate. The fact of the matter \nwas our side was completely blocked from participating in the \nlegislative process, forcing our hand to oppose moving to the bill.\n  My proposed resolution would disallow the majority leader or any \nother member from offering a first-degree amendment, followed by a \nsecond-degree amendment. It amends Rule 15, Standing Rules of the \nSenate and it is my hope the Senate can adopt this and operate under \nthis rule in the 111th Congress and beyond. It is time for this chamber \nto conduct business in a logical, factual way; that is, for Senators to \ncome to the floor and address the substance of the bill and offer \namendments if they choose.\n  Congress currently has an approval rating at a level that is \nunacceptable. As we enter a new Congress, efforts must be made to allow \nregular procedure to return to the United States Senate. It is my hope \nthat the grueling hours members and staff put into legislation will be \nhonored by giving it due consideration on the Senate floor. With a few \nchanges in procedure, this Senate can ensure a more productive \nenvironment in the 111th Congress and beyond.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/12/senate-section/article/S316-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 15.
