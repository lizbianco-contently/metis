Madam President, last week four Nevadans tragically died \nfrom the H1N1 virus, the swine flu. In Clark County, NV, the State's \nmost populous county and the home of Las Vegas, 18 people have now died \nas a result of the H1N1 flu. We are all familiar with this strain of \nthe flu. It has been on the front pages for months.\n  This past weekend, President Obama declared the outbreak a national \nemergency in anticipation of a rush of patients to doctors' offices and \nemergency rooms.\n  Fortunately, for nearly 150 years the United States has had a high-\nranking official in place to serve as the government's top public \nhealth officer. We call that person the Surgeon General of the United \nStates. Unfortunately, though, right now we have no permanent Surgeon \nGeneral. The reason is as simple as it is mind-boggling: Republicans in \nthe Senate refuse to confirm President Obama's exceptionally qualified \nnominee for this job. I would try to explain the Republican reason for \nthe refusal, but, as with so many other\n\n[[Page S10870]]\n\nthings they oppose, a rationale simply does not exist. Senate \nRepublicans are simply so opposed to everything--absolutely \neverything--that they even oppose putting people in some of the most \nimportant positions in our government. Democrats, on the other hand, \nbelieve those who are chosen to serve our country must be able to get \nto work without delay.\n  Perhaps those watching and listening think this is how the Senate \nalways operates. It is not. Allow me to put these delays in context.\n  President Obama has 228 nominations awaiting confirmation--228. \nDuring the first Bush administration, there was not a problem; during \nthe Reagan years, not a problem; during the Clinton years, minor \nproblems; during the second Bush administration, no problems. During \nthe first Bush administration, the first year, there wasn't a single \ncloture motion that had to be filed. He got basically everyone he \nwanted. But that isn't the way it is here. In the first 4 months of the \nBush administration, as I indicated, the Senate was controlled by the \nPresident's party. We were in the minority. There wasn't a single \nfilibuster--not one. But in the first 4 months of the Obama \nadministration, Republicans filibustered eight of his nominees--in the \nfirst 4 months. That means President Obama faced twice as many \nfilibusters of his nominees in the first 4 months of his administration \nas President Bush faced in his first 4 years.\n\n  Those who are watching may also understandably assume that if this is \nnot how the Senate always operates, then there must be something \nextraordinarily controversial about these nominees, something highly \nobjectionable or even questionable. Again, no. None of the nominees are \ncontroversial. None of them are questionable.\n  As I mentioned, Republicans in the Senate refuse to confirm our \nNation's Surgeon General at a time when our President has declared a \nnational emergency over the H1N1 virus. The President's nominee, Dr. \nRegina Benjamin, a physician from Alabama and the founder of a \nnonprofit rural health clinic, is eminently qualified for the position. \nShe had been written up in news accounts from all over the country \nbefore she was selected by President Obama.\n  But that is not all. Republicans in the Senate also refuse to confirm \nthe top official responsible for science and technology in our \nDepartment of Homeland Security. For that position, President Obama \nnominated an expert in combating both pandemics and bioterror attacks. \nImagine that. Americans are bracing against a flu epidemic here at home \nand threats of terrorism from abroad; the President nominated someone \nhighly experienced in both of these areas, and Republicans are saying \nno.\n  If that sounds like something you wouldn't want your Senate to do, \nyou might even be further concerned that it is not the first time these \nRepublican Senators have done it. While our sons and daughters are \nfighting in Iraq and rebuilding that nation, earlier this year \nRepublicans delayed the confirmation of America's Ambassador to Iraq. \nWhile troops serve bravely in Afghanistan, earlier this year \nRepublicans delayed the confirmation of LTG Stanley McChrystal, our new \ncommander in that difficult war.\n  These telling examples are only the tip of the iceberg. Allow me to \ncontinue.\n  Months ago, President Obama picked a trade expert who worked in the \nReagan, Bush, and Clinton administrations to be this Nation's Deputy \nTrade Representative, an extremely important job, but she has yet to \nofficially join the Obama administration. Listen to this one. Why? \nBecause a Republican Senator is holding up the nomination over a bill \nthey think would hurt tobacco companies. If that seems like an \nunrelated, random reason to hold up this qualified nominee, you might \neven be more outraged to learn that the bill that so angers this \nRepublican Senator is not before the U.S. Senate, it is not even before \nthe U.S. House of Representatives. In fact, it is not even in the \nUnited States. It is a bill before the Canadian Parliament. It should \ngo without saying that our administration can't dictate how the \nCanadian legislature does its job any more than the Canadian Parliament \ncan dictate how we do ours. It should go without saying, but \nunfortunately we evidently have to say it.\n  Another example: President Obama nominated another former chief of \nstaff of the General Services Administration, which manages Federal \nagencies. Today, that person has still not been confirmed. President \nObama nominated this woman in April on the first full day of the Major \nLeague Baseball season. Today, on the second day of the World Series, \nshe remains unconfirmed for her job. Why? Because a Republican Senator \nis demanding that a Federal building be built in his home State.\n  Let's go over these few things. There are 228 being held up, but we \nknow we should have a Surgeon General. We know Regina Benjamin is \neminently qualified. We have a flu pandemic. We have other issues \nfacing our country, and we need the top doctor. We don't have it. Why? \nJust because the Republicans don't want anyone to move forward. We know \nthat the head of the Department of Homeland Security, the Secretary of \nHomeland Security, is desperate to have someone there who can do the \nwork that is needed dealing with this flu epidemic. I had a call from \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano, the day before \nyesterday. She said: I can't imagine why I can't get this woman to help \nme. We are dealing with bioterrorism, with the flu pandemic, and she is \nbeing held up. We are talking about trade relations that need to be \nimproved all over the world, and we have this being held up because of \nsome tobacco law they are considering in the Canadian Parliament.\n  There are so many examples. President Obama asked an expert in Latin \nAmerican affairs, a man who has written books, a scholar--his expertise \nis in regime change in Central and South America. He has been a \nvisiting scholar at many fine universities in the United States, even \nat Oxford. He has been chosen to be our Nation's Assistant Secretary of \nState for the Western Hemisphere to take care of what is going on in \nthe southern part of this world in which we live.\n  Nearly 6 months after he was nominated, one Republican Senator still \nrefused to allow the confirmation to move forward. This Senator is \ntrying to force our Nation to recognize a military coup in Honduras, \nand so he is holding this nomination hostage. Most people would \nreasonably conclude that this nominee's expertise would be particularly \nuseful at a time when there is a diplomatic crisis in Central America, \nin Honduras. The man who was ousted--some say constitutionally, some \nsay not--they took him out of the country. He came back, and now he is \nin Brazil's Embassy and has been for about a month. There are \ndemonstrations every day. The economy is staggering. Yet this is being \nheld up.\n  These examples are not isolated. They are part of a much larger \npattern. This year, Republicans have already gone to great lengths to \nensure that President Obama cannot have his full team in place. We have \nalready wasted taxpayers' precious time and money by holding up the \npresent nominees for Secretary of Labor, Secretary of Health and Human \nServices, Director of National Drug Control Policy, Deputy Secretary \nfor the Department of the Interior, two members of the Council of \nEconomic Advisers, a number of Assistant Attorneys General, and many \nothers. These nominees finally broke through, the ones I just \nmentioned: the Secretary of Labor, Health and Human Services, the \nDirector of National Drug Policy, the Deputy Secretary of the Interior, \ntwo members of the Council of Economic Advisers, and a number of \nAssistant Attorneys General. They finally broke through, but their \nstory doesn't end there. When votes were finally called, they passed \nwith flying colors.\n  They passed with votes of 89 to 2, 97 to 1, 88 to 0, and 97 to 0. The \nnumbers don't lie, and there is no clear evidence that many of these \nobjections were without merit--just to stall. Some took weeks of time \nwhen we could have been doing other things. So it is obvious that these \nobjections are not the norm, that they are not based on qualifications, \nand they are rampant with this Republican minority.\n  As far as Republicans are concerned, no one is too important to \nblock. No high-ranking position is too important to remain empty, and \nno problem is too urgent to delay. The person who Janet\n\n[[Page S10871]]\n\nNapolitano wants to work on bioterrorism and the pandemic that we have \nwith the flu, who has been selected by the President, is being held up; \nthe Surgeon General is being held up; the Trade Representatives are \nbeing held up; 228 nominations are being held up for reasons like a \nCanadian bill, like a building in their State--petty reasons.\n  The American people must look at what is going on and say: What is \nthis all about? It is about Republicans setting records last year on \nhow many filibusters they would conduct. If I sound like a broken \nrecord, it is because Senate Republicans continue to be recordbreakers. \nLast year, after they held up the work of Congress more than any other \ntime in history, the American people rejected the Republican status \nquo. They said no to Republicans' ``just say no'' strategy.\n  There is no question that the American people are taking notice, \nthere is no question that they see these games for what they are, and \nthere is no question they are fed up with these petty partisan tricks, \nand there is no question that these tactics have consequences--\nconsequences that we don't have one of the most important jobs in \nAmerica filled by one of the most important doctors in America, Regina \nBenjamin, and that we don't have somebody in the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to help with bioterrorism and with the flu pandemic.\n  These reckless tactics have consequences. The Republicans delay and \ndelay at their own peril. But the truth is that all Americans suffer. \nIt is time for them to allow these nominations to go through. And I \nhaven't mentioned the judges.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10871-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, it was a signature assurance of the \nPresident's campaign: Middle-class Americans would see no new taxes of \nany kind under the new administration.\n  It is a pledge he will have to break if the health care bill, as \ncurrently moving through Congress, makes its way to the President's \ndesk and he signs it. We already know that the bill slashes seniors' \nMedicare, and study after study shows it is going to drive up premiums \nfor people who already have insurance. Higher taxes will be the third \npainful blow to Americans already struggling in a recession.\n  Here is a sample of the new taxes Americans are going to have to bear \nto finance more government health care. Anyone whose health care \nbenefits are worth more than $8,000 or any family whose benefits are \nworth more than $21,000 will get a 40-percent excise tax. While backers \nlike to call these ``high value'' or ``Cadillac'' plans, the new tax \nwon't be indexed to keep pace with rising health care costs. So as time \nmarches on, it won't just hit the so-called Cadillac plans but the \n``Buick and the Chevy'' plans, too--all the way down to tricycles. \nEventually, this tax will hit all plans.\n  Health insurers also get hit with a giant new nondeductible tax, \nwhich we know will get passed along to families in the form of higher \npremiums.\n  The bill would tax life-saving medical devices such as heart stents \nand prosthetics. Prescription drugs get taxed, which we know patients \nwill have to pay for in the form of higher drug costs and premiums.\n  Tens of millions of American families who have experienced tax-saving \nbenefits of Flexible Spending Accounts to pay for prescription drugs \nand other necessities will see those benefits wiped out under this \nplan. In an effort to redirect billions of dollars these families \ncurrently save through FSAs back to the government, FSAs would \nautomatically be capped at $2,500 and then phased out over time. \nAnything families currently save by deducting more than that would go \nto the government instead.\n  People who choose not to buy government-approved health insurance \nwill get clobbered with a penalty as high as $1,500.\n  Businesses would also get hit. According to the bill, any business \nwith 50 or more employees that doesn't currently provide insurance to \nits employees will be forced to subsidize it at a significant cost per \nemployee--all of which brings us back to the President's pledge.\n  Would health care reform hit the pocketbooks of all the people who \nearn less than a quarter million dollars a year or wouldn't it? That is \nthe question. You bet it would. I have listed some of the ways middle-\nclass Americans get hit under this plan. These are the ones we know \nabout.\n  But don't take it from me. The testimony of the independent, \nnonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation could not be clearer. It looked \nat the taxes in the Finance Committee bill and found that nearly 80 \npercent of the burden would fall on Americans earning less than \n$250,000 a year. Again, 80 percent of the burden would fall on those \nmaking less than $250,000 a year.\n  Taxes on insurers and manufacturers will be passed right along to \nconsumers, and the average income for people who have Flexible Saving \nAccounts is $55,000--hardly the wealthiest segment of Americans.\n  Bottom line: If you have insurance, you get taxed. If you don't have \ninsurance, you get taxed. If you are a struggling business owner who \ncannot afford insurance for your employees, you get taxed. If you use \nmedical devices, you get taxed. If you buy over-the-counter medicine, \nyou get taxed. In other words, Americans get taxed going and coming \nunder the $1 trillion plan that is making its way through Congress.\n  No wonder most Americans oppose this plan--higher premiums, higher \ntaxes, and cuts to Medicare. This is not the reform America bargained \nfor. In fact, it is no reform at all. It is a bill of goods being \nforced on the middle class when they can least afford it.\n  Commonsense reforms and lower costs--that is what people want, and \nthat is what they should get.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10871-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I am going to continue on a point that \nthe Senator from Kentucky made, and that is tax increases. I want to be \na little more specific about how the health care reform bill is going \nto very dramatically increase taxes--particularly for groups of people \nwith under $250,000 a year in income, which group President Obama has \npromised would never have their taxes increased.\n  On September 12, 2008, in Dover, NH, candidate Obama said:\n\n       And I can make a firm pledge: No family making less than \n     $250,000 will see their taxes increase--not your income \n     taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, \n     not any of your taxes.\n\n  You can see on the chart that quotation. It is very firm, very clear. \nWell, I believe we are at the point of abrogating that promise.\n  President Obama's pledge has also been repeated by the President and \nhis advisers numerous times since candidate Obama has been in office. \nHowever, the health care reform bill reported out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee is loaded with tax hikes on ``the middle class.''\n\n  President Obama, however, has defined the middle class as those \nmaking under $250,000. Candidate Obama stated that ``if you are making \nless than $250,000, then you are definitely somewhere in the middle \nclass.''\n  President Obama's budget tracks this definition by preserving the \ncurrent income tax rate structure for families under $250,000 and \nsingles under $200,000. And the Democratic leadership\n\n[[Page S10872]]\n\nbudgets adopted President Obama's definition of the middle class.\n  President Obama and congressional Democrats have adopted this \ndefinition of the middle class in the context of health care reform.\n  As evidence, on August 3, 2009, President Obama's press secretary \nRobert Gibbs said:\n\n       Let me be precise. The President's clear commitment is not \n     to raise taxes on those making less than $250,000 a year.\n\n  In his Portsmouth, NH, townhall meeting, the President--referring to \nways in which to pay for health care reform--said this:\n\n       It should not burden people who make $250,000 a year or \n     less.\n\n  The congressional Democratic leadership have made similar \ncommitments. So the question is: When health care reform comes up, will \nit not increase taxes for people making under $250,000? Will the \npromises that the President made as a candidate be kept by the bills \nthat may become law? I don't want to refer to this Senator's judgment \nof this. I want to use the words of the Joint Committee on Taxation and \nthe Congressional Budget Office. These are people who are experts--\nnonpartisan--and nobody questions their judgment. They are \nintellectually honest. They are not Republicans or Democrats.\n  According to these official scorekeepers--Joint Tax and the \nCongressional Budget Office--the Finance Committee bill contains over \n$500 billion of taxes, increases, fees, and penalties on individuals \nand businesses.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation testified that a significant \npercentage of these tax increases, fees, and penalties will be borne by \nthe middle-class taxpayers--those making under $250,000.\n  Joint Tax also performed a distributional analysis of three tax \nprovisions of the Senate Finance Committee bill for the year 2019--when \nthese provisions are fully in effect. In other words, Joint Tax and the \nCongressional Budget Office look ahead 10 years. So we are talking \nabout between now and 2019.\n  The three provisions that Joint Tax made distributional analyses of \nare: the advance refundable insurance premium tax credit; second, the \nhigh cost plans tax, also known around here as the Cadillac health \ninsurance plans--and that is the tax connected with it; third, the \nmedical expense deduction tax increase.\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation found that, on average, by 2019, \nsingles making over $40,000 a year, and married couples making over \n$75,000 a year would have a net tax increase under the Finance \nCommittee bill.\n  Again, if you are single and making over $40,000 a year, or married \nand making over $75,000 a year, your taxes are going up, on average, \nunder the Finance Committee bill. We have two charts up here that make \nthat very clear.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle may say that the Finance \nCommittee bill lowers people's taxes. Let's look at that. This may be a \nlittle bit true for some taxpayers. But for middle-class taxpayers, \ntheir taxes will go up. Further, Joint Tax--the official congressional \ntax scorekeeper--said so.\n  So if the President signs the Senate Finance Committee bill, or some \nof the financing measures in that bill, into law, the President would \nbreak that campaign pledge.\n  The President then would be raising taxes on families making $250,000 \nand singles making $200,000. Now that we have established that the \nFinance Committee bill raises taxes on the middle class, I would like \nto dig a bit deeper.\n  In looking to 2019, Joint Tax data leads to the conclusion that 77 \npercent of the burden of the tax increases in the Finance bill would be \nborne by middle-class taxpayers. In 2019, out of these taxpayers making \nunder $200,000 who are affected by the three provisions mentioned \nabove, 54 percent of them will see tax increases. In other words, 46 \nmillion middle-class families and individuals would pay higher taxes \nunder the Finance Committee bill, contrary to what the President has \nsaid.\n  Joint Tax data also finds that middle-class families who file joint \nreturns are very dramatically affected. Specifically, in 2019, over 64 \npercent of middle-class families filing joint tax returns would face a \nsignificant increase, and these families, obviously, make less than \n$250,000 a year.\n  Once again, I have charts that will show the different divisions of \npeople falling into those income categories.\n  Another way to look at this is, there are four groups of middle-class \ntaxpayers who are treated differently under the Finance Committee bill. \nThe first is a group of 14.5 million who will receive refundable tax \ncredits. These refundable credits represent government spending and not \ntax relief. That is the judgment of these official scorekeepers, not \nthis Senator. In 2019, this government spending amounts to $77 billion \nalone.\n  In the second group, some of the 25 million will see some tax relief. \nHowever, a substantial number of those 25 million in this second group \nwill not see any tax relief under the bill.\n  The third group, made up of 46 million middle-income taxpayers, will \nbear a large tax increase.\n  A fourth group of 83 million will have a tax increase from provisions \nin the bill that Joint Tax has not yet analyzed, so I cannot go into \ndepth about that group.\n  For example, Joint Tax has not yet provided distribution analysis on \nthe effect of the fees on health insurers that will be passed through \nand medical device manufacturers.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I ask for 5 additional minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Because we do not have that analysis, we do not know \nhow many of those 83 million will face tax increases. For instance, \nmany of those 83 million buy health insurance themselves or their \nemployers buy it for them, and they will bear the burden of the new \ninsurance fees in the form of higher insurance premiums.\n  During the Finance Committee debate, some Senators of the majority \nparty described the Finance Committee bill as providing a net tax cut. \nLet's look at what is a net tax cut because the official scorers would \nnot determine that is what it is.\n  To understand whether these claims are accurate, one has to figure \nout what is meant by the words ``tax reduction.''\n  The premium tax credit under the bill is refundable. That means tax \nreturn filers receive the tax credit, even if they have no income tax \nliability. If a tax filer has no income tax liability, how can their \ntaxes go down? Joint Tax does not describe that as a tax reduction. \nInstead, Joint Tax says these filers receive a Federal benefit.\n  Joint Tax also tells us that 73 percent of the $453 billion in the \nrefundable tax credits for health insurance is, in fact, pure and \nsimple, government spending. That leaves just 27 percent--or $122 \nbillion--that might legitimately be called a tax reduction, and we see \nit on the chart.\n  Meanwhile, as mentioned above, there are over $500 billion in tax \nincreases--$\\1/2\\ trillion is another way of saying it. Even if we add \nin the meager small business tax credit of $23 billion, which is the \nonly other tax benefit in the bill, this bill contains a net tax \nincrease of over $350 billion.\n  Because the refundable insurance premium credit is called a tax \ncredit, Democrats have argued the entire $453 billion is a tax credit. \nHowever, Joint Tax and the Congressional Budget Office scores 330 \nbillion of that $453 billion as pure and simple government spending.\n  Colleagues on the other side of the aisle argue that such government \nspending is actually a tax cut. However, Joint Tax scores this as \ngovernment spending, not tax cuts.\n  An outlay results when the tax credit is larger than an individual's \nincome tax liability, if any. That individual simply receives a check \nfrom the Internal Revenue Service. Sending a check to an individual who \npays no income tax cannot credibly be called a tax cut. Some colleagues \nargue that the refundable tax credit offsets payroll taxes. However, \npayroll taxes are meant to be paid so individuals can receive benefits \nfrom Social Security and Medicare later in life.\n  Even if you agree that individuals should not have to pay payroll \ntaxes but should also receive Social Security and Medicare benefits, \nthat rationale cannot be used over and over. It should only be used \nonce.\n  We already have a number of generous refundable tax credits. The \nchild\n\n[[Page S10873]]\n\ntax credit, the earned-income tax credit, and the making work pay \ncredit are all refundable tax credits.\n  The insurance premium credit in the Finance bill is added to that \nlist. Therefore, this same payroll tax cut rationale has been used four \ntimes to claim that this government spending is actually a tax cut. \nJoint Tax scores these outlays as government spending, not as a tax \ncut. That is not this Senator saying that; it is the professionals in \nJoint Tax who say it is government spending, not a tax cut.\n  The interesting thing about the refundable tax credit for health \ninsurance is, it does not go to the individual or family. Instead, this \nFederal tax benefit goes from the government directly to the insurance \ncompany providing health care coverage. That is a check from the \nFederal Government made out to your insurance company dated, signed, \nsealed, and delivered directly to that insurance company.\n  I remember hearing President Obama criticize sending money directly \nto insurance companies. On October 4, before his election, in Newport \nNews, VA, then-Candidate Obama criticized Senator McCain's health \ncredit for health insurance by saying these words:\n\n       But the new tax credit he is proposing? That wouldn't go to \n     you. It would go directly to your insurance company--not your \n     bank account.\n\n  That is what the President said in that quote. If Candidate Obama was \nagainst it then, how is President Obama for it now? But that is what is \nin this legislation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, as we begin to slowly emerge from the \neconomic pitfalls of the worst recession this country has seen in \ndecades, the long-term issues that remain are real and affect Americans \nof all walks of life.\n  Out-of-control government spending has resulted in a skyrocketing \ndeficit, fueling fears of an unsustainable financial future for \nAmerica. A stifled free market drags down our economic growth and \nimpairs our ability to work toward reducing this enormous burden on our \nchildren's and grandchildren's future.\n  In spite of this volatile forecast, there are some who feel that the \nbest way to reinvigorate our economy is to impose heavier costs, higher \nfees, and greater taxes on businesses and individuals, while forcing \nthe Federal Government to oversee and manage health care in the United \nStates, ultimately adding an additional one-sixth of our economy to the \ngovernment's balance sheet.\n  Make no mistake, this financial instability is not disconnected from \nAmericans' everyday lives. It is being felt at bill-paying time, \ndiscussed at dinner tables, and it is weighing on the minds of the very \npeople who drive this country's economy.\n  The other side would have you believe that greater government \ncontrol, increased spending, and less money in Americans' pockets is \nthe way toward economic stability and growth.\n  Since there has been no legislative language circulated on the \nproposed government takeover of health care at this point, we can only \nconsider the conceptual language as passed by the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  Here is 1,502 pages of conceptual language that has come out of the \nFinance Committee and is being proposed as meaningful health care \nreform.\n  This phantom health care proposal imposes $\\1/2\\ trillion in new \ntaxes, fees, and penalties on individuals and businesses. While some \nwould have you believe these taxes will only be borne by the wealthy in \nthe form of a 40-percent excise tax on high-value insurance plans, both \nthe Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation--as \nalluded to by the ranking member on the Finance Committee, the Senator \nfrom Iowa--have testified that these taxes will almost entirely be \npassed on to the consumer, irrespective of their tax bracket.\n  Under the tax provisions of this health care proposal, in my home \nState of Georgia, a young, healthy individual under certain health \nplans would see his monthly premiums almost double.\n  Additionally, $92 billion of this new burden will be in the form of \nnew fees on manufacturers and importers of branded drugs and certain \nmedical devices, as well as on health insurance providers. Again, all \nthis is going to be passed on to consumers, resulting in higher health \ninsurance premiums and higher costs for health-related products.\n  While a majority of the health reforms in the Finance Committee bill \ndo not go into effect until 2013, such as the tax credit for health \ninsurance and the individual mandate, both of which are designed to \nlower health care costs, these so-called fees are effective on January \n1 of next year. This means health insurance, in general, will become \nmore expensive before any government assistance or policies intended to \nmake health insurance more affordable even take effect.\n  Also included in the Senate finance proposal is a tax on individuals \nwithout essential health benefits coverage, which would subject \nindividuals who fail to maintain government-approved health insurance \ncoverage to a penalty of $750 per adult in the household.\n  While Democrats complain this contains savings for low- to middle-\nincome families, CBO has stated that almost half those families paying \nthis tax would be between 100 percent and 300 percent of the Federal \npoverty level--or a family of four earning between $22,800 and $68,400 \nin 2013. Additionally, proponents of this bill say it reduces the \ndeficit while providing relief from high health care costs from lower \nincome families. However, what they do not tell you is, under their \nrefundable tax credits, families who earn nearly four times the Federal \npoverty level will have almost 91 percent of their health care costs \npaid for by other taxpayers.\n  The CBO--the Congressional Budget Office, the independent \nCongressional Budget Office--estimates that by 2019, out of 253 million \nAmericans with health insurance, only 18 million will be eligible for \nthese tax credits to purchase insurance. So this supposed health care \ncost-reducing tax credit at the heart of the Democrats' health care \nreform is only available to 7 percent of the population.\n  Increasing taxes on 91 percent of Americans to pay for 7 percent of \nthe population is not reform, it is business as usual. While I am in \nfavor of tax credits to purchase health insurance, I do not support \nplacing limitations on who can receive such credits or what type of \ncoverage they can purchase.\n  Madam President, as if increasing the size of government even more in \nthe health care sphere isn't going to make matters worse, who do you \nthink is going to administer, implement, and enforce these tax \nincreases? None other than the Internal Revenue Service. With a new \ninflux of complex health care policies being legislated through the Tax \nCode, the IRS would be tasked with overseeing all aspects of the \nmillions of taxpayers now burdened with even more filings to the IRS.\n  Additionally, the IRS would likely be entrusted with enforcing these \nnew provisions as well as protecting against fraud in certain cases. \nThese new responsibilities of the Internal Revenue Service would mean \nonly one thing: a bigger and more intrusive IRS.\n  As I continue to say, I am in support of reforming the health care \nsystem in this country because we do have problems. We need greater \ntransparency in health care costs, increased competition, more \nindividual portability for peace of mind for those who change jobs, a \nbetter focus on prevention and wellness and real reform of the health \ninsurance industry. Republican-backed plans do exactly that. There are \nways to lower health care costs and be more fiscally responsible, and \nthere are opportunities to pay for this coverage without expanding \nentitlements and increasing taxes on middle-class Americans.\n  Americans deserve a patient-centered approach to health care reform. \nThe 1,502 pages being discussed this morning as we speak--behind closed \ndoors, by the majority leader and other Democrats--puts politicians and \nbureaucrats in charge of the health care industry in this country, and \nthat is not what the American people want or deserve.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I also rise to speak about the health \ncare legislation the Senate is preparing to consider on the Senate \nfloor. I will begin my remarks, as my colleague from Georgia has done, \nby referring to the bill which the Finance Committee has put out. This \nis it. It is 1,502\n\n[[Page S10874]]\n\npages which, interestingly, we did not have before us when we \nconsidered it in the Finance Committee.\n  I think most people in the country realize right now that as the \nFinance Committee proceeded through 2 full weeks of markup on this \nlegislation, the legislation had not actually been written. Even though \nthe very first amendment, which we brought, was an amendment to say \nthat before we would be forced to vote on a bill, we should see the \nbill for 72 hours and have the CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, \nscore on the bill for 72 hours so that we and the American public could \nunderstand what was in it, that was not allowed. We cast our final \nvotes in the Finance Committee on the Finance Committee's bill--well, \nthe Finance Committee's concept paper. This bill didn't yet exist. We \ndid have an idea about what concepts were intended to be in it, but the \nbill itself didn't exist.\n  The reason I bring that up right now is because this is actually not \ngoing to be the bill we consider on the Senate floor. As soon as the \nSenate Finance Committee finished with this bill, the majority leader \nand the chairmen of a couple of the relevant committees--I presume with \nsome personnel from the White House--got together behind closed doors \nin the Capitol Building and began drafting a new bill to merge this \nbill with a previous bill that had come out of the HELP Committee bill \nin the Senate. That new bill has now been sent to CBO for a score, but \nwe don't know what is in it either.\n  In fact, we are told it is concepts and options that are being \nsubmitted to CBO. I am not even sure if that new bill has yet been \nwritten, but I do know no one, except those who have submitted it to \nCBO, know what is in it.\n  Well, we have a good idea of what is in the health care bill the \nSenate Finance Committee put out, and I expect a lot of what was in \nthis Senate Finance Committee bill will make it into this new bill that \nsomeday maybe the American public and the rest of the Members of this \nChamber will be able to see. As we approach the health care issue, I \nthink it is important for us to understand exactly what it is we are \nexpected to do by the American people and what it is we are doing with \nthe health care legislation.\n  Most Americans want health care reform. But when they say that, the \nvast majority of them mean they want Congress to take swift and \ndecisive action to bring under control the spiraling costs of health \ncare and the spiraling costs of health care insurance. As a part of \nthat, they want to see increased access for those who are uninsured, \nwhose burden of coverage and health care falls on the taxpayers. That \nis the core focus, the purpose behind the drive in America for health \ncare reform.\n  Well, what does the legislation we passed out of the Finance \nCommittee do? With regard to the cost of insurance, it will not cause \nthe cost of insurance to go down. It will, in fact, drive up the cost \nof insurance at even faster rates of growth than would have occurred \nwithout the legislation. What does it do for coverage of those who are \nuninsured? It establishes an extremely expensive new government program \nthat would provide tax credits--or what are called renewable tax \ncredits--for those at certain income levels to provide the ability for \nthem to obtain coverage. But of the 47 million who are uninsured in the \nUnited States today, the bill still leaves approximately 25 million of \nthem uninsured.\n  What it does put into place for these two outcomes on the major \nreasons for reform--increased cost of insurance and only about 50 \npercent reduction of the uninsured--is a massive new amount of Federal \ncontrol over the health care industry, a massive new entitlement \nprogram that will cost, according to CBO, approximately $829 billion of \nnew spending, and then offsets that try to address the growing costs of \nthe Federal Government that it represents by about $404 billion worth \nof cuts in Medicare and $506-or-so billion of new taxes, fees, and \npenalties.\n  Remember the discussion I started with about the fact that the \nAmerican people wanted to see the cost curve on health care bend down? \nWe will hear it said that this bill bends down the cost curve. Well, it \ndoesn't bend down the health care cost curve, and it doesn't bend down \nthe health care insurance cost curve. All it does is try to address the \nimpact of the phenomenal amount of new spending--$829 billion--by \nraising taxes and cutting Medicare in amounts that are greater than the \namount of the cost in the bill.\n  Well, what kind of impact will these increases in taxes have? First \nand foremost, I want to return to what my colleague, Senator Grassley, \nrecently pointed out. In the discussion of this issue, President Obama \nmade it clear as a candidate, and he has repeatedly made it clear as \nPresident, that he will not sign legislation that imposes a tax \nincrease on people making less than $250,000 in the United States. \nThese are his remarks on September 12 during the campaign in New \nHampshire, which, again, he has repeated consistently:\n\n       And I can make a firm pledge: No family making less than \n     $250,000 will see their taxes increase--not your income \n     taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, \n     not any of your taxes.\n\n  Well, what does this bill do? This bill squarely increases the taxes \non the middle class in the United States. The full tax burden of this \nbill, including all of the taxes and fees and penalties that are \nincluded in it, is over $\\1/2\\ trillion. Experts have now told us that \nthe majority, in fact the significant majority of those taxes and those \nincreased fees and penalties, will fall on the backs of those who make \nless than $250,000. We don't have the data yet, but, in fact, the \nimpact on people who make less than $120,000 will be a huge portion of \nthese new taxes and fees. Yet how can that be allowed to happen with \nthe President making this pledge?\n  I think the American people need to pay attention. In essence, what \nwe have represented is a huge increase in spending in the Federal \nTreasury--$829 billion under the Finance Committee plan. It is expected \nto be closer to $900 billion under the plan that was devised recently \nand submitted to CBO. Nonetheless, it is a massive increase in Federal \nspending, matched by equally massive cuts and tax increases--cuts in \nMedicare and tax increases--to make it appear that the impact on the \ndeficit is marginal. But don't be fooled. When those who support this \napproach defend it, they will tell us it bends the cost curve. The cost \ncurve they are talking about is the cost to the Federal Government. \nThey are not telling us the cost of the Federal Government--the \nexpenditures of the Federal Government--will be going down. What they \nare telling us is the expenditures will not be going up faster than the \ntaxes and the cuts in Medicare are going up.\n  It is important for the American public to recognize that this \nlegislation represents yet again one huge step of the Federal \nGovernment into management and control of the health care economy, and \nthat huge new step of the Federal Government into management of the \neconomy will be financed squarely on the backs of the middle class with \na huge tax increase. That is not what America was asking for.\n  So to summarize, Madam President, what do we have? We have a proposal \nthat will not bend the cost curve; it will, in fact, cause the cost \ncurve on which everyone in America is focusing--the cost of health care \nand the cost of insurance--to go up. It will not achieve universal \ncoverage for those who do not have access to insurance today, but it \nwill put the Federal Government much more in charge and control of our \nhealth care economy and will grow the Federal Government by nearly $1 \ntrillion of new spending at the expense of $\\1/2\\ trillion of tax \nincreases and $400 billion of Medicare cuts.\n  That is not the kind of health care reform our Nation needs. It is \nnot the kind of health care reform the American people have asked for. \nWe should change the debate, and we should begin focusing on those \nkinds of common ground areas that we know how to identify where we can \nbend the cost curve--the true cost curve--down, where we can do so \nwithout raising taxes on the American people, and we can do so without \ndevastating the Medicare programs of our country.\n  With that, Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). The Senator from Kansas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I understand I am allowed 10 minutes of \nthis morning business period; is that correct?\n\n[[Page S10875]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to share my concerns about \nthe tax increases called for in the health care reform bill that is now \nbeing finalized behind closed doors. I want to make sure the American \npeople truly understand what these tax increases will mean for them and \ntheir families. This bill calls for an incredible and shocking $500 \nbillion in taxes, in massive new taxes, taxes that will fall on average \nAmericans who already know their tax burden is too high.\n  We hear a lot about the efforts behind the closed doors to merge \nthree different bills and all the costs and all the efforts to get more \nvoters onboard. But we do not really hear much about the tax increases. \nThey really should make the taxpayer sit up and take notice.\n  The behind-the-doors crowd has tried to disguise some of the new \ntaxes in this bill by presenting them as being paid for by targeted \nhealth care industries. However, the reality is that average Americans \nwho purchase health insurance and use medical services, from \nprescription drugs to hearing aids, are the ones who will foot the bill \nfor this tax-and-spending spree. The higher taxes called for in this \nbill come straight out of Americans' pocketbooks. American taxpayers, \nAmericans, have the right to know, they have the right to be informed, \nthey have the right to understand, and they have the right to be \nheard--not only on the spending, not only on the health care reform \nbill, but in regard to the taxes they will pay.\n  Let me give just a few examples of the new taxes called for and who \nwill actually pay them.\n  The bill imposes a 40-percent excise tax on health insurance \nproviders that offer high-cost health insurance plans. This provision \nis the largest tax hike in the bill. It raises $201 billion. Of this \namount, an analysis by the Joint Committee on Taxation, or the JCT, \nfinds that more than 80 percent or $164 billion of the tax will come \nfrom increased income and payroll taxes on higher wages. When the bill \nis implemented, however, the excise tax is likely to hit 40 percent of \nAmerican families, so the reality is that these families, not the \ninsurance providers, will be on the hook for the $164 billion.\n  The bill raises taxes on those who pay for their health care out of \npocket by raising the floor for deducting catastrophic medical expenses \nfrom 7.5 percent to 10 percent of adjusted gross income. Those who take \nthis deduction are most often seniors and those with serious medical \nissues. Eighty-seven percent of taxpayers who claim this deduction have \nincome under $100,000.\n  While an amendment to exempt taxpayers 65 or older from the higher \nthreshold was approved in committee, thank goodness, don't be fooled: \nthe exemption is only in effect in the first 3 years. As a result, in \nthe following years roughly 50 percent of the taxpayers affected by \nthis proposal will be over the age of 65. This makes no sense.\n  The bill raises taxes on the more than 35 million Americans who \nparticipate in flexible spending accounts. The median income of a \nflexible spending account participant is $55,000. This program is a \nvery important benefit for many families for whom health insurance does \nnot cover, or does not sufficiently cover, some of the highest cost \nhealth care expenses, such as dental, vision, and also prescription \ndrug costs. It is also important for individuals who manage chronic \ndiseases such as diabetes, heart disease, or cancer. FSAs allows \nparticipants to set aside money out of their own pockets to pay for \nthese necessary expenses. However, under this bill the government caps \nhow much can be set aside in a flexible spending account, a person's \nown account, effectively raising the tax burden on certain FSA \nparticipants and increasing their health care costs--typical of a \ndisguised tax in this bill.\n  Another tax attack: It also eliminates the ability of individuals to \nuse money from their accounts, the FSA accounts, to purchase over-the-\ncounter medications. Here we are, trying to put downward pressure on \nhealth care costs. Rather than maintaining current law that gives \nconsumers the option to purchase over-the-counter medications through a \nflexible spending account that they have chosen to put money into, the \nbill instead directs them to more costly alternatives and increased use \nof the health care system and limits the consumers' ability to fully \nuse their own accounts.\n  Another example of the stealth taxes called for in this bill is the \nindividual mandate penalty. Although the President has said this \npenalty is not a tax, the Finance Committee bill adds this provision \nunder a section called the ``Excise Tax on Individuals Without \nEssential Health Benefits Coverage.'' The government expects to collect \n$4 billion from this tax.\n  In 2013, almost half of those Americans who will be paying the \npenalty tax will have incomes between $22,800 and $68,400 for a family \nof four. This penalty essentially means the IRS will now tax you if you \ndo not buy a health care plan approved by the government. Let me repeat \nthat. This penalty essentially means the IRS will now tax you if you \ndon't buy a health care plan approved by the government.\n  Not only that, this bill also expands the reach of the IRS even \nfurther into the lives of ordinary Americans, allowing them to collect \nmore information than ever before about you and your health care \nchoices in order to tax you based on these choices. This provision \nhighlights one of the most disturbing aspects of this bill: the \nincreased role the IRS will play in the lives and health care choices \nof every American.\n  Under this bill, the IRS will gain unprecedented new powers. But here \nis the clincher. There is no money in this bill to pay for the \nexpansion of the IRS that will have to occur for the IRS to administer \nand enforce these new tax provisions--emphasis on ``enforce.'' How much \nwill that cost? How many billions will be needed to pay for this growth \nin government? How many more employees will the IRS have to hire? We \ndon't know. But make no mistake, every American should understand that \nthe IRS will be playing a bigger role in their life and their health \ncare decisions.\n  Question, for all those who braved the townhall meetings. Everyone \nwho wants more IRS involvement in their lives, raise your hands. I \ndon't think in these townhall meetings you will hear many hands \nclapping. Under this bill, not only will Americans see massive new \ntaxes, they will also see an unprecedented expansion of the Internal \nRevenue Service and a further reach by government into their lives.\n  This is the wrong solution to health care reform. Americans are \nlooking for real reform that preserves their health care choices. But \nreform that comes with a $500 billion tax increase and is supervised, \nif not more, by the Internal Revenue Service is simply not the answer.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, this health care debate is one of the most \nimportant debates we have ever had in this country. We are talking \nabout one-sixth of the American economy. We better get it right because \nif we do not, this economy will never be able to recover. If we go down \nthe wrong path and we spend too much time building the government at \nthe expense of the individuals in this country, we will never be able \nto change it. So this is a very important time, and I am calling upon \nall my colleagues in both the Senate and the House to try to work \ntogether so we can come up with a program, a system that literally will \nwork.\n  We can build upon things we already agree upon. Things such as \npreexisting conditions should be covered, automatically covered. That \nis a very difficult issue; it is not something you can just say glibly. \nThe fact is, we have to resolve this problem so people will not just \nwait until they get sick to buy insurance because they have a right to \ndo so under any new policy we are coming up with. But they should be \nable to get into the insurance market now.\n  Having said that, there are many on the other side who would like to \nhave what they call a public plan or what I\n\n[[Page S10876]]\n\ncall a government plan. The problem with the government plan is that \nthe central force would be right here in Washington, filled with \nbureaucracy, filled with expenses, filled with all of the clogs that \noccur in Washington, DC. And we will not be solving the individual \nproblems of the various States, each of which has its own demographics. \nI have often pointed out that Utah's demographics are not the same as \nNew York's or California's or those of Massachusetts. But neither are \nNew York's the same as those of Massachusetts or California. Each State \nhas its own demographic problems.\n  Utah is considered one of the top three States in the delivery of \nhealth care. There is a good reason for that; that is, we thought it \nthrough and we basically bring health care closer to the people. We \nalready have an exchange in Utah which is working to a large degree. It \nis just starting, but the fact is, it has been embraced and accepted by \npeople. We would bitterly resent a one-size-fits-all Federal Government \nprogram to resolve all problems.\n  This business of making sure preexisting conditions are covered is \nfraught with all kinds of difficulties if we do not do this right. \nThere are all kinds of expenses if we fail to observe the past and, I \nmight add, all kinds of bureaucratic problems if we do not work \ntogether to get this problem solved.\n  On the other hand, are we going to go to a system where government \ntells people they have to buy insurance, whether it be a public plan or \notherwise? I am not sure constitutionally that the government has that \nkind of power. If the government has that kind of power, to tell people \nthey have to have insurance even if they don't want it--and that \nincludes the public plan insurance--then what limitations are there on \ngovernment? What happens to all the freedoms we all take for granted? \nWhat happens to the liberties we have embedded in the Constitution?\n  These are important issues. They are not issues you just brush aside \nbecause one side or the other wants to have the Federal Government take \nover all control of our health care system.\n  I might add, I think most of us agree there should be transparency in \nthe system. If we had transparency over all of the hospitals, all of \nthe physicians, and we could tell which ones are great, which ones \naren't, we could make our own decisions as to where to go for \nparticular types of care, especially very serious care. I think most of \nus would like to provide a system where our constituents could do that.\n  What about medical liability reform? As a former medical liability \ndefense lawyer, I defended doctors, hospitals, nurses, and health care \nproviders who needed defending, many of whom did not commit negligence \nbut were finding themselves suddenly in court in front of juries that \nmay be empathetic to somebody who did not have a good result even \nthough there was no negligence involved. I estimated 25 years ago that, \nin unnecessary defensive medicine, we are probably wasting upwards of \n$300 billion a year.\n  That sounds very high. But I am finding more and more people are \nstarting to come to the conclusion that we waste an awful lot of money \non what is unnecessary defensive medicine. We all want defensive \nmedicine because we all want the doctors to do what they should do. Our \nadvice to the doctors back in those days happened to be, if somebody \ncomes to you with a common disease or injury, you cannot afford to just \ngive them--tell them to just do the minimum. You better have every test \nand every procedure you possibly can in your history, so if you ever do \nget sued, you will be able to say you went way beyond the standard of \npractice in the community and did everything you possibly could to try \nto help this person with their problems and that you should not have \nliability because of that.\n  Well, I have to say we can go on and on. It was interesting to me, \nwhen I first asked Dr. Elmendorf, who heads our CBO, the Congressional \nBudget Office, what does unnecessary defensive medicine cost us, Dr. \nElmendorf came up with an extremely low figure over 10 years. I think \nit was something like $10 billion.\n  I chatted with him and I said: That cannot be so. I explained to him \nwhat my experience was and the experience of almost anybody who has any \nexperience in this field, and he went back. He said: Well, I am going \nto go back and review it. He did go back and review it and came up with \na figure of $54 billion over 10 years, just for Federal Government \nunnecessary defensive medicine. So it is much more than that if you add \nin everything else and extrapolate it all out.\n  We should be able to save some of these dollars. That also would help \nus to be able to pay for real health care that needs to be done.\n  We know the health care reform bill has been basically written in the \noffice of the majority leader. While we do not know what this bill will \nlook like, because it apparently has been written in the secrecy of the \nmajority leader's office, and by very few people, by the way--and the \nsame over in the House--every indication is, it will be similar to the \nbill reported out by the Finance Committee earlier this month.\n  That bill, which would drastically change the very fabric of an \nindustry that affects every American in the most personal way and \nrepresents one-sixth of our economy, contains roughly $409 billion in \nnew taxes that are going to be passed on to the average taxpayer. Many \nUtahns are asking me who is going to have to pay these new taxes? \nUnfortunately, I have to tell them that it will not just be the \nwealthiest among us, but middle and even lower income American families \nas well.\n  Perhaps the most solid promise that President Obama made during his \ncampaign was that ``no [one] making less than $250,000 a year will see \nany form of tax increase!'' He further pledged that the 98 percent of \nAmericans earning less than this amount would not see any tax increase \non income and savings. Let me repeat that: The President promised that \n98 percent of Americans earning less than $250,000 would not see any \ntax increase on income and savings.\n  The majority leader is preparing a partisan proposal to which he \nhopes to attract at least a modicum of Republican support. Thus far, \nhowever, he has no takers from my side of the aisle, and support from \nsome on his side appears to be waning. Perhaps a major reason for this \nis that everyone knows the bill would break the President's promises \nnot to raise taxes on average Americans. That is not the only thing it \nwould do.\n  The Finance Committee product offers a cornucopia of revenue raisers \nthat would fund health care reform. Some of these provisions include \ndirect taxes on lower and middle income wage earners, while others \nwould hit average families indirectly through penalties, fees, and \nhigher costs.\n  If your employer offers you a higher cost insurance plan, your taxes \nwill likely rise under this plan. If you have a flexible spending \naccount or a health savings account, your taxes will likely rise. If \nyou or your family use a medical device costing more than $100, such as \na hearing aid or an insulator, or if you purchase prescription drugs, \nthe cost of those items will likely rise.\n  And ironically, in a bill that is designed to lower the costs of \nhealth care, the cost of health insurance itself is likely to rise \nunder this plan. And if you do not have insurance, the cost of not \nhaving health insurance will rise because the bill will impose a tax if \nyou do not get insurance.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle will probably paint this \nrise in penalties, fees, and higher costs as Republican hocus-pocus. \nBut do not take it from me or my colleagues; take it from the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on \nTaxation.\n  Looking first at the direct taxes on the middle class, the Democrats' \nbill declares war on savings accounts for health care. For example, the \nbill would limit the amount that employees can set aside of their own \nmoney into flexible spending accounts. In addition, over-the-counter \nmedicine would no longer be qualified expenses for FSAs and health \nsavings accounts, unless you have a doctor's note. Lastly, the proposal \nincludes an increase from 10 percent to 20 percent for the penalty for \nwithdrawals that are not used for qualified medical expenses. All \ntogether, this means that employees could be facing a 55-percent \nFederal tax on a bottle of aspirin. I thought we were trying to make \nhealth care more affordable, not more expensive.\n\n[[Page S10877]]\n\n  This year, 35 million employees participate in employer-sponsored, \nemployee-funded flexible spending accounts. These accounts provide \nrelief for the ever-increasing amount of health care that families must \npay out of their own pockets. How does cutting back on FSA accounts \nlower the costs of health care? These accounts are not just provided to \nthe wealthy. On the contrary, the average income for flexible spending \naccount participants is just $55,000 per year.\n  Another clear increase on taxes for middle income families is the \nraising of the threshold for the itemized medical expense deduction \nfrom 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income to 10 percent. This tax \ndeduction is already means-tested so that it only kicks in when medical \nexpenses are catastrophic or nearly so. This is not a tax benefit for \nthe wealthy. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that in 2013, \napproximately 11.5 million taxpayers would be affected by this \nproposal. Of that number, about half have incomes less than $75,000.\n  Perhaps even worse are the indirect tax increases in the bill. One of \nthe most troubling ones to me is an unprecedented fee levied on entire \nsegments of the health care industry, including pharmaceuticals, \nmedical devices, and health insurance. While these fees would be paid \nby corporations, they will ultimately be passed on to consumers in the \nform of higher prices or on to employees in the form of lower pay, or \neven layoffs. Under this plan, the cost of everything from contact \nlenses to hearing aids to thermometers would rise for consumers, \ncreating one more unfair burden on middle income families seeking \naffordable health care.\n  And if you decide to either not have health insurance or if you need \na more expensive plan than is allowed, the Democratic plan would raise \ntaxes on you, even if you do not make anywhere near $250,000 per year. \nThis is part of the so-called individual mandate, which requires \nindividuals to obtain health care coverage or pay an extra tax. The \namount of tax could reach as much as $750 per uninsured adult. Some may \nsay this is simply a penalty for not doing what Uncle Sam wants you to \ndo, but let us face it, it is nothing more than a new tax.\n  There are at least two provisions in the Finance Committee bill that \nraise serious constitutional questions. First, is the transition relief \nfor the high-cost insurance plans that is granted to 17 yet-to-be \ndetermined States. This means that a different tax rate will apply \ndepending on where you live. Second, is the individual mandate itself. \nThe constitutionality of the mandate, as pointed out by the \nCongressional Research Service, has never been addressed. We are \ntreading into new waters. Are we just going to simply ignore these \nserious constitutional questions?\n  Again, President Obama promised from the beginning that he would not \nraise taxes on the 98 percent of Americans who make less than $250,000. \nUnfortunately, the Democratic proposal we will soon be debating would \nbreak that promise. We are all for real health care reform, everybody, \nRepublicans, Democrats and Independents, but not all of us are willing \nto pass it on the backs of middle-income taxpayers. At a time when we \nhave trillion-dollar-plus deficits and an unemployment rate nearing \ndouble digits, this would be a colossal mistake.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, soon we will have an historic opportunity \nto take up the most significant change in our health care system in \nmany decades, a bill that will help Americans deal with their health \ncare needs, that will reform our health care system so we have \naffordable, quality health care for all Americans. This bill will help \nmiddle-income families who currently have health insurance. Because we \nare going to build on the current system, protect those who have good \nhealth care coverage so they are able to keep that coverage in the \nfuture, we base it on building on what is right in our health care \nsystem and correcting the problems that currently exist.\n  For a family who has health insurance today, they are paying a large \namount of money for those who don't have health insurance. The number \nof people without health insurance has grown dramatically, to over 46 \nmillion Americans. The cost to a family who has health insurance for \nthose who don't have health insurance is $1,100 a year. That is a \nhidden tax on middle-income families today. Health insurance reform \nwill help correct that inequity to help middle-income families. It will \nalso reform the practices of health insurance companies dealing with \npreexisting conditions and caps put on the amount of coverage and with \nmaking sure that prevention is available without copayments and \ndeductibles. All that will help middle-income families today who have \nhealth insurance.\n  But the critical factor, why this is so important for middle-income \nfamilies today, is because of the escalating cost of health care. \nHealth care is growing three times greater than wages. That means for \nthe typical family, every year they are falling further and further \nbehind on their standard of living, because more and more of their \nincome needs to be devoted toward health care costs. Whether your \nemployee pays it or you pay it or a combination of both, it comes out \nof your compensation package. For many families, they are actually \nreceiving less income every year because so much more is devoted toward \nhealth care costs.\n  In Maryland, 10 years ago the cost for a family was about $6,000 for \nhealth insurance. Today that is $12,000. By the year 2017, it is \nprojected to be $23,000. We are spending in America today $7,400 per \nperson for health care, $2.4 trillion. Health reform will help middle-\nincome families because we are going to bring down the cost of health \ncare.\n  First, we invest in wellness. We know that if people take care of \ntheir own health care needs, if they deal with their diabetes, high \nblood pressure, high cholesterol, with keeping themselves healthy \nthrough exercise, if they don't smoke, all of that will bring down the \ncost of health care. The health care reform that we will be taking up \ninvests in wellness programs, gives incentives for wellness programs to \nbring down the cost. What we also do is invest in health information \ntechnology. The amount of money we waste every year because of the \nadministrative inefficiencies of the system is staggering. Also we have \nunnecessary tests that are given in the emergency room because they \ndon't have medical records. We have the technology. Let's use it. We \ncan use technology to keep people healthy by sharing information so \nthat your health care provider knows what medicines you are taking. And \nmanaging care, we can save money by managing diseases much more \neffectively than we do. For all those reasons, health care reform will \nhelp control the escalating costs, and that will help middle-income \nfamilies. It will also help small businesses.\n  Small businesses need more competition among health care insurance \ncompanies. Today, if you are a small business owner, there are very few \noptions available as to who you can choose as your health insurance \ncompany. As a result, you are subjected to unpredictable annual \nadjustments in your premiums. We already know that health insurance is \ntoo expensive. We already know that it increases every year by too high \na percentage rate. But for a small business owner, it is worse than \nthat. They can be subjected to a 20, 30, 40-percent increase in any \ngiven year because they are not in the large pools that larger \ncompanies are. Health insurance reform helps small businesses by \nproviding larger pools that small businesses can get into, more \ncompetition. The State exchanges provide information that is critically \nimportant for small businesses to get a competitive product, to get the \nproduct they want. It makes it more affordable.\n  Let me give one example. We all have received letters. I have \nreceived lots of letters from my constituents. I want to read one I \nreceived. It comes from\n\n[[Page S10878]]\n\nKeith, a Maryland small business owner. He writes:\n\n       Currently, I have what is considered a ``Cadillac'' health \n     plan. It is an old CareFirst Blue Cross Blue Shield plan that \n     does not cover vision or dental [and has] a moderate \n     deductible. It only covers general health and drugs. My wife \n     is disabled and is unable to work. She is under age 50 and \n     has Medicare as a primary insurance and is on my family plan \n     as secondary where she gets drug coverage.\n\n  This person is a small business owner involved in a plan.\n\n       I have one child with some health issues on the plan as \n     well. Based [on] my situation, my health insurance options \n     are limited.\n       I am a small business owner and have had significant \n     increases in my insurance costs over the last 20 years. \n     Currently, I pay $29,000 for family coverage thru (sic) my \n     company and last year I had $9,900 in out of pocket expenses, \n     which is ``normal'' for my family. My income is above \n     $100,000, but well below the $250,000.\n       At one time I considered myself part of the middle class, \n     but with my ever increasing health care costs, I now have \n     second thoughts. . . .\n       It is unbelievable to me that a family like mine could be \n     in this situation. I know there are others far worse than \n     mine and can empathize with their plight. . . .\n       How can I be spending about $40,000 a year [on health care] \n     with no end in sight?\n\n  Well, help is on the way. The bills that have been reported out of \nour committees that the majority leader is now merging to bring to the \nSenate floor will help my constituent Keith, who finds that he cannot \nafford health care today even though he has certainly a reasonable \nincome.\n  This legislation will also help our seniors. I mention that because \nthere is a lot of concern about how we can strengthen the Medicare \nsystem, which is so important to our seniors. Well, the problem with \nMedicare today is that health care costs are going up. Medicare is a \npretty efficient program. We know its administrative costs are far less \nthan private insurance. But we cannot bring down the government cost of \nMedicare unless we bring down health care costs in America. That is \nexactly what the health care reform proposals will do.\n  It will also, by the way, use those savings to help our seniors by \nimproving their prescription drug benefit so we can certainly make \nimprovements to mitigate the doughnut hole on prescription drug \ncoverage. It strengthens dramatically the preventative health care \nservices that are offered our seniors under the Medicare system.\n  Well, the uninsured are also helped under this bill and those who are \nin danger of losing their health insurance by the State exchanges, \nwhere there will be more competition, more availability. The bill deals \nwith affordability, providing subsidies for those who otherwise could \nnot afford the health insurance.\n  One of the prime ways that is done is through the public option, so \nlet me talk a moment about it. There has been a lot of discussion about \nit. I saw that it is going to be included in the bill in the House of \nRepresentatives. The majority leader is looking to include that in the \nbill that is going to be brought forward on the floor of this Senate.\n  A public option is nothing strange to Americans. It is not that the \ngovernment takes over health care; it does not. Health care is provided \nby private doctors, private hospitals. The most successful public \noption program in America in health care is Medicare, and I do not see \nanyone coming and saying we should do Medicare in a different way. \nMedicare has worked well, with the government providing the way we \ncollect the premiums and collect the dollars necessary to pay the \ndoctors and hospitals that are private, and where the Medicare \nbeneficiaries can choose their own doctor or hospital. That is the way \nit should be.\n  The reason it is important to include a public insurance option in \nthe bill that is being brought forward is to make sure we have an \naffordable option for those who cannot find insurance, so we have an \naffordable product in every part of America. If you live in rural \nAmerica, it is tough to find an insurance company that is interested in \ninsuring you if you are in the individual market. That is just a fact \nof life.\n  So the public option provides an affordable option and provides more \ncompetition. In my own State of Maryland, two insurance companies \nrepresent 71 percent of the private insurance market. We do not have \neffective competition in our State of Maryland. The public option \noffers more competition. If we have more competition, it is going to be \nless costly. That is the reason we want to make sure it is included in \nthe bill that is brought forward and the bill we hope will be \nreconciled with the House and sent to the President of the United \nStates.\n  Mr. President, as I said when I took the floor, we have a unique \nopportunity. We have a unique opportunity in taking up health care \nreform and health insurance reform to help the people of our Nation. We \nhave to make sure we get it right. I agree with my colleagues, we need \nto take the time to make sure we get this bill right, but we need to \nact. We need to act in order to protect middle-income families so they \nhave affordable health care coverage in America.\n  We need to act to help small businesses so they have more choices, \nmore competition, so they can afford to provide health insurance for \ntheir employees. We need to act for our seniors and those who are \ndisabled in the Medicare system to make sure we strengthen Medicare for \nfuture generations and can expand the benefits that are covered under \nMedicare.\n  We need to act for the sake of our economy. We need to act for the \nsake of our Nation. I encourage my colleagues to get engaged in this \ndebate so that, at the end of the day, we pass a bill that is going to \nbe in the best interest of the people of this Nation.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, these days, the economy is foremost on the \nminds of Americans, and well it should be. Two out of five Americans \nsay the economy should be our top priority. That is more than twice as \nmany as cite any other issue--two times that the economy is much more \nimportant.\n  The unemployment insurance bill before us today helps to address the \neconomy in several ways. In several ways, our legislation would help \nAmericans to get and keep good jobs. First, our bill would extend much \nneeded unemployment benefits. This unemployment insurance relief would \nget money into the hands of people who need it--need it desperately. I \nmight say, there are about 15 million Americans out of work chasing \nabout 3 million jobs. There are many more people unemployed looking for \nwork.\n  When we help unemployed Americans, let's also remember we help our \ncommunities, not just the individuals who receive unemployment \nbenefits--and they have earned those benefits--but also the communities \nare helped by payment of those benefits. When we help our unemployed \nneighbors, we also help to keep open the neighborhood grocery store and \nthe neighborhood gas station. When we help our unemployed neighbors, we \nalso help to keep houses out of foreclosure. When we help our \nunemployed neighbors, we also help our economy; we help ourselves.\n  According to officials in my home State of Montana, if we do not pass \nthis 14-week extension, then at least 7,000 Montanans will lose their \nunemployment benefits. That is a significant number when we consider \nthe population of my State, which is just a little bit over 900,000 \ntotal.\n  A report prepared in June for the Montana Manufacturing Center showed \nthat nationwide manufacturing employment fell from 13.8 million workers \nat the end of 2007 to 12.4 million workers at the beginning of 2009. \nThat is a 10.5-percent drop in little more than a year--a 10.5-percent \ndrop in workers in just more than a year. The decline nationwide was \nechoed in Montana, where manufacturing employment fell 8 percent.\n\n[[Page S10879]]\n\n  In south central Montana, logging and milling have slowed down in the \nBozeman area, just as they have elsewhere in the State. That means \nworkers in the logging and milling industries have been losing their \njobs.\n  It is absolutely essential we get this aid to those in need so they \ncan continue to put food on the table while they continue to look for \nwork.\n  A second integral part of this legislative package is the extension \nof the home buyers tax credit. This tax credit has already helped \nnearly 1.5 million Americans to achieve the dream of owning a home. \nWithout this tax credit, many of these first-time home buyers would \nhave remained on the sidelines. They would have been unable to buy a \nhome in these challenging economic times.\n  The home buyers tax credit provides up to $8,000 for millions of \nAmericans to purchase their first home. The credit has helped to reduce \nthe excess supply of homes on the market and, in doing so, the credit \nhas helped to stabilize the housing market.\n\n  In many places throughout the country, homes are selling and \ninventories are dropping. The Pending Home Sales Index, a leading \nindicator of existing home sales, rose again in September for the \neighth straight month. Total housing inventory fell 10.8 percent at the \nend of August.\n  Home prices also appear to be slowly recovering. The Case-Shiller \nHome Price Index increased 1.4 percent in June after falling for 35 \nconsecutive months. These encouraging numbers tell us that the home \nbuyer tax credit is working. Yet the housing market remains fragile. \nHigh unemployment has increased foreclosure rates, inventories remain \nwell above normal levels, and homes are worth substantially less than \nthey were a year ago.\n  In May, back home in Montana, I helped with a charity raffle of a new \nhome in Billings. During the event, the homebuilders for this home told \nme how well the home buyer tax credit is working. They said it \ndefinitely helped to boost their sales. The builder made it very clear \nhow much the tax credit has helped in Montana.\n  Realtors and home builders across Montana have provided examples of \nthe tax credit working to get buyers off the fence and into new homes. \nThe Billings Gazette recently reported on one development where 30 \nhomes were sold this year. Home buyers of 17 of those homes used the \nfirst-time home buyer tax credit when they bought their home. In \nBozeman, MT, housing starts and home purchases have dropped off, but it \nis clear that the home buyer tax credit has helped to cushion that.\n  The success of the American economy is closely tied to the success of \nthe housing market. By helping to stabilize the housing market, the \nhome buyer tax credit has helped to shore up the economy as it begins \nto recover. It is important that we temporarily extend the home buyer \ntax credit to further support our recovery. That is why we have \nproposed extending the tax credit to April 30 of next year. Because the \nhousing market remains fragile, we propose expanding the credit to \ninclude a greater number of potential home buyers.\n  As before, the $8,000 tax credit would be available to those buying a \nprincipal residence for the first time, but it will also be available \nto home buyers who have lived in their current residence for 5 years or \nmore. These home buyers hoping to move up would be eligible for a \n$6,500 tax credit. This strikes a fair middle ground. We would help \nfirst-time home buyers and we would also help homeowners looking to \nmove up to a new home, but we would exclude from the credit speculators \nwho may have recently purchased a home intending to flip it for a fast \nprofit.\n  Our amendment would also increase income limits. This would enable an \neven greater number of potential home buyers to take the credit. Those \nearning less than $225,000 for joint filers and $125,000 for single \nfilers would be eligible. Increasing this threshold would further \nstimulate the housing market by bringing a new group of buyers into the \nmarket. These days, millions of renters earn more than $75,000 a year.\n  Our new home buyers tax credit would also include a ``binding \ncontract'' provision that would allow anyone who has entered into a \nbinding contract to be eligible for the credit, so long as they close \non the home within 60 days. Also, the extended tax credit would \ncontinue to allow military personnel to claim their credit for an \nadditional year.\n  Many more Americans stand to gain from the extension of the home \nbuyers tax credit, and with our amendment they would get help buying a \nnew home during these tough economic times.\n  Homes that are worth more than $800,000 would not be eligible for the \nhome buyers tax credit. We need to target the credit toward those \npotential home buyers who need it most, not those buyers who would have \nbought a new home even without the new credit.\n  To address concerns such as those raised by the Treasury Inspector \nGeneral for Tax Administration, we have given the IRS additional tools \nto prevent erroneous credits from being paid.\n  It is important that this tax credit does not become a permanent \nfixture in the Tax Code. That is very important. It certainly is to me. \nOur amendment would end the credit on April 30 of next year. This \nextension would get us through the winter, traditionally the worst \nseason for real estate. Our amendment would jump-start the housing \nmarket as it enters the summer months in 2010. With the new ``binding \ncontract'' provision, we would effectively extend this tax credit for 7 \nmonths, long enough to encourage home buyers to buy homes but short \nenough to remain fiscally responsible. It is a fair approach and it \nwould play an important role in getting the housing market back on its \nfeet.\n  In addition to unemployment insurance and the home buyer credit, our \namendment would also add needed net operating loss relief for \nbusinesses. Under current law, corporations may carry back net \noperating losses 2 years. In the stimulus bill earlier this year, we \nwere able to increase that carryback period to 5 years, but only for \nsmall businesses. The carryback provision for small businesses has been \na great help to struggling small companies. They were able to carry \nback their losses to profitable years, and then they could file quick \nrefund claims. This gave them much needed cash to meet payroll, invest \nin new equipment or inventory, or pay for other current expense \nobligations.\n  But many businesses did not qualify for the carryback stimulus \nprovision that helped small businesses. Many larger companies are also \nhurting during this economic downturn. Senator Snowe and I recognized \nthis during our discussions on the stimulus bill. We introduced a bill \nto expand the needed relief to all businesses, and now we are including \nthat relief here.\n  The great recession, which I heard to date is officially over because \nnow the GDP is growing for the first time in I don't know how many \nmonths--but the great recession has hurt Montana businesses from \nfarming to retail to manufacturing. A recent series in the Billings \nGazette highlights a number of historically profitable Montana \nindustries that are facing serious losses as a result of hard economic \ntimes. The lumber industry provides an acute example.\n  Pyramid Mountain Lumber is the oldest surviving family-owned and \nfamily-operated mill in Montana. Loren Rose, the controller of Pyramid \nMountain, reports that their mill has faced increased costs on logs and \nfuel and orders have dropped because of the slowdown in home building. \nThe owners have invested everything they have in the mill. They are \nterrific operators. I spent a good bit of time at that mill and I am \nvery proud of it. They have done a super job. Loren said the lumber \nmills are ``all in'' as far as ownership investment. They have nothing \nleft to invest. Other mill owners have had to shut down. Loren said \nthat an NOL provision such as that in our bill would ``absolutely'' \nhelp in ``providing working capital to the small, independent mills.'' \nThat is his quote. Our NOL provision would directly help this industry \nand others in Montana that are struggling to survive in these tough \neconomic times. Let's expand the help we provided to small businesses \nto all businesses; that is, all businesses that need the cash infusion \nnow.\n  The questions always arise: How do we pay for these provisions? Our \namendment pays for them responsibly. In 2004, Congress created a new \nway for American-based corporations to allocate interest for purposes \nof computing their taxes. The implementation of that allocation method \nwas to be effective in tax years beginning after 2010.\n\n[[Page S10880]]\n\nOur amendment delays the effective date of that provision until tax \nyears beginning after 2017.\n  Our amendment also increases penalties for taxpayers who fail to \ntimely file partnership and S-corporation returns. These two provisions \nwould allow Congress to provide additional incentives for home buyers \nand implement expanded NOL carryback relief for businesses. Both of \nthese goals are big steps toward boosting our economy.\n  Our amendment, I believe, is the right approach. I urge my colleagues \nto support it. Let us respond to the concern that is foremost on \nAmericans' minds, and that is jobs, that is the economy. Let us pass \nthis legislation to help unemployed Americans and provide tax relief, \nand let us pass this legislation that will help Americans to get and \nkeep good jobs.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to raise serious concerns \nwith the cap-and-trade legislation which is currently in hearings in \nthe Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works.\n  The committee is holding its third hearing today on the bill that \nwould presumably be coming to the floor of the Senate. One of the \npanels today is going to focus on the impact on transportation of the \ncap-and-trade bill. I think Members deserve to know the real costs and \neffects this bill will have on transportation. That is what I will talk \nabout today.\n  Last week, Senator Bond and I unveiled a report that analyzed the \nfuel cost implications from the House bill that is making its way \nthrough the House. Our report forecasted a $3.6 trillion gas tax on the \nAmerican economy for the life of the program, which is 2015 through \n2050.\n  At this time of economic uncertainty, with 15 million people out of \nwork, just about every American is cutting back on spending. Do we \nreally want to put a tax on energy and increase energy costs for \nfamilies and small businesses at a time like this? I think the answer \nis obvious. The worst thing we could do to our struggling economy is to \noverburden it with new taxes and more regulations. But that is exactly \nwhat the cap-and-trade bill is doing, and that is exactly what is going \nthrough Congress right now.\n  This past weekend, we began to see what was in the Senate bill that \nis being proposed. It is even more stringent than the House bill. The \nlegislation on the Senate side would impose a huge tax on business and \nlevy a massive economic burden on all Americans.\n  For most Americans, gasoline is a mandatory expense, and raising the \ncost of it, of course, is going to strain working families, small \nbusinesses, farmers, ranchers, and our whole economy. Last year, when \nconsumers experienced $4 gasoline and $5 diesel, it caused enormous \nhardships for Americans. Fortunately, those fuel prices were temporary. \nBut under cap and trade, those high prices will be permanent--at least \nuntil 2050.\n  High fuel prices don't just impact our transportation expenses; we \nare actually hit twice because the gas tax raises the price of every \ngood and service--groceries, clothes--that consumers must purchase in \norder to live.\n  Energy costs are, among our businesses, top operational expenses. \nCompanies face a variety of energy expenses, ranging from heating and \ncooling their plants and facilities to powering equipment and lighting. \nIn order for businesses to withstand this heavier tax burden and to \nremain viable, they will be forced to pass fuel costs on to consumers \nthrough higher prices.\n  Several industries will be more severely penalized by the gas tax \nthan others.\n  Let's take trucking. The American trucking industry is a major target \nof the cap-and-trade gas tax. In 2007, 1.7 million drivers of tractor \ntrailers logged 145 billion vehicle miles, consuming 28.5 billion \ngallons of fuel. That equates to an annual fuel cost per vehicle of \n$34,560. That number will skyrocket under this cap-and-trade proposal \nthat is going through Congress. When you consider that the average \nself-employed truckdriver earns only $43,000 per year in net revenue, \nthe gas tax represents an enormous new tax on working middle-class \ntruckers.\n  Of course, truckers will not suffer those higher gas taxes alone. \nTheir additional costs will be shared by every consumer in the \nincreased price of everything they transport. At some point, nearly \neverything bought or sold must be shipped to a retailer. So the \nsweeping effect of the gas tax on every consumer, every person, every \nbusiness--certainly the trucking industry but every other business--\nwill harm our entire economy.\n  The pain doesn't stop with trucking. Our Nation's farmers and \nranchers, who are tasked with producing high-quality goods for much of \nthe world, will be irreparably harmed under the House's $2 trillion tax \non gasoline and $1.3 trillion tax on diesel fuel. Gas and diesel fuel-\npowered equipment, ranging from tractors to combines to fertilizing \nsystems, are the operational foundation of America's farms and ranches. \nEvery extra penny they pay will be seen in the cost of goods and \ncertainly the cost of food. Under the climate change legislation, they \nwill face $550 million in higher fuel costs in 2020.\n  Despite all of this pain we are going to see on our truckers, on our \nfamily farmers, and on every business, what good will it do? If there \nis a good side, let's look at it. It is supposed to be to help our \nenvironment. But even the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency \nAdministrator admits that unless China and India impose similar \nDraconian taxes and regulations, there will be no effect on world \ntemperatures. So what is the purpose of this increase in taxes and \nincrease in costs every American will bear? Well, there is no \nimprovement because it is certainly common sense to know that if we do \nthis unilaterally in the United States and put this tax on our \nrefineries, on our exploration companies that are trying to produce \nmore energy for our economy at a cheaper price and environmentally \nsafely, and if others around the world don't do it--put more caps on \nand more regulations--and they are spewing into the world much heavier \ncarbon emissions than the United States does now--if they don't change \nand we do, it will still come to our country. So there will not be any \neffect on the global environment.\n  Under the bills going through today, trillion-dollar figures have \nbeen discussed so nonchalantly in Washington that it seems as if they \nare losing their shock value. Americans must know that $3.6 trillion in \ngas taxes is a real number, and it is going to have a real effect on \nevery American.\n  We can improve the environment and we can improve the economy.\n  One of the things that is not being discussed, as we are talking \nabout putting more taxes on the industries that produce energy, the \nbread-and-butter energy of our economy, what isn't being discussed is \nnuclear power. Nuclear power has been shown time and again, where it is \nin place, that it is inexpensive, efficient, and it is environmentally \nsafe. There is no carbon emission from a nuclear powerplant.\n  So why does the House bill not even address nuclear? Why are we not \ntalking, in this administration, about nuclear power, which can be \nclean energy, efficient energy, and which has been proven to also have \nfewer consequences than once thought because the amount of nuclear \nwaste has now been lowered to a huge extent and can be safely kept? And \nif we continue our research, we will probably be able to reuse the \nnuclear waste and put it back into more nuclear power. Why aren't we \npursuing nuclear instead of just putting more taxes and regulations on \nthe bread-and-butter energy that is produced in our country?\n  We need to reject the cap-and-trade bills that are going through \nCongress right now. We need to focus on environmental policies that \nwill make a difference in our environment, that might make a difference \nin our global environment. But certainly unilateral regulations and \ntaxes just on America has been absolutely proven not to make a \ndifference in the global economy if no\n\n[[Page S10881]]\n\nother country adopts these Draconian measures, which they have all said \nthey are not going to do.\n  While I stand ready to support clean energy technology, nuclear \npower, I could not possibly support a bill that is going to wreck our \neconomy in a very precarious time and that will send jobs away from \nAmerica at a time when we know we need to increase jobs in America. It \nwill be sending American jobs overseas where it is easier to do \nbusiness and where regulation is more stable.\n  Mr. President, what are we doing? What are we doing talking about \nmore taxes and more regulations that will not impact the global \nenvironment? I hope that as these bills are vetted in committee, we \nwill stop and say: Let's do something rational. Let's promote clean \nenergy. Let's promote nuclear power. Let's don't hold back those who \nwould be willing to make that investment and take that chance.\n  We should not pass cap and trade, which will tax and regulate our \nenergy industry and it will not help the environment. That is a lose-\nlose proposition. I hope Congress and the majority in Congress will see \nthat this is the wrong way and stop the cap-and-trade bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak again about the issue that \nis the topic of the day for us in the Congress--independent of the \nquestion of Afghanistan and Iraq, which is our No. 1 concern--and that \nis the question of health care.\n  Today, the Speaker of the House and the Democratic leadership and \nmembership of the House unveiled their plan. It is 2,000 pages long. \nThey made the representation that, in some way, it wasn't going to \nincrease the deficit. This is a bill that is going to cost between $1 \ntrillion and $2 trillion over 10 years. The idea that it is not going \nto increase the deficit is so unbelievable just on its face that it \ndoesn't even pass the laugh test. If you believe that, then maybe the \nSpeaker of the House should sell you a bridge in Brooklyn--or even in \nOakland, for that matter. That one doesn't work, by the way. The simple \nfact is, when you increase the size of the government by $1 trillion or \n$2 trillion, as this bill proposes to do by massively creating a \nmassive new entitlement called a government-forced insurance plan, \nthere is no way you are going to be able to cut Medicare enough, as it \nis proposed in this bill, or raise taxes enough, as it is proposed in \nthis bill, to meet the cost of that program. There is no way it is \ngoing to happen. So to claim that this won't add one dime to the \ndeficit, as the President claimed he would not do when he spoke to the \nCongress, is just not believable.\n  Under this administration, we have seen a massive expansion in the \ndebt of this Nation. They represent constantly that they just inherited \nthis from the Bush administration. Yes, a fair amount of it did come \nover from the prior administration, but the budget they sent here, \nwhich has a trillion-dollar deficit every year for the next 10 years, \nisn't the Bush budget, it is their budget. The budget they sent over \nhere, which raises the debt in this country from 40 percent of GDP to \n80 percent, isn't the Bush budget, it is the Obama and Democratic \nbudget.\n  The representation was that we would go out and spend almost $1 \ntrillion--$800 billion--on a stimulus package, and that would create \njobs. What it created was debt for our children.\n  The numbers are starting to come in now. It was represented in New \nHampshire specifically, this administration said there would be 16,000 \njobs created in New Hampshire by the stimulus package. Since the \nstimulus package has passed, we have lost 12,000 jobs in our State, and \n$400 million has been spent in New Hampshire. The administration argues \n$400 million created 3,000 jobs. They have to use some pretty creative \naccounting to get to those 3,000 jobs. Even if we give them the benefit \nof the doubt, that is over $130,000 that it has cost Americans per job.\n  Did we have that money to spend? No. We sent the bill for that \npackage to our children. We put it on their backs. In fact, almost 50 \npercent of that stimulus package is going to be spent after this \nrecession is long over. It is going to be spent after the year 2011.\n  Chairman Bernanke, head of the Federal Reserve, said the recession \nwas over. He said that about 2 weeks ago. Granted, the pain and \nsuffering and the difficult economic times certainly are not over, and \nwe do need to be concerned about that. But in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, \neven in 2019, there will still be money being spent under that stimulus \npackage, and all of it will have been borrowed, borrowed from our \nchildren, and they will have to pay it back.\n  Then we had the Cash for Clunkers Program which was allegedly going \nto be this great stimulus initiative. That has been looked at by an \nentirely independent group, edmunds.com, which is an automobile site on \nthe Web. They tell you a car's value and give you an independent \nassessment of its qualities, pluses, and minuses. They took a look at \nthat program. They said there were 690,000 vehicles sold during the \nCash for Clunkers period. But they concluded--they are not \nconservative, they are not liberal, they are not moderate. They are \njust a professional group of people looking at what happens in the area \nof automobiles. They concluded that only 125,000 of those cars would \nnot have actually been purchased or sold by the dealer were the Cash \nfor Clunkers Program not in place. In other words, the vast majority of \ncars would have been sold; they would have been bought under Edmunds' \nestimates.\n  So we spent about $3 billion to buy 125,000 cars. That works out to \n$24,000 per car. Who did that bill go to? That is going to our kids \ntoo.\n  Just in the last 2 weeks--well, almost every week around here we hear \nproposals to spend money and not pay for it. A week ago, somebody \nsuggested from the administration that we should spend $14.5 billion by \nsending $250 to every Social Security recipient. Why did that come \nabout? That came about because people were starting to realize senior \ncitizens were getting a little upset with the fact that under the \nhealth care proposals that have been coming forward from the Finance \nCommittee, from the Labor Committee, now from the House, that under \nthese proposals Medicare was going to be significantly reduced. Seniors \nwere going to lose their Medicare benefits so that a brandnew \nentitlement could be created which had nothing to do with seniors and \nbe partially paid for with these reductions in Medicare payments.\n  In fact, if you are on Medicare Advantage, under the Finance \nCommittee bill, you can forget it. That program is gone. There are a \nlot of seniors in this country who have Medicare Advantage. They like \nit. They think it is a good way to get health care. But the majority of \nthe Medicare cuts come out of Medicare Advantage. Basically, they are \nwiping out that insurance benefit. Talk about losing your insurance. \nThe President says nobody is going to lose their insurance today who \nhas it; nobody is going to lose it.\n  Right on the face of it, when Medicare Advantage gets wiped out, \nevery senior who has that is going to lose it. They are going to be \nmoved over to the standard Medicare. And for what? To pay for a new \nprogram, a new entitlement program that has nothing to do with seniors \nand has nothing to do with making the Medicare system more solvent.\n  If we are going to reduce Medicare payments, and there are \nadjustments we need to make in the Medicare system, it should go toward \nmaking that system solvent. Why is that? Because the system is \ninsolvent.\n  It is inconceivable that the White House would suggest that we should \nadd $14.5 billion of new spending to the Social Security Program, which \nis also going to be insolvent in a few years, because seniors were \nupset and they were realizing what was going to happen to them under \nMedicare. They wanted to sort of give them some walking-around money, \nthe old Chicago way--walking-around money. If we give people money, \nmaybe they will not be upset by things.\n\n[[Page S10882]]\n\n  I think most seniors understand that, sure, they would love $250, but \nhow does that work? When we total that all up, that is $14.5 billion of \ndebt which is going to be given to their children and their \ngrandchildren to pay when those grandchildren and children already are \ngetting a massive debt, almost $50 trillion of unfunded liability just \nin Social Security and Medicare alone.\n  We have to ask ourselves: Should we put another $14.5 billion on \ntheir backs simply to make a political statement? Of course not. But \nthat was proposed.\n  Then a week ago, it was proposed that we should do a $250 billion fix \nto reimburse doctors fairly. Doctors are not reimbursed fairly under \nMedicare. They are not. That is an interesting fact because if we look \nat all these proposals that are being talked about from the other side \nof the aisle, they are saying: Oh, everybody in America will have \nMedicare. That is a great idea. The fact is, Medicare does not \nreimburse doctors for what the real costs are. So a lot of doctors \ndon't want to do Medicare.\n  The reflection of that fact is, they proposed the $250 billion doctor \nfix. They didn't want to pay for it. That is a $\\1/4\\ trillion. That is \na lot of money. All that debt goes on our children's backs. Our \nchildren have to pay for that spending. That was the proposal that came \nfrom the other side of the aisle.\n  Fortunately, some folks on the other side of the aisle--I \ncongratulate them, 12 Members on the other side of the aisle in the \nDemocratic Party and one Independent--said: Wait a minute. We are going \nto join the Republicans on this one. You can't do this. This is not \nright. You cannot spend $250 billion on fixing the doctors fix, which \nshould be fixed, and then take that bill and give it to our kids and \ngrandkids. You have to be more responsible.\n  Over the years, every year we have fixed the doctors fix. We have \nfixed it now for 10 years, and we have paid for it. But this was not \ngoing to be paid for.\n  These ideas for spending money and not paying for them have become \nfairly common around here. But the biggest item is clearly going to be \nthis health care bill which is a brandnew entitlement representing $1 \ntrillion to $2 trillion of new spending.\n  What is that money going to be used for? It is going to be used \nbasically to create a new government-inspired insurance program to \ncompete with the private sector in the area of supplying health care. \nThat would be OK except for the fact that as the Speaker of the House \nhas said, that government plan is going to be used to save money. There \nis only one way that a government insurance plan can save money; it has \nto underprice the private sector. How does it do that? It uses the \nauthority of the government to set price controls. It uses the \nauthority of the government to control procedures that people are able \nto get. It uses the authority of the government to limit innovation \nbecause innovation is costly.\n  Inevitably because of that--price controls, controlling access to \ndoctors and hospitals and procedures people can get, and controlling \ninnovation--it inevitably deteriorates the quality of health care \ngenerally for the public.\n  Equally important, of course, under the scheme that has been \ndeveloped that we have seen so far--although we have not seen the \nspecifics because they are being developed behind closed doors on the \nSenate side. We have seen the House bill, but we haven't had a chance \nto read the 2,000-page bill. But the scheme that came out of the \nFinance Committee, equally important, the practical effect would have \nbeen that employers would have been encouraged to basically drop \nemployees from their private insurance plan and cause those employees \nto migrate over to the public plan--intentionally, of course--through a \nwhole series of activities which would make it much more practical for \nan employer simply not to insure people but to pay a penalty instead \nand put employees on a public plan.\n  There will be a natural contraction in the private insurance \ncommunity because there would be a price-controlled government plan and \na natural movement of people over to the government plan because the \npenalty for employers not insuring people is significantly less--at \nleast in the HELP Committee bill--than the cost of insurance and, \ntherefore, employers will look at it and say: It is cheaper to pay the \npenalty than insure the folks. So I will just pay the penalty and \npeople can go over and get a public plan. They lose their insurance.\n  Mr. President, 180 million, 190 million people in this country have \nprivate insurance. They are pretty happy with their doctor and their \nhealth care. They may not be happy with the insurance company--most of \nus are not--but they are pretty happy with their doctors and their \nhealth care. If they are forced on to a public plan, that is going to \nput this bureaucrat between you and your doctor. It will mean if you \nhave a government plan, you may have to call Washington to see your \ndoctor.\n  It also means, as I said earlier, in order for the public plan to \nwork and be cost effective in the sense of saving money, as the Speaker \nof the House says that is how she has to save money, it has to have \nprice controls, it has to have control over access, it has to have \ncontrol over innovation, all of which inevitably leads to delay and a \nlesser quality health care system.\n  The goal on the other side of the aisle--we all understand this \nbecause they have been public about this; there is no subtlety about \nit--is to move to a single-payer system where there is one insurer in \nthe country, and that is the government.\n  The same group that is bringing us the swine flu vaccination program \nis going to bring us all our health care. Think about that. We don't \nhave to go too far for an example of how the government has a hard time \nmanaging fairly large issues of health care when it comes to the \npractical application of taking care of people who need assistance. All \nwe have to do is look at what is happening in the swine flu program to \nrecognize that the government may not necessarily, in all instances, do \nsuch a great job of delivering health care.\n  For example, today you cannot get your swine flu vaccination in most \nplaces in this country because it is not available. Yet that is the \nsystem which a large percentage of members of the other party seem to \ndesire, a single-payer system where government supplies it much along \nthe lines of what we see in places such as Canada and England.\n  I don't think it is healthy for you. I don't think it is healthy for \npatients. It is certainly not healthy for our children because it means \nthey are not only going to get a lesser health care system, they are \ngoing to get this huge bill, this massive bill which is going to come \nout of this $1 trillion to $2 trillion increase in the cost of \ngovernment.\n  It is hard to understand--it has to be intuitive to people, and I \nknow it is to most Americans--that if we increase the size of \ngovernment by $1 trillion to $2 trillion, we inevitably end up passing \non massive debt.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used his 15 minutes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask for an additional 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. As I said, it has to be intuitive, and I know it is \nintuitive for most Americans, that if we increase spending of the \ngovernment by $1 trillion to $2 trillion--and our estimate is this \nprogram costs $2.2 trillion in fact--and we cut Medicare to try to pay \nfor that, or we try to raise taxes to pay for that, we are like a dog \nchasing a tail. It never will happen. The two ends just don't meet. \nThey just don't meet. And what happens to the part that doesn't meet? \nThat is called debt, and it goes to our children.

The Senator from Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10882-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10882-S10884]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BIOFUELS AND THE EPA\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, last week, President Obama delivered a \nspeech at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on the environment \nand on clean energy. He made an appeal for congressional support for \nbiofuels, wind, and solar energy, clean coal technology. Naturally, as \nfather of the wind energy tax credit of about 18 years ago, I share \nPresident Obama's support for homegrown renewable energy. When the \nPresident was in the\n\n[[Page S10883]]\n\nSenate, he and I worked together to promote the production and \ndistribution of biodiesel and ethanol. It is because of our common \ninterest and shared support that I make an appeal today to President \nObama.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency is currently reviewing a number \nof proposals that are incredibly important to our Nation's ability to \nreach its potential in terms of renewable fuel production. On September \n3, I was fortunate to host EPA Assistant Administrator Gina McCarthy \nand Margo Oge, Director of the EPA's Office of Transportation and Air \nQuality, on a family farm in my State of Iowa. I was happy they \naccepted my invitation. It was a very good visit.\n  With the tremendous impact EPA decisions have on the family farmer, \nit seemed worthwhile for Administrator McCarthy and Director Oge to see \nAmerican agriculture directly through the eyes of a family farmer. I \nalso had the opportunity to share my concerns on many pending issues, \nand I believe these EPA officials were a welcome audience.\n  The first issue I am speaking about relates to the EPA's proposal to \npenalize biofuels for greenhouse gas emissions from supposed changes in \ninternational--I emphasize international--land use. I know President \nObama is aware of my concerns because I relayed them to him personally \nover lunch at the White House on May 6 of this year. Their new \nrenewable fuels standard, enacted in the year 2007, requires various \nbiofuels to meet specified life cycle greenhouse gas emission reduction \ntargets.\n  The law specified that the life cycle greenhouse gas emissions are to \ninclude direct emissions and significant indirect emissions from \nindirect land-use changes. However, the proposed rule relies on \nincomplete science and inaccurate assumptions to penalize U.S. biofuels \nfor so-called indirect land-use changes. Under the EPA's analysis, \nethanol produced from corn reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 16 \npercent compared to gasoline. However, if you remove the murky science \nof emissions from indirect land-use changes, corn ethanol reduces \ngreenhouse gas emissions by 61 percent compared to gasoline--\nremembering that the other figure was just 16 percent compared to \ngasoline. So you can see what we know from science--sound science--is \nethanol is very environmentally positive.\n  The EPA's models conclude that changes in international land use--\nagain, emphasis upon international land use--contribute more in \ngreenhouse gas emissions than the entire direct emissions of ethanol \nproduction and use. The fact is, measuring indirect emissions of \ngreenhouse gases is far from a perfect science. There is a great deal \nof complexity and uncertainty surrounding this issue. That is why \nSenator Harkin and I, along with 10 other Senators, asked EPA earlier \nthis year not to include calculations of indirect land-use changes. But \nthe EPA ignored the request of Senator Harkin and myself.\n  In its proposed rule, the EPA grossly underestimates future crop \nyields that will help meet the demand without requiring new crop acres. \nIn addition, the EPA fails to adequately measure the land-use credits \nfor the feed value of corn ethanol coproducts. Similar miscalculations \nexist for biodiesel as I have explained for ethanol. The EPA \nmiscalculated the value of coproducts associated with biodiesel \nproduction and even included a nitrogen penalty.\n  I wish to speak to the nitrogen penalty because it is a case of total \nignorance on the part of the EPA. Farmers know that growing soybeans \ndoes not require nitrogen use. Soybeans, in fact, capture nitrogen and \nreturn that very valuable product to the soil naturally.\n  During consideration of the Interior appropriations bill last month, \nSenator Harkin filed an amendment to block EPA from including the \ninternational component of the land-use change calculation. In \nresponse, EPA Administrator Jackson sent a letter to Congress claiming \nthe amendment would prevent them from carrying out their statutory \nobligations.\n  There are two points that need to be made with regard to \nAdministrator Jackson's letter to us in the Congress. First, the \nstatute does not require the inclusion of international land-use \nchanges. Nowhere does the word ``international'' appear in the statute. \nSecond, in measuring greenhouse gas emissions, the statute states \nclearly:\n\n       Direct emissions and significant indirect emissions such as \n     significant emissions from land use changes.\n\n  If the EPA can't determine the impact of land-use changes with any \ndegree of certainty, how can it be sure the impact is significant? \nIsn't there the same probability it is entirely insignificant?\n  Importantly, the House of Representatives demonstrated its lack of \nconfidence in the EPA's handling of this issue during consideration of \nthe climate bill in June. In that bill, Agriculture Chairman Peterson, \nSpeaker Pelosi, and Energy and Commerce Chairman Waxman agreed to an \namendment that recognized there is no scientific agreement or no \nconsensus that links U.S. biofuels production to international land-use \nchanges. The amendment blocked EPA's consideration of international \nland-use changes for 5 years, until it can be measured using what we \nought to expect them to use--sound science. There is strong \nbipartisanship on the record in opposition to EPA's finding in this \narea. So I hope EPA gets the message.\n  The second issue pertains to the volume mandates required for \nbiodiesel under the expanded Renewable Fuels Standard. The RFS-2 \nrequires the use of 500 million gallons of biodiesel in 2009 and 650 \nmillion gallons in 2010. However, EPA's rulemaking to implement these \nvolume requirements has not yet been finalized and may not be until \nwell into next year.\n  The U.S. biodiesel producers are in a tough financial situation. They \nneed this mandate--which Congress did enact--to ensure a domestic \nmarketplace for their renewable fuels. While the EPA took action to \nincrease the overall volume mandate to comply with the law, it has \nfailed to implement the specific biodiesel mandate.\n  In early August, Senator Conrad and I were joined by 22 other \nSenators in writing President Obama to ask for his help.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of the letter to President Obama.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 6, 2009.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     President of the United States, The White House, Pennsylvania \n         Avenue, NW., Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: We are writing to ask your assistance \n     to ensure that America maintains a viable domestic biodiesel \n     industry that is capable of producing renewable diesel \n     replacement fuel.\n       The Energy Independence and Security Act (EISA) of 2007 \n     provides for renewable content in U.S. diesel fuel as part of \n     the program's Advanced Biofuels schedule. Specifically, the \n     Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS-2) requires the use of 500 \n     million gallons of biomass-based diesel in 2009; 650 million \n     gallons in 2010; 800 million gallons in 2011; and 1 billion \n     gallons in 2012 and thereafter. This policy, if implemented \n     in a timely and workable fashion, will promote the \n     significant economic, environmental and energy security \n     benefits associated with the domestic production and use of \n     biodiesel.\n       The RFS-2 program was to begin on January 1, 2009, and the \n     Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was required to revise \n     the current regulations to ensure the mandated volumes are \n     met, including the volumes for biomass-based diesel. \n     Recently, the EPA announced a two-month extension to the \n     comment period for the new regulations. This extension will \n     likely delay the implementation of RFS-2 well into 2010, \n     causing further uncertainty and creating additional harm to \n     biodiesel plants that have, as Congress intended, made \n     substantial investments based on the volume goals provided \n     for in the statute. The U.S. biodiesel industry desperately \n     needs the market provided by the RFS-2 and cannot afford a \n     significant delay in the implementation of the volume \n     requirements mandated by EISA.\n       Domestic biodiesel producers face a practically non-\n     existent domestic marketplace. Currently, 70% of U.S. \n     biodiesel production capacity is idle. Domestic production is \n     expected to be less than 50% of last year's levels and \n     numerous bankruptcies loom for the industry. If this \n     situation is not addressed immediately, the domestic \n     biodiesel industry expects to lose 29,000 jobs in 2009 alone, \n     and the nation's ability to meet the common-sense volume \n     targets for biomass-based diesel provided for in RFS-2 will \n     be compromised. A viable biodiesel industry is key to \n     reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil and meeting our \n     nation's renewable energy goals.\n       Given the significant delays associated with RFS-2 \n     implementation, the precarious state of the U.S. biodiesel \n     industry, and the\n\n[[Page S10884]]\n\n     volume goals established by statute for biomass-based diesel, \n     we believe this matter must be addressed immediately. While \n     EPA appropriately increased the overall volume mandate to \n     comply with EISA, it has, to date, failed to implement the \n     specific biomass-based diesel mandate. Therefore, we request \n     that the Administration exercise its authority immediately, \n     either by Executive Order or through Agency action or \n     guidance, to provide greater certainty for the 2009 and 2010 \n     RFS-2 volume mandates for biomass-based diesel. Prompt \n     attention is critical to the survival of the biodiesel \n     industry, will provide greater certainty in the marketplace, \n     and is needed to further the energy security, environmental \n     and economic interests of the country.\n       Thank you in advance for your consideration on this \n     important matter.\n           Sincerely,\n         Kent Conrad; Chuck Grassley; Tom Harkin; Byron L. Dorgan; \n           Jon Tester; Amy Klobuchar; Sam Brownback; Max Baucus; \n           Pat Roberts; Christopher S. Bond; Roland W. Burris; \n           Blanche L. Lincoln; Tom Udall; John Thune; Richard \n           Durbin; Debbie Stabenow; Maria Cantwell; Ben Nelson; \n           Patty Murray; Mike Johanns; George V. Voinovich; Tim \n           Johnson; Richard G. Lugar; Al Franken.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the domestic biofuels producers are in a \nprecarious state, so we asked President Obama to take immediate action \nto implement the volume mandates for biodiesel. It is in our Nation's \neconomic and environmental interest to maintain a robust biodiesel \nindustry. Unfortunately, no action has been taken to immediately \nimplement the volume mandates.\n  Finally, the EPA continues to delay in approving higher blends of \nethanol in our transportation fuels. Earlier this year, a number of \nethanol producers submitted a request to EPA to allow higher blends of \nethanol. Currently, ethanol blends are limited to 10 percent in \nnonflex-fuel vehicles. The waiver request is simply requesting that EPA \nallow ethanol to be blended at 15 percent levels instead of 10 percent.\n  While the waiver request was submitted back in March, the EPA has not \nmade a decision. The EPA's delay in considering this request is having \na negative impact on U.S. ethanol producers and is harming consumers \nwho would otherwise benefit from lower prices at the pump. The delay is \nalso putting off our efforts to use more homegrown renewable fuels in \nplace of imports.\n  The delay is also putting off our efforts to use more homegrown \nrenewable fuels in place of imported fossil fuels.\n  I recognize that prior to approval of higher ethanol blends, the \nrequisite studies and testing must be concluded.\n  A number of scientific studies conducted in recent years confirm that \nhigher ethanol blends do not cause significant changes in tailpipe \nemissions, vehicle drivability, materials compatibility or durability.\n  It is time to end the delays and take action to further reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n  I am speaking today to ask President Obama and his staff at the White \nHouse to pay close attention to these three issues.\n  Our Nation currently has a strong, renewable fuels infrastructure \nthat is working every day to reduce our dependence on foreign oil.\n  Those involved are also working diligently to increase efficiencies \nand strive toward the second generation of advanced biofuels. But, we \ncan't get there by undermining today's industry.\n  The President can take action within his administration to ensure \nthat no harm is done to the renewable fuels that are displacing dirty \nfossil fuels today.\n  He can ensure that EPA uses only sound science and avoids speculative \nassumptions when determining the greenhouse gas emissions of biofuels.\n  He can take action to see that America uses even more homegrown, \ngreen energy by ensuring that even more renewable fuel is blended in \nour Nation's transportation mix.\n  And, he can take action to immediately provide the certainty for \nbiodiesel producers that Congress intended in the energy bill of 2007.\n  That is what I am asking him to do.\n  By zeroing in on these three pivotal issues facing the renewable \nenergy effort today, President Obama and his staff can make a major \npositive difference for the production of even more clean, renewable, \ndomestic biofuels.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, may I inquire, is the procedure that we \nare going back and forth? If it is, I will defer to the junior Senator \nfrom Illinois.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is not part of the order.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10884-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10884-S10885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I anticipate speaking about 10 minutes, \nand I rise to speak on the health care bill that is making its way to \nthe Senate floor. Today, I wish to talk about just two topics relative \nto that health care bill, and those two topics are transparency and, of \ncourse, the all-important topic of taxes.\n  We all have been through elections. We know elections lead to \npromises. We say things out on the campaign trail. We make promises to \nthe American people and to the people of our State. Well, last \nelection, by any measure, was a historic election. Over and over again, \nthe American people were promised change. They were promised middle-\nclass protections. Very specifically, our President promised increased \ntransparency. There would be no tax increases on the middle class. We \ncan all quote that language--not one dime. But I have to tell you, \neverything I see about the health care debate at this point leads me to \nthe conclusion that campaign promises are about to be broken.\n  Without a doubt--without a doubt--the American people clearly support \nmore transparency in Washington. Yet health care has the same old \npolitics. There isn't any transparency at the moment. I remember that \nfamous tape of the President where he said: You know, we are going to \ndo this in front of C-SPAN. We are going to see who is with the big \ninsurance companies and who is with the people. Well, what is happening \nnow? We are in the process of bills being merged--hugely different, \nmonstrous bills--and we don't even know exactly what is going to be in \nthose bills, and it is all happening behind closed doors. I just \nfundamentally ask the question: If this is good for America, then why \nbe secret about it? It is altering one-sixth of our economy. It simply \nshould not be happening behind closed doors. There is too much at \nstake.\n  Everyone should support the 72-hour transparency bill. It simply \nrequires that legislation and a CBO score be available at least 72 \nhours before consideration. That is a commonsense idea and I think kind \nof a minimal idea, actually. A 1,900-page bill came out of the House--\n1,900 pages. Yet they are talking about a vote on that next week. I \nthink most people would say: What is the rush? But we should at least \nget 72 hours, with a score, so we could talk to the American people \nabout what is in the bill and what is not.\n  This leads me to the next piece of what I wished to talk about today, \nand that is taxes. A signature promise of the President's campaign was \nno taxes on families making under $250,000. Wow. What an important \npromise to the middle class. Let's look at the taxes in the Finance \nCommittee's bill. There are over $500 billion of new taxes and fees. \nThat is a very big number. Who is going to be hit with that? We have \nhad studies done on it. The Joint Committee on Taxation analysis says \nthis. It concluded that for 2019, roughly 77 percent of these taxes \nwill be borne by middle-class tax payers; three quarters of the tax \nburden falls on those the President promised would not be impacted with \nhigher taxes. What are the taxes? For anyone with a higher priced \ninsurance plan, a 40-percent excise tax will be passed through to the \nworker. Higher health care costs, lower wages, I think. Any taxpayer \nwho refuses to buy government-approved insurance will be penalized. \nThese numbers could change, but right now it looks like $750 for \nsingles and $1,500 for couples.\n\n  The CBO says this: Almost half of those paying this penalty tax would \nbe between 100 percent and 300 percent of the Federal poverty level--or \na family of 4, earning $22,800 and $68,400 in 2013. Clearly they are in \nthe middle class. Clearly they are under $250,000. Call it what you \nwill, to the people paying this, to them it will be a tax.\n  If you do buy insurance, prepare to be taxed by the new insurance \nindustry fees. If you use a medical device, you will get hit with a new \nmedical device\n\n[[Page S10885]]\n\nfee. If you contribute more than $2,500 to a Flexible Spending Account, \nyour taxes go up. Many taxpayers who purchase over-the-counter medicine \nwill now see them taxed. Taxes and transparency--two issues.\n  I will continue, in the weeks ahead, as will my colleagues, to \ndiscuss the dangers of health care reform done wrong. Health care \nreform is needed, no doubt about it, but not rushed legislation with no \ntransparency and so many new taxes on the middle class.\n  I will wrap up with this. I think overhauling 16 percent of the \neconomy is too important to do fast and to not do right, so I \nrespectfully suggest that we take the time to do it right and honor the \npledges made.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, over the last few months I have addressed \nthis Chamber many times on the need for a strong public option as part \nof our health reform legislation. The need, I believe, is quite clear, \nbut the controversy remains. There are some who continue to attack the \npublic option as a ``government takeover,'' or an unnecessary intrusion \ninto the free market. We must not be deceived by these baseless \nattacks. They are the instrument of a political opposition that cannot \nwin this argument on the merits.\n  The American people know this better than anyone. They recognize that \nour health care system is broken and that they must not settle for \nanything less than comprehensive reform that only a public option can \nprovide. They know that the insurance companies maintain a virtual \nmonopoly over regional markets and that large corporations are \nsqueezing families and businesses for extraordinary profits. Those who \noppose reform see no problem with this lack of competition and \naccountability and that is why their arguments fall short. That is why \ntheir talking points seem tired and disingenuous, because they are out \nof touch with what is going on in America today.\n  Let's reject the constraints of partisanship. Let's shut out the \nlobbyists and special interest groups that stand to profit from the \npoor health of hard-working Americans. Let's talk about why we \ndesperately need a strong public option in this country right now.\n  The key problem with health coverage today is that American consumers \ndo not have any options. The principles of competition and choice have \nalways been at the heart of our economic system. They have driven \ninnovation and they have served as the foundation of so many great \nideas and achievements throughout our history. In many ways, these \nprinciples are uniquely American. Yet the health industry is somewhat \nexempt from their influence. Private insurance companies are free to \nfix prices, monopolize local markets and deny coverage to almost anyone \nfor almost any reason. We have seen unprecedented consolidations in the \ninsurance market and that has led to a lack of competition and choice \nfor American consumers.\n  In the past 13 years, there have been more than 400 corporate mergers \ninvolving health insurers. As a result, 94 percent of our Nation's \nmarkets are now considered ``highly concentrated,'' meaning that they \nare post-antitrust concerns. In my home State of Illinois, just two \ncompanies control 69 percent of the market and, sadly, Illinois is far \nfrom alone. In Alabama, a single company controls more than almost 90 \npercent of the market and in Iowa, Rhode Island, Arkansas, Hawaii, \nAlaska, Vermont, Wyoming, Maine, and Montana, the two largest health \ninsurance companies control at least 80 percent of the market. In fact, \nthere are only three States in the entire country where the largest \nthree companies control less than a half of the insurance market.\n  This is a staggering statistic. In that kind of highly concentrated \nenvironment, there is no incentive to compete. There is no reason to \nimprove service, expand access, or work with patients and doctors to \nachieve better health outcomes. In fact, there is every incentive to do \njust the opposite. These companies continue to look for new, innovative \nways to deny coverage to sick Americans. They increase premiums, they \ncap lifetime benefits, they increase corporate earnings at the expense \nof families and businesses that are already stretched to the breaking \npoint. While the rest of us suffer the effects of recession, they post \nrecord profits. That is why health care premiums are growing four times \nfaster than wages. That is why profits are up and, relatively, health \noutcomes are down.\n  In the last quarter, one major insurance company reported profits \nthat had more than doubled when compared to the same quarter last year. \nIn fact, between 2000 and 2007, 10 of the country's top insurance \ncompanies increased their profits by an average of 428 percent.\n  Today, $1 out of every $6 spent in this country goes to pay for \nhealth care. This is wrong. This flies in the face of every value our \nNation holds so dear.\n  It is time to stand up for the American people and restore the \nAmerican values of competition and choice to the system. It is time to \nhold insurance companies accountable. It is time to create a strong \npublic option that will make insurers compete for your business, like \nany other corporation in America.\n  There is nothing wrong with making a fair profit. I understand that. \nI have been in business myself. They have to make a profit. But there \nis nothing fair about creating a monopoly and then wringing money from \nthe sick Americans who are counting on you in their hour of need.\n  That is why we need a strong public option. We cannot have real \nreform without competition and we cannot have competition without a \npublic option. A strong public option would be a self-sustaining, would \nprovide a low-cost alternative to private companies, and would force \nthem to improve their product or risk losing customers. The public \noption would give people a choice for the first time in many years. No \none would be forced to change their coverage, but if their current \nprovider isn't treating them right, they deserve the opportunity to \nchoose something better and more affordable.\n  The American people deserve the chance to shop around, to compare \noptions and pick the plan that is right for themselves and their \nfamilies or small businesses. That is what the public option would mean \nfor Americans. That is why I will not settle for anything less. I will \nnot compromise. I will not stop fighting. The good hard-working people \nin Illinois and across America demand the real reform that a strong \npublic option would provide.\n  Now is not the time to back down. Now is the time to act with \nconviction. I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up for choice \nand competition in the health insurance industry. Let us rise to this \nchallenge and include a strong public option in the reform bill we send \nto the President.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this is the week of two more 1,000-page \nbills. The House has produced a nearly 2,000-page health care bill \nwhich we are all looking forward to reading. The Senator from New \nMexico and I are members of the Environment and Public Works Committee, \nand this week we have been spending almost all day each day on a nearly \n1,000-page bill on climate change.\n  As I said on Tuesday when the bill was presented, I have no problem \nacknowledging the problem, but I do have a problem with the proposed \nsolution. The National Academies of Science of 11 major industrialized \ncountries, including the United States, have said that climate change \nis real and that humans are causing most of the recent warming. If fire \nchiefs with the same reputation said my house was likely to burn down, \nI would buy some fire insurance. I would buy fire insurance that \nworked. But I wouldn't buy insurance so expensive that I couldn't pay \nmy mortgage or I couldn't pay my hospital bill. That is my concern \nabout the\n\n[[Page S10886]]\n\nsolution that is a part of the Kerry-Boxer bill which we have been \nworking on this week.\n  The Kerry-Boxer bill is a high-cost clean energy plan that will make \nit hard for Americans to support their families.\n  When the Boxer-Kerry cap-and-trade Bill is put together with the \nEnergy Committee's Renewable Electricity Standard, it will be even \nbigger. It will be a combination of an economy-wide cap and trade and \nnarrowly defined energy mandate. It will be a 1,000-page-plus bill of \ntaxes, mandates, and surprises. But some things will not be a surprise.\n  We have heard this week a good deal of detail about the costs. At a \ntime of 10 percent unemployment in America--and that is likely to \ncontinue for a while--it will impose a new national energy tax that \nwill raise utility bills and send manufacturing jobs overseas looking \nfor cheap energy. It will collect hundreds of billions of dollars each \nyear from American taxpayers for use in a Washington slush fund for \npoliticians to play with. Already we have corporations all over the \ncountry with their hands out looking for their share.\n  The economy-wide cap-and-trade, as has been said before our committee \nby very distinguished scientists, will be ineffective against fuel. \nFuel is 30 percent of our carbon emitted today, which is a contributor \nto global warming. So the idea is that we put cap and trade on carbon, \nand it raises the price of fuel. But the testimony before our committee \nhas been that it doesn't do much to reduce carbon emissions because \neven the large price increase in gasoline, for example, which will be \npassed on to those of us who drive cars, trucks, and fly in airplanes, \nwould not be enough. It will be enough to cause a lot of pain, but it \nwould not change much human behavior and reduce the amount of fuel \nconsumed. The net result is higher prices but the same emissions.\n  The EPA has done a quick look at this nearly 1,000-page bill. Its \nconclusion is that its costs and benefits are much like the Waxman-\nMarkey bill passed by the House of Representatives a few months ago. We \nknow what people have said about that bill. President Obama's Budget \nDirector, Peter Orszag, said in March that by giving the allowances to \nindustry for free--instead of auctioning them--would result in the \n``largest corporate welfare program in history.'' That is President \nObama's Budget Director.\n  The Congressional Budget Office said that the House-passed Waxman-\nMarkey bill would cut up to 3.5 percent of our GDP by 2050. In other \nwords, it will make us poorer than we would otherwise be. The Brookings \nInstitute said the cost is likely to be $300 billion annually by 2030. \nFormer Senator Wirth of Colorado has criticized the bill as a cap-and-\ntax revenue raiser and said instead, it ought to focus primarily on \nutilities. James Hansen at NASA, who feels passionately about climate \nchange and believes it is a problem, as I do, says the bill is less \nthan worthless.\n  So taken altogether, the strategy of this bill to deal with climate \nchange is, taxes, expensive energy, and mandates, plus the President's \ngoal of a national windmill policy--a combination of subsidies and \nincentives and mandates that would have as a goal making 20 percent of \nour electricity from giant wind turbines.\n  Mr. President, I believe our dream for energy ought to be just the \nreverse. We should want large amounts of reliable, clean, low-carbon, \nor carbon-free energy, but it should be cheap energy not deliberate \nhigh-cost energy because that is the way we create jobs and avoid \nhardships for American families. Our dream throughout our existence in \nthis world has been that someday we would have cheap, energy for the \npeople of the world so they could get out of poverty. We are fortunate \nin this country. We are just 5 percent of the people in the world, and \nwe have 25 percent of the wealth, and we use about 25 percent of the \nenergy. We should be leading the way and not have a policy that \ndeliberately raises the price of energy. We ought to deliberately lower \nit.\n  So before we deliberately embark on a program to send manufacturing \njobs overseas, which this unquestionably will--if you work in an auto \nplant or auto supplier plant or cement plant or aluminum plant, if this \nbill passes, your job is more likely to go overseas. Before we \ndeliberately make ourselves poorer, we should try a low-cost strategy, \nand we have one.\n  Republicans--all 40 Republicans--have a 4-point, low-cost clean \nenergy strategy, which I believe many Democrats agree with, and I \nbelieve President Obama agrees with a lot of it. So rather than this \neconomy-wide, high-cost energy strategy, why not the following 4-point \nstrategy:\n  No. 1, create the environment in which we could build 100 new nuclear \npowerplants in the next 20 years. That is the same number we have \ntoday--104. We built those in 20 years, between 1970 and 1990. Those \nplants produce 70 percent of our carbon-free electricity today. Wind \nand all of the renewable energies--except for hydropower produce 4 \npercent. So 100 more nuclear powerplants is No. 1.\n  No. 2, electrify half our cars and trucks in the next 20 years. This \ncan happen. Almost every major automobile manufacturer is making \nhybrid-electric cars today. I drive a plug-in hybrid. I plug it in \nevery night when I go home, and I put gas in my car about every 6 \nweeks. So we can electrify half our cars and trucks in 20 years. We can \ndo it by plugging them in at night, when we have so much spare \nelectricity. We can do it without building one new powerplant. That is \naccording to the testimony of a former Brookings Institute scholar who \nis now in the Obama administration as Assistant Secretary of Energy.\n  No. 3, we can explore offshore for low-carbon natural gas and for our \nown oil. Natural gas has suddenly become in abundant supply, and the \nprice is low. We can use more of it for energy, for electricity. We \nneed to be careful with that. We did that once before and the price \nwent up to $15. But we have a new abundant supply of natural gas. It is \nour own and it is not overseas. We should find it and use it. It is low \ncarbon. While we are at it, we should find our oil. Even if we drive \nhalf our electric cars--which will reduce our oil from overseas by one-\nthird--we will still be using 12 or 13 million barrels of oil a day \njust for transportation, and we will be better off if we use our oil \ninstead of oil from places overseas, from countries who don't like us.\n  The fourth item is to launch four mini Manhattan Projects like the \none we had in World War II. Secretary Chu, the distinguished physicist \nwho is President Obama's Secretary of Energy, calls them ``innovation \nhubs.'' We can launch four Mini Manhattan Projects, or innovation hubs, \nto find ways to recapture carbon from coal plants. We know how to take \nnitrogen, sulfur, and mercury out of coal plants. We need to find a \ncommercially viable way to take the carbon out.\n  A mini Manhattan Project could make solar power costs competitive. \nToday, it costs four or five times as much as other electricity. It is \ntoo expensive to use in a widespread way.\n  Germany, which has invested much of its future in solar power, gets \nless than 1 percent of its electricity from solar power. We are nearly \nat zero in the United States. We need a mini Manhattan Project to make \nelectric batteries better so that our cars can go 400 miles instead of \n100 miles with electricity, a mini Manhattan Project to recycle used \nnuclear fuel in a way that doesn't isolate plutonium.\n  This strategy, as I said, is supported by all 40 Senate Republicans, \nand many Democrats and, I believe, some of that the President embraces: \nnuclear powerplants, electric cars, offshore exploration for natural \ngas and oil, and double energy R for four mini Manhattan Projects for \ncarbon recapture, solar power, electric batteries, and recycling used \nnuclear fuel. This strategy doesn't drive manufacturing jobs overseas. \nIt doesn't put an ineffective cap and trade program on fuel and raise \nthe price of gasoline without reducing much carbon.\n  That is much better than a national windmill policy, which is what \nthe Obama administration and our current subsidies basically have in \nstore for our future. Let me say what I mean by that. To produce an \nadditional 20 percent of our electricity from nuclear power, we would \nneed 100 new nuclear reactors on 100 square miles. Most of them could \nbe built on sites where we now have reactors. We have been doing this \nsuccessfully since the 1950s. We have a nuclear Navy. We produce 19 \npercent of our electricity from the 104\n\n[[Page S10887]]\n\nreactors we have today. But the proposal of the administration is to \nbuild 20 percent of our electricity from wind power. That would require \n186,000 50-story wind turbines whose blades are the size of a football \nfield. It would require 19,000 miles of new transmission lines from \nremote places, through your backyard, over your scenic viewscape, to \nbring that electricity to your house. It would require $170 billion in \ntaxpayer subsidies over the next 10 years, while the subsidy for the \nsame amount of nuclear power would be about $6.8 billion, according to \ncurrent law.\n  It would turn our ridge tops and coastlines and treasured landscapes \ninto junkyards in the sky. According to statistics from the American \nBird Conservancy these turbines could kill more than 1 million birds a \nyear. These turbines would work one-third of the time. That means we \nwould have to build nuclear power natural gas plants, or coal plants, \nto back up these 186,000 turbines that would cover an area the size of \nWest Virginia. That is a project for our country that ranges from \nimpractical, to expensive, to preposterous, especially when we have \navailable the possibility of doing what we did before--adding 100 new \nnuclear reactors, which the rest of the world is doing.\n  What happened to nuclear power? If we were going to war with the \nsuccessful nuclear Navy created 60 years ago and it was doing exactly \nwhat we wanted it to do as the world's leading military, with thousands \nof our sailors living safely on top of those reactors, why would we \nstop building nuclear ships and start using sailboats for our national \ndefense? That is tantamount to what the current administration's energy \npolicy is doing with a national windmill policy.\n  We should build 100 new nuclear powerplants as rapidly and as safely \nas we can. It is the cheapest and most reliable way to reduce carbon \nand deal with climate change, and it is the fastest way to do that--\njust as electrifying half of our cars and trucks would be a fast way to \nreduce foreign oil and reduce emissions in the transportation sector. \nWe invented nuclear power. It is one of our great technologies--maybe \nthe most important technology in the last 100 years, and we haven't \nbuilt a new nuclear powerplant in 30 years--even though the old ones we \nhave are producing 70 percent of our carbon-free electricity.\n  What is the rest of the world doing? China is building 132 new \nnuclear powerplants. The head of a French company that makes large \nturbines for powerplants was in my office the other day. He told me \nChina is starting a new nuclear plant every 2 to 3 months. France is 80 \npercent nuclear and has among the lowest electric rates and carbon \nemission rates in Western Europe.\n  We hear a lot about green jobs. Spain has a lot of green jobs. \nUnfortunately, many of the rest of Spain's jobs are going to France \nbecause the electricity rates are lower in France, and they are high in \nSpain because they favor unreliable and expensive renewable electricity \nover nuclear power. Japan is 35 percent nuclear and growing. Taiwan, \nIndia, and the United Arab Emirates are building them. Russia is \nbuilding two nuclear plants a year so they can use their natural gas as \ncurrency with the rest of Europe. But we invented nuclear technology \nand we haven't started a new nuclear powerplant in 30 years.\n  Why don't we go full speed ahead? We believe this is a more sensible, \npractical, low-cost solution for dealing with climate change. I will \nspeak for myself; we have many different views on climate change in the \nRepublican caucus. We have the whole spectrum. Not everybody agrees \nwith me that it is a real problem and humans are causing it and we \nought to deal with it as rapidly as we reasonably can. But here is the \nway we should do it.\n  If we, by 2030, build 100 new nuclear plants, and if we electrify \nhalf of our cars and trucks, we would be producing about 40 percent of \nour electricity from nuclear. Natural gas would be about 25 percent, \nhydro would be 10, wind and solar maybe 5 to 10. With these two \nefforts--nuclear power and electric cars--we would reach the Kyoto \nprotocol goals for carbon emissions by 2030 without a significant \nincrease in energy prices.\n  If in the meantime our mini-Manhattan projects for research, solar, \ncarbon recapture, recycling nuclear waste, and electric batteries \nworked, we would be even more successful in reducing emissions, all \nwithout a national energy tax.\n  One might say: What is going to make all that happen? I would say two \nwords: Presidential leadership. President Obama is very persuasive. He \ncan set a goal and mobilize the country. That is part of the \nPresident's job: See a need, develop a strategy, and persuade half of \nus he is right. I think he can get a lot of Democrats.\n  He could start removing barriers to nuclear plants, speed up approval \nof designs for them. If China can start them every 2 or 3 months, we \nought to be able to do so as well. He could provide incentives, such as \n$100 billion in loan guarantees--and those would all be paid back not \njust for nuclear but for all clean energy. His budget could fund the \nmini-Manhattan projects. Dr. Chu has recommended we do that.\n  At a town hall meeting recently, President Obama said the United \nStates would be ``stupid''--those were his words--not to use nuclear \npower. I was glad to hear him say that. I was disappointed when he went \nto the United Nations Climate Change Conference in New York and \nlectured the other countries about not doing more about climate change \nand he didn't mention the words ``nuclear power.'' Meanwhile, Chinese \nPresident Hu Jintao said his country would ``vigorously'' develop \nnuclear power to combat climate change and they are building 132 \nnuclear plants. But I was glad to hear what President Obama said in New \nOrleans.\n  As we move through the Senate on the debate on climate change, I ask \ncolleagues on both sides to look carefully at this economy wide cap and \ntrade. We have had some experience with cap and trade on small dollars \nfor coal plants and sulfur. That does not translate very well to what \nis being proposed here. It does not work on fuel, which is 30 percent \nof our carbon. It raises the price without reducing carbon emissions, \nit drives manufacturing jobs away, and it raises utility bills. We \ndon't need to do it.\n  With Presidential leadership, we could build 100 nuclear plants, \nelectrify half our cars and trucks, find new low-carbon natural gas, \nlaunch the mini-Manhattan projects, and meet our clean energy goals \nwithout a national energy tax, without running jobs overseas looking \nfor cheap electricity.\n  All 40 Republican Senators agree with this agenda. So do many \nDemocrats. President Obama agrees with much of it. Then why are we \npushing a high-cost national energy tax and subsidizing 186,000 \nwindmills when we should all agree on a low-cost, clean energy plan \nthat will create good jobs and power our economy for the 21st Century?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10887-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10887-S10889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FOOD SECURITY\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, last week the United Nations Food Agency \nannounced there are now a record 1 billion people in the world who go \nhungry--nearly one-sixth of the world's population. The crisis that \ncaught the world's attention last year has escalated and has had a \ndevastating effect in all corners of the globe.\n  On my left is a headline from the Associated Press from a few days \nago: ``A Record One Billion Are Hungry, U.N. Report Says.'' This chart \ntracks from 1969 forward. We can see where it remained relatively \nstable for a while and then started to pick up in the early part of \nthis decade, to the point now it is above 1 billion and is going in the \nwrong direction, going far too high--1 billion people in the world \nhungry.\n  While the number of undernourished has increased steadily since the \n1990s, there was a sharp spike last year due to the global food crisis. \nWe can work to address this problem, I believe. We should work to \naddress this problem, and I believe we must work to address this \nproblem.\n  Some people might say there is a bad economy in the United States. We \nhave other major challenges and priorities. Why should we worry or \naddress a problem that might seem too big to deal with and it is mostly \nabout other places, they might argue.\n\n[[Page S10888]]\n\n  We know what hunger has done here in America, what a lack of food \nsecurity has done to our country. But we also know it has devastating \nimpacts across the world.\n  There are at least two major reasons why the United States of America \nhas to be deeply concerned about that headline of 1 billion people \ngoing hungry. First, it is a humanitarian crisis of incalculable \nproportions. As one of the richest countries in the world, we have, I \nbelieve, a moral obligation to help as we can and help when we can. I \nthink this is one of those moments.\n  This crisis is solvable with a combination of assistance and emphasis \non providing small farmers around the world with the know-how, the \ntechnology, and the means to provide for themselves.\n  There is also a second reason why we have to address this problem, \nand it involves something as fundamental as national security.\n  Instability arising from conflict over access to food is a documented \nand real problem. It is irrefutable based upon what we have seen in the \nlast couple of years. Last year's food crisis, unfortunately, brought \nthis into acute focus. We saw it in Somalia where struggles to gain \naccess to food have enveloped population centers in violence. We have \nseen it in Egypt during last year's bread riots. And we have seen it in \nHaiti where hospital beds filled last year with those injured during \nfood riots. Increased instability in any of these countries, not to \nmention so many others, has a direct impact on U.S. national security \nand our national interests.\n  There are a host of examples from across the world that illustrate \nthe scope of the problem. Here are a few.\n  Higher rates of hunger are shown to be linked to gender inequality, \nespecially in terms of education and literacy, which also negatively \naffects the rate of child malnutrition. It is estimated that 60 \npercent--imagine this--60 percent of the world's chronically hungry are \nwomen and girls. Sixty percent of those chronically hungry in the world \nare women and girls. And 20 percent of that 60 percent are children \nunder the age of 5.\n  This is particularly evident in Chad which, according to the \nInternational Food Policy Research organization, ranks fifth worst on \nthe 2009 global hunger index, second in terms of gender inequality, and \nhas a female literacy rate of 13 percent, compared to 41 percent for \nmen in that country.\n  IFPR's research shows that equalizing men and women's status could \nreduce the number of malnourished children in Chad by 1.7 million \npeople in sub-Saharan Africa and a shocking 13.4 million in South Asia.\n  It goes beyond the one example in Chad. Hunger in Pakistan poses both \nproblems. It poses both a humanitarian problem as well as a security \nproblem. Last year, over 77 million people in Pakistan were considered \n``food insecure'' by the World Food Program. That is nearly half of the \npopulation of that country. As Pakistan's military is conducting new \noperations against the Taliban, that number is expected to increase. \nHunger and competition for food can lead to further instability and \npotentially undermine government leadership at a very critical time.\n  Finally, the last example. In South America, Bolivia remains one of \nthe least developed countries with more than two-thirds of its \npopulation living below the poverty line. Poverty is the main cause of \nfood insecurity in Bolivia. The income of 40 percent of its population \nand 59 percent in rural areas is not enough to meet basic food needs. \nThis also has had a real impact on the health of the \npopulation. Malnutrition, for example, in Bolivia has stunted the \ngrowth of nearly 30 percent of children.\n\n  What should be done to address this urgent humanitarian and national \nsecurity crisis? A couple of things. First, for too long, the \ninternational community has relied on an assistance model that provided \nfood but not the capacity to grow food. We are starting to see a shift \nin thinking as the assistance community is more strategic about how \nthey provide the training and technical assistance necessary to help \nthe world's hungry.\n  In 1980--another stunning number that I recite here--17 percent of \naid contributed by foreign countries went to agriculture. This number \nplummeted to 3.8 percent in 2006 and has only slightly improved in \nrecent years. Imagine that: The percent of aid contributed by foreign \ncountries that goes to agriculture was 17 percent worldwide but has now \ngone down to a little less than 4 percent.\n  Last year, the Bush administration responded quickly to the food \ncrisis with emergency assistance. I was proud to be part of an effort \nto urge them to do that along with Senator Durbin and others. This was \nan important thing to do at the time and it was the right thing to do. \nWhile we may need to provide additional emergency aid to address the \ncurrent crisis, we should simultaneously attack the root cause of the \nproblems.\n  I applaud President Obama and his administration for their efforts to \nhelp the hungry in America and across the world. In September, the \nWhite House announced the Global Hunger and Food Security Initiative, a \ncomprehensive approach to food security based on a commitment, led by \npeople in the administration, that focuses on both planning and \ncollaboration. Secretary of State Clinton is leading a visionary \n``whole of government'' effort to help the world's hungry. As the \nadministration works out the details of implementation, I hope and \ntrust we will maintain a sharp focus on the ability of small-scale \nfarmers to grow food at an increased and sustainable rate.\n  In the Senate, we have also worked to bring attention to the world's \nhungry. Senator Lugar, a respected leader in this field for decades, \nand I joined together to introduce the Global Food Security Act earlier \nthis year.\n  Our bill has three fundamental objectives. First, the bill will \nprovide for enhanced coordination within the U.S. Government so that \nUSAID, the Department of Agriculture, and other involved entities are \nnot working at cross-purposes. We do that by establishing a new \nposition, the Special Coordinator for Food Security, who will report \ndirectly to the President of the United States on international food \nsecurity issues and who would forge a comprehensive food security \nstrategy.\n  Second, our bill would expand U.S. investment in the agricultural \nproductivity of developing nations so that nations facing escalating \nfood prices can rely less on emergency food assistance and instead take \nthe steps to expand their own production.\n  Every dollar invested in agricultural research and development \ngenerates $9 worth of food in the developing world. This provision can \nserve as a vehicle for the President's pledge to more than double the \nU.S. agricultural development assistance over the next 3 years.\n  Third, our bill would modernize our system of emergency food \nassistance so that it is more flexible and can provide aid on short \nnotice. We do that by authorizing a new $500 million fund for U.S. \nemergency food assistance when appropriate.\n  Finally, we should note that our bill, the Global Food Security Act, \nhas passed through our Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and we hope \nit will be on the Senate floor soon.\n  This is one of those rare occasions where a serious crisis is greeted \nwith serious administration support, interagency cooperation, as well \nas--we don't hear this too often--bipartisan collaboration in the \nSenate and House. This is the right thing to do and will ultimately \nenhance the security of the United States and our allies.\n  The global food crisis last summer had a devastating effect on the \npoor in every corner of the world, and today we continue to see its \nterrible results. In times of economic troubles, it is difficult to \nfind funds for all programs, including international affairs. Yet I \nbelieve we are summoned by our conscience to respond to this \nhumanitarian crisis.\n  I also believe we have an obligation--a deep abiding obligation--to \nstrengthen our national security by enhancing food security here at \nhome and around the world, especially in places where food insecurity \nthreatens U.S. national interests.\n  If enacted, the Global Food Security Act has the potential to help us \nmeet these challenges and obligations. We have a plan that can work. \nLet's start to attack the roots of this terrible problem so another \nrecord number of hungry is not set next year, and let's hope we can \nsomehow alter or change that headline of 1 billion people going hungry \nin the world.\n\n[[Page S10889]]\n\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, earlier today, apparently, our distinguished \nmajority leader came to the floor and noted that a nomination for GSA--\nmade on the opening day of Major League Baseball season--still remains \nunconfirmed for the job and said it was ``because a Republican Senator \nis demanding a Federal building is built in his home State.''\n  Obviously, I am that Senator. I thank the good Senator from Nevada \nfor raising that question because I and a bipartisan group of Members \nof Congress and the leaders of the Kansas City area have been working \nwith the GSA for the past several weeks to resolve the concerns I have \nand get some questions answered on a project very important to the \nKansas City community.\n  Our conversations have amazingly become very productive, and the GSA \nhas assured me they will have information to share very shortly. \nUnfortunately, until I put this hold on the nominee, progress was not \nquite so quick. But I expect the issue to be resolved shortly, in what \nI hope is a matter of a couple days, to the benefit of the GSA and \ncertainly to the benefit of the Kansas City greater community.\n  Let me point out one other thing before leaving the floor. The \ncommunity of Kansas City--all of the leadership, the elected officials \nand others--had gone together to work with the GSA to get a building--a \nnew building--to replace an existing building, which by any stretch of \nthe imagination is extremely expensive, is partly occupied, and is not \nconducive to good work, as a good workplace, and it needs to be \nreplaced. We had gone all the way through, gotten GSA approval and \ngotten to OMB. Then it was held up in the Senate. After all the \nfinancing had been committed to construct a building on a lease-to-own \nbasis, they decided to pull the plug.\n  The Commissioner of Public Buildings has assured me that the existing \nfacility is not a fit place for the workers to work. So I had asked and \ninquired of GSA and advised them that Kansas City needs to know what \nthe plans are. As I say, our bipartisan congressional delegation is now \nreceiving great cooperation, and we are working hard to get this \nresolved. We hope to do that shortly.\n  I also want to point to the fact that, according to a report in \ngovern\nmentexecutive.com, delay on this nomination reaches back long before my \ninformational hold, which occurred in late July. Since Senator Reid \nsuggested the nomination has been pending since April, it raises the \nquestion: Why wasn't she approved in April, May, June or July, prior to \nmy informational hold? That was a period during which the baseball \nseason started and stretched long past the All-Star break.\n  According to governmentexecutive\n.com, the delay was because of concerns by Senator Reid that GSA allow \nFederal employees to travel to Las Vegas to meet, gamble or whatever \none does in Vegas. It is important to the Federal employees in Kansas \nCity that they have a building that has a roof that doesn't leak--a \nproposition of which GSA concurs. Senator Reid apparently wants Federal \nemployees to be able to visit Las Vegas, and certainly I want Federal \nemployees to have a good place to work. Senator Reid has his priorities \nregarding the delay on this nomination and I have mine. He wants more \npeople in Las Vegas; I want to get the building that had been promised \nand was expected by the Federal employees in Kansas City.\n  Assuming the report in govern\nmentexecutive.com is accurate, I wish to make sure it is clear to the \nSenate that the delay in approval of this nomination has more than one \nfather and is truly bipartisan.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of the article to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From Congress Daily, Sept. 14, 2009]\n\n           Senate Majority Leader Slows Action on GSA Nominee\n\n                           (By Dan Friedman)\n\n       Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has missed few \n     chances to complain about blocked executive nominations, \n     regularly ripping Republicans for holds that he said are \n     designed to limit floor time for Democratic legislation.\n       On Thursday, for example, Reid faulted Republican \n     ``stalling tactics'' for forcing a cloture vote before the \n     confirmation of Cass Sunstein to head OMB's Office of \n     Information and Regulatory Affairs. In a June floor speech, \n     he blasted Republicans for placing holds on more than 20 \n     nominations.\n       But multiple Democratic and Republican staffers say Reid \n     himself slowed action on one of the highest-ranking nominees \n     awaiting confirmation, Martha Johnson. She is President \n     Obama's pick to head the General Services Administration.\n       Johnson, a former GSA chief of staff, cannot start her job \n     until she is confirmed, a GSA spokeswoman said.\n       Reid is keen to promote travel to Nevada, where he faces a \n     tough re-election fight next year. Aides said he delayed \n     confirmation of Johnson while seeking assurances that the \n     agency, which oversees federal travel policy, did not \n     discourage federal employees from traveling to Las Vegas for \n     business conferences.\n       Johnson's nomination cleared the Senate Homeland Security \n     and Governmental Affairs Committee in June, and drew no GOP \n     objections when it was circulated to all Senate offices. But \n     a Democrat apparently held up the nomination and prevented a \n     floor vote, Senate staffers from both parties said.\n       ``We later learned that Reid has expressed some concerns \n     about travel,'' said a senior Republican aide. ``He had some \n     concerns about that and was using the Martha Johnson \n     nomination as leverage with the White House and GSA.''\n       The aide said Reid did not place a technical hold, which \n     would not be needed since the majority leader controls the \n     floor schedule.\n       ``It is not accurate to say that Sen. Reid had a hold on \n     the nomination. . . . It is typical practice that a \n     nomination is reviewed once it is received,'' a Democratic \n     leadership aide familiar with the matter said. ``There were a \n     couple of issues that needed clarification on the \n     nomination.''\n       Reid has touted his concern about agencies limiting travel \n     to Las Vegas. In an exchange of letters in July, he asked \n     White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel to ensure federal \n     agencies do not prohibit travel to Las Vegas and other \n     conference destinations that ``are considered too leisure \n     oriented.'' On July 27 he sent a letter asking federal \n     agencies not to limit travel to any specific U.S. cities.\n       After Reid's concerns were resolved, Sen. Christopher (Kit) \n     Bond, R-Mo., placed his own hold on the nomination last month \n     because of concerns about delays in a federal construction \n     project in Kansas City. Bond has met with Johnson, but is \n     continuing the hold while waiting for further information \n     from the nominee, a spokesman said.\n  Mr. BOND. I thank the Chair. I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, are we in morning business?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. BURR. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for 20 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10889-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10889-S10891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS OF VETERANS\n\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about an \nissue I have been working on for 2 years--namely, ending the arbitrary \nprocess through which our own government takes away the second \namendment rights of veterans. Let me briefly describe what I mean about \nthis issue.\n  As most of my colleagues know, the Federal Gun Control Act prohibits \nthe sale of firearms to certain individuals, including convicted \nfelons, fugitives, drug users, illegal aliens, and individuals who have \nbeen ``adjudicated as a mental defective.'' Furthermore, the Gun \nControl Act prohibits possession of firearms by any of these classified \nindividuals. Needless to say, it is a serious matter. Criminal \nprosecution is\n\n[[Page S10890]]\n\nan option against those who violate the law.\n  The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act requires the government to \nmaintain a database of these individuals. We call this the National \nInstant Criminal Background Check System, NICS. The Brady law and the \nNICS database aim to prevent those who may pose a danger to society or \nto themselves from purchasing a firearm. Gun owners reference to the \nNICS screen customers--again, it goes without saying it is a serious \nmatter to have one's name on NICS.\n  Every American should expect a rigorous and fair process before their \nright to buy arms and bear arms is taken away, especially when criminal \nprosecution is involved. Unfortunately, when it comes to certain \nveterans, their spouses, their dependent children, their dependent \nparents, the process is neither rigorous nor fair. Since 1999--now 10 \nyears--the Veterans' Administration has sent the names of 116,000 of \nits beneficiaries to the FBI for inclusion under the NICS list. Again, \nthe NICS list means those 116,000 individuals can never purchase a \nfirearm. None of these names were sent to the FBI because they were \ndetermined to be criminals or a danger to themselves or, for that fact, \na danger to others; they were listed in NICS because they couldn't \nmanage their own financial affairs. We should not take away a \nconstitutional right because someone can't balance their checkbook on \ntime.\n  VA's review process for assigning a fiduciary is meant to determine \none's financial responsibility in managing VA-provided cash assistance, \nsuch as VA disability payments, pension benefits, and other benefits. \nFor example, a veteran may be assigned a fiduciary if they have a \ncredit problem. The VA focuses on whether benefits paid by the VA will \nbe spent in a manner for which they were intended to be spent. If you \nheld that threshold to every veteran, you would probably assign a \nfiduciary to all of them because we don't know in fact where the \npayments go or what they were intended for.\n  Nothing involved in the appointment of a fiduciary even gets to the \nquestion of whether an individual is a danger to themselves or others \nor whether the person should or should not own a firearm. Yet that is \nexactly what happens when the VA appoints a fiduciary to one of our \nNation's veterans.\n  Let me put a human face on the issue, if I can. I want to read \nexcerpts from a letter I received from Jennifer Briest. I have her \napproval to read it. Jennifer is the wife of Corey Briest. Corey served \nin Iraq. He was a paramedic. He was severely injured in an IED \nexplosion in 2004, which caused severe burns, damage to his lungs, and \nsevere traumatic brain injury after shrapnel entered his skull. Corey \nhas spent the last 5 years recovering from his injuries. Jennifer \nreports that he is walking, talking, and enjoying life at home with his \ntwo children.\n  Now it gets really sad. Because of his head injury, Corey still \nrequires help with certain things. The VA said he needed help managing \nhis disability compensation payments, and they named Jennifer, his \nspouse, as his fiduciary. That is where I would like to read from her \nletter. Again, I quote from her letter:\n\n       On May 19, 2009, we had our annual fiduciary meeting with \n     the VA field examiner. At the end of the meeting our field \n     examiner said he needed to read a statement to us. He read \n     the Brady bill statement and then stated that Corey can't \n     own, possess, use, be around, et cetera, any firearms. He \n     then went on to say that anyone in our household can't own a \n     gun while living in this household.\n       I asked him about Corey going on adaptive hunting trips and \n     he said that he couldn't. Corey stated that he had a gun that \n     was handed down from his grandfather and that Corey was going \n     to hand it down to his son and the field examiner told him \n     that he couldn't have it. He stated to Corey that if he did \n     own a gun or be around a gun that he would be threatened with \n     imprisonment.\n       The way that field examiner talked to Corey about this \n     issue was not appropriate. The field examiner said that I \n     could challenge it and handed me a blank sheet of paper with \n     a VA heading. I asked the field examiner for the statement he \n     read to me, but he said that he had to ask his boss [if he \n     could actually provide a copy of that statement]. After two \n     weeks of me e-mailing him, I finally got the attached papers \n     in the mail. I think the VA is taking this way out of concept \n     and I would greatly appreciate your support.\n\n  Well, in case any of my colleagues think the government would never \nprosecute someone like Corey Briest for possession of a firearm, being \naround a firearm, I wish to read to my colleagues excerpts from a VA \ndirective that went out to all VA regional offices on September 29, \nthis year, on this very issue.\n  The directive is meant to inform fiduciary field examiners of their \nobligation if they were to witness a violation of the Brady Act. I am \ngoing to quote from this VA memorandum to their field examiners.\n\n       Field Examiners or other VA employees who encounter \n     beneficiaries believed to be in violation of the Brady Act \n     are required to notify the Fiduciary Activity Manager as soon \n     as safely possible. At no time should the employee place him/\n     herself in danger. The Fiduciary Activity Manager at the VA \n     regional office of jurisdiction must immediately report the \n     alleged violation to the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and \n     Firearms at 1-800-ATF-GUNS.\n\n  That is straight out of the Department of Veterans Affairs memorandum \nto their field examiners. For 2 years I have gone through this in the \nVA Committee. I have tried to plead with my colleagues that this is a \nbreach of the second amendment of our country's veterans, that no \nveteran who has had their name reported of the 116,000, have ever been \njudged by a court to have a mental deficiency. In most cases, this is \nbecause there is a fiduciary needed to make sure they stay up to date. \nBut there is not an incapacity on their part that has been judged to be \na flaw in their judgment. Quite frankly, I find it offensive. I find \nthe language of this directive offensive because the premise seems to \nbe that our veterans are dangerous.\n  But as I mentioned, there is nothing about the current process that \neven gets to the question of an individual as dangerous. The current \nprocess is also a double standard. Only VA beneficiaries fall under \nthese guidelines. The Social Security Administration assigns \nfiduciaries to help beneficiaries every single day. Yet it does not \nsend their name to the NICS list.\n  We have a policy on the books that discriminates against individuals \nbecause they wore our Nation's uniform, because they fought on behalf \nof this country. I find it unacceptable and it must end.\n  I have a bill, S. 669, that would prohibit the VA from continuing \nthis arbitrary and unfair practice. It would require a judge, a \nmagistrate, or another judicial authority to determine that a VA \nbeneficiary is a danger to themselves or to others before their name \ncould be sent to the NICS list.\n  Twice the Veterans Affairs Committee approved this bipartisan \nlegislation to afford veterans with due process before their second \namendment right was snatched away from them. But twice the bill \nlanguished on the Senate floor. S. 669 was approved unanimously by the \ncommittee back in May. But it has gone nowhere. And the question is: \nCan veterans wait any longer or should veterans wait any longer?\n  I am not here to ask that we put guns in the hands of dangerous \npeople. I am here to ask you, to plead with you, that we treat veterans \nfairly and that their rights are protected like every other citizen.\n  Many of our veteran organizations and other groups agree with me. The \nVeterans Second Amendment Protection Act has the support of the \nAmerican Legion, the Veterans of Foreign Wars, AMVETS, the Military \nOrder of the Purple Heart, the National Alliance on Mental Illness, the \nNational Rifle Association, and Gun Owners of America.\n  I plead with my colleagues: Ask for S. 669 to be brought to the \nfloor. Do not sit back and say this is an obscure thing that the VA \nsometimes engages in and sometimes does not. Again, September 29, 2009, \n1 month ago, this directive goes out: Subject: Reporting violations of \nBrady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.\n\n       This letter provides guidance to our field personnel who \n     may encounter violations--\n\n  Violations by a veteran who served his country, is not a danger to \nhimself or to anybody else, but has been deemed to need fiduciary help \neven if it is a spouse and a second amendment right was yanked from his \nhands, and now the VA says to their field examiners: Report it because \nwe will prosecute these individuals.\n  I am not exactly sure how to respond to Jennifer Briest. That letter \nshe sent\n\n[[Page S10891]]\n\nme about: Corey continues to make progress after an IED explosion \nDecember 4, 2005.\n  How do you say to a kid who served his country, who is raising a \nfamily: One, we had to turn you in so you can never own a gun. And, \ntwo, that gun your father handed down to you, Corey, you have to get \nrid of it. You cannot hand it down to your child, because even if you \nhanded it down today to your son living in your home, they cannot have \nthat gun, because the Veterans Administration says you cannot.\n  But if a fiduciary was assigned to Corey's father or to his mother, \nthe Social Security Administration does not send that in to the NICS \nlist to deprive them of their second amendment right. This is the most \nunfair thing I have seen this country do. It is time we end this \npractice. It is time we respect our veterans. It is time we treat them \nfairly. It is time we uphold the Constitution of this United States.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I will be brief. I know the Republican \nleader is busy, but I just wish to make a couple of comments on a \ncouple of nominations.\n  A woman by the name of Tara O'Toole has been nominated to be Under \nSecretary of Science and Technology at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. This woman has such wonderful qualifications. She is \npresently the CEO and director for the Center for Biosecurity at the \nUniversity of Pittsburg Medical Center. She is a professor of medicine \nand public health at the University of Pittsburg. The Center for \nBiosecurity is an independent organization dedicated to improving the \ncountry's resilience to major biological threats.\n  Dr. O'Toole is internationally known for her work on biosecurity and \non health and safety issues. She has written volumes, literally. She is \npublished in areas of Anthrax, smallpox, plague, biological attacks, \ncontainment of contagious disease epidemics, biodefense research, \nhospital preparedness. These are areas that she has written in. She is \ncoeditor in chief of the Journal of Biosecurity and Bioterrorism. She \nwas a principal author and producer of ``Dark Winter,'' an influential \npiece of work done in 2001. She has served on numerous government and \nadvisory committees. Her education is significant: a bachelor's degree \nfrom Vassar College, a medical degree from George Washington \nUniversity, and a master of public health degree from Johns Hopkins \nUniversity. She has completed an internal residency at Yale and a \nfellowship in occupational and environmental medicine at Johns Hopkins. \nThis is a remarkably powerful foundation for someone who is going to be \nthe Under Secretary, the deputy, second in charge at the Department of \nHomeland Security. It is such an important job, Under Secretary of \nScience and Technology.\n  I had a call on Monday from the Secretary of Homeland Security, Janet \nNapolitano, saying: I am desperate for this woman. My staffing for \nbioterrorism is depending on her. She is a person I am going to depend \non for the pandemic that the President declared with the H1N1 flu. So I \nam really concerned about not being able to get this woman confirmed.\n  I ask unanimous consent, therefore, that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 331, the nomination of Tara \nO'Toole to be Under Secretary of Science and Technology at the \nDepartment of Homeland Security; that the nomination be confirmed and \nthe motion to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, \nwith no further motions in order; that the President of the United \nStates be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the Senate \nthen resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We do have some objections on this side; therefore, I \nmust object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I would renew my request and inquire about \nthe possibility of a 2-hour time limit of debate on the nomination or \nany reasonable time agreement, or I will even take an unreasonable time \nagreement at this stage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. There are objections on this side; therefore, I must \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I am going to ask unanimous consent that \nthe Surgeon General be confirmed. This is a wonderful woman who has \ndedicated her life to taking care of the poor and underprivileged. She \nhas done that for two decades on the gulf coast rather than going to \nsome fancy place and seeing how much money she could make. She didn't \ndo that. She has garnered nationwide praise for founding a rural health \nplan in Bayou La Batre, AL.\n  More than 40 percent of the town's 2,500 residents have no health \ninsurance. In 2002 she became the first African-American woman to be \npresident of the Medical Association of the State of Alabama. She would \nbe a terrific Surgeon General. Her family situation directs attention \nto the need for taking care of people who need help. Her father died of \ndiabetes and hypertension. Her brother died at 44 with HIV-related \nillness. Her mother died of lung cancer. She certainly is qualified and \nneeded during this crisis.\n  I, therefore, ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider Calendar No. 477, the nomination of Dr. \nRegina M. Benjamin to be Surgeon General of the Public Health Services \nof the United States; that the nomination be confirmed and the motion \nto reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, with no \nfurther action in order; that the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, I \nthink there is a good chance this nomination will be cleared. I need to \nhotline this nomination. If it comes out the way I anticipate, we \nshould be able to confirm this nominee in wrap-up. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all \npostcloture time be yielded back--and we are talking about the \nunemployment extension bill--and the motion to proceed be agreed to; \nthat once the bill is reported, the following be the only first-degree \namendments in order to the bill; that debate time on the listed first-\ndegree amendments be limited to 60 minutes each, except the Baucus-Reid \nsubstitute, which would be debated within\n\n[[Page S10892]]\n\nthe time limits provided for the bill; that general debate on the bill \nbe limited to 60 minutes, with that time equally divided and controlled \nbetween the leaders or their designees; Baucus-Reid substitute \namendment, which contains unemployment insurance extension and net \noperating loss provisions, as well as the negotiated home buyer tax \ncredit language; the Johanns amendment regarding an alternative \nsubstitute; that upon disposition of the amendments, the Baucus-Reid \nsubstitute amendment, if amended, be agreed to, the bill, as amended, \nbe read the third time, and the Senate then proceed to vote on passage \nof the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill object, this is the same subject we have been going back and forth \non for days. I have pared back our request for amendments \nsignificantly, but we are still unable to get even a modest three \namendments on this side of the aisle. Therefore, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, we have more than a million people, as we \nspeak, who have no unemployment insurance. These are the most desperate \nof the desperate. They have long since lost their jobs. If we can \nrecognize that what would stimulate the economy is giving somebody who \nhas been out of work a long time a check, and they will spend it--we \nhave more than a million people wanting to spend that money, maybe to \npay rent or make a car payment they are behind on to stop the car from \nbeing taken sometime in the middle of the night.\n  We have agreed to a bipartisan amendment dealing with first-time home \nbuyers that has been worked on by Johnny Isakson. It was his idea \noriginally. We have Senator Bunning, who offered an amendment dealing \nwith net operating loss. We have agreed to that. I would even be \nwilling to modify my unanimous consent request and include the Corker-\nWarner amendment regarding TARP trustees, another bipartisan amendment.\n  The Republicans have dropped their request for having an amendment on \nE-Verify, which took several days to work out. I appreciate that. They \nhave dropped their request to do another in the long line of amendments \ndealing with ACORN. But now they are hung up on a TARP amendment that \nwould basically sunset the program. This isn't the time to do that. \nThis is just an effort to delay and divert attention from this most \nimportant issue.\n  Even if that weren't the case, the House of Representatives--I spoke \nto Steny Hoyer at 3:30. I told him I would call him in the next half \nhour, 45 minutes. They will accept what we have talked about for first-\ntime home buyers and the work we have done with net operating loss, but \nthey are not going to accept terminating TARP. That is basically what \nit is. It sunsets it. We know there is a time limit on it, anyway, \nstatutorily. It seems to me there should be a better time to debate \nthis, dealing with a multibillion-dollar program.\n  So I hope my modification, which basically would add to it the \nalternative substitute by Senator Johanns and the Corker-Warner \namendment regarding TARP, would be agreed to.\n  I say to the distinguished Republican leader that we will not be able \nto accept the request to do the sunsetting of TARP tonight. I think it \nis unfortunate that we cannot approve what we agree upon. Today is \nThursday. I have already explained to the distinguished Republican \nleader--and he understood it, anyway--that this would put it over until \nMonday, and then Monday sometime we would attempt to get cloture on the \nbill. We got it on the motion to proceed to it. That takes another \ncouple of days. It is a difficult thing for people to have to wait a \nweek. I hope there will be an agreement to allow us to move forward.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, I believe the majority leader \npropounded another consent agreement. Reserving the right to object, \nlet me briefly recount for colleagues where we have been on this issue \nover the last days.\n  We initially offered a modest number of amendments--eight. Five of my \nMembers have been willing to discontinue their request for votes on \ntheir amendments. The majority leader just indicated he is willing to \nhave one TARP amendment. We have one more TARP amendment. That would \nmake for a total of three amendments. We could enter into a consent \nagreement to have votes on these three amendments, with short time \nagreements, and be through with this bill this afternoon.\n  I hope this is not the way the majority leader is planning on \nhandling the health care debate because the American people will storm \nthe Capitol if they think the majority is going to dictate to the \nminority what amendments will be offered on a bill as significant as \nrestructuring one-sixth of the economy.\n  I feel as if we have been extraordinarily reasonable. We are down to \nthree simple amendments on which we would be willing to accept time \nagreements to complete this unemployment insurance compensation bill. I \ndon't think that is unreasonable. Therefore, Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I guess reasonableness is in the eye of \nthe beholder. Try to explain to someone who has been out of work for 8 \nmonths that their ability to get a check to pay the rent before they \nare evicted is going to be held up because this program, which is--I \nthink the original TARP was $700 billion, as I recall, after meeting \nwith the Secretary of the Treasury, who first came up with the idea. \nThe program has been moving along, and there may be some reason to \nmodify the program, and there should be debate on that. I have no \nproblem doing that. But we should not hold this up. Every amendment we \nhave talked about here has been bipartisan in nature. The Isakson \namendment is bipartisan, the Bunning amendment is bipartisan, and the \nCorker amendment is bipartisan. I cannot imagine why we would hold this \nup.\n  My friend the distinguished Republican leader said they are not going \nto approve this, and I think that is too bad for the nameless people \nout there--I can see them in my mind's eye being desperate for help.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, just to make sure there is no \nmisunderstanding with the consent agreement I am willing to agree to, \nwith votes on three amendments, with short time agreements, we could be \nfinished with the unemployment compensation bill this very afternoon. \nThis is not an effort to delay. If my friend is concerned about the \namendment, he has 60 votes on his side; he could simply vote it down. \nThat is an easy solution to the problem--to enter into the consent \nagreement, have short time agreements, and if my friend from Nevada \nopposes them, I am sure he can convince 60 Democrats to vote them down.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, since we started this some 3 weeks ago, \nabout 150,000 people have been added to the list of people who are \neligible for what we are trying to do--150,000 people. Now there are \nwell over a million people waiting to get this relief.\n  I have said that this matter will not be approved by the House. The \nHouse is going to move to health care next week. I received a call from \nLeader Hoyer. He wants this matter to come over there with what we have \nagreed upon.\n  This is another effort to delay what we are doing. This is not a \nquestion of flexing muscles--who has 60 votes and who has 40 votes. It \nis a question of moving forward with legislation now, not next week, to \nhelp people in America.\n  Remember, since we started this--trying to get a simple extension of \nunemployment benefits, which is paid for, and it is not deficit \nspending--we have agreed to do what has been suggested by the \nRepublicans. First-time home buyers, we agreed to that; net operating \nloss, we will agree to that; we will agree to what Senator Corker \nwants, which is trustees appointed for TARP.\n  This is soon to be the fourth week of trying to simply get something \ndone. The Republicans have been saying no, no, no to everything we do--\n``the party of no'' is pretty well described. We have had 87 noes so \nfar this year in the form of 56 filibusters, plus trying to move the \nbills some 30 more times. So you\n\n[[Page S10893]]\n\ncan talk all you want about it. We should have been through with this 3 \nweeks ago.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Madam President, the way to finish this right now is \nto enter into a consent agreement to have votes on three amendments, \nwith very short time agreements, and we can solve this issue. If my \nfriend is worried about whether the House will accept it, he can vote \nit down, defeat the amendment. Around here, if you get the most votes, \nyou win; if you don't, you lose. All I am suggesting is that we have \nthree amendment votes, with short time agreements, this afternoon, and \nwe can wrap up this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this bill should have been wrapped up 3 \nweeks ago. It is always something. There is always a little something \nmore to do, until time goes on and on. It is obvious that my friends \ndon't care about these people who are desperate for money. I care about \nthem. We care about them.\n  Madam President, would the Chair announce the next order of business. \nUnder the provisions of the consent agreement the Republican leader and \nI agreed to, what is the matter before the Senate--or will be shortly?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10893-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10893-S10908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n              APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2010--CONFERENCE REPORT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I have an important announcement to \nmake on another subject which is of interest to the American people. \nThe era of the thousand-page bill is over. We now have a 2,000-page \nbill, a new health care bill introduced in the House of Representatives \ntoday by Speaker Pelosi. What we will do on the Republican side, and \nwhat I hope our friends on the Democratic side will do as well, and \nwhat every American expects us to do, is read all 2,000 pages and know \nexactly what it costs before we begin to vote on the congressional \nDemocrats' health care bill.\n  For example, while we know just a few things about the bill, we know \nthe price tag is likely to be more than $1 trillion. So it is 2,000 \npages, more than $1 trillion.\n  We know the physicians Medicare reimbursement rate, which is \nimportant to all of us to be included, is scheduled to be treated \nseparately there. Well, it wasn't treated separately here. On what was \nthe first vote on health care a week ago, 13 Democrats joined with 40 \nRepublicans to say we are not going to begin the health care debate by \nincreasing the deficit by $\\1/4\\ trillion. That was an important \nstatement to the American people.\n  One of the questions we will be asking is how is the physician \nMedicare reimbursement plan, which is an essential part of any plan for \nhealth care over the next 10 years, how is it paid for? Does it add to \nthe debt? We will be looking--and I know the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire who is the ranking Republican on the Budget Committee \nalready is looking--at not just what happens in the first 5 years of \nthis proposed bill but in the second 5 years and the 10 years after \nthat, because our goal is to reduce the cost of health care, the cost \nof premiums to each of us and to our government. A preliminary look \nsuggests that while the cost may go down to the government in the first \n5 years, it might go up in the second 5 years as the plan is \nimplemented.\n  Third, we want to look at the new taxes on small businesses we have \nbeen told about.\n  Next, we want to look at the provision in the bill which seems to say \nthat an employer might have to pay 8 percent of his payroll as a \npenalty if the employer does not provide health care to his employees. \nDoes that mean all employees? Does that mean full-time employees? Does \nthat mean part-time employees? We want to read the bill. We want to \nknow exactly what it says. We want to see a Congressional Budget Office \nestimate--a formal estimate--of what it costs.\n  There is in the bill a new government-run insurance plan. We have \nsaid before that our view on the Republican side--and I know some \nDemocrats have concern about this as well--is the effect of a \ngovernment-run insurance company--some call it the government option--\nis no option because if you are one of the 170 million or 180 million \nAmericans who have health insurance through your employer, the \ncombination of a bill such as this is you are more likely to lose your \ninsurance and the government option is likely to be your only option. \nWe will be asking that question and see what it costs.\n  There is a provision in the bill that expands Medicaid. This is the \ngovernment-run program for the low-income we already have that has 60 \nmillion Americans in it. The State and the Federal Government share the \ncost of it. My preliminary understanding of this provision is, it \nincreases the cost of the Medicaid expansion, which Governors all \nacross the country are deeply concerned about, and it adds a provision \nto require that physicians be reimbursed for Medicaid services at the \nsame level as Medicare, which would basically double the cost of the \nMedicaid expansion. How much of this will the States pay?\n  There are a number of questions to be asked, but the news of the day \nis this: The era of the 1,000-page bill is over. We have a new 2,000-\npage health care bill. We will be reading the bill, and we will be \ntrying to understand exactly what it costs.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Tennessee yield for a question, \nMadam President?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will be glad to yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. A 1,000-page bill is pretty big. It is about this big, and \na 2,000-page bill is about this big. We are going to find out when we \nsee it printed. That probably weighs a lot, 4 or 5 bricks, 10 bricks \nmaybe?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I don't know. The Senator from New Hampshire has a \nwide variety of experiences and may understand the weight of bricks \nbetter than I do. I just know the era of the 1,000-page bill is over. \nWe have a 2,000-page bill, and we will need to read it.\n  I ask the Senator from New Hampshire how long should it take the \nCongressional Budget Office to provide a formal estimate of a 2,000-\npage bill, based upon his experience--I ask through the Chair--as \nformer chairman of the Budget Committee and the ranking Republican \nmember.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I say to the Senator from Tennessee, I \npresume it would be at least a week or maybe 10 days. I understand they \nare going to do an informal sort of ``on the back of an envelope'' \nestimate quickly. But the implications of this bill, 2,000 pages--it is \nakin to dropping 10 bricks on our seniors, isn't it? Doesn't this \nbasically wipe out Medicare Advantage and massively impact Medicare \nbenefits and move those savings over to fund a brandnew entitlement?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire. Our concern \nhas been, with the bills we have seen so far, that a bill that is \nsupposed to reduce costs actually raises the cost of premiums, cuts \nMedicare, and raises taxes. The new government insurance plan will \ncause millions to lose their employer-based insurance and become a part \nof the government option and, unless the physicians Medicare \nreimbursement payment is a part of the plan, it also adds to the debt.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will entertain one other question. The \nSenator, in his comments on this new 2,000-page piece of legislation, \nwhich started out at significantly less, made a point that I believe \nthe last 5 years of this bill--it is a 10-year bill and, of course, it \nis going to go on forever. They basically start the taxes at day one, \nbut they don't start the expenditures until year five. It turns out, as \nI\n\n[[Page S10894]]\n\nbelieve the Senator said, the expenditures in the last 5 years exceed \nthe income. So if you were to logically put this bill in a 10-year \ntimeframe, where you had all the expenditures and income matched up, \nthis bill is going to add a lot to the deficit. This is a $1 trillion \nto $2 trillion bill, and the deficit is going to go up a lot. That is \ncommon sense; is it not?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It seems to me it will.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am always glad to yield for a question by the \nassistant Democratic leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Since we are dealing with health care reform that \naddresses one-sixth of the American economy, does the Senator from \nTennessee believe there should be a maximum number of pages the bill \nwould entail?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is a very good question. I saw the Senator from \nIllinois on the floor the other day saying: A 1,000-page bill, who \ncares about a 1,000-page bill?\n  I don't think Americans like the idea of a 1,000-page bill. I think \nthey will like even less a 2,000-page bill. I don't think we do \ncomprehensive very well here.\n  I think what the American people want us to do, if I can say to the \nSenator from Illinois, is not have a comprehensive bill full of higher \npremiums, taxes, and surprises but to focus on reducing the cost of \nhealth care premiums and reducing the cost to the government and go \nstep by step on things----\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I am trying to answer his excellent question. Go step \nby step to meet that goal, such as a provision that would allow small \nbusinesses to combine resources and offer their employees insurance, \nsuch as provisions that would get rid of junk lawsuits against doctors, \nwhich virtually everyone agrees drives up the costs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for one more question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Will the Senator yield for an additional question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Yes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator recall--and perhaps the Senator from \nIllinois recalls--does the Senator recall, during the last Presidential \ncampaign, when the President of the United States said there will be \nRepublicans and Democrats sitting down together and there will be C-\nSPAN cameras? I wonder if the Senator knows the C-SPAN cameras are \nstill waiting outside this room over there. Does the Senator recall \nthat commitment? I wonder--I wonder--whatever happened to that campaign \npromise that the American people would know who is on the side of the \npharmaceutical companies and who is on the side of the American people. \nIf they came in now, it would be too late because they already cut a \ndeal with the pharmaceutical companies in return for $80 billion. They \ngot $100 million in positive ads for reform.\n  I wonder if the Senator from Tennessee recalls that commitment on the \npart of the President of the United States. I wonder if he might urge \nhis colleague, the other Senator from Illinois, to get the C-SPAN \ncameras in there while these negotiations are going on.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his excellent \nquestion. I am sure there is no one in this Chamber who more vividly \nremembers that promise than the Senator from Arizona. We all would like \nto know what is in this bill and what is going on behind closed doors.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for one more question, a very \nshort question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Only if----\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Before he does, Madam President----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Tennessee has \nthe floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Without yielding the floor, I certainly would be \nglad--if I may reclaim the floor. I have the floor. I will be glad to \nallow the Senator from California to say whatever she would like, if I \ncan have consent to have the floor back.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I appreciate that. The Senator from Tennessee is the \nranking member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee. I alert the \nSenate that time is running on the bill. It is 2 hours, equally \ndivided.\n  Let me ask the Parliamentarian this question: How much time remains \non the Interior appropriations bill, and how much time has the \nRepublican side used to this moment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority still has 1 hour, and the \nminority has used 12 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Just so you know.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the chairman. I look forward to moving over \nthere and working on the Interior appropriations bill. I think Senator \nMcCain is here to speak about it. I was only, in an extravagant gesture \nof courtesy, trying to answer the question of the distinguished \nassistant Democratic leader from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for one more question? Will the \nSenator yield for one short question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Knowing the Senator is a very able trial lawyer, it is \nonly because I am courteous that I will do that. Of course I do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Very good. Can the Senator from Tennessee tell me how \nmany pages the Republican health care reform bill is?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Republican health care reform bill, Madam \nPresident, if I may talk about it, has been offered in a series of \nproposals. The proposal for a small business health insurance program \nis less than 1,000 pages, by several hundred pages.\n  What I think I will do is not take so much more of the Senator's \ntime, but I will enumerate the proposals and give him the number of \npages. While he is reading our proposals, I will read his, and we will \nsee who gets through first. Of course, we will have to wait until they \ncome out from behind closed doors with their bill.\n  I will get the small business proposal. I will get the proposal to \nend junk lawsuits against doctors. I will get the proposal to allow \npeople to buy insurance across State lines, which will reduce the cost \nof insurance. I will get the proposal that would adjust tax incentives. \nThere is a proposal that would also expand technology on which we have \nproposals on both sides of the aisle. So I will get five or six of the \nRepublican proposals, most of which we hope will gain bipartisan \nsupport.\n  I see the assistant Democratic leader every day at the beginning of \nthe day. Maybe we can even read them together, and then whenever his \nbill comes out from behind closed doors and we get the House bill, we \ncan all read that 2,000-page bill.\n  I am going to accede to the wishes of the chairman of the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee, because I am her ranking minority member, \nand cease talking about the end of the era of the 1,000-page bill and \nlet us get to Interior appropriations.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I am very pleased to be at this \nmoment. I join with my distinguished colleague, Senator Alexander, as \nwe begin consideration of the conference report on the fiscal year 2010 \nInterior, Environment, and Related Agencies appropriations bill.\n  This is the first year Senator Alexander and I have worked together \nas chairman and ranking member of the Interior Appropriations \nSubcommittee, and I am happy to say it has been a very good experience. \nWe consulted on several occasions and worked through several different \nissues as we crafted the original Senate bill and then again as we went \nto conference with the House, which I must say was a difficult \nconference. As a result, though, I think we have produced a bill that \nis fair, balanced, and workable. I personally thank him for all his \nwork and cooperation.\n  The Interior conference report totals $32.2 billion in nonemergency \ndiscretionary spending. That amount is $4.6 billion above the \nequivalent 2009 level but $60 million below the President's request. It \nis consistent with the subcommittee's 302(b) allocation for both budget \nauthority and outlays.\n  As everybody knows, each appropriations subcommittee receives an \namount within which they must produce an appropriations bill. We met \nour allocation. The problem was, the allocation for the House committee\n\n[[Page S10895]]\n\nwas $200 million bigger than our allocation. Then with some other items \nthe House put in which raised it about $300 million, it was very \ndifficult to reconcile the two bills.\n  I will not go through each and every line item, but I would like to \nemphasize the great strides we have been able to make in five specific \nareas: water and sewer infrastructure; wildfire suppression and \nprevention of fire on public lands; bolstering our public land \nmanagement agencies; investment in the Land and Water Conservation \nFund; and helping the most vulnerable in Indian country.\n\n  First, this conference report provides $3.6 billion for water and \nsewer infrastructure projects. That is a very significant increase over \nlast year's level of $1.6 billion. In fact, this is the largest single \ncommitment of funds that has ever been provided in an annual \nappropriations bill for these necessary and very basic infrastructure \nprojects. And as you will hear, we are infrastructure short in this \nNation.\n  I am a former mayor. I remember the day before bottled water. I \nremember the day when you could drink water right out of the tap. What \nwe have seen is a deterioration in this infrastructure all throughout \nthis great country. And when you factor in the $6 billion that was \nincluded in the stimulus, we are providing nearly $10 billion this \ncalendar year to our State and local water authorities. That is a major \ninvestment, and one I believe both of us are very pleased to have \nachieved. Senator Alexander was a Governor, I was a mayor, and we know \nthe importance of water and sewers. This money will allow our State and \nlocal water authorities to begin to tackle 1,479 wastewater and \ndrinking water projects across this Nation.\n  For those of you who might not be aware, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, which administers these grants, has estimated that over a 20-\nyear period our communities will need to spend over $660 billion for \ndrinking water and wastewater infrastructure repair and renovation. \nObviously, we can't provide that level of funding during tough \nbudgetary times. But what we were able to provide will go a long way \ntoward helping our communities tackle their crumbling infrastructure \nand provide their residents with more reliable and cleaner water.\n  Secondly, the bill provides $1.8 billion for wild land fire \nsuppression activities--a very big deal. It is very important that we \nare providing that level of funding because that is the amount that was \nactually spent, on average, in each of the last 3 fiscal years. The \nproblem is it wasn't budgeted for. So these big roaring fires take \nplace and then everybody has to scramble to transfer funds to be able \nnot only to fight the fires but to replace the money.\n  The conference report includes critical firefighting budget reform as \npart of the FLAME Act of 2009, which was championed by Senator \nBingaman. This act will help create a dedicated, steady, predictable \nfunding stream for wildfire suppression activities.\n  As part of the $1.8 billion provided for fire suppression, the bill \ncontains $474 million for the FLAME Fund reserve accounts for the \nForest Service and Department of Interior. These FLAME Funds have been \nestablished to cover the costs of large or complex wildfire events and \nas a reserve when amounts of firefighting funds from the agencies' \nregular fire appropriations accounts are exhausted. So it is a reserve \nfund for big fires, of which we are having plenty in the West.\n  In addition to fully funding fire suppression, the conference report \nalso includes $110 million in grants to help States fund their own \nfirefighting and fuels reduction efforts. That is a 22-percent increase \nover the 2009 level. It provides $556 million for hazardous fuels \nreduction projects on Federal lands nationwide. That is a 7-percent \nincrease over last year. These funds together will allow the Forest \nService and the Department of the Interior to treat 3\\1/2\\ million \nacres of fire-prone Federal lands.\n  One of the things we know is that the past policy of suppressing \nfires--letting everything grow until they become a combustible mix that \nburns hotter, heavier, and longer--has to change. So to work these \nlands, to manage these lands, to remove hazardous fuels, is a real \neffort to protect our forests and our wild lands.\n  Third, the bill shores up our public land management agencies by \nproviding a total of $6 billion for basic operations and backlog \nmaintenance at our national parks, forests, wildlife refuges, and on \nBureau of Land Management lands. For too long we have neglected these \nagencies and forced program cuts on them by underfunding the fixed \ncosts they incur this year. That is not done this year. Both the \nranking member and I are very proud of that.\n  Included in these funds are $2.3 billion for basic operations of 391 \nnational parks, an increase of $130 million. I think all of us would \nagree that our national parks are the crown jewels of this Nation. \nPeople go there by the tens of millions. For many, it is the only \nvacation they have. For most, it is a revelation of the amazing beauty \nof this great country. These monies will allow the Park Service to \ncontinue utilizing the 3,000 seasonal employees who have made a real \ndifference in the condition and enjoyment of our parks. Additional \nmaintenance personnel, law enforcement officers, park rangers will all \nbe brought back as a way of enhancing the visitor experience now and \npreparing our parks for the centennial in 2016.\n  In particular, I want to point out that the funding being provided in \nthis bill will allow the Park Service to continue the drug eradication \nprogram started last year. This is a huge problem. In our vast national \nparks, Mexican nationals have come in. They are armed, they are \ndangerous, and they essentially grow acres upon acres of marijuana and \nthen protect that marijuana. It is a real problem. So task forces have \nbeen put together--state, Federal, and local--to go into these parks \nand essentially roust the growers and arrest them.\n  This effort isn't limited to the Park Service. Included in the $1.56 \nbillion that this bill provides for operations of the national forests \nis a new $10 million increase for the Forest Service's law enforcement \nprogram. These funds mean that the service will be able to hire up to \n50 new law enforcement officers to battle the epidemic of marijuana in \nour parks and on public lands.\n  Fourth, the bill increases the protection and conservation of \nsensitive lands by providing $450 million through the Land and Water \nConservation Fund--and that is an important fund for all of us--\nconsisting of $278 million set aside for the four Federal land \nmanagement agencies for conservation of sensitive lands that provide \nhabitat to wildlife and recreation to visitors; $76 million for \nconservation easements through the forest legacy program; $56 million \nfor acquisitions associated with habitat conservation plans; and $40 \nmillion for State grants through the Park Service's State assistance \nprogram.\n  Finally, the bill helps some of the most vulnerable among us by \nproviding a total of $6.7 billion for the Indian Health Service and the \nBureau of Indian Affairs. That is an 11-percent increase over the 2009 \nlevel and includes increases of $471 million in direct health care \nservices; $81 million in K-12 and college education programs; and $58 \nmillion in law enforcement programs, which will allow for additional \npolice officer staffing on streets and in detention centers.\n  With these funds, more than 10,000 additional doctor visits will take \nplace that would otherwise not happen. This means additional well baby \ncare to prevent problems before they happen. It means additional \nalcohol and substance abuse treatment, which is truly a plague in \nIndian country. It means additional public health nursing visits to \nthose in the rural areas.\n  Funding provided through the Bureau of Indian Affairs will improve \nprograms and infrastructure at the Bureau's 183 schools. Interestingly \nenough, the $81 million increase in education programs will allow the \nBureau to substantially increase the number of schools that meet the \nadequate yearly progress goals spelled out in the No Child Left Behind \nAct. For the first time, nearly half of all schools will meet this \nmilestone. Half. That is very good.\n  Additional funding for law enforcement programs will allow the Bureau \nto increase staffing throughout Indian country. The bill makes a major \nincrease in funds for repair and rehabilitation of detention \nfacilities, and funds\n\n[[Page S10896]]\n\nwill allow the Bureau to repair several local facilities so that \nofficers spend less time in transit and more time on the streets.\n  Let me speak of some of the problem areas. The first one was Davis-\nBacon. Davis-Bacon is prevailing rate standards for, in this case, \nwater and sewer projects. The second area is emission control \nrequirements for the Great Lakes. And third is restrictions on the \nreporting of emissions from, of all things, manure management systems.\n\n  Let me speak about Davis-Bacon. The House put in their bill a \npermanent extension of Davis-Bacon. That was clearly a problem. \nTherefore, the agreement--and thanks to the ranking member--was that \nthe bill simply would contain a 1-year extension. In other words, \nDavis-Bacon would be included for water and sewer infrastructure for \nthe fiscal year 2010. We compromised on that. I have always supported \nDavis-Bacon. I believe that prevailing rates should apply to these \nprograms. But I also believe this is very much a necessary compromise, \nand it will serve as a bridge to allow the House and Senate authorizing \ncommittees--which is, after all, the proper place for this--to enact \nthe necessary legislation.\n  The conference report also includes language that would exempt 13 \nsteamships on the Great Lakes from certain marine fuel requirements. \nThis was language that was included at the insistence of the House. \nFrankly, it was not my preference to include this language, but I \nunderstand Members from the Great Lakes States are very concerned about \nthe economic impact of pending EPA emission control regulations on \nthese 13 older ships.\n  After substantial negotiation and discussion with EPA, we have \ncrafted a narrowly tailored compromise that recognizes these concerns \nin report language but will not impact air quality in California or any \nother seaboard city, or interfere with the ability of EPA to negotiate \ninternational controls on emissions from other oceangoing vessels.\n  I must say, this is a very important thing to California. In the L.A. \nport area--this is the area where 40 percent of all of the Nation's \ncontainer ships come in--there is a real and growing asthma problem. \nBeing able to regulate these ships is critical to pollution. Not only \nthat, the L.A. basin is one of the two worst nonattainment areas in the \nNation and in a few years will have sanctions on them because they \ncannot meet attainment standards. Therefore, being able to improve the \nemissions on these ships is important.\n  Third, the conference report includes language proposed by the House \nthat exempts all manure management systems from reporting greenhouse \ngas emissions to the EPA for 1 year. I believe the Senate version, \nwhich requires 90 of the Nation's largest factory farms to report on \ntheir greenhouse gas emissions while protecting family farmers from \nreporting, was a better approach. But in the interest of moving this \nbill we had to agree to the House language.\n  There is, however, one important point that must be made. The \nlanguage contained in the conference report will still allow EPA to \nimplement its underlying reporting rule and get good data on greenhouse \ngas emissions from nonagricultural sectors of the economy.\n  Finally, let me mention the CR, contained in division B of this \nconference agreement. As Members know, the current CR expires at \nmidnight on Friday, which is why it is critical that we pass this \nconference report and get it to the White House to be signed into law. \nWithout passage of the CR, the government shuts down. It is that \nsimple. And no one believes this is an option.\n  When the Social Security checks don't go out, Medicare and everything \nelse stops, it is a real problem.\n  As agreed to by the House and Senate leadership--not the ranking \nmember and I, but the House and Senate leadership--this new CR will \nprovide funding through December 18. That should allow enough time for \nthe remaining appropriations bills to be completed--we hope.\n  All in all, this is a good bill. It is the product of a lot of hard \nwork by Members in both the Senate and the House. I sincerely hope we \ncould adopt what has been agreed to by the House and get this bill to \nthe President.\n  I again thank my distinguished colleague from Tennessee for his \ncooperation and his work on this bill. Without him it would not have \nhappened. So I thank him very much and it is now his turn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, if I had to choose an appropriations \nsubcommittee to serve on, this would be it. It includes the things I \ncare the most about: the great American outdoors, clean air, our \nnational parks. I couldn't have the privilege of working with a finer \nchairman than Senator Feinstein. I like her especially because she says \nwhat she thinks. She was a mayor. A former Governor, as the Presiding \nOfficer was, appreciates that. She can make a decision, and she sticks \nto it. She cares about the great outdoors. She has a long record of \nwork on clean air and the environment, about our forests, about our \ndeserts, so we see eye-to-eye about a great many things.\n  Senator McCain is here to speak on our side in a few minutes. I think \nSenator Sessions would like 5 minutes. I would say to my Republican \ncolleagues, I don't plan to take but 3 or 4 minutes. After they speak, \nI don't have any other remarks to make. We may be able to give back \nsome of our time.\n  I thank the full committee, Chairman Inouye and Vice Chairman Cochran \nand Senators Reid and McConnell for their allowing us to move forward. \nI am glad this bill will not be part of the omnibus. That is not the \nway to do business. There were lots of differences of opinion, both in \nthe Senate and with the House--the chairman outlined those and talked \nabout those. My preference, if I were the king, I wouldn't spend this \nmuch money on this bill this year. This is a tough time. But I doubt \nAmericans will begrudge spending on national parks, on clean water, and \non firefighting.\n  This is the 75th anniversary of the Great Smoky Mountain National \nPark that was created in the midst of the Great Depression. Each State \nappropriated $2 million, and then schoolchildren gave their pennies. \nEven in tough times--maybe especially in tough times--we care about our \nnational parks. President Bush set us on the road with the Centennial \nInitiative to properly fund them by the time we get to 2016, and this \nbill continues that.\n  It is also good it includes within the budget the firefighting costs \nwhich were outside the budget as emergency appropriations. That is a \ngood way to do business. We do not want the U.S. Forest Service to \nbecome the U.S. Fire Service, even though we greatly value its work in \nfirefighting. We want it to also be able to perform other important \nfunctions.\n  I am glad to see the support for Land and Water Conservation Funds. \nLocal parks, city parks, are our most popular parks, the ones down the \nstreet.\n  The Senator mentioned the Davis-Bacon State revolving funds. I \nstrongly object to that being in the bill. This is the first time it \nhas ever been in. We have applied the Davis-Bacon Act to these state \nrevolving funds. This will mean fewer jobs, higher costs, fewer \nprojects. The States provide 20 percent of the match. They should be \nable to decide what the wage rates are in their States.\n  The bottom line is that we are appropriating $3.5 billion to get done \nwhat last year would have only cost us $2.6 billion to do. We are \nmaking a mistake. I fought hard to change that. I appreciate the fact \nthat the conference committee supported my effort to move this from a \npermanent change to a 1-year change. This is appropriately being \nconsidered by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee on \nwhich I serve. I will make my views known there.\n  I thank the chairman again for her courtesies. I see the Senator from \nArizona is here. I will yield the floor and give him and other Senators \na chance to speak on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, what little time remains to this side of \nthe debate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority has 41 minutes left.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Forty-one minutes?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Arizona may take as much time as he \nwishes.\n\n[[Page S10897]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank my friend from Tennessee, and I thank you, Madam \nChairman.\n  As we know, we are considering the conference agreement for the \nfiscal year 2010 Interior, Environment and Related Agencies \nappropriations bill. I was deeply touched and moved by both the manager \nof the bill and the ranking minority member's lamentations about the \nbudgetary constraints in which we are suffering--deeply moved, almost \nto tears, until I saw that this bill provides approximately $32.2 \nbillion, a 17-percent increase over last year's levels, and $4.66 \nbillion more.\n  You know, the bill comes after we already gave $10.95 billion in the \nstimulus bill. It is remarkable, remarkable.\n  When the distinguished manager talked about how the budgetary \nconstraints did not allow for us to have the necessary water \ninfrastructure projects which are so vital, particularly to those of us \nin the West, we somehow found room for 542 earmarks totaling $341.3 \nmillion.\n  I believe we might be able to find some more projects that are very \nbadly needed for water infrastructure and even for firefighting if \nmaybe we shifted those 542 earmarks totaling $341.3 million over to the \nneeded projects. As far as I know, not one of these earmarks was \nrequested by the administration, authorized, or competitively bid in \nany way. No hearing was held to judge whether these were national \npriorities worthy of scarce taxpayers' dollars.\n  When I read some of these, I think it would be hard to argue that \nthey would withstand any scrutiny, any competition. For example, \n$500,000 for a tropical botanical garden in Hawaii. Not in Arizona, not \nin California--Hawaii--$500,000 for a tropical botanical garden in \nHawaii.\n  There is $150,00 to renovate an opera house in Connecticut--renovate \nan opera house. The real unemployment in my State is now 17 percent. It \nis listed as less than 10 percent, but including those who have given \nup looking for work--17 percent of the people in my State are without a \njob, and we are going to spend $150,000 to renovate an opera house in \nConnecticut.\n\n  We are going to spend $500,000 for a native Hawaiian arts program in \nHawaii.\n  We are going to spend $1 million for improvements in the Sewall-\nBelmont House in Washington, DC. That is what I call a cozy \nrelationship. The Sewall-Belmont House is next to the Hart Building--$1 \nmillion. Couldn't this museum raise private money for these \nimprovements?\n  There is $2 million for an interpretive center at the California \nNational Historic Trail in Nevada and another $100,000 for the Tahoe \nRim Trail in Nevada to build a 15-mile hiking trail from Reno, NV, to \nthe Mount Rose Ski Resort near Lake Tahoe.\n  I get favorites every once in a while, but this is probably one of my \nfavorites recently. If we Twitter the top 10, I guarantee you this will \nmake the top 10: $1.2 million for rat eradication at the Palmyra Atoll \nNational Wildlife Refuge; $1.2 million worth of rat traps. This $1.2 \nmillion in rat traps is for a 5-square-mile island, U.S. territory that \nis not occupied except for a few scientists from the Nature Conserve \nstudying the island's coral reef, according to the Interior Department.\n  There is $750,000 for a conservation training center in West \nVirginia. I am sure over the years my colleagues have gotten to hear \ncertain States named--Hawaii, West Virginia, Nevada, California. I am \nsure all of those are strictly coincidental.\n  There is $200,000 for historic preservation of the Richardson-\nOlmstead Complex in Buffalo, NY. I am not making this up. The \nRichardson-Olmstead Complex is actually the former Buffalo State Insane \nAsylum which was decommissioned in the 1970s. According to Richardson \nCenter Corporation, which is a nonprofit managing the complex for \nhistoric preservation, this funding would go toward maintaining the \nformer hospital as ``an example of the humane treatment of the mentally \nill.''\n  There is $750,000 for the Hudson Quadricentennial Commission in New \nYork to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the Dutch explorer Henry \nHudson sailing the Hudson River; $500,000 to the Vermont Wood Products \nCollaborative, which provides grants to promote the development and \nmarketing of wood products businesses in the State of Vermont. \nAccording to the Office of Management and Budget, Vermont Woods \nProducts Collaborative is a continuing earmark that has received over \n$780,000 from Congress over the past 4 years.\n  That is for the Vermont Wood Products Collaborative when my State has \na 17-percent unemployment rate.\n  Some of these that I just described may have merit. There are 542 of \nthem. Some of them may have merit, but we will not know that. We will \nnot know whether or not they have merit. They have never been \nauthorized, never been subjected to competition, they have never been \nscrutinized. But what has been done is they have been put in because of \nthe relative power of certain Members of Congress.\n  I had intended today to bring over recent articles concerning the \ninvestigations that are being conducted on Members of Congress because \nof this practice of earmarking and porkbarrel spending.\n  One more example of this is the Environmental Protection Agency State \nand Tribal Assistance Grants Program, which funds wastewater and \ndrinking water infrastructure projects throughout the country. Local \ncommunities that request assistance under this program have to do so \nunder Federal and State systems for prioritizing the most important \nprojects from a health and environmental standpoint.\n  But all it takes to sidestep the entire process is for a Member to \nslip an earmark into an appropriations bill that benefits a special \ninterest in their home State. Inevitably, communities that are worthy \nof EPA's help are left empty handed because they were not connected \nwell enough in Washington.\n  The President's 2010 budget calls for terminating all of these \nearmarks. The President's budget asks that they should be eliminated. \nThe administration says, the President says, these earmarks are \n``duplicative'' and ``not subject to the State priority-setting process \nwhich typically funds cost-effective and higher priority activities \nfirst.''\n  Moreover, the administration points out these earmarks ``single out \nprojects and communities for a greater subsidy than otherwise available \nthrough existing programs,'' and ``that these types of projects require \nmore oversight and assistance than standard grants because many of the \nrecipients are unprepared to spend or manage such funds.'' In other \nwords, some communities are receiving earmarks so large that they do \nnot know how to handle them.\n  Let's look at a few of these infrastructure earmarks. For the town of \nMoorefield, WY, $2.5 million is earmarked for a wastewater treatment \nplant. The town of Moorefield has a population of 2,375. That is a \nsubsidy of over $1,000 per person.\n  Six million dollars goes to construct a drinking water reservoir in \nFayette County, AL. Estimated population of Fayette County: 18,000.\n  There is $1.2 million for sewer improvements in Plattsmouth, NE; \npopulation: 6,900. Finally, $15 million for water infrastructure in \nremote Alaska Native villages, which exceeds the administration's \nrequest by $5 million. In its budget submission, the administration \nproposed reducing spending for Alaska Native villages to $10 million \nbecause:\n\n       Audits conducted by the EPA Office of the Inspector General \n     identified several financial management problems, including \n     improperly charging labor costs to grants and disbursing \n     funds that were not tied to the actual project costs.\n\n  I am for helping our neediest and most rural communities. Some of \nthese projects may be truly needed. But it is disregard for the \nprocedure that should be followed that concerns me.\n  Last month the House and the Senate Democratic leadership airdropped \na continuing resolution into the legislative branch appropriations bill \nto keep the government running until this Sunday. It is not the way to \ndo business. There is nothing that prohibits the majority leader from \ncalling up a continuing resolution as a stand-alone piece of \nlegislation.\n  I want to say that I intend to raise a point of order. But, more \nimportantly, if this bill passes the Senate, as it did the House \nearlier today, the President of the United States, if he is serious \nabout eliminating waste and unnecessary spending, should eliminate a \nbill\n\n[[Page S10898]]\n\nthat has a 17-percent increase over last year's levels, which is $4.66 \nbillion more, in addition to the $10.95 billion that was appropriated \nto these accounts in the stimulus bill, and contains 542 earmarks \ntotaling $341.3 million. If that is not enough to earn the President's \nveto, I do not know what is.\n  I raise a point of order that the conference report violates the \nprovisions of rule XXVIII, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I move to waive the relevant \nprovisions of rule XXVIII. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Can the Chair state when the vote on the motion to \nwaive will occur this evening?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to waive will occur after all time \nis used or yielded back.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 40\\1/2\\ minutes, the minority \nhas 28 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. My understanding is that the chairman of the \nAppropriations Committee is here if you have no objection, Mr. Ranking \nMember.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I certainly have no objection at all. The Senator from \nAlabama is here. As far as I know, he is the only other Republican \nSenator who wishes to speak at this time. I have no further comments. \nSo if any other Republican Senator wishes to speak, they should come \nover. After Senator Sessions speaks, we will waive the rest of our \ntime.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I yield the floor to the distinguished Senator from \nHawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, the conference report before the Senate \nprovides funding for the Department of the Interior and related \nprograms. While the funds in this measure represent a significant \nincrease over the funding levels provided in fiscal year 2009 they are \ngreatly needed by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Forest \nService, our national parks, and other agencies which provide critical \nsupport to all Americans.\n  I would also note that the increase is within the amounts approved by \nthe Senate in the budget resolution. In fact, each bill and conference \nagreement tha the Appropriations Committee has forwarded to the Senate \nhas been within the amounts approved by the Congress. Those who object \nto the spending in these bills ignore that the Congress approved these \nfunding levels earlier this year.\n  I would share my colleagues' concern with spending if the \nAppropriations Committee were exceeding the amounts approved in the \nbudget, but in point of fact we are not. Moreover, in total the amounts \nthat are in this bill when combined with the other 11 appropriations \nbills are below the amounts requested by the administration.\n  That is only one reason, but an important consideration in why these \nbills have received nearly unanimous support from Senator Cochran and \nthe other Republican members of the committee. Once again, this \nInterior conference report saw nearly unanimous support from the Senate \nconferees.\n  Over the past few months we have heard the repeated cries that we are \nspending too much. But to reiterate, the facts are we are spending less \nthan requested by the administration and the same amount or less than \nwas approved by the Congress.\n  Included in the conference agreement is a short term extension of the \ncontinuing resolution. Regrettably, an additional extension of the CR \nis necessary because we are still unable to complete action on all 12 \nbills. I want to remind my colleagues that upon assuming the \nchairmanship of the committee last January I vowed that we would strive \nto end the process of tying all 12 bills into an omnibus bill which \naffords all members less opportunity to debate and amend these \nimportant measures.\n  I was extremely pleased to learn last spring that every one of our \nRepublican colleagues signed a letter to the majority leader urging him \nto provide ample floor time to consider these bills. And, I must thank \nthe leader, and the minority leader as well for allowing these bills to \nbe considered.\n  No one can accuse the majority of not trying to return to regular \norder. We have passed seven appropriations bills to date, and today the \nSenate is considering our fifth appropriations conference report. We \nhope to complete Senate action on two or more measures next week.\n  This has not been easy. Each time an appropriations bill has been \ncalled up a handful of Members have used their rights to slow down the \nprocess. Our managers have been forced to wait 2 and even 3 days before \nthe same Members, time after time, are willing to call up amendments.\n  The Senate has been in session about 153 days this year. On 56 days, \nso far, the body has been considering an appropriations measure. That \nis more than 11 weeks. We have tried to elicit cooperation on these \nmeasures, but once again a few members, who seem to oppose the \nappropriations process, must believe that we are better off under a \ncontinuing resolution in which the executive branch makes all spending \ndecisions than allowing the Congress to do its work. Because of this \napproach, we find ourselves in need of passing another CR.\n  Division A of this conference report represents the hard work of \nSenators Feinstein and Alexander along with all the members of the \nsubcommittee and their staffs. It contains critical funding that is \nneeded today. I support the compromise that Chairman Feinstein and \nSenator Alexander brokered on a biipartisan fashion. I commend them for \ntheir fine work.\n  Division B of the conference agreement extends the current continuing \nresolution until Friday December 18. There are also two technical \ncorrections in the bill that fix problems in the original CR. In \naddition, three new issues are added which generally have the support \nof the administration and should be noncontroversial.\n  First, the Small Business Administration will be allowed to use $80 \nmillion to continue Small Business 7(a) loans during the CR period. \nWithout this authority, SBA expects to have to turn off its loan \nprogram in November.\n  Second, up to $200,000,000 of funds made available in the Omnibus \nbill will be allowed to be used to adjust allocations for public \nhousing agencies to prevent cutting off assistance to poor families. \nWithout this authority the administration believes up to 10,000 \nfamilies would lose their housing assistance.\n  Third, the bill allows for government-sponsored mortgage holders to \ncontinue to loan funds at higher level loans so that high cost areas \nare still covered. The current law expires in December. The Department \nof Housing and Urban Development expects that in anticipation of the \nexpiration of the authority lenders will start to stop credit for these \nhigh-cost loans as early as November.\n  The House has already approved this provision in its 2010 THUD \nAppropriations bill, but since that bill has not yet been completed, \nthis action is necessary at this time.\n  Some of my colleagues may be concerned that we have attached the CR \nto this bill. It is clear as I have pointed out that we cannot expedite \npassage of appropriations bills this year because of a small number of \nopponents. Each bill has taken nearly a week to pass all because of a \nfew Members wanting to delay.\n  For example, the Energy Water conference report which passed with \nnearly 80 votes took 3 days of delay before we were allowed to vote.\n  As such, regrettably this approach is necessary. I urge all my \ncolleagues to support the swift passage of this bill to avoid a \ndevastating shut down of government operations.\n  And, finally I urge my colleagues to cooperate with the managers of \nour appropriations bills in the coming weeks as we seek to pass our \nremaining bills. Without cooperation, we will no doubt be forced to \nreturn to an omnibus-type of approach which limits all Members' right \nto debate and amend the measures that the committee has recommended.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I will vote to approve this conference \nagreement and continuing appropriation resolution to provide over $32 \nbillion for a variety of important environmental, forest and land, \nnational parks and infrastructure purposes; as well as to extend\n\n[[Page S10899]]\n\nfunding for other Federal programs through December 18.\n  I am pleased this bill includes the full $475 million for Great Lakes \nRestoration Initiative, GLRI, as requested in the President's budget. \nThe GLRI is a multi-agency effort to address the array of current and \nhistoric threats facing the Great Lakes, such as invasive species, \nhabitat loss, and pollution. The Environmental Protection Agency has \nprepared a spending plan for this money based on years of research and \ncooperative work with other Federal, State, tribal, and local partners, \nand the EPA will measure results to ensure accountability. This bill \nincludes language, which I supported, to ensure that steamships in the \nGreat Lakes are able to continue to operate. The compromise included in \nthis bill allows the EPA to move forward with a proposed air emission \nregulation for maritime vessels operating on the coasts while the EPA \nworks with the Great Lakes shipping community on compliance. \nAdditionally, the EPA will conduct additional economic analysis for the \nGreat Lakes region.\n  This bill provides $2.7 billion for our National Park Service, an \nincrease of $200 million from last year's level, which I support. That \nincrease would help maintain and protect the natural, historic and \nrecreational resources of the six National Park units in Michigan. I am \npleased conferees favorably responded to my request to waive the match \nrequirement for Quincy Smelter funding, located within Keweenaw \nNational Historical Park in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. The bill \nincludes $1 million to stabilize the deteriorating buildings at the \nQuincy smelting complex, which is the best remaining example of a \ncopper smelter of its era in the country, and possibly the world. The \nsmelter has been identified by the Park Service as a core resource in \nthe park, yet its structures have deteriorated significantly since the \nsmelter closed in 1971. Over the past couple of years, some parts of \nthe smelter buildings have collapsed and last year, a smokestack, which \nis a critical part of the landscape, had to be removed because it was \nin danger of imminent collapse. With the waiver language included, this \nfunding can be used to stabilize the buildings to prevent additional \nstructural failures, saving one of the most important resources of the \npark.\n  Importantly, the bill would provide $1.4 billion to capitalize the \nDrinking Water State Revolving Fund and $2.1 billion for the Clean \nWater State Revolving Fund for wastewater projects. The funding in this \nconference agreement more than doubles the amount provided in the \nfiscal year 2009 omnibus. Michigan would receive about $41 million for \ndrinking water and $90 million for wastewater projects, protecting \npublic health, improving the environment, and creating a stronger \neconomic climate.\n  This appropriations conference agreement would provide a significant \nboost to protect and clean up the Great Lakes, protect the environment, \nimprove Michigan's parks and lands, provide communities with safe \ndrinking water and improved wastewater infrastructure, and I support \nits passage.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, is there a time limit on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority still has 28 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask to be notified after 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify the Senator.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, a number of appropriations bills, as \nSenator Inouye has said, have moved forward this year, and I do not \nthink it is obstructive or an effort to delay to try to make sure those \nbills spend the taxpayers' money at a reasonable level and for things \nthat serve the national interest.\n  Let me talk about the bill before us today. It is stunning in its \nincrease in spending at a time when we are not able to spend at this \nlevel. Some people dismiss the persons at the tea parties who have been \nringing our phones and sending us messages and e-mails about the \nreckless rate of spending. I believe, unfortunately, that as a body \nthis Senate is in denial. The Senate is of the belief that it is \nbusiness as usual, that we will get together and have these meetings in \nthese committees and bills will be dropped on the floor, with \nunprecedented rates of spending increases, and everybody will vote for \nit and it is OK because that is what we always do.\n  Actually, what we are doing today is worse than what we have been \ndoing in the past. The spending increase levels are at rates that are \nbreathtaking. I have to talk about it.\n  I would like to support the Interior bill. I know the Environmental \nProtection Agency is an important agency. We are not trying to \neliminate them. But let's take a look at a few things. The Senate bill \nthis year for Interior and EPA has a 16.9-percent increase. At this \nrate, spending for the Interior-EPA would double in only 4 to 5 years, \nthe whole budget would double in 4 to 5 years at this rate of increase. \nInflation today is less than 1 percent. The Environmental Protection \nAgency spending increase is 37.7 percent in this legislation, a 37-\npercent increase. At that rate, the whole EPA budget would double in 2 \nto 3 years.\n  You say, surely you are considering some of the stimulus money we \npassed, the $800 billion stimulus package that was supposed to create \njobs, which was passed in February of this year. No, I am not. This is \nthe baseline budget bill. If you add the stimulus for fiscal year 2010, \nwe would have a 57-percent increase. The 2-year increase from 2008 to \nfiscal year 2010 would be 62-percent, assuming we are adding stimulus \nspending to FY2010. But that does not include the emergency funding \nthat may occur for fires or floods or storms.\n  Some Senators have the gumption to come down here and ask: What are \nwe doing? How can we continue to spend like this? Aren't we being \nirresponsible? Are you listening, fellow colleagues, to your phone \ncalls, to your e-mails, to your letters and your townhall meetings? Are \nyou listening to them or do you think this is just business as usual? \nWe make a few deals and we pass a bill. Everybody is happy, and we pat \neverybody on the back.\n  Let me show a few charts that relate to that issue. This is the \nEnvironment and Interior appropriations history for the last several \nyears. A lot of my colleagues say President Bush spent so badly. Well, \nsometimes he did. But from calendar year 2001 through 2009, the \nspending increases averaged only 1 percent in these departments. Look \nat this year. It was an actual reduction. Now we have a 16-, 17-percent \nincrease, and that does not include the $11 billion from the stimulus \npackage. That totals, then, a 57-percent increase in this Interior \nbill.\n  I can't vote for this. How can I go back home and tell my people, \nwhen I said I am concerned about spending and we have to do better, \nyes, constituents, I know we have to do better and then waltz into the \nSenate and vote for a bill such as this? No matter how much good people \nsay is in it, we don't have the money.\n  This year the budget deficit hit, as of September 30, about four \ntimes the highest budget deficit we have ever had in the history of the \nRepublic, $1.4 trillion.\n  Look at the Ag bill. The Agriculture bill, we were waltzing along \nwith a 2-percent average annual increase from 2001 through 2009. That \nincludes 2009. We end up with another 14 percent increase in \nAgriculture. That does not count the stimulus package. Agriculture got \na good bit out of the $800 billion stimulus package.\n  What about the THUD? Boy, it is a thud in terms of what impact there \nwill be on the deficit for the Nation. Discretionary appropriations \nfrom 1995 to 2009 averaged an increase of 5.2 percent. What about 2010? \nA 23-percent increase. That is budget baseline spending.\n  I ask my colleagues, is anybody listening to their constituents or \nare Alabama constituents the only ones who care about the financial \nfuture of this country? Are they the only ones who care about their \ngrandchildren? I don't think so. I think my colleagues are hearing some \nof the same thing.\n  So how do we come up with these increases? Here is the State \nDepartment and the Foreign Operations bill. As I said, from 1995 \nthrough 2009, over 14 years, all our discretionary spending averaged an \nincrease of 5.2 percent. What do we get today? Look at this, a 32 \npercent increase in 1 year. In 3 years, that doubles the whole foreign \nops budget.\n  What does it mean? These are not exaggerations. I hope my colleagues \nand\n\n[[Page S10900]]\n\nthe American people look at this chart. We ended fiscal year 2008 with \na $5.8 trillion total American debt. That is how much we owed to the \npublic. In 2013, according to our own Congressional Budget Office, \nbased on President Obama's spending plan, it will double to $11.8 \ntrillion, doubling the entire national debt in 5 years. By 2019, the \n10-year budget window the President has submitted to us, his budget for \nthat period, it would triple the debt to $17.3 trillion. This takes us \ntoo close to having a debt equal to 100 percent of America's gross \ndomestic product.\n  According to the Heritage Foundation, there are gimmicks in these \nnumbers. They estimate it will be closer to $20 trillion, and that is \ngoing to be about 100 percent of the entire gross domestic product, \nwhich is considered very bad in international circles and historically \nhas always resulted in adverse economic ramifications.\n  One more thing. The numbers get so large. You talk about trillions \nand billions, and it is hard to get a grip on what we are talking \nabout. Most of us can understand what interest is on our debt. We can \nunderstand that. We pay a mortgage. You take out a mortgage and most of \nthe money you pay the mortgage company goes to interest until it begins \nto go down over a period. If we look at this chart, we will see what \nwould happen to the government's interest payment. Despite these \nsurging increases, the Interior budget for parks and the EPA budget \ncombined for all this year is $32 billion. That is a huge sum of money. \nAlabama's total budget, including education and general funds, is about \n$7 billion, the whole State of Alabama. So we are spending 32 \nnationally on Interior and EPA. This past year, fiscal year 2009, we \nspent $170 billion just to pay the interest on the money we borrowed \nfor the $5.8 trillion in debt we had when the year started. So we paid \n$170 billion in interest. That is more than five times the Interior \nbudget we are passing today, as big as it is and much as it has \nexpanded. Look how it increases in only 10 years. According to the CBO, \nwhich is by far the most conservative analysis, it ends up at $799 \nbillion in interest in 1 year. That is not paid to some other \ngovernment agency, it is paid to people who hold our Treasury bills \nbecause, during this period, instead of paying interest on $5 trillion, \nwe will be paying interest on $17 trillion, and the interest rates are \nunusually low today. CBO experts expect those interest rates to \nincrease.\n  The result is, we are talking about $800 billion in interest. If \nthere are higher rates of interest, as the blue chip outside economists \nproject, they project it would be $865 billion in interest in 1 year on \nthe public debt, much of it interest paid to people in foreign \ncountries, countries, states who own our treasury bills and buy our \ndebt, leaving us weakened economically, politically, strategically, our \nsecurity weakened, when we are that much in debt to people around the \nglobe.\n  I believe Americans are getting it. That is why they are writing us. \nThey would like to see us do better. Are we doing better? The charts I \nshowed indicate we are doing worse. It is time to say: No, we don't \nhave the money. The average household income for an American citizen \nfell 3.6 percent. So the average household is seeing a 3.6-percent \nreduction, and States all over America are reducing their spending and \nmaking improvements in efficiency and taking other tough steps to \ncontain spending. We are spending like crazy. Remember, we passed an \n$800 billion stimulus package in February. That is such a huge number. \nIt is the largest spending bill this Republic has ever passed, $800 \nbillion in one fell swoop after a few weeks of being in session. It had \nto pass supposedly. Unemployment was going to go up if we didn't pass \nit. So in panic--not with my vote--this Congress passed that stimulus \nbill, and we have seen very little stimulus results from it.\n\n  Unemployment in my State is about twice what it was before this \nrecession started. So we have a problem, and we are not going to just \nborrow our way out of it. In the long run, I am concerned about this \nspending level and the debt level because there is no plan to make it \nbetter. According to the Congressional Budget Office, in 2019, what \nwill the deficit be? Will it be going down? Will we be beginning to pay \noff the debt, the money we have borrowed? No. In 2019, they project the \nannual deficit that year to be over $1 trillion--in 1 year, over $1 \ntrillion--in 1 year to add to the total national debt.\n  This is irresponsible. There was an article in today's Washington \nTimes by one of their economists who pointed out the tremendous--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator asked to be notified after 10 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I thank the Chair, and I will wrap up.\n  He just noted the severe risk this kind of surging debt--the likes of \nwhich the country has never before seen or participated in. Those risks \nare real. He emphasized our national security. But many people are \nemphasizing the risk to our economy and our future growth. We are going \nto have to pay, in 2019, $800 billion, at least, in interest before we \nstart buying the things America needs for its government to operate. \nInstead of $170 billion, we are going to be spending $800 billion.\n  Why? Because we cannot say no. Why? Because we are addicted to higher \nand higher spending. I think it is irresponsible. I certainly believe \nour colleagues who produce these bills think they are doing well and \noperate within reality, and it is hard, they think, to make any \nchanges. But why can't we? States are making changes. People in their \nhomes are making changes. Why can't we make changes?\n  I think we can. I do not think it is a little bitty matter. It is not \na political matter. I keep hearing Democratic colleagues also \nexpressing great concern about this debt. They try to blame it on \nPresident Bush and other things. But at some point it is our spending. \nPresident Bush did not propose to increase the Interior spending by 17 \npercent. The Democratic leadership proposed that, and all these other \nbills we have.\n  So we have to do better. I will be voting no, regretfully, and I hope \nmore of my colleagues will join me because we need to begin to say: No, \nwe cannot continue on this road. We are not in denial. We do believe \nour constituents have valid concerns about reckless spending, and we \nare going to try to act in a way that again wins their trust.\n  Madam President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I yield 10 minutes of our time to \nthe distinguished Senator from North Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me thank Senator Feinstein and also \nSenator Alexander for the work they have done on this bill. I used to \nbe the ranking member of this subcommittee, and I understand many of \nthe issues in this bill. The breadth and scope of it is very \nsubstantial, and I think they have done a good job.\n  I want to mention two things that are very small parts of this bill \nbut, nonetheless, I think important. One is the issue of something \ncalled hydraulic fracturing. The reason I mention it is, there is a lot \nof discussion about how important it is for us to become less dependent \non foreign energy. We need to become less dependent on oil from places \nlike Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Iraq, Venezuela and so on.\n  Madam President, about 70 percent of our oil comes from overseas. The \nfact is, we use a prodigious amount of oil.\n  The U.S. has about 5 percent of the world's population, but we use \nalmost 25 percent of the oil. Seventy percent of it comes from off our \nshores from other countries, and 70 percent of all the oil we use is \nused for transportation. So we need to continue to develop resources at \nhome if we are going to become less dependent on foreign energy.\n  There is a provision included in the Interior conference report \nrelated to hydraulic fracturing. This small provision requires a study \nby the EPA of hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. What I want to \nmention is this: In the subcommittee I chair on Energy and Water \nDevelopment, I have continued to include research and development \nfunding for oil and natural gas programs. We lead the world in \nunconventional oil and gas production, in part, because of this \nfunding.\n  We are now discovering new fields in shale and tight sands reservoirs \nbecause we can use technologies that we\n\n[[Page S10901]]\n\ncould not benefit from 5 and 10 years ago. Just think we now explore 2 \nmiles beneath the surface of the Earth areas of shale and go into seams \n100-foot thick. We have the ability to drill down 2 miles, make a big \ncurve, and drill out 2 miles to reach the resource. So you have a 4-\nmile circuit with this one drilling rig and you go into a shale deposit \nmore than out 2 miles out. To exploit the resource, companies use \nhydraulic fracturing by using water under high pressure. It allows them \nto break down that shale, and you have oil production.\n  The U.S. Geological Survey did a survey in North Dakota in an area \ncalled the Bakken shale. It is an area about 100-foot thick 2 miles \ndown. They said using today's technology--today's technology--there is \nup to 4.3 billion barrels of recoverable oil in place. That is the \nlargest assessment of recoverable oil they have ever found in the Lower \n48 States. Think of that. But none of that resource would be available \nwithout the use of hydraulic fracturing.\n  By the way, this issue of hydraulic fracturing--water under high \npressure to break that shale--we have been doing that for 60 years. \nThere has been many studies, and there is simply no problem with it \nwhen properly applied. These studies show that it does not contaminate \ngroundwater. In fact, the EPA itself did a study in 2004 and concluded \nthere is no problem.\n  Well, some of our colleagues are concerned, and they have legislation \nto regulate hydraulic fracturing on a federal level. In the House \nInterior Appropriations bill, there was a requirement for the EPA to do \na study. I would say the Senate did not have that requirement in its \nbill. I worked with other Senators and, but we requested that certain \nguidelines be in the study. Those requests were included in the \nconference report. I do not mind there being a study because I believe \nthat it will demonstrate what we already know and what the EPA has \npreviously discovered in their study. This issue of hydraulic \nfracturing is not a problem. We do need to continue to produce more \nenergy in this country to make us less dependent on foreign oil and \nfind ways to use more domestic natural gas. It is just a fact, and it \nwill not continue unless we can continue the hydraulic fracturing that \nunleashes the opportunity of these oil and natural gas fields.\n  So that is a small piece of this very big bill, but I think one that \nis very important. I wanted to make that point.\n\n  I want to make one additional point, and this actually relates to the \nsuccess of something we took out of this bill. I want to just describe \nit for a moment. Some things just sort of drive you batty about the way \ngovernment works. Government gets big, and somehow it just leaves \ncommon sense behind from time to time. This was a circumstance where in \na national park in North Dakota, the Badlands--the Theodore Roosevelt \nNational Park--they have to thin the elk herd. There are too many elk--\nabout 900 elk. It can only handle about 250 or 300 elk. So you have to \nget rid of some elk; you have to thin the herd.\n  Like a lot of government solutions, the solution was, well, maybe we \nshould hire Federal sharpshooters and then have helicopters we would \nhire to haul the meat out of the national park.\n  I said: I don't understand at all how you could think about that. \nThere are plenty of people who are qualified hunters who would be happy \nto volunteer their time to thin the elk herd. You do not need Federal \nsharpshooters. You do not need helicopters. All you need is a barrel \nfull of common sense.\n  So because we could not get that done, I put a piece in this Interior \nappropriations bill when we did it in the subcommittee, and all of a \nsudden everyone got serious about negotiating on how to do this. Kudos \nto the Interior Secretary and his staff. We have reached an agreement \nin principle now, and the Park Service has a proposal that it has set \nforth. My expectation is that this going to be solved in the right way. \nSo we withdrew this provision from because we do not need it.\n  We have an agreement in principle, to use qualified North Dakota \nvolunteers, deputized by the National Park Service, who will, under the \nguidance of the Park Service, thin the elk herd. We do not need to \nspend a lot of money doing it. All we need to do is just use some \ncommon sense, and that is exactly what we are doing.\n  I understand we have a circumstance where there is not quote, \nhunting, unquote, in national parks. So the first blush on all this \nwas: Well, we can't do what you suggest, Senator Dorgan. We just can't \ndo it. We are restricted.\n  Well, the fact is, we are going to use volunteers in a way that is \nconsistent with both the law and common sense. We are not going to \nspend your money hiring sharpshooters. We are not going to spend your \nmoney hiring helicopters. We are going to do this the right way. It is \nnot opening up a hunting season. It is just empowering qualified \nhunters, under the guidance of the Park Service, with the coordination \nof the State's game and fish department, to work as volunteers and do \nwhat we should just do. It is just a deep reservoir of common sense.\n  I am proud we have finally gotten that done. I know it is not the \nbiggest issue in the world, but do you know what. There are a whole lot \nof folks in North Dakota who read about these ``sharpshooters'' and \n``helicopters'' who said: Are you nuts? What are you thinking about? \nThat is what got me involved. I understand, this does not meet the test \nat all. But now we have gotten it done, and we have the right solution.\n  So I want to thank Senator Feinstein and Senator Alexander. I thank \nthe Interior Department for seeing a way to do this. There is a right \nway and a wrong way. They saw the right way to do it, and I think it \nwill be helpful to the American taxpayer. It will get the job done by \nthinning that elk herd and saving some money and giving some folks an \nopportunity to volunteer to serve their government.\n  So I wanted to mention that today and thank the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I want to thank the Senator from \nNorth Dakota, and tell him that misery loves company because in \nCalifornia we had a similar situation with the Point Reyes National \nSeashore Park, where there were growing numbers of whitetail deer, and \nthe Park Service proceeded to do a somewhat similar thing, shoot them, \nand I believe in helicopters shoot them. All the residents got very \nupset because this is not an isolated community, and they began to \ncall, and we worked out a solution--to use contraception, actually, to \ncull the herd.\n  But I do not know whether that is going to work. I think the Senator \npointed out a good situation where the Park Service has to be more \nsensitive when it does some of these things.\n  I thank the Senator for the efforts he has made--and successful ones.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Well, Madam President, I would only say that we have not \ndiscussed contraception for elk in the national park, but contraception \nwas once suggested for skunks in a wildlife refuge, and the question \nwas who was going to get close enough to the skunks.\n  But I think we have solved this issue in a way that is satisfactory \nand especially beneficial to the taxpayer. I appreciate the work of the \nSenator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I say to the Senator, thank you. I \nappreciated his work.\n  Madam President, I yield 10 minutes to the distinguished Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                  Commending Senator Edward W. Brooke\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Madam President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nCalifornia and the Senator from Tennessee for allowing me to make a \nbrief statement on a very important event that took place in this \nCapitol just yesterday.\n  I was privileged and deeply moved to witness a ceremony in the \nRotunda of this building at which Edward W. Brooke, the distinguished \nformer Republican Senator from Massachusetts, was honored with the \nCongressional Gold Medal.\n  This award, as you know, is the highest bipartisan award that \nCongress can bestow. The award to Republican Senator Brooke was the \nresult of legislation sponsored by two history-conscious Democrats: \nRepresentative Eleanor Holmes Norton of Washington, DC, and Senator Ted \nKennedy of Massachusetts, who served with Ed Brooke in the Senate for \nmany years.\n\n[[Page S10902]]\n\n  Senator Brooke was a trailblazer, a bridge builder, and a statesman. \nThe grandson of a slave, he grew up in a segregated neighborhood not \nfar from this Chamber. But he rose to become the first African American \nelected to the Senate.\n  I am proud, and the citizens of Massachusetts are proud, to have sent \nEd Brooke to Washington. We saw yesterday what our State saw in him \nlong ago: his strength, his wisdom, his decency, and his deep \ncommitment to meeting the needs of the American people.\n  Ed Brooke was elected as a Republican, but the people of \nMassachusetts did not see him as a strident party man. They saw him as \na great American and a model politician. They supported him because \nthey understood that difficult times require statesmen who can work \nacross party lines.\n  Returning to the Capitol yesterday, at the age of 90, Senator Brooke \nspoke powerfully about this Senate as a place where Members of both \nparties can and must work together for the common good. That was the \nspirit of the Senate in which Ed Brooke served. That was the spirit of \nthe Senate that Ted Kennedy embraced, and the spirit that led to \ncountless bipartisan accomplishments. It is a spirit we desperately \nneed to revitalize as we work our way through the needed reform and \nrepair of our broken health care system.\n\n  As an elder statesman of the Republican Party, this is what Senator \nBrooke said yesterday:\n\n       I'm here to tell you that politics is not an evil thing. \n     It's a good thing, and when used properly, it does good \n     things. I think of the awesome responsibilities of the House \n     of Representatives and the U.S. Senate in these years of \n     crisis. Three wars that we're in, and an economy that has \n     taken such a long time to turn around, and the lack of \n     adequate safe housing that we promised the Nation back in \n     1949, clear air and clear water, a health care bill.\n\n  Speaking to the Senate and to the House he went on:\n\n       You have awesome responsibilities. Not only this country, \n     but this world looks to you. When Republicans and Democrats \n     get together, they can do anything! And the country is \n     waiting for you to do anything. They just want relief. You \n     have that responsibility. You have that authority. You are \n     the people on Earth who are going to save this country and \n     save this world. Think about that. We have got to get \n     together. We have no alternative. There is nothing left. It \n     is time for politics to be put aside on the back burner.\n\n  With those words, the several hundred people in the Chamber came to \ntheir feet and cheered and applauded.\n  Like Senator Brooke, I have the perspective of someone who has spent \nthe last few decades in private life. I can report that American \nfamilies are deeply troubled by the economic hardship of the present \nand by the uncertainty of the future. It gives them no comfort to see \nthe Senate so politically polarized and unwilling to come together in \ncommon cause without regard to politics to solve the critical problems \nbefore us.\n  As I said in my maiden speech in this Chamber 2 days ago, as the \nhealth care debate moves forward, we who are privileged to serve in \nthis historic body on both sides of the aisle have the opportunity and \nthe obligation to take the long view, to put partisan politics aside, \nand come together to seize this unique and critical moment in our \nhistory.\n  I have had the privilege in the past to serve as chairman of the \nDemocratic Party of the United States, so I am no stranger to partisan \npolitics. But I like to think I also know when it is time to put \npartisanship aside and work together.\n  As President Obama said yesterday, while we grace Senator Brooke with \nthis honor today, perhaps a better tribute to him would be to embrace \nthat spirit: to compete aggressively at the polls, but then work \nselflessly together to serve the Nation we love.\n  No words could serve as a better summons to the historic debate on \nhealth care that lies ahead of us. We are poised to enact the most \nsignificant domestic legislation since the civil rights era. I know \neach and every Senator has deeply held beliefs about how we can best \nreform our health care system and that those deeply held beliefs will \nsometimes collide. We should and we will have a vigorous debate in this \nChamber. But that debate should reflect a level of cooperation that is \nequal to the magnitude of what is at stake for American families. It \nshould reflect a spirit of teamwork and collaboration that we always \nsaw in statesmen such as Ed Brooke and Ted Kennedy. Our times, and our \nNation, demand nothing less.\n  I offer my sincere congratulations to Senator Brooke. I thank him for \nhis service to this country and his wise counsel to those of us who are \nserving in the Senate today.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the remarks of \nSenator Brooke at yesterday's Congressional Gold Medal ceremony printed \nin the Record. I commend them to my colleagues, and I yield the floor.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for your very warm welcome. I want the record to \n     show that I have turned on the sun since you came. \n     Politicians sometimes take credit for things they had \n     absolutely nothing to do with. But I'm proud, that after a \n     rainy entry into Washington, that the sun is shining and that \n     you will be able to enjoy this very beautiful city and this \n     magnificent structure, the Capitol of the greatest country in \n     the world. Majority Leader--Steny, how are you?\n       Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Minority Leader John \n     Boehner, and Minority Leader . . . oh you're back, thank you \n     for coming back, my dear friend, the Speaker of the House. \n     What a wonderful thing, to have the Speaker of the great \n     House of Representatives, a lady.\n       I think that's progress, and I don't think it will be long \n     before a lady will be the President of the United States.\n       Patrick, thank you for your kind words. It is very \n     wonderful that you came to share in this great moment of my \n     life. You know how I feel about your family, you know how \n     saddened I am that he's not on this platform today. In case \n     you didn't know it, he started this together with Eleanor \n     Holmes Norton. He called me one day and he said, Ed, come to \n     my office, I'd like to see you. I went to his office and he \n     said, we are introducing a bill to have you awarded the \n     Congressional Gold Medal. I was shocked, I was in awe, but \n     you can be sure I was pleased. Ted said don't you worry about \n     a thing, you don't have to talk to anybody, you don't have to \n     do a thing. I will do the Senate side, and Eleanor Holmes \n     Norton will do the House side. And it happened. He had to get \n     76 United States Senators as co-sponsors of the bill, and \n     poor Eleanor had to get only 290 Representatives to get it in \n     the House of Representatives. But they were dauntless, and \n     they went out and did their work, and before I knew it the \n     Senate had passed the bill, the House had passed the bill, \n     and I just got a call the other day that there was a debate \n     on the floor, Madam Speaker, in order to use the rotunda of \n     the Capitol for this occasion. And she said if you turn on C-\n     SPAN, you'll see it. It will be a very spirited debate, and \n     it was, and the vote was 417 to nothing. And if that isn't \n     the way to win an election, I don't know what is. It's never \n     been very easy.\n       This would be a perfect day for me in my life, if it \n     weren't for the fact that my friend, my senior Senator, \n     though he was much younger than I, would be here on this \n     occasion. We don't control life and death, and we couldn't \n     control Ted, or he would still be with us. But I am really \n     honored to have with us on this occasion his wonderful wife \n     Vicki, who has been such a wonderful person.\n       And to have my family, and my wife of 37 years, who's given \n     me the best years of my life. My son and daughters, step-\n     daughters, and grandchildren, so many aunts and cousins, I \n     can't even begin to name you because it would take too long \n     and the time the Speaker has given to this and the time the \n     other members of the Senate and the House, I can't intrude \n     upon their job.\n       This is a heady thing for me, it would be for anybody. I \n     love this country, since the day I was born. And I was born \n     here in the nation's capital, on October the 26th, 1919. Most \n     of you weren't there at that time. And I'm here to tell you \n     that politics is not an evil thing. It's a good thing and \n     when used properly it does good things. I think of the \n     awesome responsibilities of the House of Representatives and \n     the United States Senate in these years of crisis. Three wars \n     that we're in, and an economy that has taken such a long time \n     to turn around, and the lack of adequate safe housing that we \n     promised the nation back in 1949. Clear air and clear water, \n     a health care bill--which I'm sure none of you want to hear \n     about on this occasion. I'll give you at least a break from \n     it. And I would not be presumptuous to tell you what to do, \n     because I'm sure you don't know what you're going to do \n     yourselves. You have awesome responsibilities. Not only this \n     country, but this world looks to you. I was happy when you \n     told me just a few minutes ago, Madam Speaker, that the \n     Republicans and the Democrats played ball last night, and \n     they played the Capitol Police. That was an awesome \n     responsibility in and of itself. And that you won! It only \n     meant to me that when Republicans and Democrats get together \n     they can do anything!\n       And the country is waiting for you to do anything. They \n     just want relief. You have that responsibility, you have that \n     authority. You are the people on earth that are going to save \n     this country and save this world. Think about that. Now we \n     can worry about discouragement, what is it, when you can't \n     stand the heat, get out of the kitchen? We can't\n\n[[Page S10903]]\n\n     worry about that, Mitch McConnell, we can't worry about those \n     things. We can't worry that you all can't get to that. We've \n     got to get to it. There's nothing left. It's time for \n     politics to be put aside on the back burner.\n       And we must lead by example and not by force. Security is \n     foremost. This nation must always be strong militarily, if \n     for no other reason than to protect itself. It's got to come \n     first. And we've got to know how to use it. We got to use our \n     diplomacy more and more and more. We've got to avoid these \n     perils before they come before us, and then it takes too \n     long. We can't keep fighting wars. We've got hungry people to \n     feed, homeless people, homeless and ill-housed people to \n     shelter, and young people to be educated. And so, on this \n     occasion, I applaud the Congress for what it has done. Our \n     three branches of government, as wonderfully founded by our \n     Founding Fathers, our legislative branch is as strong as it \n     wants to be. There is nothing that Congress can do that it \n     can't correct. They have the power to do it. The President is \n     powerful, but he has oversight of the Congress of the United \n     States. We are part of that. And the judiciary must never \n     politicize the Supreme Court and the Judiciary system. As \n     Eleanor Holmes said, and I don't want to minimize this honor \n     at all, but when she first told me that I got it I said \n     Eleanor, I'll exchange the honor if the Congress will pass \n     the voting rights act for the District of Columbia.\n       You know, Eleanor said one day, she called me when I turned \n     80. I was still playing tennis and riding horses in Virginia \n     and living the life. My mother, bless her heart, lived to \n     100. She said to me, ``keep moving, don't stop.'' But I \n     wasn't feeling too well. Eleanor called me one day when I \n     wasn't feeling too good. And I told her I didn't feel so well \n     and didn't know if I would make it. And she said to me, \n     ``Senator, you can't die before the Congressional Gold \n     Medal.'' So I kept my political promise to her.\n       Thank all of you. I wish I could call all of you by name \n     and give you a hug and kiss you. You are all my friends and \n     you are a part of my family and I love all of you. And I wish \n     all of that could happen, but obviously it can't. I want you \n     to know I am appreciative that you have come these distances \n     to be with me on this occasion.\n       I'm going to conclude with the words of Him that I recite. \n     My staff will tell you, and I had the best staff in the \n     world, I know all of you think so, but they've been \n     wonderful. ``God of justice save the people from the wars of \n     race and creed, from the strife of class and friction, make \n     our nation free indeed. Keep her faith in the simple man \n     stronger than when she became, until she finds her full \n     fruition in the brotherhood of man.''\n       Madam Speaker, Leaders of the Congress, Members of the \n     Congress, my old colleagues, family and friends, I accept \n     this honor with the deepest humility and everlasting \n     gratitude.\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I rise in support of the Department of \nthe Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act for \nfiscal year 2010 and to speak on the conference report language \nregarding hydraulic fracturing.\n  America's oil and natural gas industry is an important driver for the \nnational economy. A recent study reveals this industry supports more \nthan 9 million jobs and accounts for roughly 7.5 percent of the U.S. \ngross domestic product.\n  Developing untapped resources could add further value to the U.S. \neconomy and aid in economic recovery. According to a recent ICF \ninternational study, developing areas that are currently or were \nrecently off limits could generate $1.7 trillion for Federal, State, \nand local governments over the life of the resource, as well as \ncontribute 160,000 jobs by 2030.\n  As our country moves towards a new energy future, oil and natural gas \nwill continue to play a key role in our Nation's energy supply for \nyears to come. According to the Energy Information Administration, \nenergy demand will grow by 9 percent between 2007 and 2030. More than \nhalf of this demand is expected to be met by oil and natural gas, as is \nthe case today.\n  How will the U.S. meet this growing demand? There are significant \nresources available to recover here at home. The Bakken formation in \nNorth Dakota, Montana, and South Dakota is estimated by USGS to contain \nup to 4.3 billion barrels of oil--a 25-fold increase compared to \ngovernment estimates from 30 years ago.\n  In my home State of Louisiana, the recent development of the \nHaynesville shale formation will also contribute to supply the growing \ndemand. Experts estimate that there is 250 Tcf of recoverable gas in \nthe Haynesville shale. Last year, the U.S. consumed 23 Tcf, which means \nthere is enough gas in just the Haynesville shale to supply the U.S. \npopulation for 11 years.\n  On July 28, 2009, the New York Times reported: ``Nobody knows for \ncertain how big an area the Haynesville Shale covers--no government \nentity has mapped it. But energy companies and experts say it is large, \npossibly the largest in the lower 48 states, with an estimated 250 \ntrillion cubic feet of recoverable gas. It is up to 13,000 feet \nunderground, extending into East Texas.''\n  In addition, a recent study estimates that primarily due to the \nrecent shale gas developments across the country, the U.S. has roughly \na 100-year supply of natural gas reserves. The study was conducted by \nthe Potential Gas Committee--a group of academics and industry experts \nsupported by the Colorado School of Mines. This represents a 35 percent \nincrease in reserves versus a couple years ago--the largest increase in \nthe history of reports from the Committee.\n  However, these resources are not a guaranteed supply for the U.S. \neconomy. Both the Bakken formation and the large new natural gas shale \ndeposits--found in the Marcellus, Barnett, Haynesville, and other shale \nplays across the country--are developed using a combination of \nproduction technologies such as hydraulic fracturing and horizontal \ndrilling.\n  Unfortunately, some opponents of oil and natural gas production are \nattempting to prevent the use of hydraulic fracturing. This could have \nsignificant impacts on the future of shale gas and oil production. A \n2006 government-industry study found that 60-80 percent of the wells to \nbe drilled in the next decade will require hydraulic fracturing.\n  This technology can be used safely in an environmentally responsible \nmanner. Hydraulic fracturing has been around for roughly 60 years. \nCurrent industry well design practices provide multiple levels of \nprotection between any sources of drinking water and the production \nzone of an oil and gas well.\n  The conference report to H.R. 2996 proposes an EPA study of hydraulic \nfracturing's impacts on drinking water supplies. It is important to \nnote that EPA studied this issue in 2004 and concluded ``the injection \nof hydraulic fracturing fluids . . . pose little or no threat to \n(underground drinking water).'' Any new study must be conducted in a \ncomprehensive, scientific, credible, and transparent manner. It should \ninclude a review of other existing studies regarding hydraulic \nfracturing and its potential impacts, and it should involve interested \nstakeholders during key stages of the study.\n  Hydraulic fracturing can play a major role in our energy future, and \nthis technology can continue to be used in a responsible manner. I urge \nEPA to undertake this study in a responsible manner.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise in support of the Department \nof the Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Act \nfor 2010. This legislation will help our Nation perform a variety of \nvital functions that serve to protect the Nation's environment, \nproperly manage its natural resources and provide funding for critical \nwater infrastructure projects. The bill will fund the activities of a \nnumber of important initiatives such as the Clean Water and Drinking \nWater State Revolving Loan Fund, the Great Lakes Restoration \nInitiative, and the Diesel Emissions Reduction Act. This bill will help \nto ensure that we wisely spend our Federal monies in the most effective \nand efficient manner possible.\n  In particular, I would like to address the specific language in the \nconference report addressing the request for a study regarding the use \nof hydraulic fracturing, an extremely important tool that will help us \nunlock the vast potential of our own domestic oil and gas supplies. As \nwe all know, it is in the best interests of our Nation to become more \nenergy secure and to reduce our reliance on foreign oil supplies. \nHarmful reliance on foreign supplies can certainly have adverse \nnational security and economic implications for our country. No country \ncan remain a leading player in the community of nations if it must \nincreasingly rely on other nations for one of the bedrock elements of \nits economy. Current events compel us to proceed forward with the \nefficient development of our own domestic energy resources. Our \ncontinued economic prosperity, as well as the national security of the \ncountry itself, depends on the development of clean, secure and \naffordable energy supplies such as natural gas.\n\n[[Page S10904]]\n\n  One of the most significant ways to help us tap our natural gas is \nthrough the use of hydraulic fracturing. Hydraulic fracturing is a \ntechnique that has been commonly used in industry for many decades to \nallow our gas reserves below ground to move freely from the rock pores \nwhere it is trapped to a producing well that can readily bring the gas \nto the surface. This technique is particularly used to help us tap the \nvast potential of our unconventional gas supplies in the United States, \nincluding tight geological formations like some coalbeds, sandstones \nand shales where huge amounts of gas presently are located. To obtain \nthis gas, a well is drilled into this area and a fracturing fluid, \nusually consisting primarily of water and sand. This highly-reliable \nand cost-effective technology was developed in the late 1940s and has \nbeen continuously improved and applied since that time.\n  Hydraulic fracturing will undoubtedly play an important role in our \nfuture energy plans. Hydraulic fracturing will help us to develop our \nvast potential of oil and gas supplies more efficiently and will allow \nus to develop many resources that we would not otherwise be able to \nretrieve. Application of hydraulic fracturing to increase recovery is \nestimated to account for 30 percent of U.S. recoverable oil and gas \nreserves and has been responsible for the addition of more than 7 \nbillion barrels of oil and 600 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to \nmeet the Nation's energy needs. The National Petroleum Council \nestimates that 60 to 80 percent of all the wells drilled in the next \ndecade to meet natural gas demand will require fracturing.\n  In 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency issued a report on \nhydraulic fracturing which the Agency characterized as the most \nextensive study of the technique ever performed. That study focused on \nhydraulic fracturing of coalbed methane wells, which was viewed as a \n``worst case'' scenario in terms of the potential impacts on drinking \nwater aquifers because hydraulic fracturing of these coalbed methane \nwells tends to take place at shallower depths than hydraulic fracturing \nof shales or other types of formations. This study carefully \ninvestigated all of the facts of hydraulic fracturing and was \nextensively reviewed by numerous EPA offices, other Federal agencies, a \npanel of technical experts and members of the public. Based on its \ninvestigation, this study again confirmed that there is no evidence \nthat hydraulic fracturing has resulted in the contamination of drinking \nwater supplies and that this technique poses little threat to human \nhealth and the environment.\n  In light of this work, the Congress reaffirmed in the Energy Policy \nAct of 2005 that hydraulic fracturing should not be regulated as \nunderground injection under the Federal Safe Drinking Water Act except \nin very limited circumstances. Federal regulation would not result in \nany additional environmental benefits and could impose unnecessary \nburdens on the use of this critical technology that would impede \ndevelopment of our domestic energy resources.\n  This new study that Congress is requesting of the Environmental \nProtection Agency is intended to review the risks, if any, that \nhydraulic fracturing poses to drinking water sources. Just like the \nAgency's prior study, this study should be conducted using a \nsystematic, scientific approach that assures transparency, validity, \nand accuracy. The study should be based on accepted quality assurance \nguidelines to ensure that the information on which the study is based \nis of sufficient quality to support the study's conclusions. It should \nbe properly peer-reviewed by qualified experts in accordance with \nstandard practices, and should also draw on the expertise of those both \ninside and outside the Federal Government who can contribute relevant \ninformation to a high quality study. These contributors should include \nother appropriate Federal agencies as well as the State regulators who \nhave many years of experience with hydraulic fracturing. This study \nshould eventually be made available for review and comment by \ninterested members of the public prior to being finalized.\n  At the same time, since we have already studied hydraulic fracturing, \nit would be prudent for any proposed study to fully take into account \nother studies that have already been undertaken by Federal or State \ngovernmental agencies, councils, commissions, or advisory committees. \nFor example, given the significant effort associated with the Agency's \nprior 2004 study, it would certainly be prudent to fully consider this \nstudy in undertaking any further examination of hydraulic fracturing. \nThe 2004 study spent a considerable amount of time examining the \nhydraulic fracturing process, including the depth at which hydraulic \nfracturing activities take place as compared to the much shallower \ndepths of drinking water aquifers, the physical characteristics of the \nrock formations that separate the zones targeted for oil and gas \nproduction and the drinking water aquifers and the creation of \nfractures during the hydraulic fracturing process.\n  Finally, and perhaps most importantly, the study should be based on \nwell-recognized principles of risk assessment to determine whether \nthere is any realistic risk that individuals may be exposed to \nsubstances used in the hydraulic fracturing process at levels that \ncould possibly be considered harmful.\n  I believe that a targeted study of hydraulic fracturing is the most \nefficient way to use our resources to accomplish the goals of this \nstudy. We need to continue to develop our domestic energy resources, \nincluding clean-burning natural gas. A focused approach to the study \nwill allow us to address concerns about hydraulic fracturing while \nfacilitating the continued use of this critical technology.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I want to thank Chairman Feinstein for her \nwork on this bill.\n  I appreciate the attention that she has given to a number of key \ninvestments, particularly funding for the state revolving funds for \nsewer and drinking water infrastructure, which I have strongly \nsupported. These investments are not just a matter of improving public \nhealth and environmental quality; they are a matter of job creation, \nwhich is all important at this time.\n  I am concerned, however, about a provision that was included at the \ninsistence of the House of Representatives that will exempt certain \nvessels on the Great Lakes from regulation under a proposed EPA rule \ndesigned to limit emissions from marine diesel engines. I know that \nthis provision is not one that was advanced by Chairman Feinstein, and \nI appreciate her efforts to prevent a larger exemption than is in this \nbill.\n  Although the exemption included in this bill is limited to 13 \nvessels, the impact on public health has not been explained. In \naddition, the conference report includes language that encourages EPA \nto adopt additional exemptions for vessels on the Great Lakes in its \nfinal rule. As a result, I am alarmed about the potential impact on air \nquality in downwind States, like Rhode Island, which, I must note, will \nbe required to comply with EPA's regulations on marine diesel engines.\n  Representing a State that has an unfortunately high unemployment \nrate, I have great sympathy for those who called for this exemption on \nthe basis of potential economic impact on a local industry. On the \nother hand, my constituents bear the environmental and health burdens \nthat come from pollution that originates from the Midwest.\n  Last week, the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, \nNESCAUM, which represents air quality agencies in Rhode Island, \nConnecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont, wrote to \nexpress its deep concern about any effort to delay or limit EPA's \nregulations on marine diesel engines based on the potential \nenvironmental impacts and the impacts on international efforts to \nreduce emissions from marine engines. I will ask that this letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  I would hope that after a more thorough deliberation we will have a \nchance to revisit this issue and provide appropriate protection to \ndownwind States.\n  Again, I appreciate the efforts of the chairman to limit the reach of \nthis provision and for the important investments she has made in this \nbill. I am grateful for her leadership and am honored to serve with \nher.\n\n[[Page S10905]]\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the letter to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management,\n                                     Boston, MA, October 21, 2009.\n     Sen. Jack Reed,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reed: The Northeast States for Coordinated Air \n     Use Management (NESCAUM) has recently learned of an effort to \n     attach a rider to the FY 2010 Interior and Environment \n     Appropriations Bill that would have the effect of delaying or \n     limiting the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) \n     ability to reduce air pollution from large marine vessels \n     that operate in domestic waterways. NESCAUM is the \n     association of eight northeastern state air pollution \n     programs that includes Rhode Island along with Connecticut, \n     Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, \n     and Vermont. Consistent with our mission to protect and \n     enhance air quality in the Northeast, NESCAUM opposes \n     attempts to use the federal appropriations process to \n     obstruct EPA's efforts to reduce emissions from large marine \n     vessels.\n       Air pollution is not confined to state boundaries. Through \n     long-range transport in the atmosphere, pollutants emitted in \n     domestic waters, such as the Great Lakes, affect air quality \n     in the Northeast. We point out that one of our member states, \n     New York, has the third longest shoreline among the Great \n     Lakes states. The fuel controls proposed by EPA will \n     significantly reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen \n     oxides (NOX), which contribute to ground-level \n     ozone (smog), particulate matter, and acid rain. As a result, \n     the Northeast will realize significant public health and \n     other environmental benefits from implementing EPA's proposed \n     rule not only in the Northeast's local waters, but in upwind \n     waters as well.\n       In addition to the negative public health and environmental \n     implications, a special exclusion for vessels predominantly \n     operating in domestic waters sends the wrong message to the \n     international community regarding the U.S. commitment to \n     reduce emissions from ocean going vessels. The governments of \n     the United States and Canada have applied to the \n     International Maritime Organization (IMO) for designation of \n     their coasts as an Emission Control Area (ECA). The ECA \n     designation establishes stringent controls for fuel sulfur \n     and engine NOX emissions for all ships, foreign \n     and domestic, operating in coastal waterways. A significant \n     change in U.S. policy at this critical juncture of the ECA \n     application process, as signaled by such a rider to an \n     appropriations bill, could jeopardize the standing of U.S.-\n     Canadian application before the IMO. We should approach the \n     IMO with ``clean hands'' by demonstrating our commitment to \n     do for ourselves what we are asking others to do for us as \n     well.\n       For these reasons, we urge you to oppose the impending \n     rider to the FY 2010 Interior and Environment Appropriations \n     Bill. Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Arthur N. Marin,\n                                               Executive Director.\n\n   Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I support many of the provisions in \nthe Interior appropriations conference report, including the amendment \nI passed to allow the Federal Government to partner with private \nentities to develop new biofuels technologies. This provision is part \nof my E4 Initiative to promote the economy, employment, education and \nenergy, and it will help us to find ways to break our addiction to oil, \nwhile also spurring job creation and enhancing rural development. The \nbill also includes funding for many other important programs that I \nsupport, including full funding for the new Great Lakes Restoration \nInitiative, as well as money for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, \nState wildlife grants, national wildlife refuges, and the Clean Water \nand Drinking Water State Revolving Funds, and funding to assist \nAmerican Indian tribes through the Indian Health Services and tribal \nlaw enforcement programs.\n  I cannot vote for the bill, however, because it includes a continuing \nresolution, added in conference, that provides money to continue the \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan. While I am pleased that the President has \ncommitted to withdrawing our troops from Iraq by the end of 2011, this \nredeployment schedule is too long and may undermine our ability to \ncombat al-Qaida while straining our Armed Forces unnecessarily. In \naddition, while the President is right to focus on Afghanistan and \nPakistan, I remain concerned that his strategy for those countries does \nnot adequately address, and may even exacerbate, the global threats to \nour national security posed by al-Qaida.\n  We need to keep the Federal Government operating and make sure our \nbrave troops get all the equipment and supplies they need, but we \nshould not be providing funds to continue those wars without, at a \nminimum, engaging in a serious debate about their effects on our \nnational security.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I regret that I must vote in opposition to \nthe fiscal year 2010 Interior Appropriations conference report. There \nare too many objectionable provisions--and spending levels are too \nhigh--for me to vote yes.\n  The Interior appropriations in this bill total 17 percent more than \nlast year's level. That compares to an increase of 5 percent for \nHomeland Security functions and approximately 3.7 percent for Defense. \nAt that level, the military will not even be able to recapitalize \nequipment used during the wars, or procure new modern equipment.\n  Consider some of the other spending increases provided in this bill: \nthe Environmental Protection Agency will receive a 35 percent increase \nfor fiscal year 2010. The National Gallery of Art will receive a 36 \npercent increase, for a total funding level for fiscal year 2010 of \n$167 million.\n  Another concern I have involves wildland fire funding. During \nconsideration of the fiscal year 2010 Interior bill, Senator Barrasso \nand I offered an amendment to prohibit $2.8 million in wildland fire \nfunds from being spent in the District of Columbia for festivals and \nthe Mayor's Green Job Corps program. Clearly, neither of these programs \nis fire related. The amendment was adopted, yet the Interior \nAppropriations conference report does not include the amendment. \nInstead, it allows these much needed fire dollars to go to a city that \nhas never experienced a wildfire and does not have any national forest \nland.\n  While sensible provisions like the Barrasso/Kyl wildland fire \namendment were struck from this conference report, other problematic \nprovisions, that were not part of either the House or the Senate bill, \nwere airdropped in. The Interior conference report now includes Davis-\nBacon requirements for projects funded through the Clean Water Act and \nthe Drinking Water Act Revolving Fund. EPA has not applied Davis-Bacon \nrequirements to infrastructure projects funded through the State \nrevolving funds since its authorization expired in 1995. In addition, \nthe Act made it clear that Davis Bacon was limited in its application \nto water infrastructure projects constructed in whole or in part before \nOctober 1, 1994 with funds ``directly made available by'' \ncapitalization grants. Davis-Bacon requirements have been found to \nincrease the cost of these projects dramatically. This is a major \npolicy issue that should be fully debated on the floor instead of being \nadded to an appropriations bill behind closed doors.\n  Another provision of concern is the newly added exemption from Clean \nAir standards for steamships operating on Great Lakes. Whether or not \nit is a good idea to exempt the steamships, it is just another example \nof provisions being added in conference even though no similar \nprovisions were included in either the House or the Senate bill.\n  I do support the continuing resolution that is included. For my part, \nI would have extended the CR beyond December 18. It would hold spending \nto fiscal year 2009 levels.\n  The bill also allows the limit on loans backed by the Federal Housing \nAdministration, FHA, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to remain as high as \n$729,750 in high cost markets through 2010. While the intent is to \nensure that homebuyers can get government-backed financing, there are \nunintended consequences that we have to consider. By increasing the \nnumber of homebuyers who can qualify for government loans, we are in \neffect exposing these government entities and taxpayers to more \nliabilities. The FHA's loss reserve fund, for instance, is estimated to \ncover only 3 percent of all FHA loans. If delinquencies continue at the \ncurrent rate and cause the reserve fund to fall below the 2-percent \nthreshold set by Congress, another government bail-out may be on the \nhorizon.\n  This bill also contains a provision that purports to prohibit the use \nof funds for the transfer of Guantanamo Bay detainees to the United \nStates or its territories. The problem with the restriction is that it \ncontains a rather significant loophole: It would permit the use of \nfunds appropriated by this\n\n[[Page S10906]]\n\nbill to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the United States for the \npurposes of trial. We do not need to bring detainees to the United \nStates for trial. Congress has established military commissions for the \nexpress purpose of prosecuting these detainees, and these military \ncommissions can be convened in the place of detention.\n  There are very good reasons why this bill should deny funding for \npre-trial transfer and require instead that detainees be tried in \nmilitary commissions outside the country. First, if detainees are \nbrought to the United States, even for detention and trial, it \nincreases the chance they may be released into the country. Officials \nfrom the Obama administration have acknowledged that detainees present \nin the United States likely have more rights including constitutional \nrights than those held outside the country. Second, past public \ncriminal trials of terrorists, namely the Blind Sheikh and Ramzi Yousef \ntrials, have compromised U.S. intelligence information on al-Qaida. \nThird, importing al Qaeda terrorists into U.S. domestic prison \nfacilities would provide them access to a prisoner population that FBI \nDirector Mueller has identified as particularly vulnerable to extremist \nrecruitment. And finally, the logistics of the Zacarias Moussaoui \ncriminal trial are not something we should foist upon local officials \nnumerous times over. During his trial in Alexandria, VA, the Washington \nPost described the city as a ``virtual encampment.''\n  Military commissions are fair to the accused and they are the \nappropriate forum for prosecuting detainees who are being held at \nGuantanamo. Indeed, in the defense authorization bill, the Senate went \non record that the appropriate forum for bringing to justice combatants \nis military commissions, not civilian courts. By permitting the \ntransfer of detainees to the United States for trial, this bill ignores \nnot only the clear import of legislative enactments, but also the \nsignificant practical problems of prosecuting terrorists in the United \nStates.\n  Finally, I would caution that including $382 million for climate \nchange-related activities seems premature, given that the Senate has \nnot yet even taken up climate legislation.\n  There are some good items in the bill that I should mention. First, \nthe forest provisions. The bill includes $2 million for the Southwest \nEcological Restoration Institutes, with $1.5 million going to the \nEcological Restoration Institute, ERI, as is authorized by law and \nincluded in the President's budget. The Institute's program is \nimportant to providing the best available science to restore western \nforests and protect communities from unnaturally severe wildfires on a \nlandscape scale.\n  In addition, the bill tries to address the Forest Service and \nDepartment of the Interior wildfire cost overruns that have lead to \nborrowing from their other programs to cover wildfire costs. Of note is \nthe instruction to the agencies to develop new methods that consider \nactual prior year expenditures for formulating fire suppression funding \nestimates as part of their fiscal 2011 budget request, instead of just \nusing the agency 10-year average. It also includes $474 million for two \nfunds that will cover the costs of the largest and most expensive \nwildfires.\n  Second, the bill includes language that begins to address \nenvironmental concerns raised about the administration's push for \nrenewable energy development on public lands. Specifically, the bill \nlanguage expresses concern about the effect renewable energy projects \nwill have on water resources. In addition, the language requires a \nreport from the Department of Interior and the Forest Service outlining \na strategic plan for renewable energy project development, and requires \nin that plan that impact on water resources be a part of any \nrecommendation for specific project areas. These provisions are \nparticularly important in western states where there are large amounts \nof public land and water supplies are limited.\n  It is unfortunate that I must cast a ``no'' vote today. As many know, \nInterior-related funds are critical to Arizona. But, too much spending, \nand too many ill-considered authorizing provisions, as I have outlined, \nforces me to vote no.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I rise today to talk about an issue \nof great importance to our Nation's energy supply and our ability to \ncontinue producing affordable and reliable domestic energy. In \nparticular, I would like to speak about a provision in the fiscal year \n2010 Department of Interior, Environment and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act conference report which pertains to a study on the \nuse of hydraulic fracturing, an extremely important tool that will \nenable us to unlock the vast potential of our domestic oil and gas \nsupplies.\n  Hydraulic fracturing is a critical technique used in producing \ndomestic oil and gas resources. Across the country, leaders are \nrecognizing the growing importance of natural gas to our Nation's \nenergy supply. Natural gas is the most abundant form of clean energy in \nthe United States. Natural gas, including gas from coal beds and other \nunconventional sources, is becoming an increasingly important energy \nsource for the United States. Most experts predict that demand for \nnatural gas is likely to increase dramatically in the next decade. The \nincreased production of natural gas will both enhance our energy \nsecurity and help us address the problem of carbon reduction.\n  The Interior appropriations conference report includes a provision to \nstudy the relationship between hydraulic fracturing and drinking water. \nIt is imperative that we ensure that any study conducted is based \nstrictly on facts and science. Specifically, any study must be \nconducted in a comprehensive, scientific, credible and transparent \nmanner. It must be based upon the best available science as well as \nindependent sources of information. Additionally, it should allow for \nstakeholder participation and should be conducted in coordination with \nstates and interstate regulator agencies. Finally, the study should \nseek input and participation from industry and be peer reviewed. This \nwill ensure that the study is credible and useful\n  I am confident that if properly conducted, the proposed study will \nclarify that the use of hydraulic fracturing will help to increase our \ndomestic resource potential while posing no environmental harm.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, pursuant to rule XLIV of the \nStanding Rules of the Senate, all congressionally directed spending \nitems contained in the Interior appropriations conference report are to \nbe disclosed. The Statement of Managers that accompanies this \nconference report does, in fact, contain tables which disclose the \nrequired information. In an effort, however, to go well beyond the \nletter of the rule and provide an additional level of transparency, I \nwould like to include in the Record supplemental information that will \nserve as further clarification with respect to some of these items. \nBecause of the way the information is presented at the request of the \nHouse of Representatives, the full amount of funding specified for a \nparticular project could, to some, be difficult to discern in those \ninstances where the item of congressionally directed spending is in \naddition to the amount contained in the President's budget request. The \nlist of items that I will place in the Record will make it easier for \nMembers to make the distinction between what was in the President's \nbudget and what is subject to disclosure under the rules of the Senate.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the following material \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n        Clarification of Congressionally Directed Spending Table\n\n       Bureau of Land Management--Land Acquisition: $1,000,000 \n     over budget, California Desert Wilderness (CA), Senator \n     Feinstein.\n       Fish and Wildlife Service--Land Acquisition: $6,900,000 \n     over budget, James Campbell National Wildlife Refuge (HI), \n     Senators Akaka and Inouye; $500,000 over budget, Red River \n     National Wildlife Refuge (LA), Senator Landrieu; $250,000 \n     over budget, Silvio O.

Madam President, the next vote will be the last vote this \nweek. When we complete the next vote, that will be the last vote for \nthe week. When we come in Monday, we are going to come in half an hour \nearly; that is, we are going to have a vote at 5 o'clock on Monday. We \nhave to do it at 5 o'clock so we can complete work before midnight the \nnext day. So everyone should be here no later than a quarter to 6 \nbecause we are going to have to close the vote at a quarter to 6. We \nhope we can work something out between now and then, that we will not \nhave to go the way we are planning on going.\n  The way things are now lined up, we are going to have unemployment \ncompensation that will have the amendment of Senator Isakson and the \namendment of Senator Bunning in it. We hope we can complete that \nbusiness and move on to other things next week.\n  I don't want to sound like the proverbial boy calling wolf, but there \nis a strong possibility--much more than 50 percent--that we will be in \nnext weekend. Remember, we only work 2 days, the 9th and 10th, and then \nwe are off the 11th, 12th, and 13th. I hope everyone will understand \nthat. There has been full notice given to everyone. I hope we can work \nsomething out and that will not be necessary. I will work with the \nRepublican leader to give everyone as much notice as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote and to lay \nthat motion on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nand that following my remarks Senator Casey be recognized for 10 \nminutes, followed by Senator Sessions, who would control up to 40 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Hearing no objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am going to spend a few minutes talking \nabout the bill we just passed. I decided to save my remarks so my \ncolleagues wouldn't miss their planes and trains and could get out of \nhere and not delay them prior to the vote.\n  I listened intently to Senator Sessions and his discussion prior to \nthe vote, and I wish to raise a word of caution for the American \npublic. What we just did in the Senate was to set the government on a \ncourse to double in 5 years. The size of the Federal Government will \ndouble in 5 years if we keep doing what we have been doing on \nappropriations bills. There is a 16.9-percent increase in this bill, \nwith a truly negative inflation rate as far as the\n\n[[Page S10908]]\n\nbasket for American people and how we look at that.\n  I had several amendments in the bill. All but one of them became \ncompromised after it came out. That is not necessarily the problem of \nSenator Alexander or Senator Feinstein. But what we have done in this \nbill is prioritize the environment over the violation of our borders. \nWe have hamstrung our Border Patrol, and the consequence of that is we \nare going to continue to see drugs, we are going to continue to see \nthese ``rape trees,'' through the bringing in illegally of people and \nthen the people being brought in illegally to the country being raped.\n  This bill had 540 earmarks--71 pages of earmarks. We had an amendment \nin the bill for competitive bidding. The language came out of the \nconference report that competitive bids would be applied to everybody \nexcept people with earmarks. The American people need to understand \nwhat that means. That means the well-heeled in this country who have a \nconnection to a Member of this body get a benefit, and so it doesn't \neven have to be competitively bid. That doesn't even address the \nquestion of whether it is a priority for the country. It addresses the \nquestion of whether we may be paying two or three times what we should \nbe paying, even if it is a good project.\n  So I raise the question, for the people who are listening, and I say \nthat what we are doing is wrapping a cord around ourselves and then \ntying the knot so we get to a point where we cannot fix what ails us. \nIf you look at the U.S. dollar and the lack of confidence, and you look \nat the meetings that have been going on by people who purchase our \ndebt, they are trying to create a new reserve currency. That is \nongoing. They do not deny it. What will happen to us is, we will be on \nan unsustainable course, where we can't pay the $800 billion of \ninterest in 10 years. That interest is based on an interest rate of 4 \npercent, not at zero percent today.\n  It could very well be that in 2019, the largest portion of the \nexpenditures of the Federal Government--well over 45 percent--will be \ninterest. What does that mean?\n  What does that mean to the average family in this country? What does \nthat mean to your children, Mr. President? What does that mean to my \ngrandchildren? What are the consequences?\n  Let me explain the conservative consequences and then I will finish. \nIf you take everybody alive in this country today who is under 20 and \nyou add everybody who is going to be born over the next 20 years--so we \nhave everybody who is under 40, 20 years from now--here is what they \nare going to owe. These are not my numbers. These are actuarial numbers \nthat have been certified. Every one of them is going to owe $1.119 \nmillion. They are either going to be responsible for that portion of \nthe real debt or that portion of the unfunded liabilities for which \nthey will never gain any benefit.\n  So ask yourself: If we keep doing what we just did in this body, what \nare we doing to our kids and our grandkids?\n  We are absolutely abandoning the heritage of this country, and we do \nit cavalierly. I mean, there were 28 votes against this 16-percent \nincrease on one bill. Only 28 votes. Only 28 Senators said a 16.9-\npercent increase in spending is too much, when most families' income \nhas declined by 3.7 percent this year.\n  We don't get it. I don't understand why we continue to do it. I am as \nfrustrated as the people outside this body. But I can tell you, there \nis a day of reckoning coming and not just for our country financially \nbut for the Members of this body. The American people are going to wake \nup, they are going to see we have mortgaged their future, their \nchildren's future, and their grandchildren's future, and they are going \nto say: Enough. The hope would be it will not be too late.\n  With that, I yield to the Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10908-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10908-S10909]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight to speak about health care \nand all the issues we have been debating under the broad umbrella of \nhealth care reform. Obviously, I will not get to all of them tonight, \nbut I am going to spend a few minutes talking about two general areas. \nOne is a list of changes that I believe will take place when our work \nis completed in the Senate and after what I hope will be President \nObama signing a bill on health care reform in a matter of weeks. That \nwill change what I believe has been an unfair burden carried by the \nAmerican people, at the expense of the American people but brought on \nby the power, sometimes the awesome power, of insurance companies. I \nwill talk about that, but also I want to speak mostly about changes \nthat need to be made in our health care system for children.\n  There are a couple of points on basic reform measures that I believe \nwill be part of what we complete in the next couple of weeks. First, a \nbasic list of consumer protections that we talked about for many years \nbut we have never made illegal will prevent insurance companies from \ncontinuing what is often blatant discrimination. One of the things we \nhave to do this year is end discrimination for preexisting conditions. \nIf what I believe is the prevailing point of view in this body is \nsuccessful, insurance companies will be prohibited from refusing you \ncoverage because of your medical history. Out-of-pocket costs will be \nlimited, as well as deductibles or copays.\n  Free preventive care: Why should we say on the one hand we encourage \nprevention, as we have for years, but now we are going to get serious \nabout prevention in our health care system and make it part of every \ninsurance policy and demand that we all engage in steps that will be \npreventive in nature and we also will say, for example, for a woman a \nmammogram is important but why, in the face of all of that, do we say \nto women in America, as is the current policy, that women have to pay \nexorbitant costs for mammograms? Frankly, I believe they should have to \npay nothing for something as essential to prevention. So preventive \ncare should be free or at a very low cost.\n  If you are seriously ill, an insurance company should be prohibited \nfrom dropping your coverage. We should make that practice illegal.\n  We should make gender discrimination illegal as it relates to \ninsurance companies. I find it hard to believe that in 2009 we have to \nlegislate to prevent insurance companies from discriminating against \nwomen, but we have to because that in fact happens today. Insurance \ncompanies will not be able to charge you more because you happen to be \na woman, as happens today.\n  Eliminating annual lifetime caps on coverage has to be part of the \nfinal health care legislation.\n  Extending coverage for young adults is critically important.\n  Guaranteed issue renewal: Insurance companies, I believe, should be \nrequired to renew any policy as long as the policyholders pay their \npremium in full and insurance companies will not be allowed to refuse \nto renew a policy because someone gets sick. If you get sick you should \nnot lose your coverage, and if you get sick you should not have to \nbankrupt your family to pay for the health care you deserve.\n  Finally on this list, and it is not an exhaustive list but I think it \nis an important list to review: protecting small businesses. Small \nbusinesses should receive tax credits so they can give their employees \ncomprehensive and affordable health care and include a limit on out-of-\npocket costs.\n  These are some of the basic consumer protections I believe we should \nenact as part of this health care legislation.\n  I also believe if you want to focus on a particularly vulnerable \ngroup of Americans, a group of Americans we have made some progress \nwith in terms of their coverage, though we have not done nearly enough \nyet, I speak of children. We have made tremendous progress with the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, for example, and also the children \nin America covered by Medicaid, so children have the opportunity to \nreceive very good care in almost every instance.\n  But there are still some problems. Even in a State such as \nPennsylvania, where you have, by last count, in a survey done in \nPennsylvania last year for the Insurance Department, it showed that \njust 5 percent of Pennsylvanians up to the age of 18 were uninsured. \nThat 5 percent is too high. We want to get that to zero, of course, but \nit is a lot lower than it would have been without the Children's Health \nInsurance Program or without other strategies.\n\n[[Page S10909]]\n\n  Unfortunately in our State, and I think it is true of most States, \nwhen you look at the age category 19 to 64, in that category the \nuninsured rate is more than double the uninsured rate for children. \nInstead of being 5 percent uninsured for children age 19 to 64, it is \n12 percent. In Pennsylvania what that means is, if you are between the \nages of 19 and 64, you are one of more than 870,000 Pennsylvanians who \nare uninsured. We cannot build an economy or improve our economy in \nPennsylvania if we have that many people uninsured for a long period of \ntime.\n  I still believe, even with the progress we have made on children, we \nhave much to do. For example, we have to do everything possible to \nincrease outreach and facilitate enrollment for low-income families and \nchildren. We should not have a program such as Children's Health \nInsurance, or Medicaid, and then make it hard for families to enroll. \nSo I led the effort in our HELP Committee this summer, even before we \nvoted on a bill, to make sure that enrollment is made easier. I worked \nvery closely with Senator Dodd, who long has been a champion for \nchildren and a strong advocate for children's health insurance.\n  We should also focus on the benefit packages related to pediatrics, \npediatricians. We had an amendment this summer in the HELP Committee \nthat Senator Merkley and I cosponsored, ensuring that a pediatric \nrepresentative would be part of any advisory commission to the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services regarding what should be in a \nbenefit package. It is very important to have a pediatric \nrepresentative at the table.\n  Another thing that is critical is to have a requirement that \npediatric preventive care be included in the list of mandatory \npreventive services that insurance plans offer with a minimum of cost-\nsharing requirements for families.\n  No. 4 on this list, in terms of what happens to children in pediatric \nsettings: In our committee bill we talked about medical homes--not a \nphysical place, but a way to provide treatment, that is the idea for \nevery American to have a primary care physician and then a network of \nspecialists around them they have access to. That is certainly the \nideal and the intent of a large part of the HELP Committee bill. Also \nit is important to remember that children are not just smaller adults \nor smaller versions of an adult; they have particular and special needs \nin terms of their treatment. So for children, their primary care doctor \nis a pediatrician and therefore pediatricians must be among those \npractitioners who are at the center of the care or the center of the \nmedical home that surrounds a child.\n  Also ensuring critical health care for children involving their oral \nhealth care: We ensured in the HELP Committee this summer the \nestablishment of an oral health care education prevention campaign at \nthe CDC focusing on preventive measures. We also increased funding for \ntraining for pediatric dentists in the bill we passed this summer out \nof the committee. It is critically important that children have access \nto that kind of health care in the early years of their life. We had a \ntragic, horrific example of what could go wrong when a child died here \nin the Washington region a couple of years ago--I believe actually the \nState of Maryland--when that child did not have access to a dentist and \nhad horrific problems which led to that child's death. As a result of \nchanges we make in our health care system, we must ensure that does not \nhappen.\n  Strengthening the pediatric workforce: Along with both Senator Brown \nand Senator Dodd, this summer in our HELP Committee bill we added a \nloan repayment program for pediatric specialists and providers for \nmental health services for children. We can't say that we care \nabout children and not build in these particular protections for them \nin our health care system. Part of that is a workforce issue. We heard \na lot in this debate about the shortage of primary care physicians. The \nintent of our bill in the HELP Committee was to make sure we would have \na building up, an increase, in the number of primary care physicians. \nAgain, for a child, his or her primary care physician is a pediatrician \nand it is critically important that pediatric specialists be available \nto children when they have special needs and special challenges that \nneed to be treated by a specialist.\n\n  I know I am over my time. I will conclude. One last point about the \nCHIP program: The Children's Health Insurance Program as we know is now \na stand-alone program. There were some efforts this past summer and \ninto the fall to have that program folded into any exchange that would \nbe created as a result of the health care legislation. I thought that \nwas a mistake. I made that very clear to others and to the Finance \nCommittee as we were debating it. Thank goodness, Senator Rockefeller \nworked so hard and led the fight to keep the Children's Health \nInsurance Program as a stand-alone program. We should not fix what \n``ain't broken,'' as the expression goes, and the Children's' Health \nInsurance Program works well for millions of children today. Within the \nnext couple of years, that program will cover 4 million children who \nwill be given access to the kind of care we would hope every child has.\n  I think all these changes I have talked about, and more, come under \nthe headline of ``No Child Worse Off.'' That should be, and will \ncontinue, I believe, to be one of the goals of health care reform. At \nthe end of this process no child in America, especially poor children \nand children with special needs, will be worse off.\n  We have a long way to go, lots more work to do. But if we are guided \nby that principle we will make sure our children have the kind of \nhealth care that we all hope for and they have a right to expect.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nlegislation before us to extend unemployment insurance benefits for \nmillions of out-of-work Americans. Families across this Nation are \nhurting, and 15.1 million Americans are currently unemployed. It is \nimperative that legislation to provide relief to those hardest hit by \nthe economic downturn is passed without further delay.\n  The Unemployment Compensation Extension Act of 2009 would: Extend \nunemployment insurance benefits by 14 weeks; and, provide an additional \n6-week extension for those living in States with unemployment rates of \n8.5 percent or higher, such as California.\n  This adds up to a 20-week extension of unemployment benefits for \nthose in the toughest job markets. The legislation is fully-offset, and \nwould not increase the deficit or national debt.\n  Congress last acted to temporarily extend unemployment insurance \nbenefits in November 2008. Additionally, the economic stimulus bill \nenacted in February increased benefits by $100 a month, providing much-\nneeded help to those struggling to make ends meet. But, the \nunemployment rate continues to rise. Jobless Americans need an \nextension of unemployment benefits, and they need it now.\n  As of September, the national unemployment rate stands at 9.8 \npercent--the highest in 26 years--263,000 jobs were lost last month, \nand 7.6 million have been lost since the recession began in December \n2007.\n  My home State of California has been hit particularly hard. The \nunemployment rate has risen to 12.2 percent, significantly higher than \nthe National average. The number of people unemployed in California as \nof September was 2,247,000.\n  There are 12 States with a smaller population than the number of \nunemployed Californians: Alaska, Delaware, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, \nMontana, North Dakota, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Vermont, and \nWyoming. Mr. President, 71,000 out-of-work Californians have already \nexhausted their unemployment benefits this month. According to the\n\n[[Page S10911]]\n\nCalifornia Employment Development Department--EDD, an estimated 170,000 \nCalifornians will exhaust their benefits by the end of 2009 if Congress \ndoes not act.\n  Not only are more workers losing their jobs, but it continues to be \nmore difficult for the unemployed to find work again. The number of \nAmericans who have been jobless for 6 months or longer has reached a \nrecord 5.4 million.\n  America has faced tough economic times before, including four periods \nof recession since 1980. During all of these recessions we see a \ndisturbing pattern: laid-off workers exhausting their unemployment \nbenefits. By the year's end, 1.3 million people across the nation will \nlose their unemployment insurance benefits, and 7,000 Americans are \nrunning out of benefits on a daily basis.\n  These are more than just statistics or numbers on a page. Every \npercentage, or data point, tells the story of another family impacted \nby downsizing, a factory shutting down, or a local small business \nforced to close its doors.\n  The numbers don't tell the full story of the pain, anxiety, and \nchallenges out-of-work Americans are facing. Here are some personal \nexamples from Californians who have written to my office.\n  A former Chemist from Solana Beach, California wrote:\n\n       I have a Masters in Chemistry in drug discovery and have \n     worked for 15 years in this manner. And though I apply almost \n     every day to any and all jobs I might be a candidate or hired \n     (including entry level positions in and out of my field, \n     waiter, grocery store, fast food, hardware store, etc) I have \n     only had two interviews in the last 3 months and worked 2 \n     weeks as a temp. No one wants to hire a Masters in Science \n     for an $8 per hour job even less in my traditional career. \n     Please vote yes to extend unemployment insurance.\n\n  A single mother from Rio Dell, California wrote:\n\n       Please, PLEASE do what you can to help with the Federal \n     extension for unemployment benefits. I will receive my final \n     check in a matter of days. I am a single mother who is barely \n     surviving and fear losing my place to live. I have already \n     received one eviction notice from my landlord due to paying \n     my rent late. I fear I will lose parental custody if I can't \n     keep a roof over our heads. I have carefully documented my \n     work search, but the hope of finding employment is dwindling \n     along with my hope of providing the most basic necessities \n     such as water, heat, and shelter as winter approaches. I live \n     in Rio Dell where the base rate for water and sewer was just \n     raised to $90 per month. I'm now a month behind. I don't have \n     a spouse or family to help me. I don't even have a car \n     anymore. I know I'm not the only one in this position, but it \n     is of little consolation. So please help. The farther a \n     person gets down, the harder the climb back up. We are in a \n     devastating situation that needs immediate attention and \n     reparation. I sincerely appreciate your time and \n     consideration.''\n\n  A former Postal Service employee from Grass Valley, California wrote:\n\n       Dear Ms. Feinstein, I am writing regarding the unemployment \n     extension. I am a single mother struggling to keep my \n     daughter clean, fed and in school. I was laid-off from the US \n     Postal Service and have been desperately looking for work \n     with no luck. Please urge your colleagues to pass this \n     legislation as soon as possible and then work on possible \n     inequities between the states. Thank you very much for your \n     time.\n\n  These are only a handful of the nearly 2,000 letters my office has \nreceived. It breaks my heart to read such stories, and I am sure that \nmany of my colleagues are hearing from constituents facing the same \ntough circumstances.\n  The situation for those in high unemployment states, such as \nCalifornia, is urgent, and, it is not just about preserving a social \nsafety net or helping those who have paid into the system while they \nwere employed. The unemployment crisis feeds the foreclosure crisis \nwhich leads to continued instability in the housing market which was \nthe catalyst for the economic downturn in the first place. Put another \nway, the longer this legislation is delayed, the longer our economic \nrecovery is delayed.\n  This extension is a targeted action that will quickly put money into \nthe hands of those who need it most, and are most likely to spend it \nimmediately on everyday necessities. According to Mark Zandi, chief \neconomist of Moody's Economy.com, every dollar spent on unemployment \nbenefits generates a return of $1.64. Given the gravity of the \nunemployment situation, we have an obligation to take responsible \naction. There is no time for further delay, or political gamesmanship.\n  Some will argue that we do not need to extend benefits again, but \nwith the increasing unemployment rate, more job losses, and the jobless \nstaying unemployed for longer periods, American families need a break. \nWe must address the underlying causes of the economic instability \nfacing our Nation. More incentives are needed to ease the flow of \ncredit to businesses and consumers. Special attention must be given to \nthe small businesses that in many communities are the primary engine \nfor job creation and economic development. But, the choice before us \ntoday with this legislation is clear.\n  We should pass this legislation now.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill to provide immediate \nassistance to out-of-work Americans and aid our Nation's economic \nrecovery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10911-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10911]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 40th \nanniversary of an event that is referred to as the ``birthday'' of the \nInternet.\n  On October 29, 1969, Dr. Leonard Kleinrock of the University of \nCalifornia, Los Angeles, and his team successfully transmitted the \nfirst message to their counterparts at Stanford University, led by Dr. \nDouglas Engelbart, via a network system that was the predecessor of \ntoday's Internet.\n  I wonder if Drs. Kleinrock and Engelbart ever imagined the full \nimpact and transformative nature of their experiment, not only on \nCalifornia and the United States, but also the world?\n  From those original tubes between UCLA and Stanford, the Internet has \ngrown into a global network, facilitating important communication, \ncommerce and services around the world. The Internet allows scientists \nto share research and findings. Consumers can shop almost anywhere in \nthe world via the Internet and have their purchases delivered to their \ndoorstep. Government services, from emergency information to \nregistration of motor vehicles, can be accessed through the Internet.\n  The Internet has also been an important economic engine for our \ncountry, and I am proud that my state of California has been home to \nmany innovators, such as Google and eBay, who transformed ideas into \nsuccessful multinational businesses.\n  This anniversary also serves to remind us of the importance of \ncollaborative research efforts between our government and universities, \nlike the UCLA and Stanford. The first network system used by Drs. \nKleinrock and Engelbart, called ARPANET, was developed through funding \nand collaboration between the universities and the Department of \nDefense.\n  Today, we must remember that universities and their researchers \nremain a vital resource in facing and solving the challenges of the \nfuture.\n  I want to close by congratulating the UCLA, Stanford University, and \nDrs. Kleinrock and Engelbart, for their hard work and contributions to \nthe development of the Internet over the years. Forty years after that \nfirst successful message, the Internet continues to transform our lives \nand the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10911-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10911-S10912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  REMEMBERING SENATOR CLIFFORD HANSEN\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the passing of \nClifford P. Hansen, a former Republican colleague of mine in the U.S. \nSenate and a devoted public servant whose contributions to this august \nbody and to his home State of Wyoming will not soon be forgotten.\n  Clifford Hansen, who was the Nation's oldest living former Senator \nuntil his passing this week at age 97, loomed as large on the Wyoming \npolitical landscape as his beloved Grand Tetons do on the natural one. \nThis onetime Governor of Wyoming and two-term U.S. Senator leaves an \nimpressive legacy of legislative achievement.\n  Clifford was born in Zenith, a town so small that it no longer \nappears on\n\n[[Page S10912]]\n\nState road maps. But growing up in Jackson, Clifford demonstrated the \nabilities and qualities needed to be successful in a wide variety of \npursuits and political endeavors. After earning a degree in agriculture \nfrom the University of Wyoming, he rose quickly through the ranks, \nserving as a trustee of his alma mater, a Teton County commissioner, \nand later, in the mid-1960s, as Governor of Wyoming.\n  As Governor, Clifford Hansen brought an end to laws banning \nmiscegenation, boosted the minimum wage, and secured higher retirement \npay for State workers, among many other things. He also increased fair \nemployment practices and secured more financial assistance for public \nschools and higher education. He then served two terms in the U.S. \nSenate and compiled an equally impressive list of accomplishments \nthere.\n  I had the privilege of meeting Clifford Hansen in 1977, when I came \nto Washington as a wide-eyed freshman Senator. I will never forget the \nwarmth and kindness Senator Clifford showed me, helping me get \nacclimated to my new surroundings and responsibilities. He was a \nconservative's conservative--a public servant of rock-solid integrity \nand unwavering devotion who believed in the time-honored principles of \nfiscal responsibility and less government. He was just as devoted to \nhis beloved wife of more than 75 years, Martha, and their two children, \nMary and Peter.\n  One of Senator Hansen's many gifts was his human touch. He always \ntreated everyone the same, no matter what their station in life--with a \nwarm smile, a hearty handshake, and unfeigned respect. No wonder he was \nso beloved by so many, everyone from Senate colleagues and staff to \ncustodial and cafeteria workers.\n  More than three decades after coming to Washington, I am still \nprivileged to serve in the Senate. And even though Clifford Hansen \nretired from the Senate in 1978, the years have not dimmed my memories \nof him and the high esteem with which I hold him. I cherish his memory \nand honor his service. And my thoughts and prayers at this difficult \ntime are with his beloved Martha and other family members and devoted \nfriends.\n  He will be missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10912-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL NUCLEAR PROGRAM WORKERS DAY\n\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, today I rise to honor nuclear weapons \nprogram workers and uranium miners, millers and haulers. Tomorrow, \nOctober 30, 2009, has been designated by Congress as a national day of \nremembrance for these workers and their families.\n  During the Cold War, these men and women served the United States by \nworking in the Department of Energy's nuclear plants, exposing \nthemselves to hazardous materials. As a result of this exposure, many \ndeveloped illnesses and sacrificed their well-being for the sake of our \nCold War victory.\n  This day of remembrance is particularly important to Kentuckians, \nbecause of men and women who have worked--and still work--for the \nPaducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in Paducah, KY, since 1952. During the \nCold War, this plant enriched the uranium for the weapons that kept \nAmerica safe. Back then, this plant provided jobs to a small town and \nhelped Paducah grow. What these workers did not necessarily know then \nwas that they were not just going to work for a paycheck, but they were \nsacrificing themselves to protect our national security. Now, during a \ntime of high unemployment, the plant continues to provide jobs by \ncleaning up the nuclear waste of the Cold War era.\n  Our Nation's nuclear workers have bravely served our country at a \ntime when we needed them most and they deserve to be honored. Today, I, \nalongside the Nation, recognize these fine men and women for the \nsacrifices they have made.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10912-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 AUTISM\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the following \nop-ed article written by Doug Flutie and printed in the Boston Globe on \nOctober 17, 2009, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Massachusetts may have the best health care in the country, \n     but it doesn't cover the treatment for the fastest-growing \n     health threat to children--autism. Autism affects brain \n     function and impairs communication, social interaction, and \n     sensory modulation skills. The most recent statistics show \n     that 1 in 91 children has autism, with the incidence four \n     times as high in boys. More than 500 babies born this year in \n     Massachusetts will soon be diagnosed with autism. What their \n     parents will learn first--what my wife, Laurie, and I have \n     learned from our son Dougie--is that while the hopes and \n     dreams for their child may change, they will also intensify. \n     Parents will learn that, with early intervention, children \n     with autism can make significant strides--a fact backed up by \n     extensive studies. They'll find that their pediatricians and \n     neurologists will prescribe intense one-on-one speech, \n     occupational, physical, and behavioral therapies. And then \n     they'll be dismayed to discover that, though they've always \n     paid their health care premiums, their health plans will not \n     cover these services.\n       Why don't health plans cover treatments for the fastest-\n     growing health threat to children? There is a contradiction \n     between the role of schools versus that of medicine and \n     health plans. Federal law stipulates that schools provide \n     services necessary to allow all children to ``access the \n     curriculum.'' While critical to helping children with autism \n     excel in the classroom, this in no way replaces their need \n     for therapy to improve long-term brain functioning--not only \n     to get through an average day, but to lay the foundation for \n     the rest of their lives. School superintendents are powerful \n     in asking health plans to step up to ensure that children \n     with autism, like all others, are sent to school ready to \n     learn. They expect health plans to provide glasses to \n     students with poor eyesight, or even chemotherapy to children \n     with cancer, so they have every right to expect that children \n     with autism will receive out-of-school autism therapy. \n     Foundations like The Doug Flutie Jr. Foundation for Autism \n     and Advocates for Autism of Massachusetts work hard to fill \n     the gaps in services and opportunities for children with \n     autism. We also work to make up for the absence of the lead \n     player in supporting the treatment of any medical condition: \n     health plans.\n       In the health plans' absence, parents are left to pay \n     privately or see their children go without autism therapies.\n       Those of us who can afford it (comfortably or through \n     extreme means) see the incredible difference these services \n     make in our children's ability to communicate, learn, \n     function as part of the family and the community, and simply \n     stay safe.\n       Those who can't afford it face the pain of being unable to \n     give their child services proven to radically improve their \n     developmental outlook.\n       Autism coverage isn't just the right thing; it's the \n     financially smart thing. This coverage will cost just $2.28 \n     per member per month. Alternatively, the average lifetime \n     cost for an adult with autism is estimated at $3.2 million. \n     Research shows that with effective early intensive \n     intervention up to 47 percent of individuals can lead \n     independent lives without state-funded supports. \n     Additionally, they will each make an estimated $1.7 million \n     contribution as taxpayers, bringing the actual savings of \n     autism coverage per person to $4.9 million. While not all \n     individuals will achieve this outcome, even moderate gains \n     result in significant savings to taxpayers.\n       The Legislature is considering a bill that requires health \n     plans to treat autism as a medical condition and pay for its \n     treatments. Fifteen states have already passed similar \n     legislation. This state needs to join them in ending \n     insurance discrimination against people with autism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10912-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10912]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           MICDS CELEBRATION\n\n Mr. BOND.

Please \njoin me in congratulating my three Senate colleagues and MICDS on 150 \nyears of shaping generations of leaders and preparing their students \nfor lives of purpose and service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10912-4", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10912-S10913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ANN HIGDON\n\n Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today I wish to congratulate Ms. Ann \nHigdon of Dayton, OH, who was recently awarded The Purpose Prize, \nsponsored by Civic Ventures, The Atlantic Philanthropies, and the John \nTempleton Foundation.\n\n[[Page S10913]]\n\n  The Purpose Prize recognizes socially engaged leaders over 60 who \nhave demonstrated that social innovation is not just a pursuit for the \nyoung.\n  Ann received this important award for her work with Improved \nSolutions for Urban Systems, an organization that helps Dayton-area \ndropouts earn diplomas while training for jobs in health care, \nconstruction, computer operations, and manufacturing.\n  Like too many young Ohioans today, Ann Higdon had to cope with the \nfeeling of helplessness while growing up. Homeless as a child, she had \nno love and little desire to learn.\n  She finished school, however, with the encouragement and kind words \nof just one teacher. Over the years, Ann has dedicated herself to \nmaking sure that young Ohioans receive the same inspiration she did.\n  I applaud Ann's vision and leadership as she helps bring hope to \ndisadvantaged youth in Ohio.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10913-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10913-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10913-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 1:52 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the Senate to the bill \n(H.R. 2996) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, \nenvironment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 2010, and for other purposes.\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  At 2:02 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker \nhas signed the following enrolled bill:\n\n       S. 832.

A bill to amend the Energy Policy Act of 2005 to require the \nSecretary of Energy to carry out a research and development and \ndemonstration program to reduce manufacturing and construction costs \nrelating to nuclear reactors, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the role \nnuclear energy can play in moving our country toward a more secure \nenergy future. For some, news that a Udall is speaking favorably about \nnuclear power will come as a stark and perhaps unpleasant surprise. But \nI also believe public and expert opinion on the risks and benefits of \nnuclear power has changed.\n  The environmental and energy security challenges that we faced in the \n1970s, when that decade closed in the shadow of Three Mile Island, have \nchanged significantly. When my father Mo Udall campaigned for President \nin the New Hampshire primary in 1976--and the Presiding Officer \nremembers that era--and when he was asked about the controversial \nSeabrook nuclear facility, no one had climate change on their list of \nenvironmental concerns.\n  Today, more than 30 years on, we have a less parochial and more \nglobal view about the challenges of energy security, climate change, \nand the problems associated with carbon-based energy production.\n  Given the economic, national security, and environmental threats our \ncurrent energy system creates, we need a comprehensive and cleaner \nnational energy policy. In this regard, clearly, nuclear energy has \nemerged as an important player in our search for a stable and domestic \nenergy source that has less greenhouse gas emissions.\n  A cleaner energy economy will spur innovation in and accelerate the \nshift to clean and domestic energy sources. It will create a new \nindustrial sector, employing millions of Americans in the research, \ndevelopment, manufacturing, sale, installation and servicing of new \nenergy technologies. And it will help reduce our dependence on foreign \noil from unstable regions of the world.\n  Moreover, like it or not, we must address the climate challenge we \nface. My State of Colorado is already seeing the indirect impacts of \ncarbon pollution in the form of a devastating bark beetle infestation \nthat is killing our forests.\n  Looking beyond environmental concerns and as we face perhaps our \ngreatest economic crisis since the Great Depression, we also need an \n``all of the above'' solution to jump-start our economy. That means \ncontinuing our development of renewable energy sources such as wind, \nsolar, and biomass, as well as traditional energy resources like coal \nand oil, and cleaner fuels like natural gas.\n  That also means we should continue to invest in energy efficiency and \nconservation technology. And that means that nuclear energy and new \nnuclear power plants must be a part of the mix.\n  As I said earlier, a growing number of skeptics and even opponents of \nnuclear power are taking a second look at this industry. I count myself \namong them, and these are some of the reasons why:\n  First, in the last few decades, the performance and safety record of \nnuclear plant operations in the United States has greatly improved. \nSafety is and always must be the No. 1 priority at nuclear facilities. \nThere is always more we can do on safety, but the industry has built a \ngood record and we should recognize that fact.\n  Then there are the environmental benefits to nuclear power. Unlike \nfossil fuel plants, nuclear plants do not emit appreciable amounts of \nsulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, mercury or particulate matter. That \nmeans they cause less acid rain, as well as fewer asthma complications \nand other health ailments.\n  Further, nuclear plants release minimal amounts of carbon pollution. \nIn fact, nuclear power plants are one of the few low-carbon, large-\nscale sources of baseload power that we know how to build today.\n  Let me note that carbon-capture and storage technologies at coal and \nnatural gas plants could also potentially provide low-carbon baseload \npower at large scales too. And it is very important that we build these \nfirst commercial CCS plants and do all we can to develop economically \nviable carbon-capture and sequestration technologies.\n  I have long been a supporter of renewable energy and energy \nefficiency, and I will continue to be. But the scale of the energy \nchanges we must make dictates that we be open to the widest variety of \nenergy options, particularly those with domestic potential and those \nwith cleaner emissions. In other words, there is no silver bullet that \nwill solve all of our energy challenges; we are going to need, in the \nparlance of the West, silver buckshot. Examining all the pros and cons, \nI have come to the view that nuclear energy is a part of that silver \nbuckshot.\n  I know there are many who remain skeptical of nuclear power, \nincluding good friends of mine. Nuclear power is not trouble-free. No \nenergy source is. I hope we can all agree, however, on our clean energy \ngoals: more jobs, greater energy security, and a cleaner environment \nfor our children.\n  Supporters and opponents of nuclear power share another concern in \ncommon. Neither knows for sure how much new nuclear plants are going to \ncost. We have a new licensing process that has never been tested. We \nhave not ordered a new nuclear plant in three decades. Many nuclear \ntechnology components, for at least the first wave of nuclear plants, \nwill likely be manufactured in other countries, and the future cost of \nconstruction materials is unknown. These uncertainties, along with \nothers, led the National Academy of Sciences to estimate that \nelectricity from new nuclear plants would likely cost in the range of 8 \nto 13 cents per kilowatt hour, which is a considerable span. Given the \nlarge potential of nuclear energy, however, we need to build new \nnuclear plants over the next decade.\n  This first wave of new plants will go a long way toward telling us \nwhether new plants can be built on budget and on schedule in the United \nStates. I hope the answers are yes and yes, and that the final cost of \nelectricity is at the lower end of the uncertainty range. I say this \nbecause if nuclear energy is to survive as a viable option, it will \nneed to compete against other low-carbon technologies in the long run.\n  Some may object to the building of new nuclear plants before we have \na long-term solution to the question of what to do with nuclear waste. \nIt is true we do not have a permanent solution right now. It is also \ntrue that the answers about the viability, both environmental and \npolitical, of Yucca Mountain as a permanent waste facility continue to \nelude us. I fully acknowledge that as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, I shared these concerns and voted accordingly. But \nuncertainty about a long-term and permanent solution to waste storage \nis not a reason to halt nuclear power. I am confident that we have the \ntechnical capabilities and knowledge to safely and responsibly store \nnuclear waste for the required time periods. This is not a technology \nproblem. It is a challenge to find a fair and safe path forward, and I \nsupport the President's intention to appoint a blue ribbon commission \nto make such a recommendation.\n  In the meantime, dry cask storage provides a safe, proven option for \nat least 100 years. We have time to get this right, so let us not rush \ninto anything out of a false sense of emergency.\n  Let me turn to another subject tied to nuclear power production, and \nthat\n\n[[Page S10927]]\n\nis reprocessing. It has been suggested that we should build commercial \nscale facilities in the United States to reprocess our spent fuel as \nFrance and Japan do. I do not believe that makes sense. Why? First, the \nFrench system of reprocessing is not a comprehensive waste management \nstrategy, and so far the benefits from that approach have been fairly \nmarginal. In other words, they have not solved their waste challenge \nwith reprocessing. Secondly, we do not need to recycle spent nuclear \nfuel to enable the expansion of nuclear power in the United States and \nelsewhere. Uranium supplies are sufficient to support a worldwide \nexpansion of nuclear power during this next century. Third, the \ninternational proliferation risk associated with reprocessing is a \nconcern. The process used in France creates separated plutonium which \ncould be diverted for weapons production. I do not want to see \nseparated plutonium in any country but especially in those that are \nunfriendly to us. And we are in a weaker position to try and dissuade \nthose countries from reprocessing if we are doing it ourselves.\n  My conclusion is that a near-term decision to deploy reprocessing \nfacilities would be unwise and unnecessary. I do support research into \nadvanced proliferation-resistant technologies, though none of those \nwill be ready for deployment anytime in the near future. In general, \nour goal should be to keep nuclear power as low-cost and proliferation-\nresistant as possible.\n  To that end, today I am introducing a bipartisan bill, the Nuclear \nEnergy Research Initiative Improvement Act of 2009. This bill, which is \ncosponsored by Chairman Bingaman and Ranking Member Murkowski, \nauthorizes the U.S. Department of Energy to conduct research into \nmodular and small-scale reactors, enhanced proliferation controls, and \ncost-efficient manufacturing.\n  We are going to be debating clean energy later this Congress. I know \nseveral of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle would like to see a \nstrong nuclear title. I hope we can come to a reasonable compromise \nthat advances nuclear power and allows us to finally put a price on \ncarbon pollution. That will give the energy sector the certainty it \nneeds to begin planning and building our clean energy future and to \nbegin creating clean energy jobs.\n  Nuclear plants to date provide jobs for thousands of Americans, and \nnew plants would provide thousands more. New plants would also generate \nmillions in tax revenues for State, local, and Federal governments \nstruggling with large deficits from the economic downturn. Nuclear \npower's energy security and environmental benefits have earned this \nindustry an important place at the table. It is my hope we can build \nsome nuclear plants over the next decade to create jobs and build a \ncleaner, more secure tomorrow.\n  I invite all of my colleagues, from both sides of the aisle, to join \nSenator Bingaman, Senator Murkowski, and me in cosponsoring the Nuclear \nEnergy Research Initiative Improvement Act of 2009.\n  One of my energy fellows, Matt Bowen, is leaving my office to join \nthe Department of Energy. I thank Matt for his work in my office, \nincluding on the bill I am introducing today, and I wish him well at \nthe Department of Energy. We have been well served as a country by Matt \nBowen's patriotism and work ethic.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 2081. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \naccelerate locomotive fuel savings nationwide and provide incentives \nfor owners of high polluting locomotives to replace such locomotives \nwith newly-built or newly-remanufactured fuel efficient and less \npolluting locomotives; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to describe \nlegislation I have introduced that will help businesses, sustain and \ncreate jobs, spur economic development for a struggling industry and \nbenefit the environment.\n  The locomotive industry in the U.S. directly employs over 125,000 \npeople and supports a wide-range of secondary industries which \ncontribute to the locomotive manufacturing process through operations \nlocated around the country. This vital industry has experienced a \nsignificant decline in business over the past several years, which has \nregrettably resulted in furloughs and layoffs. It is my understanding, \nthough, that these circumstances are not due to a lack of demand for \nnew locomotives, but rather, yet another symptom of our Nation's weak \neconomy and insufficient capital among potential customers.\n  Accordingly, I along with my colleague Senator Bob Casey, have \nintroduced the Locomotive Fleet Investment and Tax Credit Act of 2009. \nThis legislation will provide a tax credit for the acquisition of new \nand newly remanufactured locomotives, including freight, long-haul, \npassenger, and switch locomotives. The tax credit we have proposed is \nsubstantial but time-limited, so as to have the maximum impact in short \norder. The bill provides a tax credit of 30 percent of the purchase \ncost of a new or newly manufactured locomotive, but stipulates that the \nnew locomotives must be placed in service before December 31, 2013, to \nqualify for the credit.\n  In addition to the economic impact, the Locomotive Fleet Investment \nand Tax Credit Act will also benefit the environment, as new and newly \nmanufactured locomotives are typically more fuel efficient and emit \nfewer harmful pollutants. Moreover, new locomotive models are often \nmore reliable and have better safety records. In short, it is in the \nbest interest of operators, manufacturers and the general public to \nremove from the rails as many old, outdated rail cars as possible and \nreplace them with new locomotives.\n  Our economy has suffered through a crisis of historic proportions, \nand though there are early signs of recovery, conditions are still \ngrim. On October 2, 2009, the Department of Labor reported that \nnational unemployment had risen to 9.8 percent, with the loss of \n260,000 jobs in September and the total loss of 7.2 million jobs since \nthe recession began. The rail industry and America's manufacturing base \nhas been hard hit by the economic downturn and the Federal Government \nought to help foster an environment in which these businesses can \nrebound and thrive once again. I am confident that our economy will \nindeed improve, and when it does, it is important that our country \nstill has a robust capacity to manufacture locomotives domestically.\n  The Locomotive Fleet Investment and Tax Credit Act of 2009 will \nprovide a much-needed boost to locomotive manufacturers, sustain and \ncreate jobs and help establish a safer, environmentally friendlier and \nmore reliable rail industry.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI (for herself and Mr. Cardin):\n  S. 2095. A bill to amend the National Great Black Americans \nCommemoration Act of 2004 to authorize appropriations through fiscal \nyear 2015; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the National \nGreat Black Americans Commemoration Act. I am proud to sponsor this \nlegislation along with Senator Cardin. African Americans have a rich \nhistory that must be cherished and remembered. This bill will honor \nAfrican American leaders from across the country by helping to preserve \ntheir names, faces, and stories for generations to come.\n  This legislation will provide continued Federal assistance to expand \nexhibits and educational programs at the National Great Blacks in Wax \nMuseum and Justice Learning Center in Baltimore, MD. Some of the \nmemorialized figures are household names, like: Frederick Douglass, Dr. \nMartin Luther King, Jr., and President Barack Obama. Yet many more are \nunfamiliar, like the 22 African Americans who served in Congress in the \n1800s. It is time we give these pioneers the recognition they deserve.\n  Maryland is proud to be home to so many important figures in African \nAmerican history. From the dark days of slavery through the civil \nrights movement, Marylanders have led the way. The brilliant Frederick \nDouglass was the voice of the voiceless in the struggle against \nslavery. The courageous Harriet Tubman delivered 300 slaves to freedom \non the Underground Railroad. The great Thurgood Marshall, a man who was \nno stranger to the restriction of educational opportunity, successfully \nargued the Brown\n\n[[Page S10928]]\n\nv. Board of Education case before the Supreme Court, and later became a \nSupreme Court Justice himself. These three amazing individuals were \nMarylanders.\n  It is fitting that the national Great Blacks in Wax Museum and \nJustice Learning Center also calls Baltimore home. The museum and \nlearning center is a popular and respected African American history \nmuseum. Approximately 300,000 people a year from around the country and \nthe world visit the museum. Many are school children, who can see \nhistorical figures come to life in the museum's exhibits. Expansion \nwill allow the museum to teach even more visitors about the important \ncontributions of African Americans.\n  Private donors have contributed too. Now it is time for the Federal \nGovernment to reaffirm its commitment.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Grassley, Ms. \n        Mikulski, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Snowe, \n        Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Voinovich, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. \n        Stabenow, Ms. Murkowski, Mr. Pryor, Mrs. McCaskill, Ms. \n        Klobuchar, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mrs. Hagan, and Mrs. Shaheen):\n  S. 2129. A bill to authorize the Administrator of General Services to \nconvey a parcel of real property in the District of Columbia to provide \nfor the establishment of a National Women's History Museum; to the \nCommittee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President. I rise to introduce the National Women's \nHistory Museum Act of 2009, a bill that would clear the way to locate a \nlong-overdue historical and educational resource in our nation's \ncapital city.\n  In each of the last three Congresses, the Senate has approved earlier \nversions of this bill by unanimous consent. I appreciate that past \nsupport, and I appreciate the cosponsorship today from 19 of my \ncolleagues, Senators Lieberman, Grassley, Mikulski, Boxer, Feinstein, \nMurray, Snowe, Landrieu Lincoln, Voinovich, Cantwell, Stabenow, \nMurkowski, Pryor, McCaskill, Klobuchar, Gillibrand, Hagan, and Sheehan.\n  American women have made invaluable contributions to our country in \ngovernment, business, medicine, law, literature, sports, entertainment, \nthe arts, and the military. The need for a museum recognizing the \ncontributions of American women is of long standing.\n  A Presidential commission on commemorating women in American history \nconcluded that, ``Efforts to implement an appropriate celebration of \nwomen's history in the next millennium should include the designation \nof a focal point for women's history in our Nation's capital.''\n  That report was issued in 1999. A decade later, although Congress has \ncommendably made provisions for the National Museum for African \nAmerican History and Culture, the National Law Enforcement Museum, and \nthe National Museum of the American Indian, there is still no \ninstitution in the capital region dedicated to women's role in our \ncountry's history.\n  The proposed legislation calls for no new federal program and no new \nclaims on the budget. It would simply direct the General Services \nAdministration to negotiate and enter into an occupancy agreement with \nthe National Women's History Museum, Inc. to establish a museum on a \ntract of land near the Smithsonian Museums located at 12th Street, SW, \nand Independence Avenue, SW.\n  The National Women's History Museum is a nonprofit, non-partisan, \neducational institution based in the District of Columbia. Its mission \nis to research and present the historic contributions that women have \nmade to all aspects of human endeavor, and to present the contributions \nthat women have made to the nation in their various roles in family, \nthe economy, and society.\n  This museum would help ensure that future generations understand what \nwe owe to the many generations of American women who have helped build, \nsustain, and advance our society. They deserve a building to present \nthe stories of pioneering women like abolitionist Harriet Tubman, \nfounder of the Girl Scouts Juliette Gordon Low, Supreme Court Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor, and astronaut Sally Ride.\n  That women's roll of honor would also include a distinguished \npredecessor in my Senate seat, the late Senator Margaret Chase Smith, \nthe first woman nominated for President of the United States by a major \npolitical party, and the first woman elected to both houses of \nCongress. Senator Smith began representing Maine in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in 1940, won election to the Senate in 1948, and \nenjoyed bipartisan respect over her long career for her independence, \nintegrity, wisdom, and decency. She remains my role model and, through \nthe example of her public service, an exemplar of the virtues that \nwould be honored in the National Women's History Museum.\n  Again, I thank my colleagues for their past support of this effort, \nand urge them to renew that support for this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 2149. A bill to suspend temporarily the duty on orthotoluidine.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing would \nsuspend temporarily, through the end of 2011, the import duty on ortho-\ntoluidine, a chemical compound used by several U.S. companies in \nmanufacturing an important agricultural herbicide used for crops \nincluding corn, soybeans, peanuts, and cotton. One of the manufacturing \nplants is a facility in Muscatine, IA, that employs 500 workers. Other \nU.S. companies use the compound in manufacturing dyestuffs, pigments, \noptical brighteners, and pharmaceuticals. This legislation is drafted \nand intended for inclusion in the miscellaneous tariff bill being \nassembled by the Committee on Finance.\n  Currently, there is only one U.S. manufacturer of orthotoluidine, and \nthat company has already announced plans to end production of the \ncompound by the end of this year. Manufacturers in the U.S. will soon \nhave no choice but to import this ingredient and to pay a duty of 6.5 \npercent unless it is suspended. Suspending this duty will help to \ncontrol U.S. production costs, keep jobs at home, and enhance the \ncompetitiveness of U.S. businesses, workers, farmers, and the \ncommunities in which they are located.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SESSIONS (for himself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Bond):\n  S. 2336. A bill to safeguard intelligence collection and enact a fair \nand responsible reauthorization of the 3 expiring provisions of the USA \nPATRIOT Improvements and Reauthorization Act; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I sent to the desk earlier legislation \nthat is cosponsored by myself and Senator Joe Lieberman and Senator Kit \nBond. In essence, it reauthorizes certain provisions of the PATRIOT Act \nwhich expire, if we do not act, on December 31 of this year. It is an \nimportant matter and I am proud to be working with the distinguished \nchairman of the committee that has oversight over homeland security, \nand Senator Bond, who is the ranking Republican on the Intelligence \nCommittee and has worked on these issues for quite a long time.\n  I wish to be notified after 10 minutes, if you would, please.\n  In recent years, Federal agents have exposed a series of potentially \ndevastating terrorist plots across our country. If successful, these \nplanned attacks would have caused unthinkable harm and claimed the \nlives of countless Americans. In the years following 9/11, there have \nbeen constant attempts to strike again on American soil. There could \nhave been a dozen 9/11's, perhaps, were it not for the skill and \ncourage of those who labor in defense of our country and our \ncountrymen, and were it not for the measures passed by this Congress \nthat have finally given them the support and the legal and financial \nresources they need to combat the terrorist threat.\n  But unless Congress acts, these very measures will soon expire. \nUnless Congress acts, our agents will be stripped of some of the legal \ntools they have used to foil attack after attack on our homeland and to \navert catastrophe time and again.\n  Three of the most critical national security provisions passed by \nthis body must be renewed by December 31 of\n\n[[Page S10929]]\n\nthis year. Those provisions are found in the USA PATRIOT Act, which has \nplayed an essential part keeping our families and communities safe for \nthese last 9 years. It at last gave the intelligence community the \ncapabilities it needed to detect and deter terrorism inside our \nborders.\n  These capabilities have long been used in routine law enforcement, \nbut could not be used in national security matters. Why would we not \npursue terrorists with the same tools we can use to pursue drug dealers \nand mobsters?\n  Anyone who has followed the news in recent weeks knows just how vital \nthese tools are. Four major terrorist plots have been foiled in the \nlast 6 weeks--four in the last 6 weeks.\n  Just yesterday, we learned that two Chicago men were charged with \nplotting to attack the facilities and employees of a Danish newspaper \nthat printed cartoons depicting the Islamic prophet Muhammad. The \nplanned attack included weapons and explosives. According to reports, \none of the men admitted working with a Pakistani group which has been \ndesignated by our government as a foreign terrorist organization.\n  The government recently charged Najibullah Zazi with conspiring to \nuse one or more weapons of mass destruction--specifically, explosive \ndevices--against persons or property within the United States. The New \nYork Times described the government's case against Mr. Zazi as ``a set \nof damning accusations'' that begin ``with explosives training in \nPakistan followed by purchases of bomb-making materials in Colorado, \nexperiments in a hotel room, and a cross-country trip to New York, \nwhich the authorities feared might have been the target of his \nattack.''\n  According to reports, Mr. Zazi was in contact with senior al-Qaida \noperatives, including the leader of al-Qaida in Afghanistan. Attorney \nGeneral Holder has described Zazi's plot as one of the worst since 9/\n11.\n  In another case, Hosam Maher Husein Smadi stands accused of \nconspiring to set off an explosive attached to a vehicle at the base of \nthe 60-story Fountain Place office tower in Dallas, TX. In yet another \ncase, Tarek Mehanna was charged with material support of terrorism \nrelated to a plot to kill U.S. troops in Iraq, assassinate top \npoliticians, and gun down shoppers in U.S. malls.\n  But these attacks never occurred. They never occurred because we had \nthe tools in place to prevent them and because of the untiring agents \nwho carry out their noble, often thankless mission day after day. But \nout of an abundance of caution, Congress created a time limit on some \nof these investigative procedures and tools, and in 2006 those \nauthorities were renewed because it was clear they were working and \nwere needed.\n  It is worth noting that even though these authorities had not been \nabused by our hard-working terrorism officials, numerous revisions to \nthem were made in 2006. Then, we reauthorized the provisions, while \nalso strengthening civil liberties protections. That 2006 legislation \nwas passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. It passed with 89 \nvotes, among them our current President, who was a Member of the \nSenate; the Vice President, who was then a Member of the Senate; and \nthe Secretary of State, who was then a Member of the Senate.\n  The PATRIOT Act is again up for renewal with three critical \nauthorities set to expire. While we in the Judiciary Committee have \nbeen debating whether these expiring PATRIOT Act authorities should be \napproved for another 4 years, our agents are actively working hard to \nprotect this country and its people from the constant threat of \nterrorism. Is there anyone in this Chamber who thinks that we should \nmake it harder for our national security investigators to catch \nterrorists? Is there anyone here who believes the American people want \nus to make it harder for our investigators to catch terrorists?\n  I know Chairman Leahy has worked hard, as we all did, to try to come \nup with a PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill in the Judiciary Committee \nthat could attract strong bipartisan support. I commend him for that \neffort. He really worked at that. We worked together at that. However, \nthe bill that eventually emerged from the Judiciary Committee does not \nmeet the key test for any national security legislation: first, do no \nharm. The bill reported by the committee would make the jobs of our \nnational security officials more difficult. The Obama administration \nhas raised serious misgivings about the legislation that passed out of \nthe committee.\n  So, I think we need to make a fresh start. Let's go back and take the \nbill we voted so strongly for before, add the minor things that need to \nbe added to it to make it better--to deal with recent court of appeals \nrulings--and then let's move that forward to make sure we get that done \nbefore the legislation expires on December 31.\n  The bill we introduced today represents the best parts of the \nlegislation that emerged from the Judiciary Committee, the parts almost \neveryone agreed upon. I will go into some of these details later but \nwould just say that I am honored to be able to participate in the \nfiling of this legislation with two fine cosponsors, Senators Lieberman \nand Kit Bond.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I am very proud to rise today to join with Senator \nSessions, my friend from Alabama, in introducing this legislation to \nreauthorize provisions of the PATRIOT Act that will expire at the end \nof the year if we do not act. These are critically important \nprovisions.\n  I was about to say something that may sound odd to say, which is that \nthe PATRIOT Act got a bad name, which it did not deserve. It is hard to \nimagine that anything with the name ``patriot'' in it could have gotten \na bad name. There may have been a lot of reasons for it--\nmisunderstandings, maybe, frankly, suspicions of the previous \nadministration. But on the merits, this legislation was critically \nnecessary in the time after September 11. And as Senator Sessions has \nmade clear, because of what seems to be an escalating series of threats \nto our homeland security from Islamist extremists using terrorism to \nattack us, these provisions are actually probably more critically \nnecessary today than they have been in years past. But they have been \ncritically important.\n  I say the PATRIOT Act got a bad name because of the three provisions \nthat our legislation--Senators Sessions, Bond and I--will continue to \nauthorize, including the roving wiretap, business records provisions, \nand the so-called lone wolf provision.\n  When Senator Sessions goes into these in some detail in a few \nmoments, I think anybody coming to the discussion with an open mind \nwill see that these are very commonsense provisions. In fact, they are \nprovisions that law enforcers in our country have today with regard to \ntraditional crimes. And we are taking them and applying them to these \nkinds of investigations regarding terrorist threats against the United \nStates of America.\n  The Judiciary Committee labored with very good intentions, brought a \nbill out that was a compromise and did get some bipartisan support, I \ngather, which I was pleased about. But it does, as Senator Sessions \nsays, make some changes and it puts some pressure on the enforcement of \nthese critical provisions of the PATRIOT Act that will weaken them, \nwill undermine their effectiveness. And I think we should go for \neverything we can get here which has worked so well for the past years.\n  The fact is, we have seen a series--I want to come to this. I want to \ngo back because there was mention--I said the PATRIOT Act got a bad \nname. There was a particular focus and concern in the library community \nand advocates for libraries--we all love libraries, and I myself have \nsuch memories of the role the public library in my hometown of \nStamford, CT, played in my education--that somehow the government could \nbreak into libraries through the PATRIOT Act and check on what books \npeople were taking out and compromise peoples' freedom of, I guess, \nintellectual pursuit, freedom of interests, if you will.\n  There was a lot of concern, a lot of debate back and forth. Finally, \nafter some period of time in which the Attorney General refused to \nanswer questions about how often that provision of the PATRIOT Act had \nbeen utilized, the Attorney General actually came forth--I forgot the \ncircumstances--and said it had never been utilized, and it was cleaned \nup, and that is not in effect anymore.\n\n[[Page S10930]]\n\n  Now a new administration--President Obama, Attorney General Holder--\nchanged, different parties, in some sense different perspectives, but \nyet the President and the Attorney General took a sensible and I would \nsay unbiased look at the challenge they faced from terrorism in this \ncountry and then looked at the provisions of the PATRIOT Act and said: \nWe need it. It is fair. It is constitutional. It does not deprive \npeople of rights. And more to the point, it will be critically useful \nin stopping the extremists and the terrorists from depriving people not \nonly of their rights here in America but of their lives.\n\n  The PATRIOT Act provisions in question here have been a critical part \nof, I would say, a remarkable, impressive improvement in the capacity \nof the U.S. Government to stop terrorism, this unconventional enemy we \nface which aims to attack and kill Americans and, indeed, to undermine \nif not to defeat our fundamental way of life, our freedom, our values, \nour diversity, our tolerance.\n  We have seen, since 9/11, I am proud to say facilitated or encouraged \nby some legislation we passed, the Department of Homeland Security \ncreated, the 9/11 Commission Report, reforming the intelligence \ncommunity, the Department of National Intelligence.\n  Probably one of the great unsung national assets we have, something \ncalled the National Counterterrorism Center, exists outside of \nWashington. It is a facility in which all of the relevant agencies of \nthe Federal Government are there side by side 24/7, 365 days a year \nsharing information, connecting the dots. What did we all say after 9/\n11 and after the Commission Report? We had a lot of information in \ndifferent places in the Federal Government; that if it had been brought \ntogether in one place, I personally think we would have stopped 9/11, \nthe murder of 3,000 people on American soil. We did not have it \ntogether. But now those places exist--NCTC, the National \nCounterterrorism Center; the tremendous work by our intelligence \ncommunity, by our military community, by our law enforcement community, \nworking together cooperatively and cooperating with foreign \nintelligence, law enforcement and military communities.\n  The FBI has created and beefed up a counterterrorism division that I \nthink has become the best in the world. And it is what makes the \narrests that have occurred, a series of events, the ones Senator \nSessions mentioned, the Zazi case--Najibullah Zazi, Afghan from birth, \ncame here, permanent legal resident--this is the nightmare case--\nbecomes radicalized, commits himself to Islamist extremism, goes over \nto Pakistan and connects with the highest levels, allegedly, of al-\nQaida, receives training. One presumes--we do not know--he was directed \nor encouraged to do the things he came back here to do and started to \nwork to put together, to acquire, according to the indictment, the \nmaterial to explode several bombs in New York City, which would have \ndone devastating damage.\n  The slightest bit of evidence--I am not compromising anything, but \nyou might say metaphorically, Zazi appeared on one screen, a shred of \nevidence about him, and it alarmed some of our law enforcement people, \nand all of the resources of our government--foreign intelligence, \nAmerican intelligence, CIA, DNI, FBI, Department of Homeland Security, \nlocal law enforcement--came together with that little piece to build a \npicture that helped us to follow him and find him and stop him before \nhe was able to do terrible damage in New York City. Do you know what \nelse helped with that? The PATRIOT Act. It has helped in so many of \nthese cases we stopped. There has been a ring of them this year.\n\n  Earlier, about a month ago in our Homeland Security Committee, \nSenator Collins and I convened a hearing on the state of homegrown \nterrorism and our efforts to stop it. We had the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, the head of the National Counterterrorism Center, and the \nhead of the FBI. As my last question, I kind of said it wide open to \neach of them: Tell me the one thing Congress could do to help you do \nthe extraordinary, critically important, life-and-death work you are \ndoing to prevent terrorist attacks against the United States. You might \nsay I was giving them a blank check. Frankly, I thought they would say: \nWe need more money for this program or that program.\n  When we came to Bob Mueller, the Director of the FBI, he gave a \nsimple answer to the question: What is the one thing Congress could do \nto help you continue to do the extraordinary work you and the rest of \nour American team are doing to stop terrorist attacks. Director Mueller \nsaid: Reauthorize the PATRIOT Act. Without it, without those three \nsimple provisions--lone wolf, roving wiretaps, and the business record \nprovisions--we will not be able to do the job you want us to do.\n  This is so critical to our security that we should settle for nothing \nless than exactly the best. The Department of Justice recently \nsubmitted a letter urging renewal of the expiring PATRIOT Act \nprovisions and emphasized the importance of us not doing anything ``to \nundermine the effectiveness of these important authorities.'' Despite \nthe clear admonition--you might say plea--from the Obama administration \nand the Department of Justice, those who use these tools to keep us \nsafe, I am concerned that proposals to impose some new requirements and \nrestrictions on the FBI's ability to use these tested, existing PATRIOT \nAct authorities and national security letters will diminish the ability \nof the law enforcement community to protect us from these terrorist \nattacks.\n  As an individual Senator from Connecticut, as a Senator privileged to \nserve as chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, I am proud to \njoin with Senators Sessions and Bond in introducing this clean, total \nreauthorization of the expiring PATRIOT Act provisions and urge my \ncolleagues to support swift passage of this simple, proven, and vitally \nimportant legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, our intelligence community should never be \nforced to question whether our priority is protecting America's safety \nor protecting the privacy of terrorists. This bill makes clear to \nintelligence professionals that keeping our Nation safe is their \nhighest responsibility and assures they have the tools needed to get \nthe job done. That is why I am so pleased to join with my colleagues, \nSenators Lieberman and Sessions, in reauthorizing three FISA \nprovisions--lone wolf, wiretap, and section 215--which would otherwise \nexpire.\n  This legislation we have introduced today, without change, \nreauthorizes these three national vital security tools for 4 more \nyears. While I believe each of these tools should be made permanent and \nCongress plays a dangerous game with national security every time we \nimpose arbitrary sunsets, it is essential that the community's ability \nto collect lifesaving foreign intelligence should continue unimpeded.\n  Our bill also makes conforming changes to the disclosure requirements \nfor national security letters in light of the Second Circuit's decision \nlast year. These issues are so critical and so urgent to our well-being \nand security as a nation, nothing else will matter, even the current \nhealth care debate, if we fail in national security.\n  I have spoken before on this floor about the need for President Obama \nto make a decision about Afghanistan. I will not repeat those points \ntoday. But as our military, intelligence, and law enforcement \nprofessionals defend the United States and its allies in Washington, \nthere is an effort afoot to make this fight much harder than it needs \nto be.\n  The U.S. PATRIOT Act and the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act were passed overwhelmingly in the aftermath of the \nSeptember 11 terror attacks. For years, terrorism was treated as a law \nenforcement matter.\n  Our Nation responded to terrorist attack after terrorist attack, to \nthe deaths of our servicemembers and embassy personnel, with \nindictments and arrest warrants. As Congress failed to give our \nintelligence operators the tools they needed to act quickly, our \nterrorist enemies became even more emboldened and determined to strike \nour homeland. September 11 was a wake-up call.\n  Our driving mission appropriately, after that, became prevention and \ndisruption of terrorist attacks at home against our troops overseas and \nagainst\n\n[[Page S10931]]\n\nour allies. That is why the legislation we passed provided the \nnecessary tools. In 2005, the PATRIOT Act was reauthorized with minor \nchanges, but three FISA provisions remained subject to sunset. Here is \nan opportunity for us to reauthorize these three vital provisions. \nThere is little disagreement among people who know that these \nprovisions should and must be reauthorized.\n  FBI Director Mueller testified before the Judiciary Committee that \neach is important to the FBI's work in national security and criminal \ninvestigation. But because of the enhanced information sharing rules \nand procedures, other community entities, such as the Counterterrorism \nCenter, are often dependent upon information collected under these \nauthorities. Their loss would adversely impact their ability to analyze \nand share important national intelligence information. As an example, \nif the FBI obtains a court order under FISA for a roving wiretap \ntargeting a terrorist subject in New York, foreign intelligence \ninformation obtained there may be shared with the CIA, enabling them in \nturn to target associates overseas.\n  Events over the past few months underscore the importance of giving \nthe FBI and other agencies all the tools and authorities they need to \nstay ahead. From the disrupted terror plots in New York and Colorado to \nthose in Illinois, Texas, and North Carolina, we have seen firsthand \nwhy the FBI must have the flexibility to get the information they need \nas quickly as possible to prevent these attacks.\n  The benefit of our intelligence collection authorities, however, does \nnot just benefit our own citizens. Just as overseas terror threats may \nimpact our safety, threats posed by some within our country do not \nalways end here. We learned two men in Chicago were conspiring with \nassociates to commit terrorist attacks in Denmark. This case is a good \nexample of how FISA authorities can save lives in allied countries. \nThere is a belief among some that as long as the intelligence community \neventually gets the information it needs, time is not of the essence. \nThat is not true. Timing was everything, whether it was introducing an \nundercover agent to a target at the right moment or conducting \nsurveillance at the right time. No intelligence collector is going to \nsay that getting the same information 3 weeks later is good enough.\n  I cannot comment on specific tools that were used in foiling all of \nthese plots. We know both from public and classified testimony and \ninformation that the tools provided that we are authorizing today have \nbeen invaluable to our efforts to stay ahead of the terrorists. As I \nmentioned earlier, the FBI's ability to obtain a roving wiretap under \nFISA will end this year unless Congress acts.\n  According to Director Mueller, the FBI has used the authority 140 \ntimes in the past 5 years. The ability to track terrorists even when \nthey repeatedly use and dump their cell phones to avoid interception \nis, as Director Mueller testified, ``tremendously important.'' He also \nnoted with all the new technology, it is nothing for a target to buy \nfour or five cell phones and use them in quick succession. I couldn't \nagree more.\n  Our enemies know our laws better than some of us do. They understand \nthe hoops and hurdles government must clear to catch up or stay ahead. \nRoving wiretap authority sends a clear message that the time-honored \ntrick of frequently changing a cell phone will not work like it used \nto.\n  Obtaining a roving wiretap requires, first and foremost, that the FBI \nestablish probable cause that the target is an agent of a foreign \npower. Some critics of this provision claim it allows the FBI to avoid \nmeeting this standard as surveillance moves from phone to phone. That \nis not true. Each wiretap application is approved by a FISA Court \njudge. If a target changes his cell phone and the FBI moves to surveil \nthe new phone, the court is notified. All of the protections for U.S. \nperson information that apply to any other FISA wiretap also apply to \nroving wiretaps.\n  In short, while the authority is a tremendous asset for the FBI, it \nposes no additional civil liberties concerns. It should be renewed.\n  On business records, over the past 5 years, a rallying cry against \nthese measures has centered on section 215, allowing the FBI to obtain \nbusiness records such as hotel information or travel records upon a \nshowing of the requisite burden of proof to a FISA Court judge. We have \nheard time and again the FBI is using this authority to spy on people's \nreading habits at the local library. This is simply highly charged \nrhetoric not supported by facts. While the FBI has used section 215 \nmore than 250 times in the past 5 years, no library records have been \nobtained. But we do know that terrorists and their associates have used \nlibrary Internet access to communicate with each other and, in the \nappropriate case, the FBI must have the ability to obtain any relevant \nrecords relating to that usage.\n\n  Congress should not pass any legislation that would allow terrorists \nto use libraries or any other public facility as a safe haven for their \nillegal activities. If we did that, guess where all the terrorists \nwould congregate. Do you want them all in your libraries? I don't think \nso.\n  The inspector general of the Department of Justice conducted several \naudits of the FBI's use of section 215 and found no abuse of authority. \nThese audits also considered the time it takes for the FBI to obtain a \n215 order. The Director has testified that business records sought by \nterrorism investigations by the FBI are ``absolutely essential to \nidentifying other persons who may be involved in terrorist \nactivities.'' The records obtained under this authority are no \ndifferent from what the FBI could obtain in a criminal investigation \nusing grand jury subpoena authority. There is rarely any delay in \nobtaining a grand jury subpoena. DOJ should strive to ensure that \nsection 215 court orders are obtained in a timely and expedient manner.\n  Given the vital information that can be obtained, I have asked the \nDOJ to take steps necessary to minimize future delays. As with roving \nwiretap authority, I believe section 215 has adequate measures already \nbuilt in to ensure that the private interests of U.S. persons are \nprotected. I have not heard any reasonable critique of this authority, \nand I believe it should be authorized without changes, without delay.\n  The sole expiring provision that has not been used by the FBI is the \nlone wolf definition of an agent of a foreign power, prompting some \ncritics to demand its repeal. Under this definition, the FBI can obtain \na FISA Act search or electronic surveillance against a non-U.S. person \nwho is not readily identifiable with a particular foreign power.\n  We all should be familiar with the story of Zacarias Moussaoui, the \n9/11 coconspirator who was identified prior to the 9/11 attacks. But \nthe FBI could not connect him with a particular terrorist organization \nand, therefore, did not submit a formal request for a FISA search \norder. We know Moussaoui was ultimately convicted in the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia and is now serving a life sentence for his part in \nthe 9/11 conspiracy.\n  If FISA had included a lone wolf provision, the FBI could have \nsearched his belongings and possibly gained advanced intelligence about \nthe 9/11 plot. Once again, Director Mueller has emphasized in his \nrecent testimony that the FBI must retain the ability to target an \nindividual who cannot be specifically tied to a particular foreign \npower. The Director specifically cited the Moussaoui case as a prime \nexample. We should never again take the risk that another Moussaoui \nwill be identified by the FBI but escape scrutiny to prevent an attack \nbecause he could not be tied to a specific terrorist organization.\n\n  I see the ``lone wolf'' provision as a necessary tool that will only \nneed to be used in limited circumstances. It is kind of like those ``in \ncase of emergency, break glass'' boxes that cover certain fire alarms \nand equipment. We need to keep these tools available for the rare \nsituations where they would be needed.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the Senate Judiciary Committee reported a \nPATRIOT Act reauthorization bill that makes a number of changes to \nsection 215 authorities and other national security tools. I believe \nthe Judiciary bill is deeply flawed, and I hope my colleagues will \nlisten carefully and support our bill instead. There will be ample time \ndown the road to lay out in\n\n[[Page S10932]]\n\ndetail all my objections to the Judiciary bill, but let me just make a \nfew key points.\n  I disagree strongly that there should be a first time ever sunset for \nnational security letters. It is irresponsible to risk letting the law \nrevert back to pre-9/11 status, where NSLs were largely underutilized \nbecause the burden of proof and approval levels were too high for an \ninvestigative tool.\n  The so-called abuses that are so often cited were actually related to \nsomething called exigent letters. Exigent letters are essentially a \nrequest to third parties, usually phone companies or Internet service \nproviders, for immediate access to records, contingent upon a promise \nto provide a grand jury subpoena or a national security letter \npromptly.\n  It is important to understand that these exigent letters are not \nnational security letters or grand jury subpoenas. While there is \nstatutory authority for carriers to voluntarily provide the FBI with \nthe contents of the communication if the carrier has a good-faith \nbelief that an emergency involving death or serious physical injury \nrequires disclosure of the communication without delay, the DOJ IG \nfound that these exigent letter requests were issued on a routine, \nrather than an exigent, basis.\n  Interestingly, the people relying on the now corrected exigent letter \nproblem to justify their proposed restrictions on NSLs are not calling \nfor similar restrictions to be placed on grand jury subpoenas. They \nknow better than to try that because there would be immediate and \noverwhelming objections from the Department of Justice and nearly every \nU.S. attorney in the country. We cannot go back to pre-9/11 days, when \nnational security investigative techniques were significantly more \ndifficult to use than ordinary criminal investigative techniques.\n  Setting aside the problems with the exigent letters, I have said, \ntime and time again, that the errors identified by the DOJ IG were \nalmost exclusively administrative. The FBI has acted quickly to correct \nthese errors, and we should not respond by hamstringing their \ninvestigations.\n  I also disagree with requiring minimization procedures for both pen \nregisters/trap-and-trace devices and NSLs. The FBI has been clear about \nthe operational harm that will likely result if minimization procedures \nare required for the type of preliminary data, such as telephone toll \nrecords, obtained by these tools.\n  Aside from the basic problem of how the FBI would even go about \nminimizing this type of information, I do not see why it is necessary. \nWe certainly would never impose these types of restrictions on grand \njury subpoenas or other types of administrative subpoenas.\n  Supporters claim we need minimization procedures to protect U.S. \npersons, but they conveniently overlook the fact that the records we \nare talking about here are in the hands of third parties and are not \nentitled to the same type of protections that other information is \nsubject to.\n  The constitutional protections were discussed in Smith v. Maryland, \nand the Supreme Court held we simply do not have a reasonable \nexpectation of privacy with respect to these sorts of third-party \nrecords.\n  Ironically, because the FBI cannot tell from the type of information \nobtained by these tools if someone is a U.S. person, they would \nactually have to do more investigation and be more intrusive before \nfiguring out whether the information should be minimized.\n  Finally, I have significant concerns about the change the Judiciary \nCommittee bill makes to the notification period for sneak-and-peak \nsearch warrants--down from 30 to 7 days. These warrants, which are \napproved by a court upon a finding of probable cause, are an important \ntool in drug and certain terrorism cases. We know from the FBI--and I \nam sure if we asked the DEA, they would agree--that 7 days is not \nenough time before giving a target notice that a search was carried \nout. In a terrorism investigation, likely involving many overseas \nassociates and evidence, it is unreasonable to have to disclose the \ninvestigation within a week, when other activities connected to that \nmay be just beginning to be collected.\n  Depending on the type of information recovered from a search, testing \nand analysis may not even be done within 7 days. Are we going to risk \nblowing these investigations because of a random conclusion that 30 \ndays is too long? I understand the government can ask for more time \nafter the 7 days, but we do not have unlimited resources. We should not \nmake our law enforcement agencies jump through more hoops when a court \nhas already found that a search is proper in the first place.\n  I have other concerns about this bill, including the wisdom of a \nseparate standard for library records, which I view as an even greater \ninvitation for terrorists to use libraries to communicate with each \nother, and new reporting and auditing requirements. I have to wonder \nwhat additional administrative burdens these requirements will put on \nthe FBI at the same time they are trying to focus on preventing and \ndisrupting further attacks on our Nation.\n  Because of the significant operational concerns raised by the \nJudiciary Committee's bill, I believe that it should not be considered \nby the full Senate until the Intelligence Committee--as a whole--has \nhad the opportunity to consider its implications for our national \nsecurity, after hearing from Director Mueller about the impact of this \nentire bill on FBI operations.\n  There are many issues about the Judiciary bill--both classified and \nunclassified--that need to be addressed. The best venue in which to do \nthat is the Intelligence Committee. Don't forget that three of the five \ncrossover members from the Intelligence Committee voted against the \nJudiciary Committee bill. I would hardly call that a ringing \nendorsement. I believe full consideration by the Intelligence Committee \nwould greatly improve the measures we will be acting on, on the floor.\n  Unfortunately, my efforts to give the Intelligence Committee the \nopportunity to weigh in on the Judiciary bill have thus far been \nunsuccessful. But at the same time, we cannot risk letting these \ncrucial authorities lapse. For that reason, I have decided to cosponsor \nthe legislation we are introducing today because, under this bill, I \ncan categorically state it will have no provision that will have an \nadverse impact on intelligence community activities or operations.\n  It is not insignificant, in my opinion, that the bill we are \nintroducing today is cosponsored by the chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, and \nby me, as vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee.\n  Each of these committees has a role to play in safeguarding our \ndomestic security. Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Member Sessions, and I \nall understand the stakes in failing to reauthorize these expiring \nprovisions are high. The stakes in adding new and flawed provisions or \ncreating unreasonable burdens are just as high. It serves no legitimate \npurpose to give the FBI or any other law enforcement or intelligence \nagency tools that are rendered ineffective because Congress imposes \narbitrary conditions without fully appreciating their ramifications.\n  The sponsorship of this legislation is also noteworthy because it \nsends a clear and loud message that giving our law enforcement \nintelligence professionals the authorities and tools they need to keep \nthe country safe is not and should not be a partisan issue.\n  In the last Congress, we saw firsthand the negative impact of \npartisanship and pandering to extreme special interests. The FISA \nAmendments Act was supported by a strong bipartisan margin out of the \nSenate Intelligence Committee. Unfortunately, as the bill wound its way \nthrough the Senate and eventually the House, it became a political \nfootball. As a result, we came too close for comfort to losing the \nintelligence collection authorities we had worked hard to preserve.\n  I am hopeful we can avoid similar partisanship and political \ninterests to take over what should be a straightforward legislative \nprocess. The surest way of doing that is to pass the bill we introduce \ntoday.\n  For years, we have hammered away at the notion that there should be \nwalls between criminal and national security investigations. We have \nembraced the idea that the same tools that are used to capture drug \ndealers and child molesters should be available\n\n[[Page S10933]]\n\nto track terrorists and spies. While the idea has been generally \naccepted, the execution has been lacking. Our laws still impose \nunnecessary divisions between administrative and grand jury subpoena \nauthority and national security letters. Those divisions are \nexacerbated by the Judiciary Committee bill, which imposes new unheard \nof requirements on national security letters and the FISA pen register/\ntrap-and-trace information.\n  Over the past 8 years, Congress has placed heavy demands on the FBI \nto be a full participant in the intelligence community. While the \ntransportation has not been without some hiccups, they have come a long \nway since the days leading up to 9/11, when the word ``FISA'' was \nforeign to much of the rank and file FBI.\n  Now is not the time to saddle them with additional administrative \nburdens or to impose conditions on the use of certain tools so drastic \nthey become useless. There are so many current and clear-cut examples \nof domestic terror threats before us. I have to wonder why anyone \nthinks this would be a good time to experiment with the vital \nauthorities used to keep us safe.\n  The legislation we are introducing today will ensure our intelligence \nand law enforcement professionals can continue doing what they do best, \nwithout any additional restrictions. Our Nation has been fortunate not \nto have suffered a sequel to the 9/11 attacks. Some may call it luck, \nbut much of the credit goes to the dedicated work of our intelligence \nand law enforcement professionals and the availability of these tools \nthat we are reauthorizing in this bill.\n  We owe our thanks to the personnel who use them. We also owe them the \nrecognition that their jobs are as difficult as they are, and we should \nnot be taking any steps that will make their profound responsibility to \nprotect this country any more difficult. That is why I urge my \ncolleagues to support this measure.\n  I thank my cosponsor and our lead sponsor.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond for his thorough \nanalysis of the legislation that came out of the Judiciary Committee, \nand for bringing to bear on these great issues his vast experience as \nvice chair of the Intelligence Committee and his commitment to national \nsecurity and protecting this country.\n  He and Senator Lieberman represent the best of this body. They have \nthe ability to cut through ``flapdoodle'' and to get to the heart of \nmatters, and I appreciate so much their leadership.\n  Senator Lieberman, the Chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, \nhas been so involved in all of these matters. From the beginning, he \ntried to identify, as the 9/11 Commission did, the deficiencies in our \nsystem and tried to work toward a new way of doing business--all \nconsistent with our great heritages of liberty and civil rights.\n  I do think it is important to recognize that when Senator Lieberman \nasked the Director of the FBI: Is there one thing that we can do to \nhelp you do your job, the Director's answer was: Reauthorize the \nPATRIOT Act.\n  The bill we are introducing today represents the best parts of the \nlegislation that emerged from the Judiciary Committee--the parts almost \neveryone agreed upon. Our bill renews the three expiring PATRIOT Act \nauthorities: the rolling wiretaps authority, the business records \nprovision, and the ``lone wolf'' section of the Intelligence Reform and \nTerrorism Prevention Act of 2004. Our bill also fixes a deficiency in \nthe procedure for challenging the nondisclosure requirements of a key \nnational security tool, the national security letter.\n  Section 206, the roving wiretap provision, is a commonsense tool that \nis absolutely necessary in this day and age. It gives our agents the \nability to monitor a terrorist's phone call, even when he switches \nphones. Director Mueller told the Judiciary Committee this authority \nwas extremely important, considering how easy it is for terrorists to \nswitch cell phones.\n  Without this authority, a terrorist would be able to switch phones \nand defeat any order an investigator might have to wiretap a certain \ntelephone. As agents run back and forth to court to get repeated \npermissions to monitor telephone numbers, the suspect is able to avoid \nsurveillance.\n  Let me note that, in 1986, Congress approved a roving wiretap statute \nfor domestic law enforcement. As Senator Bond and Senator Lieberman \nsaid, so many of the provisions in the PATRIOT Act had already existed \nin the law for regular federal criminal investigations.\n  But it did help to create a system where national security matters \ncould be handled expeditiously before the FISA Court, a Federal court \nthat is experienced in these types of cases. The FISA Court maintains \nconfidentiality without the possibility of leaks, and is readily \nadvised on all the relevant case law involving terrorism matters.\n  So that is how the system works, and I think it is not at all unusual \nwhat we are proposing to do here in this bill.\n  Section 215--which my colleagues have referred to as the business \nrecords provision--allows agents and other Federal investigators to ask \nthe FISA Court for permission to get certain business records. \nGenerally, these records would be in the possession of third parties, \nnot the individual himself or herself. Examples would include records \nin the possession of a phone company, hotel records, bank records, or \ncar rental information. How important is that in a terrorism \ninvestigation? It can be absolutely critical because, for instance, \nterrorists often use cell phones and rental cars.\n  This is the type of information for which people have a diminished \nexpectation of privacy. These are not their records, they are the \nrental car company's records. These are not their telephone toll \nrecords, they are the phone company's records. Everybody at the phone \ncompany or the car rental agency has access to these records. These \nrecords are not secret in the same way as something in your desk, in \nyour home, or in your car, which would require the use of a search \nwarrant to be obtained by law enforcement. That is why subpoenas have \nbeen issued for these types of records for years. The Drug Enforcement \nAdministration can issue administrative subpoenas right now to obtain \nmany of these types of records, including bank records and telephone \ntoll records. These can be obtained by the Drug Enforcement \nAdministration without any court approval at all.\n  So I want my colleagues to know that the allegation that the PATRIOT \nAct represents an unprecedented transfer of power to the national \nsecurity investigators who are trying to protect us from terrorist \nattacks is not correct. The way things work in reality is that private \nbanks, telephone companies, and motels would be perfectly willing to \ngive records to investigators, and indeed they used to do that in days \npast without any subpoena because these records belong to them. But \nlawyers have gotten into it, and these entities have gotten worried. So \nvery frequently today hotel chains and other companies expect a \nsubpoena before they can turn over records pertaining to their \ncustomers. That is what section 215 is designed to deal with.\n  When investigating terrorism, time can be critical. Section 215 \nallows a court to order a company to turn over records in it \npossession. This key information is usually not in the possession of \nperson under investigation, but in a third party's possession. Section \n215 merely allows a court to order a business to do what is legally \npermitted to do anyway: help our officials pursue and catch terrorists. \nThis is very similar--almost identical--to grand jury subpoena \nauthority, which has been used by Federal prosecutors, State \nprosecutors, State attorneys general, county attorneys, and Federal \ninvestigators routinely for decades. This is not some sort of collapse \nof American freedoms and liberties.\n  The ``lone wolf'' section of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism \nPrevention Act of 2004 is a commonsense provision we need to continue \nthe fight against terrorists in the 21st century. Even though it has \nnot been used yet, it is there to defend against a very real \npossibility, like the Moussaoui matter Senator Bond made reference to. \nIt deals with the rogue terrorist who is not linked to a larger \nterrorist group, or at least where there is no proof of that link at a \ngiven time. In the past, the law required that national security \nagencies show a connection between\n\n[[Page S10934]]\n\nthe terrorist and a terrorist group or foreign power in order to \nmonitor him. This could cause a problem if a terrorist or a foreign \nagent left a terror group, perhaps because of a dispute. Let's say you \nhave a lawful, court-approved wiretap and the individual being \nmonitored says on it: You are not aggressive enough. You are too timid. \nI want to blow up this building in Washington, DC; you don't. Count me \nout. I am no longer a part of your group.\n  Well, since this suspect would be disconnected from a terrorist \norganization, under previous law he would not subject to key national \nsecurity surveillance techniques. So, you can have a ``lone wolf'' \nunder certain circumstances. In the Moussaoui case, investigators were \nnot able to get a search warrant for his computer because it was felt \nthat there was not sufficient proof that he was connected to a specific \nterrorist organization. This was even though Moussaoui's own activities \ncreated so much danger that an FBI lawyer went to great lengths to try \nto get approval to get that search warrant, but ultimately failed to do \nso. Had that search warrant been approved and that computer examined, \nmany think 9/11 may not have occurred.\n  This ``lone wolf'' provision has had bipartisan support in the past. \nIt was originally authored by Senator Schumer, our Democratic colleague \nfrom New York. It is a commonsense way to deal with this very real \nissue and should be reauthorized without delay.\n  Finally, our bill fixes the problem found by the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit in the case of Doe v. Mukasey. That case \naddressed the legal standard courts use to review nondisclosure \nrequirements: for example, where a motel would be required not to tell \na terrorist staying there that it has given records to the FBI. The \nSecond Circuit held that the legal standard at issue was too \ndeferential to the government. Our bill would fix this problem in the \nsame manner, almost word for word, as the legislation that emerged from \nthe Judiciary Committee in the past few weeks. In other words, we have \ngiven more protection to civil liberties, as the court suggested.\n  So as the recent slew of terrorism arrests makes so painfully clear, \nthe threat of violent Islamic extremism is severe and ongoing. We \ncannot afford to let our guard down for a single moment. The threat is \ntoo great and too real and the stakes too high.\n  Our agents risk their lives every day to investigate terrorist plots \nand prevent another attack against the United States. Congress must \nmove with the same urgency to reauthorize these lifesaving provisions \nbefore they expire. I believe this bipartisan bill is basically the \nsame bill as we approved before and provides a commonsense and \nnoncontroversial path to a timely reauthorization, and I hope my \ncolleagues will support it. We simply need to get busy and get this \nwork done.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 2336\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 328\n\n       Whereas, between 1945 and 1961, more than 2,500,000 people, \n     or 15 percent of the total population of the German \n     Democratic Republic (referred to in this preamble as ``East \n     Germany''), left the country to pursue economic opportunity \n     and enjoy the benefits of liberty and political freedom in \n     the Federal Republic of Germany (referred to in this preamble \n     as ``West Germany'') and other countries;\n       Whereas, at midnight on August 13, 1961, East Germany \n     sealed its border with West Berlin and began construction of \n     a 100-mile barrier that would later include bunkers, \n     watchtowers, searchlights, minefields, barbed wire, concrete \n     walls, and armed guards, to prevent the emigration of the \n     people of East Germany to seek freedom and opportunity \n     elsewhere;\n       Whereas, during the 28 years the Berlin Wall existed, \n     approximately 5,000 people successfully fled East Germany for \n     West Germany and West Berlin, more than 75,000 people were \n     imprisoned for attempting to leave East Germany, and an \n     estimated 1,200 people were killed trying to escape;\n       Whereas Presidents John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan \n     declared their vision of Berlin as a free city, in the heart \n     of a free Germany;\n       Whereas Chancellor Willi Brandt of West Germany and others \n     demonstrated great foresight in their pursuit of \n     ``Ostpolitik'', a policy of engagement that lowered tensions \n     and ultimately helped undermine the authoritarian rule of the \n     wall-builders;\n       Whereas more than 22,000,000 Americans served in the Cold \n     War, supporting the efforts to bring military, economic, and \n     diplomatic pressure to bear in the defense of Germany and the \n     West, and ultimately helping more than 400,000,000 people \n     gain their freedom from the bondage of communism in the \n     Soviet Bloc;\n       Whereas the Solidarity Movement in Poland demonstrated that \n     the will of a people united could not be silenced by winning \n     a surprise landslide victory in elections to the Contract \n     Sejm in June 1989;\n       Whereas, on August 23, 1989, Hungary officially opened the \n     border between Hungary and Austria, resulting in 13,000 \n     refugees from East Germany fleeing into West Germany through \n     Hungary;\n       Whereas, on September 4, 1989, after prayers for peace in \n     the Nikolai Church, crowds that would eventually number in \n     the hundreds of thousands gathered in Leipzig, East Germany, \n     to repeatedly and peacefully protest the authoritarian regime \n     of East Germany and to demand basic freedoms;\n       Whereas, in September 1989, thousands of people in East \n     Germany took refuge in the embassy of West Germany in Prague, \n     Czechoslovakia, in order to emigrate to West Germany and the \n     West;\n       Whereas, on October 18, 1989, faced with widespread civil \n     unrest and a deteriorating political situation, East German \n     leader Erich Honecker, who had predicted that the Wall ``will \n     stand in fifty or a hundred years,'' resigned;\n       Whereas, on November 4, 1989, more than 1,000,000 people \n     gathered in Alexanderplatz in East Berlin and 40 other cities \n     and towns in East Germany to demand free elections and basic \n     civil rights, such as freedoms of opinion, movement, press, \n     and assembly;\n       Whereas, on November 9, 1989, East German politbureau \n     member Gunter Schabowki announced that the government would \n     allow ``every citizen of the German Democratic Republic to \n     leave the GDR through any of the border crossings,'' and East \n     German leader Egon Krenz promised ``free, general, democratic \n     and secret elections'';\n       Whereas thousands of people in East Berlin immediately \n     flooded the border checkpoints at the Berlin Wall and \n     demanded entry into West Berlin, causing the overwhelmed \n     border guards of East Germany to open the checkpoints to \n     allow people to cross into West Berlin;\n       Whereas, in the days following the fall of the Berlin Wall, \n     hundreds of thousands of people from East Germany freely \n     crossed the border into West Berlin and West Germany for the \n     first time in more than 28 years;\n       Whereas the Chancellor of West Germany Helmut Kohl and \n     Foreign Minister Hans Dietrich Genscher managed the political \n     situation and foreign diplomacy with great tact and in close \n     cooperation with Western allies, leading to the peaceful \n     reunification of Germany as a sovereign, democratic state on \n     October 3, 1990;\n       Whereas, on November 9, 2009, the people of Germany will \n     celebrate on both sides of the Brandenburg Gate the 20th \n     anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall with the \n     ``Festival of Freedom'';\n       Whereas the fall of the Berlin Wall was one of the \n     milestones of the 20th century, brought about by the actions \n     of many ordinary and some extraordinary people; and\n       Whereas the fall of the Berlin Wall embodied the end of the \n     division of Europe, the opening of the Iron Curtain, and the \n     triumph of democracy over communism: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the 20th anniversary of the fall of the \n     Berlin Wall;\n       (2) celebrates 20 years of an undivided Europe, free from \n     the oppression of authoritarianism, with the people of the \n     former communist countries and Western Europe;\n       (3) honors the service and sacrifice of the people of \n     Germany, the United States, and other countries who served in \n     the Cold War to bring freedom to Central and Eastern Europe;\n       (4) expresses its appreciation to the people of Germany for \n     their commitment to preserving the dignity and freedom of \n     others in their leadership on international assistance, \n     peacekeeping, and security efforts, including in Afghanistan, \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina, Georgia, Kosovo, Lebanon, Sudan, and \n     off the coast of the Horn of Africa; and\n       (5) reaffirms the friendship between the Government and \n     people of the United States and the Government and people of \n     Germany.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 329--RECOGNIZING THE MONTH OF OCTOBER 2009 AS \n                     ``NATIONAL PRINCIPALS MONTH''\n\n  Mr. DORGAN (for himself, Mr. Baucus, Ms. Collins, Mr. Conrad, Mr. \nSchumer, Mr. Akaka, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Franken, Ms. Mikulski, and Ms. \nMurkowski) submitted the following resolution; which was considered and \nagreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I am happy we are going to have a Surgeon \nGeneral. We have waited far too long. This is a good woman. She \ndeserved this a long time ago. I appreciate whoever was holding her up \nallowing us to go forward. It is important for the country. We have a \nflu pandemic that has been declared. It is an emergency. We have so \nmany other problems. We need this doctor who has devoted her life to \ntaking care of the ill to take care of the entire country.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the nomination of \nDr. Regina Benjamin to be Surgeon General. The vetting process for \nexecutive nominees is thorough, and Dr. Benjamin has successfully \ncompleted that process. Her nomination was approved unanimously by the \nHELP Committee on October 7 by a voice vote.\n  The mission of the Surgeon General is to be America's ``top doctor,'' \nand to act as the chief medical educator and communicator on public \nhealth and safety issues. Dr. Benjamin has a distinguished career in \nproviding health care to low-income individuals. We also share an \nunderstanding of the unique challenges facing people in rural and \nunderserved areas. I am confident that Dr. Benjamin will be able to \narticulately inform Americans on matters of health safety.\n  Dr. Benjamin will become Surgeon General at a key time during the \nH1N1 pandemic influenza epidemic and subsequent supply shortage of the \nH1N1 vaccine. I am pleased she\n\n[[Page S10943]]\n\nwill soon be able to assist with these efforts and play a role in \nupdating the American people on the status of the epidemic.\n  I was pleased to vote for Dr. Benjamin's nomination in the HELP \nCommittee and look forward to her swift confirmation today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/29/senate-section/article/S10943-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
