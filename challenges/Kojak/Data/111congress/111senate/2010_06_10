Madam President, I am delighted to be here today to \nwelcome our guest Chaplain, Dr. Joseph Castleberry, to the Senate. Dr. \nCastleberry is president of Northwest University in Kirkland, a town \nnot far from where I grew up in Bothell, WA.\n  Northwest is a Christian university comprised of six schools and \ncolleges, including arts and sciences, business education, nursing, \nsocial and behavioral sciences, and ministry. The university offers \nabout 50 undergraduate programs, eight master's degree programs, and a \ndoctor of psychology program.\n  The school prides itself on its three core values of spiritual \nvitality, academic excellence, and empowered engagement.\n  Dr. Castleberry is an ordained minister in the Assemblies of God, the \nuniversity's sponsoring denomination. His distinguished career has \nfocused on both faith and education. He earned a bachelor of arts \ndegree from Evangel University in 1983, a master of divinity degree \nfrom Princeton Theological Seminary in 1988, and a doctor of education \ndegree in international educational development from Teachers College, \nColumbia University, in 1999.\n  In addition to that impressive background, Dr. Castleberry has a wide \narray of experience as a missionary, educator, and pastor. For over two \ndecades, in fact, he served communities throughout Central and South \nAmerica where he was involved in education, church planning, and \ncommunity development.\n  Dr. Castleberry is the founder of the Freedom Valley Project. It is a \ncommunity development ministry among African-American people of \nEcuador's Chota Valley region. He is active in a number of academic and \ncultural programs devoted to furthering interreligious understanding \nand dialog.\n  Dr. Castleberry and his wife Kathleen have three daughters--Jessica, \nJodie, and Sophie. I was also very amazed to learn that he speaks a \nremarkable 10 languages.\n\n[[Page S4788]]\n\n  I am very pleased Dr. Castleberry could join us in the Senate today. \nI thank him for his service to the students and faculty at Northwest \nUniversity, as well as his dedication to helping communities around the \nworld.\n  I also thank Senate Chaplain Dr. Black for inviting Dr. Castleberry \nto deliver the opening prayer for the Senate this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, the Murkowski resolution, which we will \ntake up soon, will increase pollution, increase our dependence on \nforeign oil, and stall our efforts to create jobs and, in so doing, \nstall our efforts to move to a clean energy economy.\n  This resolution does nothing to create jobs in Nevada or anyplace \nelse in our country. It does create jobs in places from where we are \nimporting oil--the Middle East, Venezuela, places such as that--but not \nin our country.\n  In fact, this resolution will damage the certainty and clarity that \nbusinesses want to invest in innovative and job-creating technologies \nthat reduce pollution. This includes clean renewable power using the \nSun, the wind, and geothermal energy.\n  This resolution is not going to help bring us closer to providing \nmore incentives for the production or use of clean-burning natural gas. \nThis resolution is not going to help provide funding for Nevadans or \nAlaskans or any other State to cope with and adapt to a changing and \nincreasingly unfriendly climate.\n  Forcing this vote seems to be a largely partisan political ploy \ndesigned to divide Democrats and Republicans and to pander to the \ndirty, just-say-no crowd. They want business as usual with no limits on \ntheir ability to pollute.\n  The White House has made it clear that the Murkowski resolution would \nbe vetoed if it passes. We all know, in fact, if it does pass and a \nveto is made, that it would be sustained.\n  We also know that this resolution is a great big gift to big oil, at \nleast 455 million more barrels of oil would be used, making at least \n$50 billion extra for the oil companies, and billions more if this \nresolution were to become law. And most of that oil will come from \noverseas. We know that.\n  Is this the kind of business as usual the American people want? Of \ncourse not. No, the public wants companies to give them choices of \ncars, products, and fuels that are less polluting, affordable, and made \nin America, not from the Persian Gulf, China, or other places.\n  This resolution is very much a choice about the future of our \ncountry. Do we want to return to the days when big oil and their \nfriends, with OPEC's help, decided America's economic destiny or are we \ngoing to work together to solve the incredibly difficult problems posed \nby the way we produce and use energy? Are we going to work together to \nreduce pollution?\n  I am convinced that we can pass strong, bipartisan legislation to \ncreate jobs, protect the environment, and make a safer and more secure \nfuture. But that would require the help of everyone in the Senate to be \ninvolved in a constructive engagement, and only a few have stepped \nforward. I hope that changes soon.\n  Will the Chair announce the business before the Senate?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4788-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, later today, the Senate will vote on \nan issue of vital importance to every American family and business, and \nthat is whether the Environmental Protection Agency should be allowed \nto impose a backdoor national energy tax on the American people.\n  This vote is needed because of the administration's insistence on \nadvancing its goals by any means possible, in this case by going around \nthe legislative branch and imposing this massive, job-killing tax on \nAmericans through an unaccountable Federal agency.\n  Ironically, just last year, President Obama and EPA Administrator \nLisa Jackson took the position that on an issue of this magnitude, \nwhich touches every corner of our economy, Congress, not the EPA, \nshould determine how to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But now that \nit is clear Congress will not pass this new national energy tax this \nyear, the administration has shifted course and is now trying to get \ndone through the backdoor what they have not been able to get through \nthe front door.\n  Like the cap-and-trade legislation they would replace, these EPA \nregulations would raise the price of everything from electricity to \ngasoline to fertilizer to food on our supermarket shelves. That is why \ngroups representing farmers, builders, manufacturers, small business \nowners, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce are so strongly opposed to \nthese EPA regulations and so supportive of the Murkowski resolution to \nstop them.\n  These groups know these backdoor moves by EPA will deal a devastating \nblow to an economy already in rough shape. And so does the President. \nHe said himself that his plan would cause electricity prices for \nconsumers to ``necessarily skyrocket.'' The President himself said this \nplan would cause prices for consumers to ``necessarily skyrocket.''\n  At a time of nearly 10-percent unemployment, these new regulations \nwould kill U.S. jobs. According to one estimate, the House cap-and-\ntrade bill would kill more than 2 million U.S. jobs and put American \nbusinesses at a disadvantage to their competitors overseas.\n  Closer to home, these regulations would be especially devastating for \nStates such as Kentucky and other Midwestern coal States. EPA \nregulations resulting in dramatic energy price increases would \njeopardize the livelihoods of the 17,000 miners in our State and an \nadditional 51,000 jobs that depend on coal production and the low cost \nof electricity that Kentuckians enjoy. That is why in the last few days \nalone, my office has received more than 1,000 letters, e-mails, and \nphone calls from Kentuckians opposed to this effort from EPA.\n  A lot of Kentuckians work hard to ensure that our State has the \nlowest industrial electricity rate in the Nation, and that is something \nwe are proud of at home.\n  This bill would lead to a dramatic increase in these electricity \nrates, punishing businesses both large and small.\n  But the job losses would not stop there. As I indicated, this \nbackdoor energy tax would be felt on farms as well, where increased \nenergy and fertilizer prices would drive up costs for farmers and \nlivestock producers who do not have the ability to pass on these \nincreases. This would be an especially painful blow to them, and that \nis why the Farm Bureau and many other farm groups oppose what the EPA \nis trying to do.\n  There are many different views in this body on how to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. Some favor the Kerry-\n\n[[Page S4789]]\n\nLieberman cap-and-trade bill, a significant portion of which, by the \nway, has been pushed by the oil company BP. Many Members on this side \nof the aisle have proposals they support as well.\n  One thing we should be able to agree on is that the worst possible \noutcome is for the unelected bureaucrats at the EPA to unilaterally \nimpose these job-killing regulations. That is why it is my hope that \nlater this afternoon we will vote to stop this blatant power grab by \nthe administration and EPA and pass Senator Murkowski's legislation to \nstop this backdoor national energy tax dead in its tracks.\n  This effort by the EPA would be devastating for jobs and an economy \nthat needs them desperately. It is bad for the economy and bad for \nrepresentative democracy. It should be stopped.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4789-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4789-S4836]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        RESOLUTION OF DISAPPROVAL OF EPA RULE--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, during the Memorial Day recess, we \nreceived two pieces of alarming news that should inform the work of \nevery Member in this Chamber. First, we learned the national debt has \nsurpassed $13 trillion in total, and then shortly after that, we \nlearned that nearly all the jobs that were added in May came from \ntemporary census positions. The private sector created just 41,000 jobs \nlast month--many fewer than expected and certainly a far cry from the \npace that will allow us to dig out from under this economic recession.\n  I think we all recognize there is no question that our recovery is \nstill fragile--very much in doubt. It is also quite clear it will take \nsome time for millions of unemployed Americans to find their jobs and \nget back on their feet again. These tough facts should encourage us to \nfocus on these policies that create jobs, that reduce our debt, and at \nthe same time should encourage us to guard against policies that fail \nin either or both of those areas.\n  Madam President, we are here today to debate a policy that works \nagainst both of those goals--the Environmental Protection Agency's \neffort to impose economy-wide climate regulations under the Clean Air \nAct. The sweeping powers being pursued by the EPA are the worst \npossible option for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and there is \nbroad bipartisan agreement that this approach would forgo all of the \nbenefits, all of the protections that are possible through legislation. \nIt would reduce emissions at an unreasonably high cost and through an \nunnecessarily bureaucratic process. It would amount to an unprecedented \npower grab, ceding Congress's responsibilities to unelected \nbureaucrats, and move a very important debate, a critical debate, from \nour open halls to behind an agency's closed doors.\n  This approach should have been, could have been taken off the table \nlong ago. Yet because the EPA is determined to move forward \naggressively and because neither Congress nor the administration has \nacted to stop them, it is now in the process of becoming our Nation's \nde facto energy and climate policy.\n  Because this is our worst option to reduce emissions and Congress \nneeds time to develop a more appropriate solution, I have introduced a \nresolution of disapproval--I introduced this back in January--to halt \nthe EPA's regulations. My resolution does not affect the science behind \nthe endangerment finding, but it will prevent the finding from being \nenforced through economy-wide regulations.\n  Forty other Senators here in this body have joined me and are \ncosponsors of this effort. Our resolution has garnered significant \nsupport among the American people, and from the day it was introduced, \nwe have had individuals and we have had groups and organizations from \nall across the country that have expressed their support and their \nappreciation. It really is a tremendous coalition, a significant \ncoalition from farmers and manufacturers, to small business owners, to \nfish processors. There are more than 530 stakeholder groups that have \nendorsed our resolution's passage, and I will tell you, when you look \nat some of those groups, you would not put them in a category where you \nwould say: Well, this is an entity that is standing up to fight, to \npush back against the EPA. But I will suggest to you that the broad \nrange of stakeholders is really quite impressive.\n  Despite that support, I will still be the first to admit that we face \nan uphill battle. We oppose the EPA's regulations because of their \ncosts, most definitely. But, unfortunately, that seems to be precisely \nwhy some Senators have gone out front to support them, hoping these \neconomic costs will be so onerous that it will force us here in the \nCongress, here in the Senate, to adopt legislation we otherwise \nwouldn't move to do.\n  This has been an interesting, sometimes difficult and contentious \nseveral months as we have moved forward with this resolution of \ndisapproval. Personal attacks have been directed at supporters of this \nresolution in an effort, I think, to intimidate others from adding \ntheir names.\n  The EPA Administrator has, somewhat incredibly, suggested our \nresolution was somehow related to the oilspill that is ongoing in the \ngulf. Some have even claimed the resolution is a bailout for the oil \ncompanies and are trying to make sure we don't let another crisis go to \nwaste--in other individuals' terms--in their efforts to pass sweeping \ncap-and-trade measures. I would suggest that the only similarity I see \nbetween the spill in the Gulf of Mexico and the EPA's regulations is \nthat both of these are unmitigated disasters. One is happening now; the \nother one is waiting in the wings if Congress fails to adopt this \nresolution.\n  This decision--where we are today here in the Senate debating this \nresolution of disapproval--ultimately boils down to four substantive \nfactors. The first one is the inappropriateness of the Clean Air Act \nfor reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The second is the likelihood \nthat the courts will strike down the tailoring rule. Then we also have \nthe lack of economic analysis from the EPA, which is stunning--that we \ndo not have a better sense in terms of what the economic impact of \nthese regulations will be. Then finally and certainly above all else is \nthe undisputed fact that climate policy should be written here in \nCongress. It is not just Lisa Murkowski who says that, and it is not \njust the other 40 Senators who have signed on as cosponsors to this \nresolution of disapproval; it is everyone from the President, to the \nAdministrator of the EPA, to colleagues on the House side who have said \ntime and time again that it should be the Congress, it should be those \nof us who are elected Members of this body who set the policy of this \ncountry and not the unelected bureaucrats within an agency.\n  I would like to speak to each of these four factors in a little \ngreater detail, so I will start by examining why the Clean Air Act is \nsuch an awful choice for reducing these emissions. I have explained \nthis many times before, so I will reiterate two main points here--first \nis the way these regulations are carried out.\n  You have command-and-control directives that are issued by the \ngovernment that affect every aspect of our lives, rather than market-\nbased decisions made by consumers and businesses. I wish to reinforce \nthat, the fact that these are directives that will impact every aspect \nof our lives.\n  When we were debating health care reform here on this floor not too \nmany months ago, it was repeated time and time again that it was so \nimportant we get this right because health care reform will impact one-\nsixth of our economy. Well, I would suggest to you that when we are \ntalking about climate policy, that is something which is going to \nimpact every aspect--100 percent--of our economy.\n  The system imposed by the EPA will entail millions of permit \ndecisions--millions of permit decisions--by midlevel EPA employees, \nwithout effective recourse, and it will leave regulated entities with \nvery little flexibility to comply.\n  Another reason the Clean Air Act is extremely complicated for \nreducing greenhouse gas emissions: the Clean Air Act's explicit \nregulatory thresholds. They absolutely put an exclamation mark on why \nthis law is such a poor choice for addressing climate change.\n  Under the Clean Air Act, if you emit more than 100 or 250 tons of a \npollutant each year, you must acquire a Federal air permit. These \nrelatively low limits\n\n[[Page S4790]]\n\nmake sense for conventional air pollutants that are emitted in small \nquantities, but they become wildly problematic when dealing with a \nsubstance emitted in huge volumes through nearly every form of \ncommerce, such as carbon dioxide is.\n  So the question needs to be asked, then, how big is this new \nregulatory act we are talking about? The EPA recently projected that \nsome 6.1 million sources could be required to obtain new title V \noperating permits. Under the current regulations, the EPA is dealing \nwith about 15,000. So the EPA would now be charged with moving up \ndramatically from regulating and issuing about 15,000 title V operating \npermits to some 6.1 million permits. Whom does this include? It would \ninclude millions of residential buildings, small businesses, schools, \nhospitals, and restaurants found in every town in America.\n  Over time, the EPA's approach would increase their regulation by an \norder of magnitude, and the consequences would be just as enormous. And \nno one is more aware of this very uncomfortable fact than the EPA \nitself. They know they can't go from the 15,000 permits they currently \ndeal with on an annual basis up to 6.1 million permits. That is why the \nAgency has attempted to very dramatically increase the threshold for \ngreenhouse gases in its tailoring rule. They are unhappy with the plain \nlanguage, the very direct language of the Clean Air Act. The Agency \nplans to lift its limits up to 1,000 times higher than Congress has \ndirected.\n  So what you have is a situation where the EPA has simply not accepted \nthat the Clean Air Act is not structured for this task, and instead \nthey have attempted to make it so by ignoring the plain language--the \nplain language that says you have to regulate at 100 or 250 tons per \nyear. They are effectively unilaterally amending the Clean Air Act.\n  Equally astounding is that by temporarily relieving part of a \npermitting burden, the EPA is claiming that consumers and businesses--\nthe people who purchase and the people who use the energy--will face no \neconomic impact, which is incredible to believe.\n  I ask my colleagues to think about the logic behind the tailoring \nrule. The EPA is asking us to accept that while greenhouse gases are \nnot in the Clean Air Act, the Congress clearly intended them to be \nregulated under it. At the same time, we are expected to believe that \nwhile explicit regulatory thresholds are in the act, Congress meant for \nthe EPA to ignore them. Well, Madam President, I would suggest to you \nthat is a pretty thin read, and it becomes even thinner when you \nconsider the changes that are made between the tailoring rule that was \nproposed just last year and then the final rulemaking that was issued \njust last month.\n  In last year's draft, what you saw was the EPA planning to ratchet \ndown to the Clean Air Act's actual threshold levels--to get down to the \n250 tons per year--and to put that into effect over the course of the \nnext 5 years. Now the EPA is suggesting that it may exempt entire \nsectors and never even reach the statutory limits. Think about it. What \nhappens then? That is when the lawsuits pop up. This is not going to \nprovide the level of certainty I think those in business are seeking. \nWhat you will see is lawsuits as some sectors and some sources are \nregulated while others are not. And I would suggest that difference \nbetween the tailoring proposal from last year and where we are now is \ndriven not by the law but by fear of the political backlash out there--\nthe outrage from people all over the country in terms of the negative \neconomic impact to them and their families and their communities.\n  That is why it is tough to find an impartial legal expert who \nbelieves this tailoring rule will actually hold up in court. Consider a \nspeech given last year by Judge David Tatel of the DC Circuit Court of \nAppeals. This was a speech on how the EPA can avoid being sued over its \nrulemakings. Judge Tatel said:\n\n       . . . whether or not agencies value neutral principles of \n     administrative law, courts do, and they will strike down \n     agency action that violates those principles--whatever the \n     President's party, however popular the administration, and no \n     matter how advisable the initiative.\n\n  Those were the comments from a DC Circuit judge specifically on this \nissue as to how the EPA avoids lawsuits.\n  Let me move to the third area of concern I have with EPA moving to \nregulate in the area of greenhouse gas emissions--the economic \nconsequences of EPA regulation. We have to ask the question: What \nexactly are those consequences? Believe it or not, at this point in \ntime we still do not know because the EPA has refused to provide \nprojections of the economic impacts. In the various rulemakings out \nthere, the Agency has engaged in something of a shell game. They are \neither hiding or they are simply not considering the economic cost.\n  The EPA has also ignored requests from Members of Congress. I have \nasked them, and other Members of Congress have asked, to conduct this \nvery important analysis, but to this day the Agency still has not \nprovided anything close to a full projection of the economic impact its \neconomy-wide climate regulations will have.\n  I guess there were a couple of reasons. The EPA either has no cost \nestimates or they know they are too astronomical to calculate, and they \ndo not want them released. My staff has had numerous briefings with EPA \nofficials, and they have been told essentially that we will not know \nhow much these regulations cost until the best available control \ntechnologies are imposed on the regulated entities; that is, until the \nEPA figures out how to deal with what it signed itself up for.\n  The problem is, the best available control technologies remain \ncompletely undefined at this point. It could mean efficiency \nimprovements, expensive add-on technologies, or even fuel-switching \nrequirements. Over time, the EPA would have very little choice but to \nimpose all of those requirements and more, regardless of the \nconsequences.\n  Again, it is not hard to find this quite amazing and alarming. We \nneed to be growing our economy not paralyzing it. Everything we do \nright now within this body should be focused on how we grow our \neconomy, how we grow the jobs from Maine to Alaska and points in \nbetween. We know the national unemployment rate remains at almost 10 \npercent. Private sector job growth is anemic. Yet as millions of \nAmericans are doing everything they can just to find work, bureaucrats \nin Washington, DC, are contemplating regulations that would destroy \nthese opportunities.\n  Worse still, the people of our States have no voice in this \nbureaucratic process. They are on the verge of being subjected to \nrules, subjected to regulations that will directly impact their lives, \ntheir livelihoods, their economic opportunities, without ever having an \nopportunity to express their concerns through their Representatives in \nCongress.\n  That brings me to my final point. Politically accountable Members of \nthe House and the Senate, not unelected bureaucrats, must develop our \nNation's energy and climate policies. It is as direct as that. Those \npolicies must be able to pass on their own merits instead of serving as \na defense against ill-considered regulations.\n  I have said this before, but it bears repeating: Congress will not \npass--should not pass--bad legislation in order to stave off bad \nregulations. We are neither incapable nor unwilling to legislate on \nenergy and environmental policy. We have demonstrated this in the past. \nWe did this with landmark environmental legislation such as the Clean \nAir Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Safe Drinking Water Act. We can, \nwe should, and we will deal with these environmental challenges that \nface us. But forgoing legislation in favor of regulation would \nsacrifice the priorities and protections that are sought by just about \nevery Member of the Senate.\n  The things that are being considered when we talk about climate \nlegislation are worker training, funding for clean technologies, energy \nsecurity enhancements, border adjustments, manufacturing concessions--\nthese would all go by the wayside if climate policy is directed through \nregulation as opposed to legislation. There will be no agricultural \noffsets, no free allowances, no banking, and no borrowing under the \nClean Air Act. There will be no funding for climate research or \nadaptation, no protection for consumers, and no assistance for \nbusinesses or workers.\n  I do understand some Members say they will only support climate \nlegislation that puts a price on emissions.\n\n[[Page S4791]]\n\nThey are frustrated that we in the Senate have not done that--have not \nagreed to do that yet. But I do not believe that mandating higher \nenergy costs and imposing regulations on consumers and businesses is \nthe only way to solve this challenge.\n  Some have likened the EPA regulation as the gun to the head of \nCongress that will force us somehow to act more quickly on climate \nlegislation than we otherwise would. I think, sadly, a few Members of \nthe Senate have actually bought into this coercive strategy. Throughout \nthe yearlong debate on this issue--and it has been just about a year. \nIt was last September that I attempted to introduce legislation that \nwould put the EPA in a 1-year timeout. I was not allowed to bring that \nmeasure to the Senate floor. But throughout this yearlong debate on the \nissue, opponents have refused to discuss the actual impacts of EPA \nregulation. So I want my colleagues to listen today, listen to the \ndebate. See if any opponents actually defend such regulation as being \ngood for America.\n  Instead, we are going to hear red herrings about science, about fuel \nstandards, about the oilspill. But as much as some would want it to be, \nthis debate is not about the science of climate change. It is not a \nreferendum on any other legislation that is pending in the Senate, nor \nis it about fuel efficiency. The Department of Transportation is and \nhas been in charge for 35 years now, and we do not need another agency \nand another standard thrown into the mix to do the same job.\n  We updated our Nation's CAFE standards less than 3 years ago to at \nleast 35 miles per gallon, and we left DOT in charge of their \nadministration. We also outlined a very rational process for standards \nfor medium- and heavy-duty trucks. Every target set by this \nadministration can be met with existing authorities. As the Department \nof Transportation has admitted, our resolution does not directly impact \ntheir ability to regulate the efficiency and thus the greenhouse gas \nemissions of motor vehicles.\n  There is one very small potential exception and that is air-\nconditioning, but I have very little doubt that we would gladly provide \nEPA with the specific authority to regulate those systems instead of \nbroad powers over our entire economy.\n  The EPA does not need to take over this process, and it should not be \nallowed to do so under a law that was never intended to regulate fuel \neconomy. I understand concerns about a patchwork of standards and how \ndifficult it would be for the industry to comply. But while we had one \nnational standard at the start of 2009, we now have two national \nstandards set by two Federal agencies driven by California's standards. \nI have a letter from the National Automobile Dealers Association dated \njust yesterday that spells this out quite clearly. They indicate that \nit in no way helps us to have, again, two national standards set by two \nFederal agencies. The best way to avoid a messy patchwork would be to \npass our disapproval resolution, revoke California's waiver, and allow \none Federal agency to set one standard that works for all 50 States.\n  Bringing climate science, the oilspill, and fuel economy into this \ndebate are attempts at misdirection. They are red herrings that are \nintended to convince Members to oppose the resolution of disapproval. \nBut this debate has nothing to do with those topics. It is about \nfinding the best approach to reduce emissions and defending against \npolicies that fail to strike an adequate balance between the \nenvironment and our economy. It is about maintaining the separation of \npowers between the legislative and the executive branches as our \nFounding Fathers intended and rejecting an unprecedented overreach by \nthe EPA into the affairs of Congress. At its core, this is a debate \nabout jobs, about whether we should seek conditions that will lead to \ntheir creation or enable policies that will destroy them.\n  This is our chance to make sure that Federal bureaucrats do not place \na new burden on millions of hard-working Americans at a time that they \ncannot afford it and in a way they cannot reject. The time has come to \ntake the worst option for regulating greenhouse gases off the table \nonce and for all.\n  Under the procedures of the Congressional Review Act, I accordingly \nmove to proceed to the consideration of S.J. Res. 26. I encourage \nMembers of this Chamber to support debate on this measure and to vote \nin favor of both the motion to proceed and final passage.\n  I know under the unanimous consent agreement, this morning and \nthroughout the day it is 30 minutes per side. I am not certain how much \ntime I have consumed this morning, if the chair can instruct me?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2 minutes remaining\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I know Senator Lincoln was hoping to come over this \nmorning. What I will do at this point in time, if I may reserve those 2 \nminutes, seeing that Senator Lincoln is not yet here, we can move to \nthe Democratic side of the aisle, if Senator Boxer is ready to proceed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The motion having been made, under the previous order there will now \nbe up to 5\\1/2\\ hours of debate on the motion to proceed with the time \ndivided and controlled, in alternating 30-minute blocks, by the Senator \nfrom California and Senator from Alaska.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, this is a very important debate. The \nMurkowski resolution we are considering today would overturn the \nendangerment finding developed by scientists and health experts in both \nthe Bush and Obama administrations that too much carbon pollution in \nthe air is dangerous--dangerous for our families, dangerous for our \nenvironment. Imagine, 100 Senators--not scientists, not health \nexperts--deciding what pollutant is dangerous and what pollutant is \nnot. Personally, I believe it is ridiculous for politicians, elected \nSenators, to make this scientific decision. It is not our expertise; it \nis not our purview.\n  The Murkowski resolution threatens jobs, jobs that we need, that are \nmade in America for America.\n  Our hearts break every day that we look at what is happening in the \nGulf. It seems to me more than ironic that Senator Murkowski is \nadvocating repealing the scientific finding that too much carbon \npollution in the air is dangerous, at the same time every American sees \ngraphic evidence on television every single day of the deadly carbon \npollution in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  We see here in the saddest pictures what too much carbon-based \npollution does in water, what it does to our shorelines, what it does \nto our beaches, what it does to our wetlands. I will show a couple of \nother photographs. They are almost too painful.\n  But what we do here has consequences. And for someone to come to this \nfloor and say too much carbon is not dangerous, then I am sorry, we are \ngoing to have to look at these pictures even though we do not want to. \nWe know the devastation this causes. Our eyes do not deceive us.\n  This horrific spill in the gulf has disrupted the lives of hundreds \nof thousands of people employed by fishing industries, tourism \nindustries, recreation industries along the gulf coast. So, yes, this \nresolution, this Murkowski resolution, is about jobs.\n  Yesterday, Madam President, in your committee on which you serve--and \nI am so proud to have you as a member of the committee, the Environment \nand Public Works Committee--we heard from Captain Michael Frenette. He \nowns the Redfish Lodge in Venice, LA. He shared with us the terrible \npain, both personal and economic, that the people of the gulf region \nare living through.\n  This is what he said:\n\n       The possibility truly exists for many livelihoods to cease; \n     livelihoods that have existed for generations and now are on \n     the brink of financial disaster because of poor decisions by \n     a supercorporate entity that has created the worst oilspill \n     in history off the coast of Louisiana.\n\n  This spill is threatening the $18 billion in economic activity \ngenerated by fishing, tourism, and recreation on the gulf coast. The \neconomic damage in the gulf could last for years to come, although we \nwill, of course, do everything in our power to mitigate that damage.\n  I want to show you the pictures of the unspoiled California coastline \nand talk a moment about our coastal economy. Ever since I have been \nelected to public life--I was a county official, then a House Member, \nand then the\n\n[[Page S4792]]\n\ngreatest privilege of all, to serve in this body--I have fought to \nprotect our coasts. I have fought to protect our coasts because I \nbelieve they are a gift from God. I believe it is our responsibility to \nprotect that gift and to leave that gift for future generations. I have \nfought to protect that coast and I have fought to protect those \nbusinesses, the businesses that depend on it.\n  There are so many other beautiful areas such as this along our \nPacific coastline--spectacular rocky islands, sandy beaches, estuaries. \nWe must preserve these treasures.\n  Now $23 billion is the economic activity that supports 388,000 jobs \noff the coast in California. In my home State, our 19 coastal counties \naccount for 86 percent of the State's annual activity, for more than $1 \ntrillion. We must move to clean energy, to protect our environment, to \nprotect our jobs. We have to move away from the old ways.\n  No one can tell the American people that carbon is not a danger, \nbecause they have seen it every day of this spill. To say there is no \ndanger, and that is what we would be saying today, is absolutely \ncontrary to everything people are seeing every day, and do it for big \noil. That is what this is about. Big oil backs the Murkowski \nresolution.\n  So whose side are we on? Are we on the side of the people? Are we on \nthe side of clean energy jobs? Are we on the side of the lobbyists and \nspecial interests that are behind this resolution?\n  How does the Murkowski resolution threaten clean energy jobs? We know \nthat to move forward with smart regulation of this pollutant, you have \nto have the endangerment finding. It is the predicate for moving \nforward. Therefore, it is the predicate for the incentives that will \ncome for clean energy technology.\n  We must transition away from those old polluting sources of energy. \nWe must look toward the future with optimism. And, again, all you have \nto do is look at the gulf. That is the irony of the timing of this \nMurkowski resolution.\n  I think when the timing was set, it was before the gulf spill. But \nthe gulf spill tells us why the Murkowski resolution is so wrong. To \nrepeal an endangerment finding, straightforward, made by health experts \nin the Bush administration, scientists in the Bush administration, \nhealth experts in the Obama administration, scientists in the Obama \nadministration, for 100 elected people, with no expertise to say, we \nknow more than the scientists in the Bush and Obama administrations, we \nknow more than the health experts in the Bush and Obama administrations \nis the height of hubris. It is wrong. I know we all feel that we have \npowerful positions here. We have no right to do this. What is next? \nWhat are we going to do next, repeal the laws of gravity? If we start \ndown this path, there is no end in sight. Any Senator can decide that \nshe or he knows more than the scientists. Maybe we will say the Earth \nis flat and come down here and argue that one too.\n  Everyone knows we are not going to move away from the old energies \novernight. We need to work together to make sure we do it right. But we \nneed to move, move toward a clean energy economy, and the good jobs \nthat come with it. This will set us back on purpose. On purpose. \nBecause the very people who are bringing you this have not come forward \nwith any bill to move us away from these old energies. They are \nstopping us from doing it. They admit it.\n  Let's hear what John Doerr, who is one of the leading venture \ncapitalists in this country and in the world--he helped launch Google, \nhe helped launch Amazon. He tells me that more private capital moves \nthrough the economy in a day than all of the governments of the world \nin a year. This is where we are going to get the stimulus money to grow \njobs.\n  He told us that clean energy legislation is the spark we need to \nrestore America's leadership. He predicted that the investments that \nflow into clean energy would dwarf the amount invested in high-tech and \nbiotech combined.\n  Mr. Doerr said:\n\n       Going green may be the largest economic opportunity of the \n     21st century. It is the mother of all markets.\n\n  We can either believe the oil lobbyists or we can believe the people \non the ground who have shown that they know where the economic \nopportunities are. If we go this route, and we repeal this endangerment \nfinding, you are moving away from clean energy. You are moving away \nfrom these opportunities. You are moving away from these technologies \nthat will be made in America for America and, frankly, the technologies \nthe whole world wants.\n  A recent report by the Pew Charitable Trust found that 125,000 jobs \nwere generated during the period of 1998 to 2007 in my home State. \nThose jobs, those clean energy jobs, were generated 15 percent faster \nthan the economy as a whole, and 10,000 new clean energy businesses \nwere launched in that period. So when we look back at California, what \ndo we see? We see the greatest area of job growth and new businesses is \nclean energy. What a tragedy. If we pass this today, and it were to \nbecome law--which I doubt, but it could, and that is its purpose--we \nwould completely walk away from America's leadership in clean \ntechnology, turning our backs on the leading venture capitalists in our \nNation who are telling us, do not do this.\n  Nationwide, Pew found that jobs in the clean energy economy grew much \nfaster than traditional jobs. Clean energy jobs grew at a national rate \nof 9.1 percent, compared to 3.7 percent for traditional jobs between \n1998 and 2007. So if you do not want to believe John Doerr--but I \nsuggest you do, because he founded Amazon and Google, he funded them--\nlet's listen to Thomas Friedman. His book is, ``Hot, Flat and \nCrowded.'' Here is what the central theme is:\n\n       The ability to develop clean power and energy efficient \n     technology is going to become the defining measure of a \n     country's economic standing, environmental health, energy \n     security, and national security over the next 50 years.\n\n  As I said, the EPA finding that too much carbon pollution is \ndangerous for our people and our environment is the key incentive to \nmoving forward toward our clean energy economy. It is the basis upon \nwhich we move forward. It is the basis upon which we see their \nincentives then in place for clean energy technologies.\n  If this finding were eliminated under the Murkowski resolution, not \nonly would it be, I believe, a worldwide embarrassment that the Senate \nis now taking to repealing health findings and scientific findings, but \nit would stop in its tracks the economic opportunities that come from \nclean energy technology.\n  We cannot ignore the basic finding that is made in this endangerment \nfinding that carbon pollution in the air presents a very serious \ndanger, threatening the health of our families, our quality of life, \nand our natural resources. I guess if we pass the Murkowski resolution, \nthere would not be any danger anymore because we said so. I mean, you \nknow, we can pass a resolution that says there should not be any more \nrain, and I guess then there would not be any more rain. We cannot \nignore the basic scientific conclusion in that endangerment finding. If \nwe were to do this, it would be extraordinary and unprecedented.\n  In 2007, the Supreme Court was clear when it ruled that carbon \npollution and other greenhouse gas emissions are air pollutants, and \nthey directed the EPA to determine whether this pollution endangers our \nhealth. So EPA, the Environmental Protection Agency--and I want to say \nto my colleagues, it is not the Environmental Pollution Agency. If you \nwant to create an Environmental Pollution Agency, let's have a vote on \nthat. It is the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  They are not supposed to be influenced by the politics of the day, as \nyou know. They are charged with protecting the health of the kids, of \nour families, of our senior citizens, whether they are in Alaska, \nCalifornia, New York, or anyplace else in America. They are not the \nEnvironmental Pollution Agency. As much as big oil would like to \ndictate to them, they are not going to be dictated to by big oil.\n  By the way, the EPA was set up by Richard Nixon. Let's be clear here. \nSome of the officials from these States, Republicans, have weighed in \nagainst the Murkowski resolution and we will show that in a bit here.\n  EPA did what they were directed to do by the court. They had to do \nwhat the scientists and the health experts\n\n[[Page S4793]]\n\ntold them to do. Again, the Murkowski resolution would overturn these \nfindings. Leading scientists, physicians, and many others agree with \nthe finding and have told us how much damage carbon pollution in the \natmosphere can do. That is why they have stated their strong opposition \nto the Murkowski resolution.\n  Less than a month ago, the National Research Council, which is an arm \nof the National Academy of Sciences comprised of America's leading \nscientists, concluded that climate change is occurring. It is caused \nlargely by human activities, and it poses significant risks for and is \nalready affecting a broad range of human and natural systems. The \nNational Research Council further concluded that changes in climate \npose risks for a wide range of human and environmental systems, \nincluding freshwater resources, the coastal environment, ecosystems, \nagriculture, fisheries, human health, and national security.\n  EPA Administrators under Presidents Nixon, Ford, and Reagan oppose \nthe Murkowski resolution. Let's be clear. This should not be a partisan \nissue. It may wind up being that, but it should not.\n  Russell Train, EPA Administrator under Presidents Nixon and Ford, \nwrites: I urge the Senate to reject this and any other legislation that \nwould weaken the Clean Air Act or curtail the authority of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency to implements its provisions.\n  William Ruckelshaus, EPA Administrator under Presidents Nixon and \nReagan, said: Thanks to the 2007 Supreme Court decision on global \nwarming, EPA clearly has the right to regulate carbon. Anyone who would \ntake away that power--it is a terrible idea.\n  William Ruckelshaus, EPA Administrator under Nixon and Reagan, said \nthe Murkowski resolution is a terrible idea because this is the way we \nare going to address the problem of climate change.\n  Eighteen hundred scientists wrote to us opposing efforts to overturn \nthis endangerment finding. In a letter to us, these scientists wrote: \nWe the undersigned urge you to oppose an imminent attack on the Clean \nAir Act which would undermine public health and prevent action on \nglobal warming.\n  They go on to say: EPA's finding is based on solid science. This \namendment represents a rejection of that science.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter \nsigned by 1800 scientists.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Protect the Clean Air Act\n\n               (A letter signed by 1,806 U.S. Scientists)\n\n       Dear Congress: We the undersigned urge you to oppose an \n     imminent attack on the Clean Air Act (CAA) that would \n     undermine public health and prevent action on global warming. \n     This attack comes in the form of House and Senate binding \n     resolutions that would reverse the Environmental Protection \n     Agency's (EPA) finding that global warming endangers public \n     health and welfare. Because the EPA's finding is based on \n     solid science, this legislation also represents a rejection \n     of that science.\n       The EPA's ``endangerment finding'' is based on an \n     exhaustive review of the massive body of scientific research \n     showing a clear threat from climate change. The 2007 Fourth \n     Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \n     Change found that global warming will cause water shortages, \n     loss of species, hazards to coasts from sea level rise, and \n     an increase in the severity of extreme weather events. The \n     most recent science includes findings that sea level rise may \n     be more pronounced than the IPCC report predicted and that \n     oceans will absorb less of our future emissions. Recently, 18 \n     American scientific societies sent a letter to the U.S. \n     Senate confirming the consensus view on climate science and \n     calling for action to reduce greenhouse gases ``if we are to \n     avoid the most severe impacts of climate change.'' The U.S. \n     National Academy of Sciences and 10 international scientific \n     academies have also released such statements. Unfortunately, \n     the Murkowski amendment would force the EPA to ignore these \n     scientific findings and statements.\n       The CAA is a law with a nearly 40-year track record of \n     protecting public health and the environment and spurring \n     innovation by cutting dangerous pollution. This effective \n     policy can help address the threat of climate change--but \n     only if the EPA retains its ability to respond to scientific \n     findings. Instead of standing in the way of climate action, \n     the Senate should move quickly to enact climate and energy \n     legislation that will curb global warming, save consumers \n     money, and create jobs. In the meantime, I urge you to \n     respect the scientific integrity of the EPA's endangerment \n     finding by opposing Senator Murkowski's attack on the Clean \n     Air Act.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I also wish to display the public health organizations \nthat oppose the Murkowski resolution.\n  We have to decide whom we want to listen to. Do we want to listen to \nbig oil or politicians or do we want to listen to public health \norganizations that oppose the Murkowski resolution? I ask the American \npeople to determine which side they are on--the American Academy of \nPediatrics, the Children's Environmental Health Network, the American \nNurses Association, the American Lung Association, the American Public \nHealth Association, the National Association of County and City Health \nOfficials, Trust for America's Health, Physicians for Social \nResponsibility, National Environmental Health Association, American \nCollege of Preventative Medicine, American Thoracic Society, the \nAssociation of Public Health Laboratories, the Association of Schools \nof Public Health, the Hepatitis Foundation International, the Union of \nConcerned Scientists. Again, we have included for the record the \nscientists, 1,800 of whom signed a letter to us opposing this.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter signed \nby these entities as well as a separate letter from the American Lung \nAssociation.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 23, 2010.\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: The undersigned national organizations, with \n     a strong commitment to environmental public health issues, \n     write in opposition to a potential amendment or ``Resolution \n     of Disapproval'' by Senator Lisa Murkowski that would \n     overturn or temporarily block the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) endangerment finding for six \n     greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change.\n       On December 7, 2009, EPA issued final findings that the \n     greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change constitute \n     a danger to public health and welfare. Some of the publc \n     health effects of climate change cited in EPA's announcement \n     include: increased likelihood of more frequent and intense \n     heat waves, more wildfires, degraded air quality, more \n     flooding, increased drought, more intense storms, harm to \n     water resources and harm to agriculture. Given the serious \n     public health implications of increasing greeenhouse gas \n     concentrations, we believe overturning EPA's endangerment \n     finding is bad public health policy.\n       We strongly urge you to oppose any amendmenmt or Resolution \n     of Disapproval to overturn or restrict EPAs greenhouse gas \n     endangerment finding.\n           Sincerely,\n         American Academy of Pediatrics; American College of \n           Preventive Medicine; American Public Health \n           Association; American Thoracic Society; Association of \n           Public Health Laboratories; Association of Schools of \n           Public Health; Children's Environmental Health Network; \n           Hepatitis Foundation International; National \n           Association of County and City Health Officials; \n           National Environmental Health Association; Physicians \n           for Social Responsibility; Trust for America's Health.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    American Lung Association,\n\n                                                 January 26, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the American Lung Association, I \n     write in support of the Clean Air Act and the implementation \n     of the law by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The \n     American Lung Association urges the Senate to reject Senator \n     Lisa Murkowski's Resolution of Disapproval (S.J. Res 26).\n       The resolution would block the U.S. Environmental \n     Protection Agency's Supreme Court-directed endangerment \n     finding that is required under Clean Air Act. EPA made this \n     endangerment finding after a careful review of science and an \n     extensive public comment process.\n       Specifically EPA concluded: ``Pursuant to CAA section \n     202(a), the Administrator finds that greenhouse gases in the \n     atmosphere may reasonably be anticipated both to endanger \n     public health and to endanger public welfare.'' (emphasis \n     added)\n       The Senate must not vote to ignore the scientific evidence \n     and reject its clear conclusions. The Clean Air Act mandates \n     that the Environmental Protection Agency follow the science \n     and then implement the law accordingly. The Resolution of \n     Disapproval is a cynical attempt to disregard the science and \n     block the enforcement of the Clean Air Act.\n       Since its passage in 1970, the Clean Air Act has been the \n     nation's premier public health and environmental protection \n     statute. The Clean Air Act is predicated on the protection of \n     public health. Its implementation is grounded in sound \n     science. The American Lung Association is a staunch supporter \n     of this public health statute because of the enormous impact \n     that air pollution has on\n\n[[Page S4794]]\n\n     public health and the tremendous improvements in the nation's \n     air quality that have resulted from this law.\n       The protection of public health is critically important. \n     EPA has found that climate change will make attainment and \n     maintenance of national ambient air quality standards more \n     difficult as well as more frequent and more intense heat \n     waves and other events that adversely impact respiratory \n     health. The American Lung Association urges the Senate to \n     support the Clean Air Act and reject S.J. Res 26.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Charles D. Connor,\n                                                  President & CEO.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. These are the experts. These are the people we rely on \nwhen our children get sick. They don't take them, with all due respect, \nto Senator Boxer for a checkup or Senator Murkowski for a checkup. They \ngo to the pediatrician. The pediatricians oppose the Murkowski \nresolution. They are afraid of it because they know who is behind it. \nThey know it is the special polluting interests, the big polluters who \ngive big money to politicians. They know that. They are smart.\n  Let's be clear. We have on our side the people who are responsible \nfor taking care of our kids, taking care of families, looking out for \ntheir health. They don't have any political skin in this game. They \ndon't have any special interest in this game. They have one concern--\nthe health of our families.\n  Overturning a scientific finding that states that carbon pollution is \na threat to the health and well-being of the American public is a \ndangerous step. It would lead us down a perilous road that sets a \nprecedent for appealing other scientific findings. I talked a little \nbit about that.\n  I want to talk specifically about two other findings that maybe one \nday any Senator, on either side of the aisle, could seek to repeal. \nImagine if we had done this on lead, lead and children.\n  In 1973, EPA did what it had to do and issued an endangerment finding \nfor lead in gasoline. At the time, the lead endangerment decision was \ncontroversial. This was the EPA under Richard Nixon. They said there \nwas too much lead in gasoline. They said it was a danger to our kids. \nThey said it would cause harm to the brains of our children. So the \nAdministrator under Richard Nixon, William Ruckelshaus--who opposes the \nMurkowski resolution today--reached the conclusion that lead presented \na significant risk of harm to the health of our population, \nparticularly our children. What if a Member of Congress came down and \nsaid: We are going to overturn that. We don't like that rule. We don't \nlike that finding. We disagree. We don't think it causes a problem. Can \nmy colleagues imagine what would have happened? We would have seen the \nphase down of lead in gasoline delayed for a decade or more, leaving \nanother generation of Americans exposed to serious health threats. We \nwould have seen hundreds of thousands more children with impaired \nmental function. That is a fact. It may be a fact the other side \ndoesn't want to hear, but it is a fact. That is why we have former \nmembers of the Nixon administration opposing the Murkowski resolution.\n  Let's look at the science behind the dangers of smoking. What would \nhave happened if people didn't agree with Surgeon General Everett \nKoop--another Republican administration--and they came down and said: \nWell, we are going to speak for the tobacco companies here. Let's \nrepeal that. Nicotine isn't a problem, not a problem at all. Let's just \noverturn that health finding.\n  Again, I ask my colleagues do they want to stand with the health \nexperts, the lung association, the pediatricians, the nurses, or do \nthey want to stand with the powerful special interests? It is a simple \nquestion. Every Member has to answer that.\n  We have to stop this attack on science and health. We have to stop \nthis attack on the safety of our citizens. Our families come first.\n  I think it is important to note that overturning this endangerment \nfinding--supporting the Murkowski resolution--is opposed by the auto \nindustry and the autoworkers. This is what they tell us. We are \nspending $1 billion a day importing foreign oil. Do Members like that? \nThen vote for the Murkowski resolution. It is going to set us back. We \nwon't get off foreign oil if we go down this path.\n  This is why we have the automakers opposing Murkowski: On behalf of \nthe Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers and its 11 member companies, I \nam writing to express concern over the proposed resolutions of \ndisapproval. If these resolutions are enacted, the historic agreement \ncreating the one national program for regulating vehicle fuel economy \nand greenhouse gas emissions would collapse.\n  The autoworkers are asking us not to do this. Let's see what they \nsay: The UAW is deeply concerned that overturning EPA's endangerment \nfinding would unravel the historic agreement on one national standard \nfor fuel economy. And they go on.\n  Clearly, we are at a point where we are finally seeing the auto \nindustry come back to life. Let's not pass the Murkowski resolution and \nget them off track. After all the debate and all the arguments, I know \nthe Senators from Michigan care deeply about what is happening to their \nautoworkers and their auto companies. We are very clear here what side \nthey are on.\n  In summary, the Murkowski resolution would upend a historic agreement \nbetween auto companies, autoworkers, environmental groups, leading \nStates such as California that formed the foundation of the recent EPA \nand DOT standards.\n  I am going to include for the Record a host of quotes from our \nnational security experts who tell us that carbon pollution leading to \nclimate change will be, over the next 20 years, the leading cause of \nconflict putting our troops in harm's way. That is why we have so many \nreturning veterans who want us to move forward and address this issue \nso we can create the new technologies that get us off this foreign oil. \nEvery time we import oil, we hurt ourselves. We have to get off these \nold energy sources. It is a transition. It is not going to happen \novernight. But if we do things such as the Murkowski resolution, we \nwill create chaos. We are going to see jobs lost. We are going to see \nus continue in an economic situation that has no new paradigm for \neconomic growth, as we have learned from our venture capitalists, as we \nhave learned from analysts, such as Thomas Friedman, who are so clear \non this point.\n  The question before us is this: Will we protect the people we \nrepresent from dangerous pollution or will we choose to reject science? \nWill we choose to ignore the findings of the scientific community, the \npublic health officials, and national security experts?\n  If we care about jobs--I know the Presiding Officer does--if we care \nabout moving to a clean energy economy, if Members care about health, \nif they care about our environment and our natural resources, then they \nshould vote no on proceeding to this resolution.\n  I hope we will carry the day. I know it will be close. But I have to \ntell my colleagues, this is a significant moment for the Senate because \nif we move down this path, ``Katy, bar the door.'' Any resolution, any \nhealth finding, any scientific finding is subject to politics. I would \nhave thought that in the Senate, we might disagree with how to deal \nwith the scientific finding--in other words, what kinds of rules and \nregulations should come out of it--but not to repeal the scientific \nfinding itself. That would be unprecedented in the worst of ways.\n  I have used my time, the first half hour; am I correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 10 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have a number of fantastic speakers we \nwill hear from in the next ensuing time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, at this time on the Republican side, \nI ask unanimous consent that for this next half hour, the order be \nSenator Lincoln for 7 minutes, followed by Senator Inhofe at 13 \nminutes, Senator Voinovich for 7, and Senator Graham for 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Arkansas is recognized.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. \n26, Senator Murkowski's resolution of disapproval.\n  First, I would like to thank my friend and colleague, Senator \nMurkowski, for her leadership to prevent\n\n[[Page S4795]]\n\nthis heavy-handed EPA regulation of carbon emissions. I am proud to be \npart of a bipartisan group of Senators cosponsoring the resolution \nbecause I do believe EPA's regulatory approach is the wrong way to \npromote renewable energy and clean energy jobs in Arkansas and the rest \nof the country.\n  Allowing the courts and EPA to use the Clean Air Act to regulate \ngreenhouse gases is truly misguided. It would threaten valuable jobs \nduring an economic downturn, and it has the potential of actually \ndiscouraging the use of clean, renewable energy that is already helping \nto keep people working today.\n  But, first, let me say a few words on the energy challenges facing \nour Nation. We have committed to ambitious renewable fuel goals, and I \nhave supported efforts to set a national renewable energy standard.\n  Just last June we passed a bipartisan energy bill out of the Senate \nEnergy Committee, and I was very proud of that bill and hoped we would \nmove forward on it.\n  In order to meet these goals and prosper in the 21st century, we must \ndevelop clean domestic energy supplies. This means developing all \nsources of energy--everything from wind, to natural gas, to, of course, \nbiofuels.\n  My home State of Arkansas is already leading in this effort. Wind \nturbines and blades are manufactured in my home State of Arkansas, \nproviding hundreds of green jobs to Arkansans. These include Nordex, LM \nWind Power, Polymarin Composites, and Mitsubishi.\n  Arkansas is also home to the Fayetteville Shale, where clean burning \nnatural gas has provided an enormous boost to the economy of central \nand north central Arkansas, producing jobs in a huge part of what has \nbeen positive for our economy.\n  Arkansas companies such as Future Fuel in Batesville, AR, are \nproducing huge amounts of biodiesel, helping our Nation to meet the \nrenewable fuel targets set forth in the 2007 Energy bill, not to \nmention their advanced battery technologies that they are researching \nand building upon.\n  Our wood and paper industry produces about two-thirds of the energy \nit needs from renewable forest biomass, providing and sustaining tens \nof thousands of jobs in the process. Facilities that range from small \nsawmills such as Bean Lumber in Glenwood and huge paper mills such as \nDomtar in Ashdown have taken steps to increase their use of renewable \nenergy in recent years, saving thousands of critical jobs in the \nprocess.\n  These efforts in Arkansas, and similar efforts all around our \ncountry, are leading the way toward a clean energy future--one that \nreduces our emissions, reduces our dependency on foreign oil, and \nprovides economic opportunity and jobs to so many of our citizens.\n  Unfortunately, EPA regulation of greenhouse gases does not move us \nany closer to a clean energy future or to reducing our dependency on \nforeign oil. Furthermore, it is simply the wrong tool for addressing \ngreenhouse gas emissions.\n  Congress, the elected representatives of the people of this Nation--\nnot unelected bureaucrats--should be making the complicated, \nmultifaceted decisions on energy and climate policy. Furthermore, it is \na widely shared view that the Clean Air Act, with its command-and-\ncontrol approach to regulating air emissions, is the wrong fit for \naddressing greenhouse gas emissions.\n  One example of the way the EPA's approach to regulating carbon \nemissions does wrong is the way the proposed tailoring rule treats \nemissions from biomass energy. The tailoring rule equates carbon \nemissions from renewable energy with fossil fuel emissions. This is not \nconsistent with years of internationally accepted policy, and it could \npenalize important industries and cost thousands of jobs, including \nsome 10,000 direct and thousands of additional indirect jobs in our \nState of Arkansas.\n  As chairman of the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry, \nI am also concerned about the effects EPA's regulation of greenhouse \ngases will have on production agriculture and domestic food security.\n  The hard-working farm families of this great Nation produce the \nsafest, most abundant, affordable supply of food and fiber in the \nworld, and they do it with greater respect to the environment than any \nother growers across the globe. For every one American mouth we feed, \nwe feed 20 mouths globally, and it is critical we make sure we maintain \nthe ability to do that.\n  According to a recent University of Tennessee economic analysis, EPA \nregulation will result in billions of dollars in losses in net returns \nfor agriculture from 2010 to 2015, with the largest declines occurring \nin crops grown in our State of Arkansas, such as soybeans, cotton, and \nrice. These figures are frightening for agriculture in our State, \nparticularly during a time of recession.\n  Furthermore, over 100 agricultural groups have expressed their \nconcerns with EPA regulation of carbon and expressed their support of \nthe Murkowski resolution. These groups include national associations \nfor wheat, dairy, corn, cotton, rice, poultry, beef, pork, and eggs. \nThese groups also include many specialty crop growers as well.\n  I also want to speak for a moment about what this resolution does not \ndo. Some think this resolution weakens the Clean Air Act. It would not \namend or otherwise affect the plain language of the Clean Air Act. It \nwould not change or in any other way alter the words within the \nexisting statute.\n  My colleagues and I are concerned about what will follow EPA's \ndecision to release the endangerment finding--a unilaterally imposed \nall-sticks-no-carrot policy that actually discourages renewable energy \nuse and penalizes those industries that have acted early to adopt clean \nenergy technologies.\n  That is not the direction in which we want to go. We know, \ndesperately, that we want to lower our carbon emissions, lessen our \ndependence on foreign oil, and create good, green jobs. This attempt, \noverreach, and this action by unelected bureaucrats at EPA is not going \nto help us achieve those goals.\n  Lastly, let me address a criticism heard in recent days: that a vote \nfor the Murkowski resolution is a bailout or somehow a boon for big oil \nin the wake of the tragic oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth.\n  These critics would like the public to believe that opposing EPA \nregulation of greenhouse gas emissions is somehow related to the \noilspill. Nothing could be further from the truth. We all know the \nBritish Petroleum spill in the Gulf of Mexico needs to be addressed \nthrough legislation that ensures the safety, effectiveness, and \nsustainability of oil and other resource extractions--as we will very \nsoon. We are all concerned about what has happened in the gulf.\n  I certainly know, as a neighbor to the north of Louisiana, and one \nwhose economic livelihood depends on the Port of New Orleans--not to \nmention the wonderful natural resources that we partner with the State \nof Louisiana in trying to preserve--this is a horrific circumstance \nthat exists there, and we are all going to do everything we can not \nonly to provide the cleanup but to ensure this kind of catastrophe \nnever happens again.\n  But this issue is separate from the EPA regulation of greenhouse \ngases. I do not know, in my recent election if people had listened to \nwhat was on the TV, they would have thought I single-handedly was \nresponsible for what happened in the Gulf of Mexico. This is not where \nwe solve that problem. We have much to do there and we should do it and \nI am all about getting about that business.\n  What would EPA regulations affect? I think that is the question we \nhave before us. In Arkansas, it would affect manufacturers and their \nemployees.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent for an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. In Arkansas, it would affect manufacturers and their \nemployees: facilities such as Great Lakes Chemicals in El Dorado, Green \nBay Packing in Morrilton, Nucor Steel in Blytheville, Georgia Pacific \nin Crossett, FutureFuel Chemical Company in Batesville, and Riceland \nFoods in Stuttgart.\n  These Arkansas facilities, employing several thousand people, \nsupporting families with good-paying jobs, would\n\n[[Page S4796]]\n\nbe threatened by EPA regulation of greenhouse gases. That is why I \nencourage my Senate colleagues, with similar consequences facing their \nStates, to vote for this resolution.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, it is my understanding I have 13 \nminutes. I would like to have the Acting President pro tempore tell me \nwhen I have 1 minute left.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Of course.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is kind of interesting because I have probably \ntalked on this subject over the last 7 years for 200 or 300 hours, and \nI never had any trouble before getting time. It lets you know there is \nan awakening in the people who are looking at this particular vote that \nwe are going to have today. Many of them believe in their hearts that \nanthropogenic gases cause global warming. I do not believe that. And \nthere is everyone in between. The point is not that. It is, do we \nreally want to have this bureaucracy?\n  Let me just comment. I was here when my good friend, Senator Boxer, \nwas making her comments. That was very interesting because she spent \nthree-fourths of her time talking about the oilspill. Let me say, there \nis no relationship between this and the oilspill. There is no reason to \ntalk about them in the same speech.\n  When they talk about big oil--as she said, ``big oil has all this \ncontrol''--well, big oil is BP. The last I checked, BP is very much \ninvolved with the majority, with the White House. In fact, I went and \nchecked. I found out in my last Senate race, I was given $2,000 by BP. \nAnd I checked, in the last Senate race, which was the first Senate race \nby then-Senator Obama, he got three times as much money as I did. Now \nwe find out that during the Kerry-Lieberman bill that has been talked \nabout quite a bit, BP has been behind closed doors with them. Everybody \nknows this.\n  Now, it is not big oil behind this bill. Behind this bill you have \nthe American Association of Housing Services for the Aging, Family \nDairies USA, the Farm Bureau, the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, the Brick Industry Association--all of these organizations, \nwholesome American organizations that are behind this issue because \nthey do not want us to give up all the freedoms we would have to give \nup.\n  When Senator Lincoln was talking about the tailoring rule, I know \nthere has been a problem with those who are pushing for the \nendangerment finding, trying to make everybody believe that somehow it \nwas not going to happen to anyone except some of the big industries, \nthe refiners, the big manufacturers. No, the tailoring rule they are \ntalking about is something that unilaterally they thought they would be \nable to get by with without anyone even noticing it, when, in fact, the \nClean Air Act very simply says the emission of 250 tons in a period of \na year.\n  Now, 250 tons, that is every farm in my State of Oklahoma. That is \nevery church. So it covers everyone. But let me go back in this brief \nperiod of time and try to put this in perspective. Eleven years ago we \nhad the Kyoto Treaty. This is the big treaty then-Vice President Gore \nwanted the American people to have to ratify. They wanted to bring it \nto the Senate for ratification. They did sign that treaty, but it never \ncame up for ratification.\n  Do you want to know why? It did not come up because at that time it \nwas so objectionable that we had a resolution that passed on the floor \nof this Senate 95 to 0--not one dissenting vote--saying: We do not want \nto be part of any movement or bill or treaty that treats developing \nnations differently than developed nations. That is exactly what it \ndid. That resolution also said we do not want to ratify any treaty or \npass anything that is going to be an economic hardship for the United \nStates of America. Obviously, this was the case.\n  So we set the stage 11 years ago. Now we are facing this same thing \nagain. I have to say that when Republicans were a majority, I chaired \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee, which had the jurisdiction \nover most of this stuff we are talking about today. I have to also say, \nback then I honestly, in my heart, believed the anthropogenic gases, \nthe CO2, the methane, caused global warming because everyone \nsaid it did--catastrophic global warming. Now they do not call it that \nanymore since we are in the eighth year of a cooling period. They say \n``climate change.'' That sounds a little bit more palatable.\n  But I can remember when I did believe that, until we started looking \nat the various bills that came up. We have voted in this Chamber five \ntimes on cap-and-trade bills, starting right about 2002 and up to the \npresent day, and there is one pending today. During that period of \ntime, we started looking at it and realizing what it would cost. The \nfirst analysis of what cap and trade would cost--and the same thing \ngoes for the EPA under their regulations--would have been somewhere \nbetween $300 billion and $400 billion.\n  When we calculate that, in my State of Oklahoma--I always do the \nmath--if we take the number of families who file tax returns, that \nwould have been $3,100--not once but every year. So with that type of \nthing, looking at it, I thought: Well, as chairman of this committee, \nmaybe we ought to look and be sure the science is accurate, the science \nis there. So we started looking at it and finding out this whole thing \nstarted--let's keep in mind, it started with the United Nations, the \nIPCC. That is the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. They then \nwere joined by all these Hollywood elites--moveon.org, George Soros, \nMichael Moore, and all these groups--until we realized they were \npushing this, but the science was flawed.\n  I first made my statement on the Senate floor in 2002 that created \nsome doubt in a lot of people's minds as to the accuracy of the science \nthat the IPCC was putting together. There had been inquiries by many \nquality scientists who had said they rejected our input. We don't have \nany kind of an input in this issue, unless you agree with the United \nNations and the IPCC, that categorically it is causing catastrophic \nglobal warming. Then they didn't let the scientists have their input.\n  So we started gathering all of this information. People were coming \nto me saying: This is a fraud. I gathered enough material that 7 years \nago this month, I made a speech and I said the notion that \nanthropogenic gases, that CO2 causes catastrophic global \nwarming is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people. \nThen the scientists started coming in with their stuff. I would suggest \nthat a lot of people don't agree with what I just said, so they ought \nto look at my Web site.\n  Five years ago I made a speech and I talked about all the scientists \nwho were coming forward. As it turned out, when climategate came, \nessentially it was the same thing I said 5 years ago. The scare tactics \nwe hear from Senator Boxer that this is all about the gulf, the \noilspill, and all of that stuff, this is what they have been using. If \nwe take Al Gore's science fiction movie and the IPCC and look at all of \nthe assertions they made in this movie and the IPCC has made, every one \nhas been refuted.\n  I can't find one assertion that has now not been refuted: melt \nHimalayan glaciers by 2035, not true; endanger 40 percent of the Amazon \nrain forests, not true; melt mountain ice in the Alps, Andes, and \nAfrica, not true; deplete water resources for 4.5 billion people by \n2085, totally refuted; slash crop production by 50 percent in North \nAfrica by 2020; 55 percent of the Netherlands lies below sea level.\n  I can remember when Vice President Gore--no, it was after he was Vice \nPresident--we had a hearing in our committee, and we had several of the \nparents of young kids coming to us and saying: You know, my young \nchild, my elementary age child is forced to watch this movie once a \nmonth, and they have been having nightmares and all of this stuff. So a \nlot of damage was done at that time.\n  But when we get back to what we are faced with today, we are faced \nwith something they tried to pass. This administration has tried ever \nsince they came in to pass cap-and-trade. A cap-and-trade, logically, \nyou would say: Well, if you want to cut down on greenhouse gases, why \nnot put a tax on CO2?\n  The reason they don't do that is because then people would know what \nit is costing them. So there were all of these cap-and-trade bills that \ncame up, and they were not able to pass them.\n\n[[Page S4797]]\n\nSo this administration said, I am sure--I wasn't in the meeting; I am \nnot invited to those meetings of the President--but they said: We can't \nget it passed in Congress. We can't get it passed in the House or the \nSenate, so let's go ahead and do it. We will just run over them with \nthe administration. So they said: We are going to have an endangerment \nfinding.\n  This is kind of interesting because right before going to \nCopenhagen--and for those of you who don't know this, once a year the \nU.N. throws a great big party and everybody goes to some exotic place \nand they try to sell the idea that we need to have this international \ntreaty and, of course, it hasn't happened. Before Copenhagen--that was \nin December of this past year I can remember that we had--I suspected \nthey would have an endangerment finding right while we were in \nCopenhagen to make it sound as though we were going to do something in \nthe United States. In fact, I went over as a one-man truth squad and \nhad a pretty good time.\n  Anyway, on the endangerment finding, Lisa Jackson, who is the \nAdministrator of the EPA, an appointee of Obama, testified. I said to \nher: You know, Madam Administrator, this is live on TV. I suspect what \nis going to happen is that you are going to have an endangerment \nfinding and try to take this over and do all of these punitive things \nto America under the Clean Air Act. If there is an endangerment \nfinding, it has to be based on science. What science would you use if \nyou are going to have an endangerment finding?\n  The answer was, It is going to be the IPCC, primarily, and that is \nthe very science that climategate used when it came along, and it has \nbeen pretty much debunked. In fact, it was characterized in Great \nBritain as the greatest political scandal in the history of our \ncountry.\n  So, anyway, the endangerment finding was all based on that, and that \nis where we find ourselves today. So I would say this: I only talk \nabout the science. I don't like to talk about the science because I \nknow people don't understand it. But I did it because if you are one of \nthose--and I say this to the Chair; I say this to anyone who might be \nlistening at this time--if you believe that anthropogenic gas causes \ncatastrophic global warming and climate change, then what would this do \nto remedy that? Well, the answer is nothing because the same Lisa \nJackson who testified before our committee when I asked her this \nquestion--\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I said: If we were to pass this, any of these cap-and-trade bills, or \nif we were to do this through the Clean Air Act through the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, how much would that reduce the \nworldwide CO2 emissions?\n  Her answer was, Well, it wouldn't reduce it because this would only \napply to the United States.\n  What I am saying is, if you want to invoke all of this money spent, \nall of this cost on the American people, on every farmer in America, \neven if you believe the concept is there, it still wouldn't reduce the \nemissions. You could argue it could increase the emissions because our \nmanufacturing base would have to go to places such as China, India, \nMexico, places that didn't have the standards we have, and it would \nhave the effect of increasing--actually increasing--CO2.\n  So I just hope those individuals will realize if they think the \nproblem is real, this isn't going to solve it.\n  I yield back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nbipartisan resolution to disapprove EPA's endangerment finding, S.J. \nRes. 26.\n  First of all, I am not here as a climate skeptic. I believe we should \nreduce emissions, but the steps we take must balance our Nation's \nenergy and economic needs.\n  Climate change is a global environmental issue that cannot be solved \nby America acting alone. EPA's own data shows us that unless the \nrapidly expanding economies of China and India reduce emissions, U.S. \naction will have no impact on global temperatures.\n  It is widely acknowledged that regulations that flow from EPA's \nendangerment finding will jeopardize job creation, our economic \nrecovery, and American competitiveness. That has been made very clear \nby those who have spoken before me. This was openly acknowledged by the \nObama administration last year when the White House Office of \nManagement and Budget cautioned:\n\n       Making the decision to regulate CO2 under the \n     [Clean Air Act] for the first time is likely to have serious \n     economic consequences for regulated entities throughout the \n     U.S. economy, including small businesses and small \n     communities.\n\n  This is far from incidental. The endangerment finding is the \ncenterpiece of a coercive strategy designed to force Congress into \npassing cap-and-trade legislation. This was confirmed by a senior White \nHouse economic official late last year who was quoted as saying:\n\n       If you don't pass this legislation, then . . . [EPA] is \n     going to have to regulate in a command-and-control way, \n     which will probably generate even more uncertainty.\n\n  Time magazine likened this approach to ``putting a gun to Congress' \nhead.''\n  But this is a false dichotomy. Senators have before them a number of \npolicy options to address climate change, including the power to remove \nthe threat of EPA regulation. That the Senate has not yet embraced a \nbill speaks more to the flaws contained in those policies than to this \nbody's willingness to act. In fact, economic analysis of every major \npiece of climate change legislation shows they would result in net job \nlosses and retard economic growth with little or no impact on global \ntemperatures. Why would the Senate choose to enact economically \ndamaging legislation in order to stave off economically damaging \nregulations? This Senator certainly will not.\n  In their efforts to gain leverage over the legislative branch, \nadministrative officials claim the resolution to disapprove EPA's \nendangerment findings would prevent fuel efficiency in vehicles through \nnew EPA regulations. More recently, claims have been made that the \nresolution is a way to protect big oil in the wake of the gulf \ndisaster. These claims are disingenuous on their face.\n  First, EPA's endangerment finding does nothing to clean up the Gulf \nof Mexico or prevent future spills. To suggest otherwise is an \nopportunistic bait and switch and an insult to the people of the gulf, \nthe intelligence of the American people, and the Senate.\n  Second, EPA's endangerment finding has nothing to do with fuel \nsavings. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has had \nauthority to increase corporate average fuel economy--CAFE--standards \nfor over 30 years. Indeed, NHTSA was required by law to raise light-\nduty vehicle standards to at least 35 miles per gallon when Congress \npassed the Energy Independence and Security Act in 2007.\n  In a February 19 letter, NHTSA's general counsel stated:\n\n       The Murkowski resolution does not directly impact NHTSA's \n     statutory authority to set fuel economy standards.\n\n  Indeed, in its own rule, EPA confirms that ``the CAFE standards \naddress most, but not all, of the real world CO2 emissions'' \nfrom automobiles.\n  In reality, EPA's rules are the ``camel's nose'' under the regulatory \ntent.\n  In spite of the Supreme Court's ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA, only \nthe most tortured--tortured--reading of the act allows one to conclude \nthat the Clean Air Act was intended to address global climate change. \nThe act contains no express authorization to regulate, and there are no \nprovisions recognizing the international dimension of the issue. I know \nthis for a fact. I have been on the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee for almost 12 years, and during those 12 years attempts have \nbeen made every 2 years to amend the Clean Air Act to include \nCO2. In every instance, it has been turned down.\n  As a matter of fact, this issue has been dealt with over and over by \nthe Senate. In fact, starting back in 1997, the Senate spoke directly \nto this issue where, by a vote of 95 to 0, it passed the Byrd-Hagel \nresolution. The resolution specifically stated that the United States \nshould not commit itself to limits or reduce greenhouse gas emissions \nunless developing countries embrace specific commitments to reduce \ngreenhouse gases. The overarching concern\n\n[[Page S4798]]\n\nwas the serious harm that would be inflicted on the U.S. economy by \nunilateral action.\n  In other words, for us to go ahead and let the EPA regulate this and \ndo it on our own, in effect what we are doing is we are unilaterally \ndisarming the U.S. economy for absolutely no environmental gain.\n  Copenhagen showed us that the developing world will continue to \nresist binding reduction targets, and while China continues to build \ntwo coal-powered plants a week--in other words, while China puts up two \ncoal-fired plants a week, the Sierra Club and other environmental \ngroups in this country are shutting down any opportunity for us to use \ncoal in terms of generating energy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 1 more minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Despite the fragile state of the economy and the \nfutility of the effort in environmental terms, this administration \npresses forward.\n  In the final analysis, the Clean Air Act does not recognize the \ninternational nature of climate change and is not suited to regulate \ngreenhouse gas emissions. The administration's attempt to use it to \nforce Congress to adopt economically damaging climate policy is a \nreckless stunt, especially when one considers the very real challenges \nAmerica faces today.\n  I am hoping that the Senate supports S.J. Res. 26, removes the gun \nfrom its head and gets on with the business of debating a sound energy \npolicy. I suggest that the best way we can start to do this is by \nlooking at the bipartisan bill--the Bingaman bill--which came out of \nthe Energy Committee. That is where we should start if we want to be \nconstructive in dealing with greenhouse gas emissions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. How much time remains on the Republican side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Five minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I appreciate what Senator Murkowski is \ntrying to do. Maybe this is a balance-of-power issue. The court ruled, \nI think in 2007, that greenhouse gases could be regulated under the \nClean Air Act. Senator Voinovich is right. Congress has never made that \ndecision. There have been efforts in the past to get carbon pollution \nregulation by the Clean Air Act, but it was never passed legislatively. \nThe courts have spoken.\n  The tool being used today is a legislative tool available to the \nCongress to basically put regulatory powers in check, and what we are \ndoing by passing this amendment is basically stopping the EPA from \nregulating carbon. And here is the real rub: If we stop them, are we \ngoing to do anything?\n  My view is that we need to do several things to replace the EPA. The \nEPA regulation of carbon cannot provide transition assistance to \nbusinesses. They don't have the flexibility or the tools necessary to \ncreate rational energy policy. That would create an economic burden at \na time we need to create economic opportunity. So I think the \nregulatory system of dealing with carbon pollution is the wrong way to \ngo, but to do nothing would be equally bad. To do nothing means China \nis going to develop the green energy technology that is coming in the \n21st century.\n  What I propose is that the Congress, once we stop the EPA, create a \nrational way forward on energy policy that includes clean air and \nregulation of carbon.\n  No. 1, the trust fund that is used to build roads and bridges is \ntremendously underfunded. Senator Inhofe and others have challenged the \nCongress time and time again to do something about shortfalls in the \nhighway trust fund.\n  To the transportation community, if you are listening out there, you \nhave a chance, as a broader package, to be part of a broader deal to \nget money for the highway trust fund. But you will never do it standing \nalone. We are not going to raise taxes to put money in the \ntransportation trust fund and that is all we do.\n  I think the transportation sector needs to be looked at anew. How can \nwe lower emissions on the transportation side, reduce our dependency on \nforeign oil, and replenish the trust fund? I would argue that Congress \ncould come up with policies that would dramatically reduce \nCO2 emissions coming from cars and trucks without a cap on \ncarbon; that we could have incentives on the transportation side to \ndevelop alternative vehicles--battery-powered cars, hydrogen-powered \ncars, hybrid cars in different fashions that would break our dependency \non foreign oil.\n  If you take this debate and separate it from our dependency on \nforeign oil, you have made a huge mistake. Madam President, $439 \nbillion was sent overseas by the United States last year to buy oil \nfrom countries that don't like us very much. When you talk about \ncontrolling carbon, you ought to be talking about energy independence.\n  I suggest that Congress look at the transportation sector with a \ncomprehensive approach that will reduce our dependency on foreign oil, \nthat will create vehicles that are more energy efficient and produce \nless carbon to clean up the air, and you can do all that without a cap \nand put money into the trust fund to rebuild bridges and roads that are \nfalling apart as America grows. These are jobs that will never go to \nChina. We need to have a vision on transportation that needs to be part \nof our broader vision.\n  When it comes to breaking our dependency on foreign oil, we need to \nuse less oil in general. The President is right. A low-carbon economy \nis a safer America, a cleaner environment and I think a more prosperous \nAmerica. But we have natural fossil fuel assets in this country. We \nhave oil and gas.\n  The gulf oilspill is a tremendously catastrophic environmental \ndisaster, but if we overreact and say we are going to stop exploring \nfor domestic oil and gas--9 million barrels a day comes from domestic \nexploration, and we use 21 million barrels a day--the people in the \nMideast would cheer that policy. The biggest winner in stopping \ndomestic exploration for oil and gas would be OPEC nations. So it is \nnot in our national security interest, not in our economic interest to \nmake a rash decision on oil and gas exploration.\n  I encourage the Congress to slow down, find ways to safely explore \nfor oil and gas, and make it part of an overall energy vision that will \nallow us to break our dependency on foreign oil.\n  When it comes to job creation, wind, solar, battery, and nuclear \npower--all of the energy efficiency green technology that will come in \nthis century is going to come from China if we don't get our act \ntogether. We need a rational energy policy that would incentivize \nalternative energy to be developed in America before the world takes \nover this emerging market. That means incentives for wind, solar, and, \nyes, nuclear power. Twenty percent of our power comes from the nuclear \nindustry, and 82 percent of the French economy's power comes from the \nnuclear industry. Surely we can be as bold as the French. If you had a \nrenaissance of nuclear power in this country, you could create millions \nof jobs. We could come up with ways to treat the waste.\n  President Obama has been very good on nuclear power. His \nadministration, with Secretary Chu, has been excellent in trying to \ndevelop incentives to expand nuclear power in a safe fashion.\n  Carbon is bad. Let's do something about it in a commonsense way. You \ndon't have to believe in global warming to want clean air. This idea \nabout what to do with carbon--you don't have to believe the planet is \ngoing to melt tomorrow, but this idea that what comes out of cars and \ntrucks and coal-fired plants is good for us makes no sense to me. If we \ncan clean up the air in America, we would be doing the next generation \nand the world a great service. The key is, can you clean up the air and \nmake it good business? I believe you can. Let's pursue both things: \ngood business and clean air.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that whatever \nextra time was given to the other side be added to our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S4799]]\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, at this point, we are going to hear \narguments against the Murkowski resolution from Senator Durbin for 6 \nminutes, followed by Senator Reed of Rhode Island for 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the Murkowski resolution gives the \nSenate a choice between real science and political science. That is \nwhat it comes down to.\n  The EPA went to the scientists across America and asked them the \nbasic question: Do greenhouse gas emissions endanger life and the \nplanet on which we live? After months and thousands of comments and \n380,000 scientific comments, they concluded that it does. They said \nthat we have a responsibility under the Clean Air Act to protect the \npeople in the United States and the people on Earth. We are going to \nmove forward with a gradual, systematic way of reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions because we know they are causing damage.\n  Twenty-one years ago, I went to Alaska, to Prince William Sound, \nafter the Exxon Valdez ran aground. I saw the thousands of barrels of \nblack, sludgy oil covering that pristine and beautiful part of America \nin Alaska.\n  I have spoken to the Senator who is the sponsor of this resolution. \nTwenty-one years later, we still know that ecology, that environment \nhas not recovered from that spill. But that was very obvious. You could \nsee it. It was filthy. There are changes in the environment that are \nhurting Alaska today that are hard to see.\n\n  We know greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution are changing \nAlaska, with the loss of sea ice; the melting permafrost; coastal \nerosion in villages, such as Shismaref, that have been falling into the \nocean; ocean acidification. The Arctic icecap, which is a key \necological component of Alaska's ecology, has a record-low amount of \nArctic sea ice.\n  Are we to ignore this? You will ignore it if you vote yes for the \nMurkowski resolution. You will choose political science over the real \nscience that tells us that unless we come to grips with the air \npollution that threatens us, it will not only endanger our lungs and \nour lives, it will endanger the planet on which we live.\n  In 1970, we created the EPA, under President Richard Nixon. In those \ndays, 40 years ago, the environmental issues were bipartisan issues. \nPeople came together and said: We can address the challenges facing us \nin the United States and around the world on a bipartisan basis.\n  Well, bipartisanship is still alive when it comes to important \nenvironmental issues. There is bipartisan opposition to the Murkowski \nresolution. It turns out those who headed the EPA under Presidents \nNixon, Ford, and Reagan all oppose the Murkowski resolution. They \nbelieve, as scientists do, that we have a once-in-a-lifetime \nopportunity to seize this moment and find a way to save this planet we \nlive on and make it healthier for all of us and for our children.\n  We have had great success with the Clean Air Act. We have reduced \npollution. We are moving forward. But the Murkowski resolution says \nstop--stop taking those actions that have been proposed by the EPA to \nreduce pollution; ignore the scientific findings and accept the \npolitical science.\n  What do I mean by that? There are political forces strongly in \nsupport of the Murkowski resolution. Big oil is one of them. Energy \ncompanies agree we should stop this EPA regulation. Of course, they \nhave a vested interest. They have money on the table. How credible is \nbig oil today on the floor of the Senate when we have witnessed the \ndisaster in the Gulf of Mexico? Are we going to criticize them in the \nmorning in speeches and then reward them by passing this resolution in \nthe afternoon? I hope not.\n  I hope we will take an honest look at the environment we live in and \nunderstand that to give away basic scientific findings, walk away from \nthem, and embrace political science is something we will never be able \nto explain to future generations.\n  The United States should join in leading the world to clean up the \nplanet on which we live. Passage of the Murkowski resolution is a step \nbackward. It will say to the world that the United States is in \ncomplete denial; that the Senate is rejecting the findings of \nscientists all across the world; and that we don't need to address \nclimate change and the impact of air pollution on our lives.\n  This is a singular historic moment. I sincerely hope my colleagues on \nboth sides of the aisle--and I hope it is bipartisan again--will join \nin standing up for science, for clean air, for an approach to the \nenvironment that says our kids will have a fighting chance to live on a \nplanet that can sustain life and do it in a healthy way.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time on this side and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Today, in the midst of the biggest oil spill in our \nNation's history, we are debating a joint resolution, supported by the \noil industry, among others, that effectively says that the Senate, with \nits extensive expertise, believes the Environmental Protection Agency \nwas wrong to conclude that greenhouse gases are pollutants despite the \npreponderance of the evidence, scientific evidence, that shows this to \nbe an accurate and correct assessment. The Senate can pass a resolution \nsaying practically anything, but it does not change reality. The fact \nis, the best science tells us that climate change is real and that \ngreenhouse gas emissions contribute significantly to it.\n  It is also true that our continuing reliance on fossil fuel \nundermines not only our environmental quality but our national and \neconomic security. We have seen the environmental effects played out \ndramatically and catastrophically in the Gulf of Mexico with the BP \ndisaster. But if we do nothing, we will continue to see our economy \nheld hostage by our need for fossil fuels and the billions of dollars a \nyear we send overseas to buy oil. We will see our national security \nimperiled by our over-reliance on these fossil fuels and our continuing \ninability to take effective, measured action based on science to \ncontrol these greenhouse gases.\n  This resolution is more than just our opinion; it would effectively \nand permanently block the EPA from taking concrete steps today to deal \nwith this problem. For example, it would prevent the EPA from \ncollaborating with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration \non new vehicle efficiency and emission standards. These are \ncommonsense, doable achievements, and, in fact, we are seeing even the \nautomobile industry support this. It is estimated that if the EPA and \nthe highway traffic safety administration move forward, they could save \nconsumers more than $3,000 in fuel costs over the lifetime of their \nvehicles. Think of that. If we were talking about a $3,000 tax rebate \nto Americans, everybody would be jumping up and down saying that is \ngreat.\n  By improving the efficiency of automobiles and doing it in a \nthoughtful way, we can provide consumers, families, over the lifetime \nof a vehicle--several years--$3,000 in benefits rather than shipping \nthat $3,000 overseas to buy petroleum. That is a pretty good deal. This \nresolution would effectively prevent that.\n  The proponents of the resolution say: Congress has to act on this. \nThat is true, but I would be more encouraged with that line of argument \nif it were matched by effective action to deal with the serious \nproblems that face this country today. Indeed, we have spent months and \nweeks laboring over the extension of unemployment benefits. Every \nsignificant bill that has come to this floor has been filibustered time \nand time again. To suggest disingenuously that we will pass this \nresolution and get on to a climate change bill, pass it within several \nweeks or months is, I think, not borne out by the evidence of what we \nhave seen in this Chamber over the last several months.\n  We have to move forward. As I said, this is not only an economic \nissue. It is a national security issue. The Quadrennial Defense Review \nin February 2010 noted--this is the review that is done periodically to \nassess the strategic position of the United States:\n\n       Assessments conducted by the intelligence community \n     indicate climate change could have significant geopolitical \n     impacts around the world, contributing to poverty, \n     environmental degradation, and the further weakening of \n     fragile governments. Climate change will contribute to food \n     and water scarcity, will increase the spread of disease, and \n     may spur or exacerbate mass migration.\n\n\n[[Page S4800]]\n\n\n  In effect, what this review suggested is that it is very likely \nclimate change will be an accelerant of instability. At this moment in \ntime, the last thing we need is to accelerate instability in the world.\n  One of the challenges we face is that this is not the Cold War where \nwe are facing a monolithic Soviet Union and its allies in a strategic \nconflict that can be managed through deterrence. This is a situation \nwhere our greatest danger today is in unstable parts of the world, and \nthat instability is going to be accelerated if we do not take steps. \nThis is not just an issue of the economy, environmental rules, whether \nCongress should act or the agencies act. This is whether we are going \nto deal with the forces that are causing turmoil and instability in the \nworld.\n  For these reasons and many others, I urge rejection of this \nresolution.\n  I reserve the remainder of our time, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, my esteemed colleague from New York, I \nfirst thank our Chair, the Senator from California, who does a great \njob on all of these issues. I thank the Senator from Rhode Island for \nhis, as usual, excellent and prescient words.\n  I join my colleagues in strong opposition to S.J. Res. 26. This is a \njoint resolution disapproving of the rules submitted by EPA which finds \nthat greenhouse gases threaten the public health and our environment. \nThis resolution, if enacted, would turn back the clock on years of \nscientific research that tells us greenhouse gases are damaging to our \nenvironment and our public health.\n  This resolution could not be coming at a more meaningful moment in \nour Nation's history. As we speak, thousands and thousands of barrels \nof oil continue to pour into the gulf, disrupting lives, posing \nenormous risk to our shorelines, and costing our economy billions of \ndollars. Now is certainly not the time to tie the Federal Government's \nhands when it comes to weaning our Nation off unclean fuels. Now would \nbe the last time to allow business as usual for the oil companies who \nalways, as the BP incident shows, prioritize profits over clean energy \nproduction and safety and pollution reduction.\n  The most enthusiastic supporters of this resolution we are debating \ntoday are BP, its fellow oil companies, and their lobbyists in \nWashington. Why should we let BP and their lobbyists take the driver's \nseat? Why should we allow them to tell us how to achieve energy \nindependence, how to keep American people safe from greenhouse gases? \nThey are certainly not good about telling us how to keep safe from \noilspills.\n  We are witnessing firsthand what happens when industry is allowed to \ndo what is best for industry. There are 37 million reasons why we \ncannot let this resolution pass today: 37 million barrels today have \nbled into the gulf on the industry's watch.\n  I urge my colleagues to put aside their ideological positions on \ngovernment regulation and instead work together to rewrite energy \npolicy in this country. We need to focus all of our efforts on a \ncomprehensive solution to a complicated problem and pass legislation to \njump-start clean energy, cap greenhouse gases, and improve our energy \nsecurity. It is critical that we join together in a national commitment \nto reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.\n  We have come too far to reverse the tide on investment in American \ntechnology to reduce pollution and to produce cleaner energy. And we \nstill have miles to go.\n  Even my colleagues who argue about the science of global warming \nagree that energy independence is also a national security issue. We \nsend $1 billion a day overseas to buy foreign oil in large part from \nunstable and dangerous companies such as Iran, and unfriendly countries \nsuch as Venezuela. Our brave men and women fighting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan suffer significant casualties during the transportation of \nfuel and fuel-related supplies which are prime targets for our enemies.\n  Because we have failed to break this dangerous cycle of dependence, \nwe are more reliant on foreign oil today than in the days after 9/11. \nWe certainly can do better. This resolution is a step back.\n  We also all agree that America should have the cleanest air and the \ncleanest water of any place on Earth. We all know a cleaner America is \na stronger America. Placing a cap on carbon emissions is the simplest \nway to achieve this collective goal while creating more U.S. jobs and \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil. And, it works.\n  Two decades ago, President Bush implemented an air pollution cap as a \nway to address the problem of airborne sulfur dioxide, known as acid \nrain, greatly affecting my State. The Bush plan worked. Today it is \nconsidered one of the most effective environmental initiatives in U.S. \nhistory. Lakes in upstate New York, in the Adirondacks and elsewhere, \nthat once were dead are now coming alive.\n  We are at a crossroads right now, and the decisions we make will have \ngreat impacts on our economy, our air quality, and our Nation's energy \nsecurity. We can choose to deny the science and continue to pollute the \nair, fall behind in the energy race, and let big oil run roughshod over \nour economy and environment or we can say no.\n  Or we can learn the lessons from our past, carefully weigh the facts \nand forge a new clean energy future to put America back on the road to \nprosperity.\n  We need to put ideology aside and pass comprehensive energy reform \nthis year. Majority Leader Reid has indicated that we will make an \nenergy bill a top priority this summer. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues to do just that.\n  Once again, I want to voice my opposition to S.J. Res. 26 and urge my \ncolleagues to vote against this attempt to undermine America's nearly \n40-year effort to cut dangerous pollution, protect our air quality, and \nspur innovation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, our speakers at this time will be \nSenator Shaheen for 5 minutes, Senator Sanders for 5 minutes, and \nSenator Cantwell for 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I am pleased to be here to join my \ncolleagues and Senator Boxer--and I thank her for her leadership in \nthis effort--to keep from turning back the clock on our air quality. We \ndesperately need to reform our country's energy policies.\n  Our reliance on fossil fuels means polluting our air, it results in \nan enormous transfer of wealth to other countries--$1 billion a day--\nand it compromises our national security. We are currently sending $150 \nbillion a year to countries that the State Department deems dangerous \nand unsafe.\n  There are tremendous costs domestically associated with this reliance \non fossil fuels. We saw it in 1989 with the Exxon Valdez spill in \nPrince William Sound, and we are seeing it now as the largest \nenvironmental disaster in our country's history plays out before our \nvery eyes in the gulf--the loss of life and the tragedy to the \nenvironment. The way of life that so many people in the gulf have \nenjoyed for generations is unfortunately, we think, going to be gone. \nWe pay a very heavy price for our dependence on fossil fuels. Now is \nthe time to work together to get America running on clean energy.\n  Reforming our Nation's energy policies will help us take control of \nour future in America, a future that will be built on clean energy and \nAmerican power.\n  To those who say we should not be reducing carbon pollution, I simply \ndisagree. We have heard the same tired stories from big oil and big \npolluters again and again. They tell us reducing carbon pollution will \nkill jobs and wreck our economy. Time and time again, we have heard \nthese same arguments, and we know they are not true.\n  Since we passed the Clean Air Act in 1970, we have dramatically \nreduced emissions of dozens of pollutants, we have improved air \nquality, and we have improved public health. The EPA estimates that \nthis year, the Clean Air Act prevented an estimated 20,000 deaths, more \nthan 23,000 cases of chronic bronchitis and asthma, and 59,000 \nhospitalizations.\n\n[[Page S4801]]\n\n  Yet during this same period, despite the current recession that has \nset us back, with the Clean Air Act, we have been able to grow our \neconomy. Our gross domestic product has more than tripled, and average \nhousehold income grew more than 45 percent.\n  We know we can protect the public health, save our environment, and \ngrow our economy.\n  The resolution we are debating today will unravel the only ability we \nhave right now to address carbon pollution. For those who say Congress \nshould make a decision about how to address carbon, they are absolutely \nright. But instead of debating efforts to protect big polluters, we \nshould be using this time to debate how to position our country to lead \nin the global clean energy economy.\n  I have no doubt that the American people have the ingenuity and the \ncompetitive spirit to solve our energy challenges. What they need is \nsome leadership from us in Washington. Now is the time to get America \nrunning on clean energy.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this resolution and for all of us to \nwork together to craft energy policies that will help us transition to \na clean energy economy that will stop carbon pollution and our reliance \non fossil fuels.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I rise in strong opposition to the \nMurkowski resolution which, sadly, is sponsored by virtually the entire \nRepublican caucus, which would overturn EPA's endangerment finding \nunder the Clean Air Act that greenhouse gas emissions pose a threat to \nthe public health and welfare.\n  This resolution is not about whether EPA or Congress should regulate \ngreenhouse gas emissions. What this resolution is about is whether we \ngo forward in public policy based on science or based on politics. That \nis what this resolution is about.\n  I have a very hard time understanding where all of this antiscience \nsentiment is coming from. If an American gets sick and goes to a \ndoctor, she does not worry about whether that doctor is a Republican or \na Democrat, whether the doctor is conservative or progressive. The \nconcern is that the physician is well trained by a certified academic \ninstitution and has the scientific knowledge needed to treat the \nailment. That is what Americans go to doctors for. It is not a \npolitical issue. It is a matter of science and biology, of the best \nmedical treatment available.\n  But somehow when we talk about global warming, we do not have to \nworry about the science, we do not have to worry about what the leading \nexperts and scientific institutions all over the world are telling us. \nFor whatever reason, this discussion about global warming is now \npolitical, not scientific.\n  This is absurd. It should be no more political than the best cancer \ntreatment available or how we deal with a broken leg. Let's look at the \nscience. Let's look at the leading scientists all over the world.\n  Scientists at the following world-renowned American institutions have \nall found that human-caused greenhouse gas emissions are causing global \nwarming. Here they are: NASA, National Science Foundation, Departments \nof Defense, Agriculture, Energy, Interior, Transportation, Health and \nHuman Services, State, Commerce, the Smithsonian Institute, the \nNational Academies of Science, the American Meteorological Society, the \nAmerican Association for the Advancement of Science. The CIA believes \nglobal warming presents one of the major security risks facing our \ncountry. If all of these scientific institutions are wrong, why do we \ncontinue funding them?\n\n  But this is not an issue just for the American scientific community \nor governmental agencies. This is the consensus that exists in \nvirtually every country in the world.\n  It is ironic this resolution against the science of global warming \ncomes from the Republican Senator from Alaska, a State clearly \nexperiencing the impacts of global warming. The Alaska State government \nWeb site says:\n\n       Global warming is currently impacting Alaska and will \n     continue to impact it in a number of ways. These impacts \n     include melting polar ice, the retreat of glaciers, \n     increasing storm intensity, wildfires, coastal flooding, \n     droughts, crop failures, loss of habitat and threatened plant \n     and animal species.\n\n  Three Alaskan villages have begun relocation plans, and the U.S. Army \nof Corps of Engineers says over 160 more rural communities are \nthreatened by erosion from global warming impacts. This is going on in \nAlaska.\n  The evidence of global warming is overwhelming. NASA has reported \nthat the previous decade was the warmest on record--90 percent of \nobserved glaciers are shrinking. Glacier National Park had 150 glaciers \nin 1910 and now has just 30. Arctic sea ice is covering smaller areas \nevery summer. Sea levels have risen as much as 9 inches in some areas, \ncausing the island nation of Maldives to divert revenues to purchase a \nnew homeland for its people. Harmful insects are migrating for higher \naltitudes and causing forest destruction, including 70,000 square miles \nof American and Canadian forests since 2000.\n  So with all of this evidence, who is arguing against global warming? \nWho is saying it is not real? Well, the well-known climate expert Glen \nBeck has suggested climate scientists should commit suicide and \ncompared Al Gore to Adolf Hitler. There you go. Rush Limbaugh, another \nscientist of outstanding repute, says global warming is ``bogus'' and \nis the work of ``pseudoscientists.''\n  Well, from where are these rightwing media commentators getting their \ntalking points? In many cases from precisely those corporations that \nwant us to remain dependent on fossil fuel, that want us to continue \nimporting hundreds of billions of dollars a year of foreign oil, that \nwant to continue making record-breaking billions and billions of \ndollars in profit as they charge us $3 per gallon of gas.\n  During the 1990s, big oil companies such as Exxon and BP funded an \nindustry front group called the Global Climate Coalition.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 30 seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SANDERS. These oil companies used tobacco industry lobbyists and \ntactics to cast doubt on global warming science.\n  What this is about is, if our Nation is to prosper, if we are to \ncreate the millions of jobs we desperately need, we have to have \nscience-based public policy and not politically based. I would hope \nthat we will reject, very strongly, the Murkowski resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Madam President, I thank Senator Boxer for her \npassionate leadership in defense of the Clean Air Act and the pollution \nprotections this bedrock law provides every American. I appreciate her \nyielding me time to speak in opposition to the Resolution of \nDisapproval introduced by Senator Murkowski.\n  Madam President, I don't think any of my colleagues would disagree \nthat the Clean Air Act has been one of the most effective environmental \nlaws ever passed in our Nation. It has literally saved the lives of \nthousands of children who would otherwise have suffered terribly from \nthe effects of air pollution.\n  The economic benefits of the Clean Air Act are immense, and it has \nbeen credited with turning around a dire acid rain problem that was \nthreatening the natural heritage of all of New England. The critically \nimportant 1970 amendments to the Act were a bipartisan bill. Those \nimprovements--really called the Muskie Act, in honor of the key role \nplayed by the former Senator from Maine, Ed Muskie--were, of course, \nsigned into law by a Republican President, Richard Nixon.\n  The next major revisions came 20 years later, in 1990, and those \nimprovements cracked down on acid rain and lead in our gasoline supply.\n  But today we are talking about a Resolution that would undermine the \nClean Air Act, rather than strengthen it. We are actually debating \nwhether to overturn the science-based determination that greenhouse \ngases pose a threat to the public health and welfare to the current and \nfuture generations of Americans.\n  Madam President, the Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse \ngases are pollutants and are covered by the\n\n[[Page S4802]]\n\nClean Air Act. Consequently, the court held that the Environmental \nProtection Agency must make a determination, based on the available \nscience, about whether greenhouse gases pose a threat to the public. \nEPA engaged in a thorough public process, assessed the available \nscientific evidence, and ultimately determined that greenhouse gases do \npose a threat to public health and welfare.\n  The reason I recount all this history, Madam President, is to show \nthat these findings are not the casual or capricious action of a small \ngroup of bureaucrats. Rather, they are the result of a long and \ntransparent process prescribed by statute and the highest court in the \nland.\n  In announcing her resolution last January, my colleague, Senator \nMurkowski, said:\n\n       We should continue our work to pass meaningful energy and \n     climate legislation, but in the meantime, we cannot turn a \n     blind eye to the EPA's efforts to impose back-door climate \n     regulations.\n\n  While I fully agree with my colleague on the first point--we do need \nto work together on meaningful energy and climate legislation--I have \nto say I disagree on the second point, about the back-door regulations. \nThough Congress may not have specifically anticipated greenhouse gas \nemissions when the Clean Air Act was originally passed, the same can be \nsaid of many pollutants. Indeed, when the 1970 law passed, only five \npollutants were initially listed. Since then, dozens of additional \npollutants have been listed and the air we breathe is better for it. \nThis is not an example of an agency overreaching, it is the way the \nClean Air Act was designed to work.\n  The drafters of the Clean Air Act never claimed they could predict \nall of the pollutants that might someday fall under its jurisdiction. \nThat is why they established a framework and a public process that \ncould be used to regulate any pollutant that science--science--\nultimately identified as a threat to public health and welfare.\n  Today, 40 years later, we have come to the point where thousands of \nscientists, working throughout the Federal Government and around the \nworld over the course of decades, have identified a serious risk \nassociated with the emissions of greenhouse gases. Given these \nscientific findings, the legal mandate from the United States Supreme \nCourt, and the statutory requirements spelled out in the Clean Air Act, \nthe EPA has a responsibility to act.\n  For Congress now to undermine this process would be----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. I ask unanimous consent for an additional 15 seconds.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. For Congress now to undermine that process would be to \nundermine the Clean Air Act itself and the sanctity of science-based \npolicymaking. It would be a very bad precedent, and it would be a \nthreat to our children and to the environment in which we want them to \ngrow up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Madam President, for this next 30 minutes, we will be \nallocating the block in a 20-minute segment that will be under the \ncontrol of Senator Barrasso to engage in a colloquy with several of our \nRepublican colleagues, and following that 20 minutes there will be 10 \nminutes under the control of Senator Nelson of Nebraska.\n  We have a lot of Members who wish to speak in support of this \nresolution, so we are trying to accommodate as many as possible. With \nthat, I yield to my friend, the Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I thank my colleague for allowing me \nto conduct this colloquy with other colleagues who are here as part of \nthe Senate Western Caucus. We are here to speak in favor of the \nMurkowski resolution in opposing what the Environmental Protection \nAgency is trying to do in terms of its efforts to regulate climate \nchange because we know that is a job killer for all Americans.\n  I see my colleague, Senator Hatch from Utah, and I understand he has \nsome new information he would like to share with the people of America \nand the Senate.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank my colleague, and I appreciate \nbeing here with my two colleagues from Wyoming and also Idaho. Let me \nstart by applauding Senator Murkowski for her strong leadership on this \nissue, and I stand squarely behind her effort.\n  To summarize what has already been laid out, the EPA has released \nfindings that, No. 1, human carbon emissions contribute in a \nsignificant way to global warming, and, No. 2, global warming, which \nhas been going on for about 10,000 years now, is an endangerment to \nhumans.\n  The EPA's foundation for its proposal relies on the assumption that \nboth of these findings are the truth.\n  Madam President, I was sorely disappointed but not too surprised when \nI learned the EPA based its ``findings'' almost entirely on the work \ndone by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change--\nor the IPCC. I have no problem with much of the science produced by the \nIPCC scientists, but I have a real problem with the way that science is \nsummarized by the political leaders at the IPCC and by the conclusions \ndrawn by those same political leaders in the IPCC's Summary for \nPolicymakers, which is not a science document.\n  It becomes immediately evident that the EPA relies heavily on these \npolitical summaries and conclusions rather than actual science produced \nby the IPCC because we now have abundant proof that a wide gulf exists \nbetween what the science indicates and what the political leaders of \nthe IPCC pretend that it indicates.\n  But I am not asking anyone to take my word for this. Instead, let's \nlisten to what the IPCC scientists are saying about the conclusions \nthat politicians at the IPCC have been selling to policymakers. Here is \nwhat Dr. John T. Everett has to say. He was an IPCC lead author and \nexpert reviewer and a former National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration senior manager. He says:\n\n       It is time for a reality check. Warming is not a big deal \n     and is not a bad thing. The oceans and coastal zones have \n     been far warmer and colder than is projected in the present \n     scenarios of climate change.\n\n  Well, there is one of the IPCC's top scientists saying that the \nwarming we are experiencing is not an endangerment.\n  Let's hear another scientist, Dr. Richard Tol. He was the author of \nthree full U.N. IPCC working groups and the Director of the Center for \nMarine and Atmospheric Science. He says:\n\n       There is no risk of damage [from global warming] that would \n     force us to act injudiciously.\n\n  As an illustration, he explains:\n\n       Warming temperatures will mean that in 2050 there will be \n     about 40,000 fewer deaths in Germany attributable to cold-\n     related illnesses like the flu.\n\n  What is that, Madam President? Here we have another top scientist at \nthe IPCC telling us that warming will actually save lives, not endanger \nthem?\n  Dr. Oliver W. Frauenfeld, a contributing author to the U.N. IPCC \nWorking Group 1 Fourth Assessment Report, sends those of us who are \npolicymakers a serious warning. He says:\n\n       Only after we identify these factors and determine how they \n     affect one another, can we begin to produce accurate models. \n     And only then should we rely on those models to shape policy.\n\n  I hope my colleagues in the Senate are listening today because these \nU.N. IPCC scientists are speaking directly to us. I wonder at what cost \nto our economy and our competitiveness will we as policymakers continue \nto ignore the actual scientists at the IPCC? There is nowhere near a \nscientific consensus on either one of the EPA's ``findings'' that \nhumans are causing warming or that warming is necessarily bad for the \nenvironment or for humankind.\n  MIT climate scientist, Dr. Richard Lindzen, another IPCC lead author \nand expert reviewer, dispels the notion there is a scientific consensus \nin favor of drastic climate policy. He explains:\n\n       One of the things the scientific community is pretty agreed \n     on is those things will have virtually no impact on climate \n     no matter what the models say. So the question is do you \n     spend trillions of dollars to have no impact? And that seems \n     like a nobrainer.\n\n  Another top IPCC scientist and lead author was Dr. John Christy. He \nexplained that the U.N. IPCC process had become corrupted by politics. \nHe says:\n\n       I was at the table with three Europeans, and we were having \n     lunch. And they were\n\n[[Page S4803]]\n\n     talking about their role as lead authors. And they were \n     talking about how they were trying to make the report so \n     dramatic that the United States would just have to sign that \n     Kyoto Protocol.\n\n  The politicization at the U.N. was so egregious that Dr. Christopher \nW. Landsea, U.N. IPCC author and reviewer and expert scientist with \nNOAA's National Hurricane Center, pronounced:\n\n       I personally cannot in good faith continue to contribute to \n     a process that I view as both being motivated by pre-\n     conceived agendas and being scientifically unsound.\n\n  Now, Madam President, there are many more U.N. and government \nscientists who have publicly expressed their professional opinions that \nthe IPCC political projections are overblown and not supported by the \nscience. I have put together a sampling of their quotations in a report \ncalled the ``UN Climate Scientists Speak Out on Global Warming.'' It is \navailable for download on my Climate 101 link on my Web page. I ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record two documents relating \nto climate change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I would like to address an issue that has \nbeen very carefully ignored by the EPA; that is, the--get this word--\n``benefit'' Americans can expect from the EPA's actions.\n  As Senators, not many of us are scientists, but each of us is a \npolicymaker. As policymakers, we are expected to fully analyze the \ncosts and benefits of any proposal that comes before us.\n  The endangerment the EPA points to is the warming we are supposedly \ncausing. If warming is the endangerment, then the benefit is the amount \nof warming the regulations would avoid. Thanks to the IPCC, we have all \nthe numbers and assumptions we need to be able to determine just how \nmuch warming we could avoid for the amount of carbon emissions the EPA \ncan stop.\n  Let's go on the assumption that the EPA will successfully reduce \nhuman CO2 emissions in this country by 83 percent over the \nnext century. According to the alarmist and some would say overblown \nassumptions at the U.N. IPCC, Americans can expect a cooling benefit of \nsomewhere between 0.07 and 0.2 degrees Celsius after a full 100 years \nof effort. That is right, we are being asked to give up trillions of \ndollars in economic activity, send all manufacturing activity overseas, \ngive up millions of jobs, and put basic human activities under the \ncontrol of the EPA, all for a benefit that cannot be measured on a \nhousehold thermometer after 100 years of sacrifice and pain.\n  The EPA tells us our human carbon emissions are leading to a general \ncatastrophe, but then we find out that if we do what they say, it will \nmake no real difference. So I ask the EPA Administrator this question: \nHave you done a real risk-benefit analysis of these proposed carbon \nemission regulations? I don't want to hear all the scary scenarios \nabout general global warming; I want to know the actual risk associated \nwith an 0.07 to 0.2 degree decrease in temperature over 100 years \nbecause that is what we are talking about here. That is the analysis I \nwant to see because when you stack up the astounding costs on the scale \nagainst such a tiny benefit, you have the most lopsided and obvious \nfailure of a cost-benefit analysis I have ever seen.\n  I notice my other two colleagues are here. I have gone on a little \nlonger than I wanted to.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From National Geographic News, July 31, 2009]\n\n             Sahara Desert Greening Due to Climate Change?\n\n                            (By James Owen)\n\n       Desertification, drought, and despair--that's what global \n     warming has in store for much of Africa. Or so we hear.\n       Emerging evidence is painting a very different scenario, \n     one in which rising temperatures could benefit millions of \n     Africans in the driest parts of the continent.\n       Scientists are now seeing signals that the Sahara desert \n     and surrounding regions are greening due to increasing \n     rainfall.\n       If sustained, these rains could revitalize drought-ravaged \n     regions, reclaiming them for farming communities.\n       This desert-shrinking trend is supported by climate models, \n     which predict a return to conditions that turned the Sahara \n     into a lush savanna some 12,000 years ago.\n\n\n                              green shoots\n\n       The green shoots of recovery are showing up on satellite \n     images of regions including the Sahel, a semi-desert zone \n     bordering the Sahara to the south that stretches some 2,400 \n     miles (3,860 kilometers).\n       Images taken between 1982 and 2002 revealed extensive \n     regreening throughout the Sahel, according to a new study in \n     the journal Biogeosciences.\n       The study suggests huge increases in vegetation in areas \n     including central Chad and western Sudan.\n       The transition may be occurring because hotter air has more \n     capacity to hold moisture, which in turn creates more rain, \n     said Martin Claussen of the Max Planck Institute for \n     Meteorology in Hamburg, Germany, who was not involved in the \n     new study.\n       ``The water-holding capacity of the air is the main driving \n     force,'' Claussen said.\n\n\n                         not a single scorpion\n\n       While satellite images can't distinguish temporary plants \n     like grasses that come and go with the rains, ground surveys \n     suggest recent vegetation change is firmly rooted.\n       In the eastern Sahara area of southwestern Egypt and \n     northern Sudan, new trees--such as acacias--are flourishing, \n     according to Stefan Kropelin, a climate scientist at the \n     University of Cologne's Africa Research Unit in Germany.\n       Shrubs are coming up and growing into big shrubs. This is \n     completely different from having a bit more tiny grass,'' \n     said Kropelin, who has studied the region for two decades.\n       In 2008 Kropelin--not involved in the new satellite \n     research--visited Western Sahara, a disputed territory \n     controlled by Morocco.\n       ``The nomads there told me there was never as much rainfall \n     as in the past few years,'' Kropelin said. ``They have never \n     seen so much grazing land.''\n       ``Before, there was not a single scorpion, not a single \n     blade of grass,'' he said.\n       ``Now you have people grazing their camels in areas which \n     may not have been used for hundreds or even thousands of \n     years. You see birds, ostriches, gazelles coming back, even \n     sorts of amphibians coming back,'' he said.\n       ``The trend has continued for more than 20 years. It is \n     indisputable.''\n\n\n                            uncertain future\n\n       An explosion in plant growth has been predicted by some \n     climate models.\n       For instance, in 2005 a team led by Reindert Haarsma of the \n     Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute in De Bilt, the \n     Netherlands, forecast significantly more future rainfall in \n     the Sahel.\n       The study in Geophysical Research Letters predicated that \n     rainfall in the July to September wet season would rise by up \n     to two millimeters a day by 2080.\n       Satellite data shows ``that indeed during the last decade, \n     the Sahel is becoming more green,'' Haarsma said.\n       Even so, climate scientists don't agree on how future \n     climate change will affect the Sahel: Some studies simulate a \n     decrease in rainfall.\n       ``This issue is still rather uncertain,'' Haarsma said.\n       Max Planck's Claussen said North Africa is the area of \n     greatest disagreement among climate change modelers.\n       Forecasting how global warming will affect the region is \n     complicated by its vast size and the unpredictable influence \n     of high-altitude winds that disperse monsoon rains, Claussen \n     added.\n       ``Half the models follow a wetter trend, and half a \n     drier.''\n                                  ____\n\n\nSample of Scientific Studies ShowingReal-World Benefits of Warming for \n                          Species and Habitat\n\n\n  IPCC Global Warming-Induced Extinction Hypothesis Based on Computer \n                                 Models\n\n       1.

The \nbenefits, however, are theoretical.\n  I see my colleague and friend from Idaho here. I ask him, who elected \nthe Environmental Protection Agency? Because we sure know the American \npeople are against these increased costs for energy and these job-\nkilling regulations.\n  Mr. RISCH. I thank my colleague, Senator Barrasso. You were cheating, \nlooking at my notes over my shoulder. A well made point.\n  I come at this whole proposition from a little different way than \nperhaps a lot of my colleagues do. All of this debate has been about \nglobal warming and about whether we should regulate carbon and how we \nshould do that and what have you. But that is not really the issue on \nthis resolution. This resolution is about the separation of powers. The \nConstitution of this great land that we all took an oath to uphold is \nvery specific in separating the powers of the executive branch, the \nlegislative branch, and the judicial branch. The Founding Fathers \nwisely separated the different branches so that none could overpower \nthe other. What are we doing here? The movement by the administration \nand by the Environmental Protection Agency is to take from the \nlegislative branch the power that belongs to the legislative branch.\n  It is obvious in the debate that is going on here that we have deep \ndifferences, which we should have, because this is a major policy \ndecision\n\n[[Page S4805]]\n\nthat will affect every single American. It has profound effects on the \neconomy. It has profound effects on the movement of jobs overseas. \nThese are things that should be debated and are things that should be \ndecided by elected persons--not by the people at the EPA, who are not \nelected and who are not answerable to the electorate.\n  When this happens, what you get is a deterioration of the \nConstitution of this great country. Each of the branches is constantly \ntugging at the other, attempting to pull power away from the other and \nattempting to consolidate power within itself. This movement by the EPA \nto effect policy is one of those power struggles. Every single Member \nof this body should be concerned about the shift of power from the \nlegislative branch to the administrative branch.\n  What has happened here, as everyone can see, is this has become \npolarized. Again, it has become a partisan argument that we should \nallow the EPA to do this because we can't seem to get it through the \nlegislative branch as quickly or as efficiently or leaning to the left \nas we want. That is wrong. It is just plain wrong. It should be decided \nright here. Those policy decisions should be debated here. Those policy \ndecisions should be made on the floor of this body and on the floor of \nthe House of Representatives. This is not a job for nonelected persons. \nIt is a job for the people who have been elected and who have to go \nhome again and face reelection and listen to the voters say: You did a \ngreat job controlling global warming or, you doofus, what are you \ndoing? You can't possibly do it the way you want to do it.\n  That is a debate which should be held here. Why has this become so \npartisan? At the end of the day, we all know how this is going to come \nout. There are going to be 55 votes, give or take a couple, to defeat \nSenator Murkowski's resolution. It is going to be generally on a party-\nline basis. At the end, the administration will claim a great and \nglorious victory again. But it will not be a great and glorious victory \nfor the American people; it will be a defeat for the American people. \nAnd more important, it will be a defeat and another erosion of the \nConstitution of this great country and movement of power from the \nlegislative branch where it belongs to the administrative branch, to \nthe bureaucrats, to the people who are not elected. That is a wrong way \nto do this. It should stay right here in the legislative body.\n  I yield the floor back to my good friend, Senator Barrasso.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I think my colleague makes a key point. My colleague \nfrom Idaho has been discussing what has been described as the worst \ndisaster in American history, and it is what is happening right today \nin the Gulf of Mexico. Should the Environmental Protection Agency maybe \nbe focusing its efforts there, where we know there is a real problem, a \nreal job to be done, real concerns, and the American people are looking \nor should the Environmental Protection Agency spend its time and spend \nour resources driving up the cost of energy and doing it with the idea \nthat perhaps 100 years from now it might make a difference? The efforts \nought to be placed today where the efforts are needed most. The \nEnvironmental Protection Agency ought to be focused on the gulf, not on \nsomething that theoretically may make a difference 100 years from now.\n  At a time when emissions are going up in China and going up in India \nand going up in Russia, going up all around the world, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency says: I want to handcuff the American \neconomy, handcuff the small businesses of this country. At a time with \n9.7 percent unemployment, let's make it tougher on Americans--that is \nwhat the Environmental Protection Agency wants to do. If this Senate \ngoes ahead and defeats the Murkowski amendment, they will be saying \nexactly the same thing. We are going to make it tougher on small \nbusinesses.\n  For the small businesses in the western part of the country, we have \nour small refiners, we have our agricultural folks, tourism folks--all \nof the different people as part of the Western Caucus. What is this \nimpact going to do to you? What is your position? We contacted \nagricultural groups all around the West. Look at this map of the United \nStates. More than half of the square miles of the United States \nincluded in here support the Murkowski resolution because they know it \nis key to their economy. It is key to those parts of the country. It is \nkey to agriculture. It is key to energy production. And it is key to \nfamilies who are trying to balance their budgets, live within their \nmeans. They do not want to see an increase in taxes, which is what this \nis--an increase in energy costs at a time of 9.7 percent unemployment.\n  I tell you, I am here to support the Murkowski resolution of \ndisapproval. The EPA's endangerment finding starts the process of \ntaxing everything Americans do: driving cars, heating homes, powering \nsmall businesses. This will cost millions of Americans their jobs.\n  It is fascinating. The Small Business Administration wrote to the EPA \na couple of times reminding the Environmental Protection Agency to stop \nthe endangerment finding and look at its impact on small businesses, on \nsmall communities. The SBA basically said: Comply with the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act, the law meant to protect small businesses from \nexcessive regulation from Washington.\n  I will tell you, when you talk about excessive regulations from \nWashington, we have seen them in the last year and a half. This bedrock \nlaw was meant to protect the ranchers, the small refiners around the \nStates, restaurant owners in Utah, dairy farmers--you name it. But with \nunemployment hovering at about 9.7 percent, it is unacceptable that the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency has failed to evaluate the impact of \ngreenhouse gas regulations on the small businesses and the communities \nacross America. Who grows jobs in America? Small businesses. In the \nlast 15 years, small business owners have been responsible for 64 \npercent of all job creation in America. But additional regulations, \nadditional rules, additional taxes make it that much harder.\n  Is it going to actually have an impact on the global environment? No, \nnot at all, not when you take a look at what is happening in China, \nwhere their emissions are going to go up every year all the way through \n2050. India's emissions are going up; more and more energy is being \nused. If you want to use energy well, the United States does the best \njob in using it efficiently.\n  It just seems that when I go home on weekends to Wyoming--and I will \nbe there again tomorrow--and I talk to people in various parts of the \nState, they say: What are they thinking back in Washington? Why are \nthey going to make it harder for us to compete? Why are they going to \nmake it harder for us economically?\n  The food producers in our Nation compete globally to sell food \nproducts, and they do it in a way where we need to use energy. \nAgriculture is a hugely energy-intense operation, and anything that \nincreases the costs of producing that food is going to get passed on to \nconsumers in this country and consumers in other nations as we go ahead \nand try to compete and sell our products overseas.\n  It does seem that this EPA endangerment rule will ruin the small \nbusiness engine that drives the economy on jobs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Madam President, today I rise to speak in \nsupport of the bipartisan resolution of disapproval offered by my \ncolleague and friend, Senator Murkowski from Alaska, and out of concern \nas well about a serious, harmful impact on Nebraska's economy that \ncould result if the Environmental Protection Agency moves ahead with \nits plans to regulate carbon emissions in our country.\n  While I will outline some of that impact in a moment, I wish to first \nexplain why I am supporting the resolution. I am supporting it to \nprotect the Nebraska economy and our Nation's economy from EPA \noverreach. It is that simple. I want to send a clear message: \nNebraska's farmers, ranchers, business owners, cities, towns, and \nhundreds of thousands of electricity consumers should not have their \neconomic fortunes determined by unelected bureaucrats in Washington, \nDC.\n\n[[Page S4806]]\n\n  Finding a national consensus on how to control the levels of carbon \nemissions is the job of elected Members of Congress. Reducing carbon \nemissions will have a substantial economic impact on our country but in \ndifferent ways for different States. Congress should take the lead in \ndetermining the rules that will apply.\n  American people may not support. It does not change the Clean Air \nAct. It says Congress should write the new rules curbing carbon \nemissions.\n  The reason this is important can be found in what I have heard from \nmany Nebraskans about the impact of the EPA's proposed carbon emissions \nregulations.\n  For nearly 2 years, since the EPA's initial Proposed Rulemaking for \nRegulating Greenhouse Gas Emissions under the Clean Air Act in July \n2008, I have heard from Nebraskans.\n  Many agricultural, industrial and energy-related businesses and \norganizations in my State have warned that the EPA regulations will \nimpose substantial new costs on farmers, ranchers, small businesses, \ncommunities and users of electricity. EPA regulations would impose a \ntop-down government-directed regime that would raise the price of \nenergy in Nebraska, add greatly to administrative costs, and create new \nlayers of bureaucracy.\n  While no one can say how much, because even the EPA does not know yet \nwhat requirements will be imposed on power suppliers, the cost in \nNebraska will be significant.\n  Regulated entities such as Nebraska's two Public Power companies, \nwhich provide electricity directly to 1.34 million Nebraskans in a \nState of 1.7 million residents, would be subject to an inflexible \nregulatory process. It would require new permits to be acquired before \nfacilities are built or modified, and before Best Available Control \nTechnology is purchased, installed, and operated.\n  The application process for a single EPA permit for a new or modified \nsource could cost the applicant hundreds of thousands of dollars and \nrequire more than 300 person-hours for a regulatory agency.\n  In Nebraska today, coal serves as our primary fuel source to produce \nelectricity. We also have a great potential to move to renewable energy \nresources such as wind. But the EPA's regulation of greenhouse gas \nemissions would force a move to other fuel alternatives at rates that \nwould substantially increase the cost of electricity for consumers in \nour State. This is incontrovertible.\n  Soaring electricity rates would have a detrimental impact on many \nbusinesses and manufacturers. One of them is Nucor Steel in Norfolk, \none of the largest users of electricity in Nebraska.\n  If you couple the electricity rate increase with new regulations and \nreview processes for companies like Nucor to make major modifications \nto an existing facility or build a new facility, you have a recipe for \ntrouble. EPA regulation of greenhouse gases would have chilling effects \non new investment in our Nation's manufacturing sector that we are just \nbeginning to see come around from the economic downturn.\n\n  Further, these new regulatory costs are not limited to our utility \nconsumers and manufacturers. They could devastate Nebraska's No. 1 \nindustry: Agriculture.\n  According the Nebraska Farm Bureau, were the EPA's tailoring rule not \nto work, an estimated 37,000 farms nationwide would emit more \ngreenhouse gas emissions than the Clean Air Act threshold levels allow. \nPermits generally cost more than $23,000, so the regulations could add \n$886 million in costs to our farmers.\n  Not only will our farms bear additional bureaucratic costs, but they \nwill be put at a disadvantage in the global marketplace.\n  The Nebraska Soybean Association notes that every other row of our \nState's soybean crop is exported. The EPA's new regulations will put \ncommodities such as Nebraska-produced soybeans at a disadvantage to our \nforeign competitors who are not subject to similar burdensome \nregulations.\n  Earlier this year, in his State of the Union Address, the President \ncalled for doubling our exports over the next 5 years to create more \njobs in America. That goal is at cross purposes with allowing new \nregulations to go forward that will hamstring our producers as they try \nto compete in the global marketplace.\n  Additionally, the Nebraska Corn Growers point out that the increase \nin the bureaucratic costs to farms will boost agriculture input costs. \nWith that, our Nation's farms will not even be competitive with foreign \nproducers here at home. That, then, in turn will lead to more foreign \ndependence and less security for the U.S. food and fuels supply.\n  This strikes me as possibly the biggest negative consequence of the \nEPA getting out ahead of Congress. As I pointed out time and time again \nduring debate on the 2008 farm bill:\n\n       If you love that we are dependent on other nations for our \n     energy needs, you'll love even more relying on other nations \n     for our food.\n\n  I am aware that some have argued that support of this resolution is \nan attack on the Clean Air Act. Some say that if the resolution passes \nit would lead to an even greater reliance on oil leading to more \nsituations like the spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  I am not going to go for a smokescreen argument against the Murkowski \nresolution.\n  The resolution would only prevent an unwarranted and ill-advised \nexpansion of the Clean Air Act's implementation. Every current standard \nand control for air pollution would be preserved exactly intact, as \nwritten and authorized by Congress.\n  Now, I have no doubt that carbon emissions should be reduced in the \nU.S. But not through excessively costly EPA regulations or a \ncomplicated cap and trade proposal that could spur speculation that \nenriches Wall Street, while not cleaning the air above Main Street.\n  In my view greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced through a \ncomprehensive energy bill. One that promotes efficiency, innovation, \nnew technology, and renewable energy such as wind and biofuels that can \nbe produced in Nebraska's fields. An energy bill should help, not harm, \nNebraska and the American economy as it cleans up the air.\n  By pursuing that kind of a sound energy policy we will take important \nsteps toward ending our reliance on energy from areas that can be \nunstable such as the Middle East, South America and Africa. Instead, we \ncan create our own American energy from the Sun, the wind and the \nbiofuels available throughout the Midwest, and across our great land.\n  I believe there is bipartisan support for this type of comprehensive \nenergy bill. I hope we can turn our attention to it soon.\n  We should work together on legislation that enables our agricultural \nand manufacturing industries to grow, rather than wilt under layers of \nunilateral and bureaucratic EPA directives.\n  When Congress takes the lead in that manner, Nebraska families, \nfarmers and businesses will prosper, and so will America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, at this time I yield 10 minutes to \nSenator Feinstein, followed by 10 minutes to Senator Carper.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I just learned, by looking at one of \nthe boards out here, that we have something called a Western Caucus, \nand the largest State in the Union that is bigger than all of the \nStates in population in the caucus has not been invited to join the \nWestern Caucus. Well, so be it. We will have to suffer along.\n  This measure, I believe, sets a dangerous precedent by invalidating \nthe endangerment finding on greenhouse gas pollution. I strongly oppose \nit. I wish to make the public health argument.\n  What is an ``endangerment finding''? Simply put, it is a scientific \ndetermination made by the EPA that an air pollutant endangers the \nhealth and welfare of the American people and, therefore, it must be \nregulated under the Clean Air Act.\n  This came about because of a 2007 case, Massachusetts v. EPA. What \nthe Supreme Court said was that the EPA has an obligation to study the \nimpact of global warming. Specifically, the majority opinion found that \n``greenhouse gases fit well within the Clean\n\n[[Page S4807]]\n\nAir Act's definition of an air pollutant.'' It ordered the EPA to \ncomply with the Clean Air Act and make a determination about whether \ngreenhouse gases could ``reasonably endanger public health or \nwelfare.''\n  In December 2009, the EPA issued the required final endangerment \nfinding, and that final finding said:\n\n       The emission of six greenhouse gasses, carbon dioxide, \n     methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, \n     and sulfur hexafluoride, threaten the public health and \n     welfare of current and future generations.\n\n  Accordingly, the Administrator has initiated action to curb these \nemissions in order to protect the health and safety. Many argue, and I \nhappen to concur, that a national cap-and-trade system on these gases \nmight be more efficient and less costly than having to regulate them \nunder the Clean Air Act. Yet, the Senate has failed time and again to \napprove climate change legislation. We have dithered while the Earth \nheats.\n  That means right now, EPA is the only Federal agency with the \nstatutory authority to protect the American public's health and safety \nfrom greenhouse gas pollution.\n  The Murkowski resolution, however, would throw out this endangerment \nfinding. It would stop EPA dead in its tracks. This would have some \nreal and very serious consequences. First, it would put the Senate on \nrecord rejecting scientific analysis of EPA experts. Second, it would \nblock the implementation of a new Federal fuel economy program. Third, \nit would put the Senate at odds with a coalition of 115 nations that \nsigned the Copenhagen summit agreement. The President has threatened to \nveto this resolution if it passes, and I would support that veto.\n  Now, health effects. The EPA's endangerment finding says that global \nwarming will have four significant detrimental human health effects. \nOne, more heat waves will mean more heat-related deaths, which is \nalready the leading cause of weather-related deaths in our country. \nTwo, increased extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, put human \nlives at risk. Katrina demonstrated that in tragic fashion. And, three, \na warmer climate will likely result in an increase in the spread of \nseveral food and waterborne pathogens, including tropical diseases.\n  Finally, and most important to the Chair's State and my State, EPA's \nendangerment finding states:\n\n       Climate change is expected to increase regional ozone \n     pollution with associated risks in respiratory illnesses and \n     premature death.\n\n  California has two of the worst nonattainment regions in the country: \nthe South Coast Basin, including Los Angeles, and the San Joaquin \nValley. Experts tells us combined ozone and particulate matter \ncontribute to up to 14,000 deaths and $71 billion in health care costs \nevery year.\n  Roughly 2.5 million Californians--that is bigger than most of these \nStates in the Western Caucus--2.5 million Californians suffer from \nasthma, and it is increasing, and other air-pollution-related \nillnesses.\n  This is a matter of saving lives. It is a matter of major health \nconcern and welfare, and it should be looked at that way. If \ntemperatures rise as projected, these two regions of our country could \nsee 75 to 85 percent more days with warming-related smog and ozone \npollution. Fact. This means more asthma, more lung-related disease, \nmore premature deaths from air pollution. These scientific observations \nare not political statements. They are fact established by scientific \nstudy after study. Yet the resolution offered today would reject this \nevidence.\n  The EPA is legally charged with protecting the public's health and \nwelfare from air pollution. Not to do so, in my opinion, is \nmalfeasance.\n  Additionally, the Murkowski resolution would invalidate the Federal \nfuel economy program. On April 1, the administration finalized joint \nstandards issued by EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration, more fondly known as NHTSA, in coordination with the \nState of California to require automakers to increase fleetwide fuel \nefficiency from the 2008 average of 27 miles per gallon to the \nequivalent of 35.5 miles per gallon in 2016. This is important. It is \nbased on the enacted Ten-in-Ten Fuel Economy Act which I authored with \nSenator Olympia Snowe and others. That law requires automakers to \nincrease fleetwide fuel economy to the maximum feasible rate beginning \nwith 2011 vehicle models. I have been proud and encouraged to see the \nadministration aggressively implement this program. Yet if EPA's \nendangerment finding is invalidated by Congress and thrown out, it \nwould mean that the Federal fuel economy program would collapse.\n  If that happens, California and 14 other States are required to \nenforce their respective State law, regulating tailpipe greenhouse gas \nemission standards. According to the auto industry, this would reimpose \nthe very patchwork of regulation they have argued against for many \nyears. This would be a major setback. EPA Administrator Jackson has \nwritten that Senator Murkowski's resolution:\n\n     would undo the historic agreement among states, automakers, \n     the federal government, and other stakeholders . . . leaving \n     the automobile industry without explicit nationwide \n     uniformity that it has described as important to its \n     business.\n\n  State environment commissioners from nine States have written to \nCongress to explain that they prefer a national approach, but they will \nenforce their State statutes as long as the Federal Government refuses \nto act. So the effect of the Murkowski resolution will be to encourage \na State-by-State variation of regulation. Not good. The EPA is the \nagency we have charged to protect our children and our environment from \nharmful air pollution. EPA is moving forward slowly and carefully to \naddress this issue. Its proposed rules would apply only to the very \nlargest sources until 2016, 6 years from now. If we in the Senate don't \nlike EPA's proposal, we should pass a climate change bill. But the one \nthing we should absolutely not do is deny the existence of a problem \nthat science says is severely dangerous to our planet.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. I wish to begin by saying some nice words about the \nSenator from Alaska. When she ran for the Senate the first time, she \nran against one of my dearest friends, former Governor Tony Knowles, \nwhom I tried very hard to elect to the Senate. When he lost, I said: \nYou are here. I want to work with you. I want to be your partner on a \nwhole lot of things.\n  This is one we cannot be partners and colleagues on. I want her to \nknow, though, there will be other opportunities, and I look forward to \nthose opportunities. Today I am compelled to oppose what she is \nattempting to do.\n  As my colleagues are aware, I go back and forth on the train every \nday and night. Usually before I catch the 7:15 train in Wilmington, I \ngo to the YMCA and work out. Sometimes people talk to me and say: Hi, \nhow are you? Sometimes they try to raise issues. This week a fellow \ncame up to me and said: What is this all about? ``This'' being today's \ndebate on the proposal of the Senator from Alaska. I didn't have time \nto explore it in detail in order to make my train, but I want to answer \nhis question today.\n  This is about are we going to be guided by decades of science from \nthousands of respected scientists or not. This is about are we going to \nseize the opportunity that is inherent in the adversity we face at home \nand around the world or not. This is about are we going to get serious \nabout ending our addiction to oil, a lot of which in our country is in \nplaces like the Gulf of Mexico, some thousands of feet below the \nsurface of the water or not. This is about are we going to stop sending \nliterally maybe hundreds of billions of dollars every year to places \naround the world that are unstable, nondemocratic, propping up tyrants \nwho lead countries such as Iran and Venezuela or not. This is about are \nwe going to continue sending troops to places such as Iraq or other \nplaces where they happen to have a lot of oil and we want to make sure \nthere is access to the oil or not. This is about whether we are going \nto jump-start our economy at a time in our history when millions of \nyoung people are graduating from colleges, universities, and high \nschools wondering if they will have the kind of opportunity to find a \njob and provide for themselves and their families some day, to provide \na good life, better than the one they have inherited from their \nparents. That is what this is about.\n  We have heard--and I know my colleagues have heard--from thousands of\n\n[[Page S4808]]\n\nscientists from all over the country who give us their advice. What are \nthey telling us? Among the things they are telling us is that the Earth \nis growing warmer. They are telling us that we are part of the cause. \nThey are telling us to do something about it. They are saying to us if \nwe won't do something about it, at least let EPA do the job they have \nbeen told by the Supreme Court they have to do under the Clean Air Act. \nAmong the things they have had to do under the Clean Air Act is to \nprovide for ratcheting up the fuel efficiency of cars, trucks, and vans \nup to about 34 miles per gallon by 2016. The effect of doing that will \ntake something like 50 million cars, trucks, and vans off the road by \n2030. That is the kind of thing EPA needs to do, if we will let them.\n  Who are the scientists we are hearing from? I don't know them all. We \nhave heard from a couple thousand. I know a couple of them well. Their \nnames are Lonnie and Ellen Thompson, professors at Ohio State \nUniversity, my undergraduate alma mater. They spent a lot of the last \n20, 25 years running the polar research center at Ohio State. They have \nalso spent a lot of the last 25 years going around the world climbing \nup some of the tallest mountains, a lot of them along the equator, \nwhere the snow caps give them the opportunity to take ice core samples. \nThose snow caps over time have actually begun to largely disappear. The \nice core samples they still have frozen on the campus at Ohio State \ngive us an opportunity to go back in time and, as we go back in time, \nto look back as much as a million years. What do we see then? We see \nover that million years different levels of carbon in the air. \nSometimes it is high, sometimes it is low. They have correlated--the \nDrs. Thompson; I call them the Thompson twins--the increases in carbon \nwith increases in temperature over time and the decreases in carbon \nwith the decreases in temperature. They are correlated. They are \npositively correlated. Drs. Thompson say we ought to do something about \nit. We ought to act on that science.\n  I believe they are absolutely right. We have also heard from \nscientists that the 10 hottest years in all the years we have been \naround as a country keeping records are the last 20 years. In an effort \nto compel the government to take action, all kinds of campaigns have \nbeen launched. I heard one from Senator Feinstein talking about \ndrought, fertile farmland turning into desert. Polar bears don't have \nice to float on. We see endangered species disappear. Movies are made \nabout extreme weather that is going to flow out of climate change. I am \ngoing to leave it to others to pursue those particular agendas or \nexamples. I want to focus on a couple I am more familiar with. One is \nDelaware, where I live. The other is Florida, where my parents lived \nfor the last 30 years of their lives.\n  This is Delaware, outlined here in black. If the melting that is \ngoing on in Greenland and the west Antarctic ice sheets continues, if \nit continues over the next 100 years or more, this will no longer be \nDelaware. The green area right here will be Delaware. People won't go \nto Rehoboth Beach anymore or Bethany or Dewey Beach. They will be \nlooking for a beach up here in Dover. They won't be going go to NASCAR \nraces in Dover. They will be going to a sailboat regatta in Dover. \nOcean View, which doesn't have an ocean view, will be under the ocean.\n  Let's take a look at Florida with about a 1-meter rise in sea level. \nMy parents lived in Clearwater just around here in St. Petersburg and \nTampa. The place where they used to live will be largely under water. \nThey lived about a half mile from the gulf. It will be pretty much \nunder water. Look at south Florida, go to South Beach. When we have 1 \nmeter of sea rise, we won't find it. It will be under water. What \nhappens with 6 meters of sea rise? The red part is the parts of Florida \nthat are basically under water. Most of the people who live in Florida \nlive in the parts in red. Where are they going to live? I guess they \ncan come inland a little bit, but they won't be living in the area that \nturns red because they would otherwise be under water.\n  There is a saying that all politics is local. That has been true for \na long time, and it is still true. The highest point of land in \nDelaware is a bridge. When we get a couple feet of sea level rise, the \noutline of our State changes dramatically. The quality of life in a \nState that is under water changes dramatically as well. The same is \ntrue of Florida and a bunch of other coastal States.\n  What do we need to do? We need to unleash market forces, put millions \nof people to work building new nuclear powerplants, finding ways to \ntake carbon dioxide coming out of coal-fired plants, turning it into a \nconcrete aggregate to build roads, bridges, finding ways to take the \nCO2 coming off coal-fired plants and turning it into \nbiofuels. We need to deploy off of our shores windmill farms. We need \nto deploy windmill farms from North Carolina all the way up to Maine. \nWe need to take that electricity we are generating from the wind and \nuse that to power vehicles such as the Chevrolet Volt that will be \nlaunched this fall or the Fisker Karma cars of Project Nina that are \ngoing to be launched in a year or so, built in Delaware. They get 100 \nmiles per gallon. We need to make sure that the cars, trucks, and vans \nthat GM and Chrysler are prepared to build, 44 miles per gallon, that \nwhen they build them, somebody will be there to buy them.\n  Let me conclude with the words of a friend of Senator Boxer, an \neminent climatologist named Stephen Stills. He wrote a great song that \nsays: ``Something's happening here; what it is ain't exactly clear.''\n  It is clear to me. Our planet is getting warmer. It is clear to me \nthe great challenges that poses for all of us. But inherent in those \nchallenges are great opportunities. The thing we have to do is seize \nthose opportunities, to seize the day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I yield 5 minutes to Senator Menendez, followed by 5 \nminutes to Senator Cardin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I thank the distinguished chairman for \nyielding. I come to the floor in strong opposition to the Murkowski \nresolution because it means we will needlessly use more oil. That is \nwhy the oil industry supports this resolution, because this resolution \nwould increase demand for their products. In turn that is why so many \nof my Republican friends support this resolution, because whenever big \noil wants something, it seems they line up to support it. When the \nRepublicans were in charge of MMS, they stripped the government's \nability to regulate oil drilling. Anyone who has turned on the news in \nthe last 52 days can see exactly what the policy of allowing industry \nto police itself has gotten us. Now they want to go further and strip \nthe government's ability to reduce our oil consumption and regulate \npollution. This is simply a wrongheaded approach at the wrong time.\n\n  This is not the time to increase oil consumption by more than 450 \nmillion barrels, which this resolution would ultimately do. This is not \nthe time to prop up big oil, make ourselves less energy secure, and put \nour coastlines in further peril.\n  The events unfolding in the gulf have vividly shown us we should not \nbe doubling down on 19th-century dirty fuels but, instead, moving to \nclean technologies of the 21st century that will reinvigorate our \neconomy, allow our businesses to compete internationally, improve our \nenergy security, and preserve the environment.\n  The resolution is regressive on its face. For my home State of New \nJersey, it would increase dependence on oil by more than 14 million \nbarrels in 2016 and cost New Jerseyans an additional $39 million at the \ngas pump in 2016.\n  The Federal Government gives big oil tax breaks. It gives big oil \nsubsidies. The government even gives big oil, so far, a cap on damages \nstemming from oilspills. The resolution is just one more windfall for \nbig oil at the expense of American taxpayers.\n  So the choice is clear: We can keep protecting big oil from \nregulation or we can do what reason, common sense, and good governance \ndictate. In light of the facts--in light of the need to reduce \npollution; in light of the need to move toward new, smarter, greener \nenergy for the future; in light of what we are seeing happen every day \nin the gulf--over the last 52 days--in light of the fact that this \nresolution would cost\n\n[[Page S4809]]\n\nconsumers as much as $47 billion in additional fuels costs, I hope the \nSenate soundly defeats the Murkowski resolution.\n  This is a choice between polluting our environment--and stopping the \ngovernment from ensuring we do not pollute our environment--and moving \ntoward a cleaner, greener future. This is a choice between a quality of \nlife that ultimately reduces respiratory ailments and cancer versus one \nthat continues to perpetuate it. The choice could not be clearer. I \ncertainly hope my colleagues will ultimately vote for a choice that is \ngreener, that has a future of promise and hope and opportunity, not one \nthat continues to help big oil at the expense of the American taxpayer.\n  With that, I yield back any time I may have to the chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, as the world is looking at the worst \noilspill in America's history--it may yet become the worst oilspill \never--everyone is saying: Well, what are we going to do about this? \nWhat is our response? Our response needs to be, first, to stop the oil \nfrom spilling into the Gulf of Mexico; second, to make sure we clean up \nthis mess and hold BP and its related companies fully responsible for \nall damages, whether to the businesses that have been put out of \nbusiness, literally, by what has happened in the Gulf of Mexico or the \nproperty owners or the taxpayers. BP has to be held fully accountable.\n  They are looking forward to us making sure that future drilling in \nthis country is done in a safe way; that we have a regulatory system in \nplace that protects the public, that is independent, and that will \nprotect environmentally sensitive areas where there is currently no \ndrilling, such as the Mid-Atlantic, from any drilling. But they are \nalso looking for us to have an energy policy--an energy policy that \nmakes sense for America; that we invest in alternative and renewable \nenergy sources; that we conserve energy; and that, yes, we manage our \nmineral resources as best we can and use less oil.\n  Well, the Murkowski resolution does just the opposite. It is very \nstrange, the timing of this resolution, that we are taking up what \nwould prevent the EPA regulations and would require us to use more oil \nrather than less oil. That makes no sense at all. It stops dead in its \ntracks efforts to cut the oil consumption of cars and trucks sold in \nAmerica. You may ask why this resolution is being considered. Well, it \nis clearly supported by big oil. But whose side are we on? Are we on \nthe side of the American consumers or on the side of big oil?\n  On April 1, the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of \nTransportation completed standards to decrease the oil consumption in \nmodel years 2012 through 2016 cars and light trucks sold in the United \nStates. Those standards will result in vehicles that will use almost 2 \nbillion barrels less than current models. That is what we should be \ndoing: using less oil. That needs to be part of our future.\n  On May 21, President Obama directed EPA and DOT to follow up over the \nnext 2 years with standards for trucks and buses starting with model \nyear 2014 and for cars and light trucks starting with model year 2017. \nThose follow-on standards will further reduce U.S. oil consumption by \nbillions of barrels.\n  But the Murkowski resolution would compel EPA to rescind its portion \nof the completed standard and prevent the Agency from taking part in \nthe follow-on ones--in other words, stopping us from improving the \nefficiency of our fleets, causing us to use more oil.\n  Not surprisingly, big oil is trying to disguise their resolution as \nsomething other than what it is. They claim it is necessary to prevent \nEPA from regulating the greenhouse gas emissions of small businesses \nand even homes and farms. Nothing could be further from the truth. As \nevery Senator knows, EPA has already issued a final rule to shield \nsmall businesses, to shield homes, to shield farms, and to shield all \nother small sources from regulation for at least the next 6 years. Six \nyears is more than enough time to pass a law making the exemption for \nsmall sources permanent.\n  The resolution of disapproval has just one certain outcome: that \nAmerica's dangerous dependence on oil will continue. We cannot allow \nthis resolution to be approved. It would eliminate the legal foundation \nof the EPA oil-savings standards that are essential to breaking our \naddiction to oil.\n  It is time to decide whose side you are on. I choose the side of the \nAmerican consumer, and I ask my colleagues to stand with me and reject \nthe Murkowski resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask that the time in this block be \nallocated as follows: Senator Bond, 6 minutes; Senator Collins, 7 \nminutes; Senator Enzi, 6 minutes; Senator Chambliss, 6 minutes; Senator \nBrownback, 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Do we have 2 unused minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I would ask if we could carry that time to the next \nsegment, please.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Madam President, I rise in support of the Murkowski EPA \ndisapproval resolution. We must prevent the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency from imposing a backdoor energy tax on suffering \nfamilies and workers. This is our chance to stand with American \nfamilies and workers and stand against unelected bureaucrats at EPA \ntrying to expand government's reach.\n  Missouri families and workers do not want the higher energy costs and \nlost jobs that would come from allowing EPA's big government carbon \nregulations to go forward. Missouri manufacturing workers, like those \nin States across the Midwest, are dependent on affordable energy. \nMissouri workers would suffer terribly when EPA's carbon regulations \ndrive up the cost of their energy and raw materials. Allowing the \nregulations to go forward would allow India, China, and other counties \nto take those energy-intensive jobs away from American workers. \nMissouri families, like those in States across the Midwest, are \nstruggling to pay their power, heating, and cooling bills. Missouri \nfamilies would suffer even more when EPA carbon regulations drive up \nthe cost of their electricity, gas, and gasoline bills. Allowing EPA \ncarbon regulations to go forward would punish Missouri families with \nhigher energy prices.\n\n  Like all families and workers in the Midwest, Missourians wonder why \nwe would allow EPA to impose this punishing pain for no environmental \nbenefits. Let me make it clear: For those who want to talk about what \nthis vote means for the science of global emissions, EPA itself admits \nthat unilateral U.S. actions, without China and India, which have \nclearly indicated they will not take action, will have no measurable \nimpact on world temperatures. So if you actually believe the climate \nscience and want world temperatures to stop rising, these EPA \nregulations will do nothing to address your concerns. You are basically \ntelling us you want to impose trillions of dollars in costs, hundreds \nof billions of dollars in new taxes, and hundreds of billions of \ndollars in new government spending for no environmental gain.\n  Some also try to hide behind the auto deal between EPA, the State of \nCalifornia, and automakers. We should not punish Midwestern families \nand workers with a new energy tax in order to uphold some backroom deal \nbetween EPA, the automakers, and the State of California.\n  Even so, these EPA regulations are totally unnecessary for those who \ncare about reducing carbon emissions from vehicles. Let me be clear: \nCongress has already authorized the Department of Transportation to \nimpose new, stricter auto emissions standards, and the Obama \nadministration announced recently they were going to do so.\n  So, again, opponents want to punish American families and workers \nwith job-killing energy taxes for no net environmental gain.\n  Some also say this issue is linked to the gulf oilspill and we should \nrespond by allowing EPA's new backdoor energy taxes. For the life of \nme, I do not\n\n[[Page S4810]]\n\nsee how imposing a new national energy tax is the right response to the \ngulf oilspill. It will not stop the oil from flowing, it will not \nmitigate the environmental damage, and it will not compensate the \nworkers and others for lost wages and revenue. We should be punishing \nBritish Petroleum, not the American people with new taxes. And do not \nbe misled about the empty rhetoric against big oil. Big oil just passes \nalong the cost of these taxes to us in higher prices for the gas and \noil we must buy and we must use.\n  But some, as they say, never want to let a crisis go to waste. \nUnfortunately, many of my Democratic colleagues seek any opportunity to \nexpand the reach of government and impose new taxes. They admit it, \ntoo, although they use fancy ways to say it. This week, President Obama \nrepeated his call for ``putting a price'' on carbon. These are code \nwords for imposing a carbon tax.\n  We also need to stop and think about what the majority leader has \nsaid. He and others have said that if EPA is allowed to move forward \nwith their carbon regulations, it will cut oil usage. The reason is \nbecause this new energy tax will punish American consumers with so much \npain at the pump, they will use less gasoline because they cannot \nafford it. It is like saying we need another recession because in a \nrecession people drive less. We want recessions? That is hardly the way \nto make the economy thrive and make the progress we need.\n  We must stop this policy of pain. We must stop EPA from moving \nforward with job-killing, energy cost-raising regulation. The choice is \nstark: Stand with EPA bureaucrats imposing a backdoor tax or stand with \nAmerican families and workers. I urge my colleagues to stand with \nAmerican families and workers and support the Murkowski amendment.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nresolution offered by the Senator from Alaska disapproving a rule \nsubmitted by the Environmental Protection Agency concerning the \nregulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act.\n  Our country must develop reasonable policies to spur the creation of \ngreen energy jobs, lessen our dangerous dependence on foreign oil, and \nreduce greenhouse gas emissions. We face an international race to lead \nthe world in alternative energy technologies, and we can win that race \nif Congress enacts legislation to put a price on carbon and thus \nencourage investment here in the United States.\n  I have, however, serious concerns about unelected government \nofficials at the EPA taking on this complicated issue instead of \nCongress. It is Congress that should establish the framework for \nregulation of greenhouse gas emissions. And it surely is significant \nthat the House-passed climate bill, as well as the Kerry-Lieberman \nbill, recognized that fact by preempting some of the EPA's rules in \nthis area.\n  The Agency's early rules on this topic give me cause for concern. \nThey could affect some 34 businesses in my State that employ nearly \n8,800 people. Incredibly, the EPA proposes to ignore the carbon \nneutrality of biomass and would place onerous permitting requirements \non businesses, such as Maine's biomass plants and paper mills, which \nuse biomass to provide energy for their operations. This reverses years \nof EPA considering biomass as carbon-neutral.\n  EPA's decisions could well result in the loss of jobs, leading to \nmill and plant closures and discouraging employers from investing. We \nsimply cannot afford that result, particularly not in this tough \neconomic climate. The EPA's apparent stunning reversal in its view of \nbiomass potentially would affect 14 biomass facilities in Maine in \nsmall rural towns such as Ashland, Fort Fairfield, and Livermore Falls.\n\n  A better way forward is for Congress to finally tackle this issue and \npass comprehensive clean energy legislation. In December, I joined with \nmy colleague, Senator Maria Cantwell, in introducing the bipartisan \nCarbon Limits and Energy for American Renewal Act, what we call the \nCLEAR Act. Our legislation would set up a mechanism for selling \n``carbon shares'' to the few thousand fossil fuel producers and \nimporters through monthly auctions. Under our bill, 75 percent of the \nauction's revenues would be returned directly to every citizen of the \nUnited States through rebate checks. The average family of four in \nMaine would stand to gain almost $400 each year. Our bill represents \nthe right approach, a much more thoughtful approach than EPA's, and it \nwould spur the development of green energy and the creation of green \nenergy jobs.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to advance the practical \nconcepts that are embodied in the CLEAR Act.\n  Let me be clear because there are diverse views on this issue in this \nChamber. I believe global climate change and the development of \nalternatives to fossil fuels are significant and urgent priorities for \nour country. We must meet these economic and environmental challenges. \nThe scientific evidence demonstrates the human contribution to climate \nchange, and we must act to mitigate that impact. But we must proceed \nwith care, and we should not allow the Federal EPA to charge ahead on a \nproblem that affects every aspect of our already fragile economy. The \npreliminary steps the EPA has taken, including its decision to revisit \nthe carbon neutrality of biomass, undermine my confidence in having the \nEPA proceed. It is Congress's job, not the EPA's, to decide how best to \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions.\n  So for this reason, I will vote for the Murkowski resolution.\n  Thank you, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I rise in support of Senator Murkowski's \nresolution that would ensure this Congress keeps its responsibility to \nestablish our Nation's environmental regulations. The Environmental \nProtection Agency's move to regulate carbon dioxide under the Clean Air \nAct is an economic and bureaucratic nightmare in the making that is \ngoing to have a devastating effect on our economy and put a regulatory \nstranglehold on businesses and individuals across the country.\n  The Congressional Review Act was passed in 1996 to make sure Congress \ncould step in when Federal agencies got off track. It was a bipartisan \nbill because Senators and Representatives recognized we should not hand \noff our responsibility for setting Federal policy to Federal agencies. \nSo when Federal agencies get off track, we have a way to bring them \nback to reality. We need to bring the EPA back to reality on the \ncatastrophe that regulating greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act \nwould create because if we don't, it will be consumers and businesses--\nboth small business and big business in every sector of our economy--\nthat will end up paying more than they can afford for these \nregulations.\n  The consequences of allowing the EPA to regulate carbon dioxide under \nthe Clean Air Act are tremendous. The EPA's rule that will go into \neffect if Senator Murkowski's resolution is not adopted would not just \napply to big powerplants or industrial factories. More than 6 million \nbusinesses and residences will come under these new regulations at a \ncost of billions of dollars to our economy. The EPA is going to \nregulate small business and family farms, and those who can't afford to \ncomply will go out of business. They will regulate office buildings and \nwarehouses, and if you rent space in an office building or store your \ninventory in a warehouse, your costs will rise. Grocery stores, \nrestaurants, hotels, residential buildings, and even individual homes \nwill face complicated and expensive regulations.\n  It is not just Members on my side of the aisle who believe the EPA is \ntaking a disastrous approach. The White House and members of the \nPresident's party have said EPA's move to impose ``command and \ncontrol'' regulation on greenhouse gases would be a step in the wrong \ndirection.\n  Where would the regulations stop? No one knows for sure. Cattle \nproduce a lot of carbon dioxide and methane, so it is hard to imagine \nhow the agricultural industry would not be impacted. What about people? \nIn a big city, people are breathing out carbon dioxide all day long. \nCould that be subject to regulation under the Clean Air Act? Could \nbreathing become a fineable violation or would there be a new tax as \nbreathing isn't an option?\n\n[[Page S4811]]\n\n  There will be many unintended consequences if the EPA is allowed to \nmove forward, and we have a chance to stop that from happening today by \nsupporting Senator Murkowski's resolution disapproving the EPA's \naction.\n  Our economy has lost 8 million jobs over the past 2 years, and \nunemployment is still almost 10 percent. Businesses that had to lay \npeople off are still hurting. The last thing our economy needs and the \nlast thing businesses can afford is an EPA choke hold. According to the \nEPA, the average cost of compliance for stationary sources that would \nbe regulated is more than $125,000. That is an average cost. Some will \nbe less, but many will be more than $125,000. It is just an average. \nThat is $125,000 that could be used to hire new employees. It is \n$125,000 that will not be spent on business expansion. Right now, with \nour economy struggling, we need to be working to encourage businesses \nto hire more employees and to grow, but unless we stop the EPA's \noverreach, businesses across this country will be facing the harshest \nand most expensive regulations they have ever seen.\n  Some people have suggested that EPA's decision to move forward with \ngreenhouse gas regulation will pressure Congress into implementing a \ncap-and-tax proposal. They say: We don't want EPA to regulate, but we \nhave to keep pressure on Congress or Congress would not act. I don't \nbuy that argument because, as the old saying goes, ``two wrongs don't \nmake a right.''\n  Senators are faced with a choice. If it is wrong for the EPA to \nregulate, they should stop it from happening, and supporting Senator \nMurkowski's resolution is the clearest way to do it. My colleagues who \noppose this resolution are voting in favor of EPA action. They are \nvoting to allow the EPA to set up complex regulations that will \nstrangle our economy, kill economic recovery, and further squeeze \nconsumers and businesses across the country. It is the start of a \nslippery slope. How much control will the EPA reach for after this if \nit isn't stopped now?\n  The Clean Air Act is not the EPA's regulatory Swiss Army knife.\n  Even EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson has said that the Clean Air Act \nwas not written to apply to greenhouse gases. Greenhouse gas is not one \nof the six categories of pollutants that the Clean Air Act covers and \nthe list of 188 specific pollutants that are regulated under the Clean \nAir Act does not include carbon dioxide or methane. Even if Congress \ndid decide that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases should be \nregulated, the Clean Air Act would be the wrong tool for the job. \nGreenhouse gases come from large and small sources, from major \nmanufacturers and industrial plants and from community hospitals and \nsmall-town businesses. And yes, they come from animals, and yes, from \npeople breathing in and out. Applying the Clean Air Act across the \nboard to sources that emit a small amount of carbon dioxide--as the law \nrequires--would be clumsy and harmful, and ultimately do tremendous \neconomic harm to America's businesses and consumers.\n  The Congressional Review Act was passed so that Congress could step \nin and prevent federal agencies like the EPA from implementing rules or \nregulations that don't make sense. I hope my colleagues will recognize \nthe tremendous harm that allowing the EPA to regulate greenhouse gases \nunder the Clean Air Act would do to our economy. While there are many \ndisagreements about climate change legislation, we should all be able \nto recognize that the course the EPA is on now is the worst of all \nworlds. Their approach would stymie our chances of recovering from the \nrecession and stifle economic development for businesses and consumers \nwho are already struggling to make ends meet.\n  Is there no end to the administration's approach of believing that \nany situation can be saved with more redtape, more regulations, and \nmore fines? Is there any end to the power grabs of this administration, \nwhich has thrown every obstacle it can think of in the path of our \nsmall businesses? Supporting the Murkowski resolution would check the \nEPA and give our small businesses that make up the most important part \nof our economy a fighting chance.\n  This is the last chance to stop the EPA's carbon overreach and the \nslippery slope that will ensue if we allow them to move forward with \nthese harmful regulations. Please vote yes on the motion to proceed and \nyes on the motion for disapproval.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S.J. Res. \n26, the resolution disapproving a rule submitted by the Environmental \nProtection Agency, EPA, relating to the endangerment for greenhouse \ngases under the Clean Air Act.\n  Today's debate and this resolution are about whether this Congress \nwill allow an executive branch agency--EPA--to unleash a regulatory \nonslaught that within a few years will capture homes, small businesses, \nfarms, hospitals, and apartment buildings in an expensive, intrusive, \nand bureaucratic regulatory program. The consideration of this \nresolution is about preserving the traditional and constitutional role \nof Congress as the elected representatives of the citizens of this \ncountry to make necessary and proper laws for the Nation.\n  Congress is the appropriate branch of the Federal Government to \ndebate and design a climate change policy. Many have complained that \nthe Senate is taking too long to do this, but that doesn't mean EPA \nshould go ahead and regulate on its own. It is also highly cynical for \nadministration officials to suggest that the specter of EPA regulations \nshould force Congress to act. I don't appreciate the implied threat \nthat if Congress doesn't go along with EPA then the agency will impose \ncostly regulations.\n  Many argue that passage of the resolution would prevent increases in \nthe vehicle fuel economy and undo the ``historic'' agreement among the \nFederal Government, several states, labor unions, and the auto \nindustry. It doesn't. The National Highway Traffic Safety \nAdministration--NHTSA--has had authority to regulate and increase \nCorporate Average Fuel Economy--CAFE--standards for more than 30 years. \nIn fact, Congress directed the agency to increase the standards to at \nleast 35 miles per gallon by 2020 in the 2007 Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act. And these new standards will reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions. EPA's activities on fuel economy through its so-called \ntailpipe rule are unnecessary to achieve the desired results, given the \nauthorities already held by NHTSA.\n  Many also argue that passage of the resolution is contrary to the \nscience of climate change. A letter generated by the Union of Concerned \nScientists claims the resolution ``ignores'' the scientific findings of \nEPA and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, and that the \nresolution is an ``attack'' on the Clean Air Act. They must not have \nread the resolution as even a cursory review of it will dispel this \nnotion.\n  The resolution states, ``That Congress disapproves the rule submitted \nby the Environmental Protection Agency relating to the endangerment \nfinding . . . and such rule shall have no force or effect.'' This means \nthe agency cannot use the Clean Air Act to control greenhouse gas \nemissions. This does not speak to the issue of whether climate change \nis happening or what is causing it. Those who claim the resolution \nignores science appear to be avoiding the debate over the economic \nconsequences and legal validity of EPA's approach. I also believe that \nthey are attempting an end-run around a skeptical Congress. I am sorry, \nbut that is not how the American system of government works.\n  I know the climate in changing. In 2006, I visited Greenland. I \ntoured the Kangia Ice Fjord and took a boat tour of Disko Bay to view \nthe world's largest glaciers and icebergs floating in the bay. These \nglaciers were formed more than 1,000 years ago. I saw the glaciers \nmelting and the remains of a 4,000-year-old village. Obviously, it was \nwarm enough in the past for humans to live and thrive in that part of \nthe world, even though in recent memory we only think of Greenland as \ncovered in ice. I talked to the scientists who have studied Greenland's \nglaciers for decades. They told me that while the climate is changing \nthey don't know with any certainty if the changes are natural or caused \nby human activity or a combination of the two. I found it interesting \nthat while some glaciers are\n\n[[Page S4812]]\n\nmelting, some are increasing in size. We just don't see what is \nhappening on the back side.\n  The President and the Administrator of EPA, Lisa Jackson, have said \ntheir preference is for Congress to act. They know the Clean Air Act \nwas not designed for controlling greenhouse gases. Yet they are swiftly \nmoving ahead. Last week, EPA issued a final rule for regulating \ngreenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under the Clean Air \nAct's permitting programs. The so-called tailoring rule is the fourth \nsignificant action taken by the administration to regulate greenhouse \ngas emissions.\n  The first major action was EPA's determination--the Endangerment \nFinding--that greenhouse gas emissions from cars and light-duty trucks \nendanger human health and welfare. On April 1, 2010, EPA finalized the \nlight duty vehicle rule controlling greenhouse gas emissions. Under the \nClean Air Act, when a pollutant becomes subject to regulation by one \nprovision of the Act, it then becomes subject to regulation under other \nprovisions. Hence, greenhouse gas emissions are now subject to \nregulation under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration--PSD--and \ntitle V operating permit programs. It is only a matter of time before \ngreenhouse gases are subject to other provisions in the law, such as \nnational ambient air quality standards.\n  Under current law, the title V program permitting requirements are \ntriggered when a facility releases 100 tons per year of a regulated \npollutant. For the PSD program, the threshold is 250 tons per year. In \nthe final rule, EPA ``tailors'' the application of the programs to \nsignificantly higher threshold levels. Without the tailoring rule, EPA \nestimates that about 6 million sources, including 37,000 farms and 3.9 \nmillion single family homes, will be required to obtain Clean Air Act \npermits.\n  EPA's own documents call the tailoring rule a commonsense approach to \naddressing greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources under the \nClean Air Act permitting programs. But I don't follow the agency's \nlogic. The rule states emissions from small farms, restaurants, and all \nbut the very largest commercial facilities will not be covered by these \nprograms at this time. The rule establishes a schedule that will \ninitially focus the permitting programs on the largest sources and \nwithout this tailoring rule the lower emissions thresholds would take \neffect automatically for greenhouse gases on January 2, 2011.\n  The agency, in its proposed rule, recognized the inherent problems \nwith using the Clean Air Act. The proposed rule states, ``This \nextraordinary increase in the scope of the permitting programs coupled \nwith the resulting burdens on the small sources and on the permitting \nauthorities was not contemplated by Congress in enacting the PSD and \nTitle V programs.'' It further states that, ``The new rules would apply \nTitle V to millions of sources Congress did not intend to be covered \nand would impede the issuance of permits to the thousands of sources \nthat Congress did intend to be covered.''\n  It is cold comfort that the smallest sources will not be regulated \nuntil 2016. We have a rule now that says it is not if but when \nhospitals, farms, small businesses, and apartment buildings can expect \nto have to apply for a clean air permit. We can only imagine what will \nhappen to the economy if EPA is successful and its plans to fully \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions under all of the authorities of the \nClean Air Act come to fruition.\n  One of the most troubling aspects about the tailoring rule and EPA's \napproach to its suite of greenhouse gas regulations is that there is no \neconomic analysis. The agency hasn't even attempted to quantify the \neconomic costs and regulatory burdens it will impose on American \nbusinesses and consumers. We have no idea what it will mean for jobs, \neconomic growth or small businesses. Even though we can't quantify it \nor point to a document, it is not hard to imagine the significant costs \nit will impose.\n  While EPA isn't worried about this, States, businesses, unions, and \nindividuals are. For example, in March, 20 Governors, including \nGovernor Sunny Purdue of Georgia, wrote House and Senate leadership \nexpressing grave concern about EPA's efforts to impose greenhouse gas \nregulations. They believe EPA's actions will place heavy administrative \nburdens on State environmental quality agencies just as States are \nexpected to face their worst financial situations over the next 2 \nyears. The Governors also are concerned that the regulations will be \ncostly to consumers and could be devastating to the economy and jobs. \nThe Governors believe that complex energy and environmental policy \ninitiatives should be developed by elected representatives at the State \nand national level but not by a single Federal agency.\n  While Georgia believes the final rule is an improvement over the \nproposed one, there are still significant concerns. Most notably is its \nlegal vulnerability. I quote from the Georgia Department of Natural \nResources, Environmental Protection Division, Air Protection Branch \ncomments on the proposed rule:\n\n       The GHG Tailoring Rule appears to be legally vulnerable and \n     may not provide intended relief from the statutory permitting \n     thresholds for PSD and Title V. If the Tailoring Rule is \n     vacated, the workload for permitting authorities will \n     increase exponentially at a time when State and Local \n     governments are experiencing severe budgetary challenges due \n     to the current economic climate. Vacatur of the GHG Tailoring \n     Rule seems to be a very real possibility.\n\n  The letter further states:\n\n       We also believe that EPA has failed to take into account \n     the length of time that it will take for permitting \n     authorities . . . to go through rulemaking, . . . hiring, and \n     training in order to implement the mandate of regulating GHG \n     emissions under the Title V and PSD permitting programs. In \n     Georgia, rulemaking will be required in order to insert the \n     new GHG emission thresholds. Rulemaking will also be required \n     in order to increase Title V fees consistent with the Clean \n     Air Act requirement that permitting programs collect enough \n     revenue to implement the program requirements. Given the \n     current state of the economic situation in our state and \n     country, this issue should not be taken lightly. Then, \n     permitting authorities must hire and train staff to issue \n     these complicated permits. This could take up to two years \n     after the requirement is triggered. Raising the regulatory \n     threshold will not abate the predicted permitting backlog if \n     additional permitting personnel are not in place at the time \n     the additional workload occurs.\n\n  EPA is moving ahead despite these concerns and the economic \nconsequences of its plans. They will increase energy prices, add to \nadministrative costs for companies, decrease job creation, and create a \nlarge new government bureaucracy, which will endanger economic recovery \nand limit future growth. While the final rule with its phased-in \nimplementation is a small step in the right direction, the Clean Air \nAct continues to be the wrong tool for the job, and EPA's timeline and \nits shaky legal foundation will continue to create significant \nuncertainty for the State permitting agencies and businesses community.\n  At this time, there is no other option to stop EPA from moving ahead. \nSome of our colleagues have introduced measures to provide for a time \nout; others are looking at ways to codify the tailoring rule and \nprovide permanent exemptions for small businesses. However, there are \nno plans for the Senate to consider these measures. If there were \nanother option, I would be open to it.\n  The Congressional Review Act was designed for the purpose of \nreviewing agency actions. The majority leader understands this and \nrecognizes that, ``overburdensome and unnecessary federal regulation \ncan choke the life out of small businesses by imposing costly and \noften-ineffectual remedies to problems that may not exist.'' No \ndescription could be more accurate about EPA's greenhouse gas \nregulatory plans.\n  Some argue that it would be a dangerous precedent for Congress to \nstop EPA's endangerment finding. However, it is far more dangerous for \nthe Nation if Congress allows an agency to impose these regulations \nunder a law that was not designed for the purpose. By issuing the \ntailoring rule, the administration has again reminded us that if \nCongress won't legislate, EPA will regulate. I believe my colleague \nfrom Alaska was correct when she called this a highly coercive \nstrategy. I am appalled by the actions of EPA.\n  There is a reason why the U.S. Senate hasn't acted on a cap and trade \nbill. This is because analyses of these bills shows they cause \nsignificant economic harm--job losses, higher energy prices, higher gas \ntaxes, less economic growth.\n\n[[Page S4813]]\n\nIt makes no sense for Congress to pass job-killing legislation in order \nto stave off costly regulation.\n  The House and Senate cap and trade bills are truly bad for \nagriculture. They would dramatically increase energy and other input \ncosts and, according to EPA, would cause the shift of 59 million acres \nout of production into trees. With a growing world population to feed, \nour farmers and ranchers will need to produce more food in the future, \nnot less. If enacted as written today, cap and trade legislation would \nonly push agriculture production overseas, raising many of the same \nconcerns that have been expressed about the loss of manufacturing jobs.\n  Rather than driving American agriculture offshore, a more sensible \napproach would be to increase food, fuel, and fiber production right \nhere at home. In this Nation, we have an abundant natural resource \nbase, an economy built on open and transparent markets, and sufficient \nprotections for consumers and the environment.\n  Last fall, Texas A University released a study on the House cap and \ntrade bill. I mention it again today because it is most instructive of \nwhat we can expect to see in the agricultural sector under a cap and \ntrade regime.\n  Texas A University used its representative farm database to study \nthe effects of the House bill at the farmgate level. This database was \ndeveloped to help Congress better understand the effects of legislation \nat the individual producer level. The study shows that 71 out of 98 \nfarms in the database will be worse off under the House bill. The 27 \nfarms that benefit do so because other producers go out of business \nthey benefit because there are fewer acres in production, thus crop \nprices rise.\n  Some producers will see increased revenue from an offset program, but \nit is not a significant factor in the profitability of farms in the \nanalysis. The study also dramatically shows the regional disparities of \nthe House bill. Only some cornbelt farmers benefit. It's hard to \nimagine that members of the Senate Agriculture Committee will be able \nto endorse a policy that disproportionally favors certain commodities, \nfew producers and one part of the country at the expense of others.\n  In January, 150 agriculture organizations sent a letter to my \ncolleague from Alaska supporting the introduction of the resolution. \nThese groups wrote that, ``Such regulatory actions will carry severe \nconsequences for the U.S. economy, including America's farmers and \nranchers, through increased input costs and international market \ndisparities.'' They also believe that, ``EPA's finding puts the \nagricultural economy at grave risk based on allegations of a weak, \nindirect link to public health and welfare and despite the lack of any \nenvironmental benefit.''\n  On May 18, I received another letter from 49 different agriculture \ngroups. They state:\n\n       Without relief from Congress, we fully expect the \n     application of these programs to have severe economic impacts \n     on agriculture. Not only will producers likely incur \n     increased costs as a result of the regulatory impacts on \n     other economic sectors, but agricultural producers will \n     eventually be directly regulated. The final EPA tailoring \n     rule estimates the average cost for these permits is $23,200 \n     per permit. For the 37,000 farms identified by EPA as likely \n     to require permits this would cost them more than $866 \n     million just to obtain the permit.\n\n  In contrast to the campaign slogans and feel-good messages of hope \nand change for farmers, ranchers and rural America, this administration \nis causing great pain through its actions, especially its economic \npolicies and far-reaching regulatory programs and goals. The \nendangerment finding and related regulations are only one set--albeit a \nvery significant set--of regulatory actions facing producers and rural \nAmerica. By themselves, these will impose higher energy costs on rural \nresidents and businesses. Higher costs in rural areas mean fewer jobs \nand opportunities for those who live there.\n  Another immense expansion of Federal regulatory authority that will \nhave severe consequences for producers and rural landowners is the \nadministration's support for legislation to grant EPA and the U.S. \nCorps of Engineers--Corps--nearly unlimited regulatory control over all \n``intrastate waters,'' including all wet areas within a State, such as \ngroundwater, ditches, pipes, streets, gutters, and desert features. The \nadministration supports giving EPA and the Corps unrestricted authority \nto regulate all private and public activities that may affect \nintrastate waters, regardless of whether the activity is occurring in \nor may impact water at all. Unbelievably, the administration supports \neliminating the existing regulatory limitations that allow commonsense \nuses such as those allowed with a prior converted cropland designation. \nI strongly oppose this effort to expand EPA's and the Corps' regulatory \ncontrol. I do not believe the Federal Government should regulate all \nwet areas within a State.\n  The administration also is attempting to circumvent one of the most \nhighly regarded environmental statutes--the Federal Insecticide, \nFungicide and Rodenticide Act, that governs the licensing and use of \npesticides. This is a well-crafted law that balances the risks and \nbenefits of pesticide use. EPA has an excellent staff of scientists and \nexperts working in this area. However, the agency's political \nleadership is trying to implement by regulatory fiat a precautionary \napproach, which is contradictory to current law.\n  For example, last fall, EPA proposed to add language to pesticide \nproduct labels that will forbid pesticide applications that result in \ndrift that could cause harm or adverse effects. For many years, EPA and \nstate pesticide regulators recognized that a small amount of drift \ninevitably will occur, and that when pesticides are applied according \nto their label instructions, this small amount of drift does not cause \nan unreasonable adverse effect. If an unreasonable adverse effect is \nlikely to be caused by a certain use of a pesticide, FIFRA requires, \nand Congress expects, the label to reflect that information and \nappropriate mitigation be required.\n  In April, I wrote to EPA, along with the chairman of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee and other colleagues, about the need for greater \nclarity in pesticide drift policy and noted that such clarity would \nbenefit the agency, pesticide users and State regulatory agencies. \nHowever, we noted that the proposal set forth vague standards and would \nnot have clarified pesticide drift policy. It also exceeded the \nauthority granted to the agency by FIFRA. We asked the proposed policy \nto be reconsidered. I am pleased to note that recently EPA made the \nright decision to do so.\n  One other issue I raise reflects the administration's willingness to \ncast aside rational, science-based policy when given the opportunity to \nimpose additional regulation. In January 2009, the Sixth Circuit Court \nof Appeals issued an opinion in National Cotton Council v. U.S. \nEnvironmental Protection Agency that would require pesticide \napplications to be permitted under the Clean Water Act's National \nPollutant Discharge Elimination System--NPDES. The permit would be in \naddition to any label requirements or restrictions already placed on \nthe use of the pesticide under FIFRA.\n  Unfortunately, the administration refused to appeal the decision even \nthough it admitted in a filing with the U.S. Supreme Court this year \nthat the Sixth Circuit Court reached the wrong decision. Pesticides are \nnot pollutants under the Clean Water Act and have never been. Instead, \nEPA, for political reasons, has been working to develop a NPDES general \npermit for discharges from the application of pesticides. EPA released \nthe draft permit last week for public comment and will issue a final \npermit in December 2010. Pesticides applications must be covered by a \npermit by April 9, 2011. Is your State ready to issue these permits? \nAre your producers and applicators ready to apply for them?\n  This has been a particular concern for State and public health \nofficials as it has the potential to seriously affect their ability to \ncontrol mosquitoes, especially those carrying the West Nile Virus. \nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, there were \n720 cases, including 32 deaths, attributed to the virus in 2009. This \nis better than 2008, in which there were 1,370 cases, including 37 \ndeaths. In 2009, two of those deaths were in my home State of Georgia.\n  Talk about overburdensome, unnecessary regulation! Requiring \nproducers, pest control agencies and other users to obtain NPDES \npermits will do nothing to enhance the environment. It\n\n[[Page S4814]]\n\nonly doubles the number of permitted entities and creates new \nrequirements for monitoring, surveillance, planning, recordkeeping, and \nreporting that only will create significant delays, costs, reporting \nburdens and legal risks from citizen suits. These permits will provide \nabsolutely benefit only cost.\n  All issues regarding water and pesticides are addressed by EPA as \npart of the pesticide registration process. If there are concerns, \nmitigation is required. We are fortunate we have a strong law that \nrequires rigorous science and careful balancing of risks and benefits.\n  The Endangerment Finding and related rules, along with the other \nenvironmental regulations planned by the administration will hurt the \nproductivity of American farmers and ranchers and make the future for \nU.S. agriculture far less bright than it should be. These actions are \nbasically a backdoor tax on every American family and business by \nunelected bureaucrats. Federal regulation is not the key to success or \njobs in rural areas or in any other part of this Nation.\n  Some claim that EPA's actions should scare Congress into passing a \ncap and trade bill, but I disagree. Congress should not be bullied into \npassing bad legislation and neither should it stand for an agency that \nis vastly overreaching. The choice is clear to me--do Senators want EPA \nto impose a regulatory regime that it has tenuous authority to create \nor do you want Congress to make the laws of the land? If you believe \nCongress should develop laws and set policy, then vote in support of \nthe resolution. I strongly oppose EPA's actions and plan to vote yes on \nthe Murkowski resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues for this \ndiscussion we are having. I was here when the Congressional Review Act \nwas put into place for the very purpose it is being used for, which is \nwhen we have a Federal agency that overreaches and seeks to put in \nplace a regulation that will cost tens of billions of dollars, without \nany legislative action taking place, the Congress should step in. That \nis what the Congress is seeking to do with this--step in on something \nthat has enormous economic consequences, enormous costs across society, \nand yet has not been voted on by this legislative body.\n  Clearly, if we are going to do something of this nature, it should \npass the Senate. It should come up in front of this body.\n  Toward that end, I tell my colleagues we have a bipartisan energy \nbill that passed through the Senate Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, the American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009, which \nChairman Bingaman worked through his committee over a month's period of \ntime, that has a number of issues regarding renewable energy, regarding \nnuclear technology, to reduce CO2 emissions. Lots of things \nare in it. It passed in a bipartisan way through committee.\n  That is what we ought to bring up on the Senate floor. We should pass \nthe Murkowski disapproval resolution so that EPA doesn't act \nprematurely before the Congress acts. We should bring up the bipartisan \nAmerican Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009, consider it, and use that \nas the route forward for us as a legislative body to act on a major \nissue facing our country, without having it done by fiat by an \nunelected bureaucracy, which is going to make people mad, and it will \nhave a lot of costs.\n  In my State, Kansas City has a board of public utilities. If we put \nthese costs on their electric generation, which is mostly out of coal, \nthey are going to see their utility rates go up from the mid-20 percent \nto 50-some percent in less than a decade's period of time. Is that \ngoing to happen without any vote of this legislative body? We are going \nto see people's utilities rates go up possibly 50 percent with no vote \ntaking place?\n  I think people would say we need to have a clear deliberation of this \nbody. Also on this point, the way we have solved problems of this \nnature and magnitude in the past is through investment and innovation, \nnot through taxes and regulation. It is us saying let's figure \ndifferent ways forward to deal with this rather than let's tax people \nand regulate people more and drive up their costs.\n  A year and a half ago, we had the first hydrogen fuel cell locomotive \nroll down the tracks in Topeka, KS, done by BNSF, the Army, and several \nother groups. It is replacing a diesel. It is a test unit. But that \ninvestment and innovation by BNSF, which uses 5 percent of the diesel \nfuel in the country, that is the way you move forward rather than raise \nutility rates for people in Kansas City by 50 percent.\n  It is also a way that we as the American people have been most \nsuccessful--investment and innovation--when people look at a better way \nfor us to move forward, which is cost effective, and the American \npeople embrace it if it works well. If it is, people will embrace it. \nThey are delighted to do that. If we go the other route and say we are \nnot going to do that through investment and innovation, we are going to \ndo it through taxes and regulation and raise utility rates 50 percent, \npeople are going to be flaming mad about that, and it is being done by \nan unelected bureaucracy to pursue that.\n  It would not work and it would not be accepted by the American \npublic. It is not the way we have moved forward as a society. It would \nnot be us leading in the world. It will be us following on, yet again--\nwhen somebody says you have to go by taxes and regulation, we say, OK, \nwe will do it. That is not the American way. It is through investment \nand innovation. We have done it in the past. We can do it now, and we \ncan have Congress's role in this on supporting a renewable energy \nstandard, which is one way, where we get more energy from wind, \nnuclear, and a bipartisan bill that has already been produced. That is \nan acceptable way, the way the American public can embrace--not this \nroute which raises taxes and regulation and will not be accepted by the \nAmerican public.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Murkowski resolution of \ndisapproval and reject the EPA's endangerment finding and take up the \nbipartisan Energy bill that is cleared through the Bingaman committee \nfor us to consider on renewable energy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time? The Senator from New Mexico \nis recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nour 30-minute block, which is coming up now, be divided in the \nfollowing manner: Senator Whitehouse for 10 minutes, Senator Webb for 5 \nminutes, Senator Murray for 5 minutes, Senator Leahy for 5 minutes, and \nI will close with 5 minutes. With that, I yield to my good friend from \nRhode Island, Senator Whitehouse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I stand in opposition to the \nresolution offered by the Senator from Alaska. The text of the \nresolution asks Senators to second-guess scientists and public health \nofficials by voiding the scientific finding that carbon pollution may \nendanger public health or welfare--like there is any legitimate dispute \nabout that question. The text of this resolution would halt all efforts \nby EPA to address carbon pollution, including the necessary and long-\noverdue fuel efficiency standards that EPA negotiated with States and \nthe automobile industry, to everyone's satisfaction.\n  Mr. President, that is the text of the resolution. But the point of \nthe resolution is far simpler: to delay--delay action on energy \nlegislation, delay action by EPA to protect public health and, more \nimportantly, to delay action in this Congress on energy reform and to \npreserve the status quo by taking off the pressure of facts and science \nand law that is now driving the process. They want to trump that with \npure politics.\n  What you will hear from many colleagues who support this resolution \nis that they want Congress to act to address carbon pollution and not \nthe EPA. But with all due respect, many of the resolution's supporters \nwant nothing to do with comprehensive clean energy and climate \nlegislation. What they want is for EPA to go away. If they can delay \nEPA's work to address carbon pollution or stop it in its tracks \naltogether, they take the pressure off of anybody to do anything \nserious\n\n[[Page S4815]]\n\nabout a new energy policy or our addiction to fossil fuel. This is \nabout delay on change in our energy policy.\n  Congress could be spending its time now setting the country on a new \nenergy course by placing a price on carbon and investing in low-energy \nand clean-energy alternatives. Transforming our energy base will not \nhappen overnight, but the longer we delay, the harder it will be.\n  That is what Congress could be doing. Instead, we are spending time \narguing about whether the Clean Air Act should be used to fight air \npollution. Outside these walls, in the real world, this question has to \nseem absurd. What else would the Clean Air Act be used for?\n  This issue has been all the way to the Supreme Court, and it is \nestablished law that the Clean Air Act applies. Then why are we \ndebating this legislation? We are debating this because the big \npolluters--the same industries that brought us the April 5, 2010, mine \ndisaster in West Virginia and the explosion on the rig in the Gulf of \nMexico--like things the way they are. They like the status quo.\n  Under the status quo, while the rest of America was struggling to \npull out of a recession earlier this year, big oil raked in record \nprofits--$23 billion in just the first quarter of 2010. Under the \nstatus quo, when workers pay the costs of mining and drilling with \ntheir lives, when our environment pays for devastating oilspills, when \nour children pay the cost of dirty air with childhood asthma, big \npolluters don't have to pay the full cost of the pollution they have \ncaused. That is the status quo they want to preserve.\n\n  In 2009, the polluters spent $290 million lobbying Congress or 10 \ntimes what the clean energy companies spent. This year, they have \nlobbied Members of the Senate to support this Murkowski resolution. \nThey will keep on lobbying for delay and against energy reform, that is \nclear.\n  The question is, How will we respond to that big oil industry \npressure? Will we fold before these big companies and their corporate \nlobbyists and delay again action on energy and climate change or will \nwe stand up to the special interests and work to enact comprehensive \nclimate and clean energy legislation?\n  This is not the first time I have spoken on the Senate floor in \nopposition to an effort to delay EPA action. But it is the first time I \nhave done so against the backdrop of an environmental catastrophe.\n  This time, when I say polluters want to delay action on climate \nchange and energy reform, we understand in a very real way the risk \nthat delay poses. Despite the multimillion-dollar ad campaign by BP \ntelling us not to worry because they are ``beyond petroleum,'' hundreds \nof thousands of gallons of crude oil now pour into the Gulf of Mexico \nfrom a BP well that exploded 2 months ago because they were big \npolluters and badly prepared.\n  Polluters have a powerful voice in Congress. Make no mistake about \nit; if they are successful in getting Congress to keep EPA from \naddressing carbon pollution, they will take all the pressure off for \nclean energy jobs legislation. But the tragedy along the gulf coast \nmakes clear that we must do something. Today's vote will make clear who \nin this Chamber is on the side of delaying action on real energy reform \nand who is fighting for the American people, for jobs, and for the \nenvironment.\n  America is already years, if not decades, behind in the race to lead \nthe global clean energy revolution. As far back as the 1890s, \nscientists documented the ``greenhouse effect'' of increased carbon \ndioxide in our atmosphere. The first congressional hearings on climate \nchange were held three decades ago.\n  In 1994, the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change recognized \nhuman-caused climate change. The issue has been out there for decades, \nand now it is time to take action. We have to move swiftly to address \nclimate change and to have America in front in the global race for \nclean energy jobs.\n  In the meantime, we have to allow EPA to use its legal authority to \nreduce carbon pollution and encourage the deployment of clean energy. \nThe EPA isn't just inventing this authority, it is following the law of \nthe land. Congress enacted the Clean Air Act in 1970 under a Republican \nPresident. For four decades, EPA has used the Clean Air Act to make our \nair safer to breathe. Over that same time, guess what. Our economy \ngrew--many times over.\n  Some argue that the Clean Air Act isn't meant to clean up carbon \npollution. Well, the Supreme Court disagreed. Congress wrote a very \nbroad definition of ``air pollutant'' and specifically, in 1990, \ndefined carbon dioxide as a pollutant in the Clean Air Act amendments.\n  Despite this broad authority, EPA was indeed idle for many years, but \nnot of its own accord, and not when it was sued. In fact, the Bush EPA \nfought the application of the Clean Air Act to carbon dioxide every \nstep of the way and to the bitter end, right up to the doors of the \nSupreme Court, where they lost. Despite the heavy hand of the Bush \nadministration holding EPA back from doing its legal duty, the Supreme \nCourt--one of the most conservative Supreme Courts in generations--\nruled in 2007 that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions \nwere ``pollutants'' under the Clean Air Act. The Supreme Court held \nthat if the Agency thought this pollutant could ``reasonably be \nanticipated'' to endanger public health or welfare, the EPA had to act.\n  Yet here we are, and some Senators still want delay. For delay, they \nare willing to vote for a resolution that disregards science. For \ndelay, they are willing to vote for a resolution that undermines the \nClean Air Act. For delay, they are willing to vote for a resolution \nthat tosses aside a Supreme Court decision. And for delay, they are \nwilling to vote for a resolution that ignores the will of the American \npeople, largely for the benefit of big oil and other corporate \npolluters.\n  Should we have a national discussion on how to control carbon? Yes. \nShould we debate how to move to cleaner sources of energy? Absolutely. \nBut rather than have an honest discussion about how to do this, \nsupporters of this resolution want to delay doing anything at all.\n  The attorney general of my State of Rhode Island, Patrick Lynch, with \n10 other attorneys general and the corporation counsel of New York \nCity, sent a letter to the Senate leadership yesterday urging us not to \nvote for the Murkowski resolution because it ``would be a step \nbackwards undoing the settled expectations of States, industry, and \nenvironmentalists alike.''\n  In closing, that is exactly the point of this resolution. It is a \ndeliberate step backward. It is a delay tactic. It is a last attempt by \npolluters to hold onto the dirty energy economy that has treated them \nso well--$23 billion well so far this year.\n  Under this dirty energy economy, we spend $1 billion a day on foreign \noil from countries that do not wish us well. Companies such as BP can \ncut corners on worker safety and the environment and then expect the \ngovernment to come in and clean up their $30 billion mess. Twelve \npercent of our children in New England downwind from the polluters \nsuffer from asthma and pulmonary disease. These kids matter. This issue \nmatters. We can delay no longer.\n  I urge my colleagues to say no to delay, say no to taking all the \npressure off the polluters, and vote against the Murkowski resolution \nso we can get to work to forge clean energy reform in America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Virginia, Mr. Webb.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise today in somewhat regrettable \nopposition to the resolution offered by the Senior Senator from Alaska.\n  I do not believe this is about big oil. This is not about oilspills. \nIt is not about people who like dirty air. It is about the extent to \nwhich the executive branch in our government can act without the clear \nexpression of intent from this Congress. I appreciate Senator \nMurkowski's efforts to illuminate this issue further in front of our \nbody.\n  Like Senator Murkowski, I have expressed deep reservations about the \nconsequences of the endangerment finding on carbon dioxide and five\n\n[[Page S4816]]\n\nother greenhouse gases that the Environmental Protection Agency issued \non December 7, 2009. As many of us in this body well know, without \nproper boundaries, this finding could be the first step in a long and \nexpensive regulatory process that could inevitably lead to overly \nstringent and very costly controls on carbon dioxide and other \ngreenhouse gas emissions. This regulatory framework is so broad and \npotentially far reaching that it could eventually touch nearly every \nfacet of this nation's economy, putting unnecessary burdens on our \nindustries and driving many businesses overseas purely at the \ndiscretion of the executive branch and absent the clearly stated intent \nof the Congress.\n  Our farms and factories, our transportation system, and our power \ngenerating capacity would all be subject to these new regulations. This \nunprecedented, sweeping authority over our economy at the hands of the \nEPA is at the heart of Senator Murkowski's concern, and ultimately, \nwhichever way one votes on her amendment, it is what this debate is all \nabout.\n  At a time when the economy continues to struggle under the burdens of \nthe worst recession since the Great Depression, I do not believe that \nCongress should cede its authority over an issue as important as \nclimate change to unelected officials of the executive branch. \nCongress--and not the EPA--should make important policies, and be \naccountable to the American people for them.\n  This is not a new concern for me. When this administration declared \nlast November that the President would sign a ``politically binding'' \nagreement at the United Nations Framework on Climate Change in \nCopenhagen, I objected. I was the only Member of Congress to send the \nPresident a letter stating clearly that ``only specific legislation \nagreed upon in the Congress, or a treaty ratified by the Senate, could \nactually create such a commitment on behalf of our country.''\n  I have also expressed on several occasions my belief that this \nadministration appears to be erecting new regulatory barriers to the \nsafe and legal mining of coal resources in my state and others. My \nconsistent message to the EPA is that good intentions do not in and of \nthemselves equal the clear and unambiguous guidance from the Congress.\n  In examining this issue, I have also reviewed carefully the Supreme \nCourt's holding in Massachusetts v. EPA. My opposition to EPA's \nregulation of carbon dioxide for stationary sources stems in part from \nmy reading of the case. I do not believe that prior EPA Administrators \nacted arbitrarily and capriciously in declining to regulate carbon \ndioxide and other greenhouse gases. Nor am I convinced that the Clean \nAir Act was ever intended to regulate--or to classify as a dangerous \npollutant--something as basic and ubiquitous in our atmosphere as \ncarbon dioxide.\n  Notwithstanding these serious concerns with the endangerment finding \nand what I view as EPA's potentially unchecked regulation of carbon \ndioxide, I have decided to vote no on the resolution before the Senate. \nI have done so for two principal reasons.\n  First, Senator Murkowski's resolution would reverse significant \nprogress that this administration has made in forging a consensus on \nmotor vehicle fuel economy and emissions standards. A little more than \none year ago, the Obama administration brokered an agreement to \nestablish the One National Program for fuel economy and greenhouse gas \nstandards. This agreement means that our beleaguered automotive \nindustry will not face a patchwork quilt of varying State and Federal \nemission standards. Significantly, this agreement is directly in line \nwith the holding in Massachusetts v. EPA, which dealt with motor \nvehicle emissions. Both in the Clean Air Act and in subsequent \nlegislation enacted by the Congress, there has been a far greater \nconsensus on regulation of motor vehicle emissions than on stationary \nsources with respect to greenhouse gas emissions.\n  It has been estimated that these new rules, which are to apply to \nvehicles of model years 2012 to 2016, would save 1.8 billion barrels of \noil and millions of dollars in consumer savings. The agreement, \nhowever, and the regulations that will effectuate it, both rest upon \nthe same endangerment finding that would be overturned by this \nresolution. In this sense, the Murkowski resolution goes too far. And \nit is for this reason that the Alliance of Automotive Manufacturers and \nthe United Auto Workers, UAW, have publicly stated their opposition to \nthe legislation before us.\n  Second, I have concluded that an alternative, equally effective \nmechanism exists to ensure that Congress--and not unelected Federal \nofficials--can formulate our policies on climate change and energy \nlegislation. Senator Rockefeller has proposed legislation to suspend \nEPA's regulation of greenhouse gases from stationary sources for 2 \nyears. I am a cosponsor of Senator Rockefeller's bill. His approach \nwould give Congress the time it needs to address our legitimate \nconcerns with climate change, and not disrupt or reverse the important \nprogress that has been made on motor vehicle fuel and emission \nstandards. I note that, to her credit, this was an approach that the \nsenior Senator from Alaska originally proposed, and I am hopeful that \nwe can take this approach in the future.\n  I am also pleased that in my discussions with the majority leader, he \nhas assured me of his willingness to bring the Rockefeller bill to a \nvote this year.\n  Finally, let me say I share the hope of many Members of this body \nfrom both sides of the aisle that we can enact some form of energy \nlegislation this year. I have consistently outlined key elements that I \nwould like to see in any energy package. The centerpiece of any climate \npolicy must be to encourage the development of clean energy sources and \ncarbon-mitigating technologies. We should explore mechanisms that will \nincentivize factory owners, manufacturers, and consumers to become more \nenergy efficient. We should also fund research and development for \ntechnologies that will enable the safe and clean use of this country's \nvast fossil fuel resources.\n  In November 2009, I introduced the Clean Energy Act of 2009, S. 2776, \nwith Senator Lamar Alexander. This bipartisan bill will promote further \ninvestment in clean energy technologies, including nuclear power and \nrenewable sources of energy. Specifically, the Clean Energy Act of 2009 \nauthorizes $20 billion over the next 10 years to fund loan guarantees, \nnuclear education and workforce training, nuclear reactor lifetime-\nextension, and incentives for the development of solar power, biofuels, \nand alternative power technologies. I believe it is a practical \napproach toward moving our country toward providing clean, carbon-free \nsources of energy, helping to invigorate the economy, and strengthening \nour workforce with educational opportunities and high-paying jobs here \nat home.\n  This legislation by itself is not intended to solve all of our \nclimate change challenges. It is, however, a measurable and achievable \nbeginning and will place the Nation on a path to a cleaner energy \nfuture. In addition, through investment in lower emission \ntransportation fuels, incentives to electrify the transportation \nsector, and support for technologies that will eventually enable the \nburning of fossil fuels in a carbon-free fashion, it provides a \nframework for technologies that will eventually enable a more effective \nresponse to climate change.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 more minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. My understanding is all the time is \nallocated in this 30-minute block. Senators are lined up to speak, I \nsay to Senator Webb.\n  Mr. WEBB. I was told last night that I would have 10 minutes. I got \ndown here and discovered I have 5. Let me just say Senator \nRockefeller's bill can do the job. I hope my colleagues will look at \nit.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I yield an additional minute.\n  Mr. WEBB. I appreciate that.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, before Senator Webb continues, may I \nask a question? If an additional minute is to be yielded to the \nopposition, I request that we also have additional time added to our \nside.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I have yielded 1 minute from my time out of \nthe 30-minute block. It is not additional time.\n\n[[Page S4817]]\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I rescind that request if it is coming out of the \nSenator's time.\n  Mr. WEBB. Let me make this a lot simpler. I will take 15 seconds and \nsay I am a cosponsor of Senator Rockefeller's bill. I believe it is an \neffective approach. To Senator Murkowski's credit, it is an approach \nshe originally proposed, before she was shut off from getting a vote on \nthat type of a procedure. I am going to vote against Senator \nMurkowski's resolution, but I think she is on the right track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I will oppose the resolution. The \nresolution of disapproval before us reminds me of a skills competition \nfor young people that has been promoted by the National Football \nLeague. It is called Punt, Pass, and Kick. The resolution is an \nengraved invitation for the Senate to make a big league handoff of a \nbasketful of illness, economic stalemate, and environmental pollution \nto our children and grandchildren.\n  It would punt away constructive action to begin addressing many \nthreats that each and every American faces from climate change, and the \nthreats we face every day to our national security.\n  It would pass on opportunities to foster cleaner air and water for us \nand for the generations that will follow us. It would kick away the \nprogress already negotiated by the Obama administration and key \nindustries, such as automobile and truck manufacturers, to usher in new \nproducts that would pollute less while creating good American jobs--\njobs that cannot be sent overseas, jobs we need in America.\n  Many on the other side of the aisle have been adamant in trying to \nwish these problems away and to forfeit the economic opportunities at \nour fingertips to lead the world in these new energy technologies. \nPowerful corporate interests are more than glad to contribute to these \nefforts to stalemate any progress.\n  What we are debating today is whether business as usual is good \nenough for the environmental challenges and economic opportunities that \nare already before us. We are being asked to overturn with a political \nveto the strong scientific evidence that points to a healthier future. \nWe are being asked to undermine America's ability to clean up our air \nand our waters.\n  The science is clear that greenhouse gases are a danger, and they are \na clear and present health and economic threat to the American people.\n  At a time when our Nation is responding to our worst environmental \ncatastrophe of all time and oil continues to gush into the Gulf of \nMexico, passing this resolution would be the Senate's way of saying: \nNothing has changed; nothing should change. I disagree. It is a \ndeclaration of our intent to keep relying on the outdated, dirty, and \ninefficient technologies of the past, and to let every other \nindustrialized country create jobs in their countries, leap ahead of us \nin developing and selling these new technologies. I disagree with that. \nThis is another proposed bailout of big polluters.\n  I do not think this is the path we want to chart for our children and \nour Nation. A decade from now, will we be able to look back at this \nvote and not be ashamed of ourselves? EPA's findings are based on sound \nscience and an exhaustive review of scientific research. Let's not the \n100 of us cast a political vote to overturn that.\n  Much of what the special interests and big oil and their lobbyists \nhave been saying in favor of this resolution is steeped in politics and \nmistruths, not in science. What we have here is the Environmental \nProtection Agency focused on protecting the American people, whether it \nis arsenic in our drinking water, smog in the air, mercury in the fish \nwe eat, or greenhouse gases. Overturning these findings would be like \ntrying to overturn science. You don't do it.\n  If we pass this resolution, it is not a case of hurting the economy. \nQuite the opposite. The resolution will hurt the economy by causing the \nAmerican people to forfeit a third of the greenhouse gas emissions \nreductions that are projected to come from last year's historic \nagreement.\n  Do not overturn the EPA findings. Do not force our Nation's already \nstruggling automakers to spend even more money to produce more fuel-\nefficient cars because a dozen States, such as Vermont and California, \ncould then go forward, each with their own rules and standards.\n  Let us not be known as the Congress to continue to punt, pass, and \nkick on these crucial issues about which the American people are \nlooking for solutions.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Washington, Mrs. Murray.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington State is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong \nopposition to the resolution before us that would block the EPA from \nregulating greenhouse gas emissions and protecting our families and the \nenvironment.\n  This resolution is not based on science, and I feel strongly it would \nbe a step in the wrong direction for our country. We know greenhouse \ngas emissions are dangerous for our environment and to our families' \nhealth.\n  The science on this issue is clear, and it is something people in my \nhome State of Washington take very seriously. Climate change would \nwreak havoc on much of what our families treasure--our forests, our \ncoastlines, our salmon habitats, and our farmland.\n\n  The debate we should be having today ought to be how we move forward \non that issue, not how to obstruct and stall and maintain the status \nquo. What we should be discussing is how to pass a comprehensive \nclimate and energy bill that would reduce our dependence on foreign \noil, support our national security objectives, and unshackle this \neconomy; that would tap the creative energy of our Nation's workers and \ncreate millions of good, family-wage jobs here in this country and make \nsure our workers continue leading the way in the 21st-century economy.\n  I know there are several proposals that have been put on the table on \nthis issue, but we can't just simply block EPA's endangerment findings \nand expect our greenhouse gas emission problem to resolve itself. I \nknow there are industries that have concerns about being regulated. I \nunderstand they would prefer a legislative solution. I would too. But \nwe have to keep moving forward so we can address this critical issue, \nand blocking the EPA's endangerment finding is a step backward toward \nthe failed environmental policies of the past.\n  The law on this is clear. The Supreme Court has ruled that the EPA \nhas the authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. A lengthy \nprocess was conducted to determine this endangerment finding, and the \npublic, as well as the business community, has been fully engaged \nthroughout. In fact, as has been said, the auto industry opposes this \nresolution because it would put them right back into a state of \nregulatory uncertainty.\n  If we look at vehicles alone, the national clean car standards as \nproposed under the Clean Air Act will cut carbon pollution from \nvehicles by 30 percent. In my home State, the transportation sector \naccounts for more than 50 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. And \nincreased fuel efficiency standards will save our families money at the \npump and it will cut demand for oil by an estimated 450 million barrels \nover the life of this program. All of that is threatened by this \nresolution.\n  It is especially disappointing to see this on the floor while images \nof oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico and devastating the local \nenvironment and economy continue to be shown on every news channel in \nthis Nation.\n  The resolution we are debating today is going to take us back to the \nfailed old policies that have made us more and more dependent on oil. \nIf the big oil companies and their lobbyists get their way on this \nvote, our families will continue to spend more on fuel, and it will be \na lot harder for our economy to make the shift to cleaner and more \nefficient sources of energy.\n  The longer we put off dealing with greenhouse gas emissions, the more \nit\n\n[[Page S4818]]\n\nwill cost our economy, our environment, and our health. So I strongly \noppose this resolution that prioritizes big oil companies over our \nfamilies and our small business owners. I hope that after this, we can \nwork together to find real solutions.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nWashington for her comments, and I yield myself any remaining time in \nour 30-minute block.\n  Today, America faces an energy crisis. The Senate owes the American \npeople solutions. But this resolution is an attempt to bury our heads \nin the sand and ignore reality.\n  The oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico is only the most visible aspect of \nour energy crisis. The true consequences of our energy policy are \nspread even wider than the spill and the costs, even more deadly.\n  First, our dependence on imported oil is a threat to our national \nsecurity. Imported oil fuels dictators and terrorists, and the CIA \nbelieves climate change will make the world more unstable. If we block \nthe clean energy transition with this resolution, we will be forced to \nuse an additional 450 million barrels of oil, most of which will be \nimported. Instead, the Senate should reject this resolution and \nrecognize that the transition to a clean energy economy is a national \nsecurity priority. Americans want our national security out of the \nquagmire of foreign oil dependency. This resolution puts us in deeper.\n  Here at home, this dependence is also a threat to the pocketbooks of \nAmerican families and businesses.\n  In 2008, American families and businesses sent $475 billion overseas \nto pay for foreign oil. Last year, we sent over $300 billion overseas. \nBy the end of this year, we will have sent over $1 trillion outside the \nU.S. for imported oil in the last 3 years.\n  That is a massive transfer of wealth from families in New Mexico and \nthe other 49 States to the treasuries of foreign nations.\n  If this resolution succeeds, we will import millions more barrels of \noil and send billions more of our hard-earned money overseas.\n  If the Senate fails to act, the administration must take up the \nslack. This resolution would paralyze the Federal Government.\n  The administration is already making progress with new vehicle fuel \nefficiency rules, which will save 450 million barrels of oil. This \nresolution would jeopardize that effort, taking us backwards.\n  Further administration efforts will improve efficiency at power \nplants and major factories and reduce pollution.\n  Small businesses, farmers, and ranchers need not worry. They will not \nbe subject to any EPA regulations on greenhouse gases.\n  Our dependence on dirty fossil fuels is also a threat to the global \nclimate system--the air we breathe and the water we drink--in New \nMexico and around the world. This resolution specifically rejects the \nEPA's scientific finding, conducted by nonpartisan scientists, that \ngreenhouse gas pollution is a threat to public health and to the \nenvironment. There are no climate scientists in the Senate. This body \nhas no business injecting political bias into scientific deliberations. \nThe resolution should be rejected for this reason alone.\n  It is revealing that this resolution is supported by dozens of \nspecial interests that have worked for years to discredit strong \nscience. The vast majority of the evidence tells us that global warming \nis real. Strong scientific evidence shows that unless we transition to \nclean energy sources, our home States will pay a heavy price.\n  Many supporters of this resolution doubt climate science. In \nresponse, I point to the scientists of Los Alamos National Lab. The \nscientists and supercomputers there keep America's nuclear arsenal \nsafe, secure, and reliable. They have no margin for error. Los Alamos \nalso runs some of the most sophisticated global climate models used by \nscientists around the United States and the world. These models \nindicate a serious risk to our landscapes and water supplies. Many \nscientific studies in the field confirm those risks.\n  In New Mexico, scientific evidence indicates devastating forest \nfires, droughts, and invasive species will be worsened by global \nwarming. According to the Nature Conservancy, over 95 percent of New \nMexico has seen temperature increases due to global warming. Ninety-\nthree percent of our watersheds have become dried, and snowpack has \ndecreased over the last 30 years.\n  Making matters worse, this same reliance on fossil fuels pollutes our \natmosphere with toxic compounds such as sulfur dioxide, soot, and \nmercury, alongside greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.\n  Luckily, we have numerous cost-effective solutions at hand to address \nthe energy and climate crisis. New Mexico and many other States across \nthe Nation are rich in much cleaner domestic sources of energy, sources \nsuch as wind, solar, geothermal, and natural gas.\n  Last week, a uranium enrichment plant opened in New Mexico to provide \nemission-free fuel for American nuclear powerplants. Several years ago, \nwind energy was unusual, but now it is increasingly common, especially \nin the American West. Offshore wind has the potential to provide 30 \npercent of the east coast's power as well. The United States is now \ninstalling over a gigawatt of solar power each year. And there are \nanother six gigawatts of concentrated solar power projects planned \nnationally, particularly in the Southwest. U.S. natural gas reserves \nhave also increased by 35 percent in just 1 year. We now have a \ncentury's worth of supply. While natural gas is a fossil fuel, it is \nsignificantly cleaner than either coal or oil, and it is more abundant. \nThe clean energy transition does not just mean renewable energy; it \nalso means a renewed focus on natural gas and nuclear power.\n  Ironically, this resolution would also eliminate the incentive to \ninvest in carbon capture technologies which are the future of coal.\n  Even worse, this resolution undercuts the push for energy efficiency. \nWithout rules to reduce pollution, powerplants lack the right \nincentives to save energy. Both government and industry studies have \nfound that the right efficiency investments could save energy and more \nthan $1 trillion at the same time. Energy efficiency does not mean \nturning down the heater in the winter or the air-conditioner in the \nsummer.\n  Mr. President, at its core, this resolution is about delay. The House \nis not going to take up this resolution. The sponsor of this resolution \nknows the President does not support this. There are not the votes. And \nreally what is going on here is delay.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at this time, the 30 minutes under \nRepublican control will be allocated as follows: Senator Wicker will \nhave 5 minutes; Senator Thune, 10 minutes; Senator Johanns, 5 minutes; \nSenator Kyl, 5 minutes; and Senator Sessions, 5 minutes. Senator Thune \nwill lead off this block.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Alaska for \nher leadership on this issue. This is an important debate to have, and \nI wish to remind my colleagues what this debate is about because I have \nheard lots of discussion on the floor today about how this is somehow \nabout the science of climate change.\n  This isn't about the science of climate change. Maybe we ought to \nhave that debate. Perhaps that is something we should debate, but that \nis not what this debate is about. This debate is also not about some of \nthe other issues that have been thrown out here--that this is about big \noil or this is about the Republicans wanting to delay or protect \nsomehow the status quo. That is not what this debate is about. This is \na very simple, straightforward question. That question is, Do we, the \nU.S. Senate, want to be on the record with regard to the issue of \nwhether the EPA ought to move forward and try to regulate \nCO2 emissions under the Clean Air Act or should we wait \nuntil Congress takes up and deals with that issue?\n  What is ironic about what my colleagues on the other side are \nsuggesting is that a lot of people have said\n\n[[Page S4819]]\n\nthat Republicans just want to delay; they want to delay because they do \nnot believe in the science. Well, we don't control the agenda; the \nDemocratic leader controls the agenda. They have a climate change bill \nthey could bring to the floor and we could debate it. They do not want \nto do that because they don't want to put a lot of their Democrats on \nrecord on that vote. So what do they do instead? We allow the EPA--a \nbunch of unelected bureaucrats--to move forward and do something that \nwould have tremendous consequence to the American economy without \nhearing from the Congress.\n  I think that, in a very simple, straightforward manner, is what this \ndebate is about. It is about, do we want the EPA to move forward with \nthe regulation of greenhouse gas emissions absent direction from the \nCongress--the people's representatives--or do the voices of the people \nneed to be heard through the debate we ought to be having here in the \nCongress?\n  I will say that irrespective of what you believe about the science \nbehind climate change and whether or not human activity is contributing \nto it, one thing we know with great certainty is that it will have \nprofound economic impacts on the American economy.\n  Mr. KERRY. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. THUNE. I will yield at the conclusion of my remarks to the \nSenator from Massachusetts, but I have some things to get to before \nthat.\n  Mr. President, what is important is that everyone acknowledges, \nincluding the Obama administration, that moving forward with the EPA \nregulating CO2 emissions under the Clean Air Act would cause \nthe economy to suffer.\n  I want to quote something the Office of Management and Budget put out \nlast August in a document. It says:\n\n       Regulating CO2 under the Clean Air Act for the \n     time is likely to have serious economic consequences for \n     regulated entities throughout the U.S. economy, including \n     small businesses and small communities.\n\n  If you look at the impact on small businesses, farms, and ranches, \nthe proponents are going to say: Well, the EPA is not intending to \nregulate smaller entities like that; we just want to get the big \npolluters. OK. We start at 100,000 tons. Well, in 2012, we move to \n50,000 tons.\n  I would argue--and it is supported by statements made by folks in the \nadministration--the EPA Administrator has indicated that by 2016, they \nintend to regulate smaller emitters, if we get to 2016, because what \nwill happen is this so-called tailoring rule will get challenged in the \ncourts and it will likely get overturned because the Clean Air Act said \nthe threshold for regulation is 250 tons.\n  At 250 tons, you don't get just the big emitters. You don't get the \nlarge polluters. You get over 6 million entities, to include farms, \nranches, small businesses, churches, hospitals, and you can go right \ndown the list. That is what happens when you regulate at the 250-ton \nlevel. As I said, they are saying that is not going to happen, that we \nhave this tailoring rule. Well, the law is very clear. If we are going \nto use the Clean Air Act as the authority to do this, the Clean Air Act \nstipulates 250 tons. That captures a whole lot of entities that strike \nat the very heart of the American economy.\n  The cap-and-trade legislation that was passed by the House last \nsummer has yet to be voted on here in the Senate, but there has been a \nlot of analysis of that done in my State of South Dakota. The public \nutilities commission in my State suggested that, if passed, that would \nincrease power rates in States such as South Dakota by 50 percent.\n  If you look at what the actual impacts are going to be on small \nbusinesses across this country--not only because of the cost of the \noriginal construction permits that would be included in this but also \noperating permits--the Wall Street Journal said in a May 2009 story \nthat in 2007 the Clean Air Act cost those who had to apply for permits \n$125,000 per permit and 866 hours to obtain it.\n  So whether you subscribe to the notion that this is only going to \napply to large entities or whether you subscribe, as I do, to the \nbelief that this is ultimately going to cover a lot more smaller \nentities that are going to be adversely impacted and deal with much \nhigher power rates, I think it is pretty clear that whoever is covered \nby these new regulations is going to be faced with a lot higher costs \nwhen it comes to permits, a lot higher costs when it comes to the \nimplementation of best available technology, and therefore a lot higher \ncost to the American consumer who will deal with the burden of that \nwhen it is passed on by these various emitting entities.\n  My State of South Dakota, of course, is composed of a lot of farmers \nand ranchers. Agriculture is a 45-percent energy-intensive business, if \nyou look at the inputs that are necessary to make a living in a farm or \nranch operation. That means 45 percent of a farmer or rancher's costs \nare going to be increased by this backdoor energy tax imposed by the \nEPA. The fees and fines that are placed upon machinery manufacturers, \nenergy companies, and fertilizer companies starting in 2011 and 2012 \nwill be immediately passed down to the farm and ranch families who are \ngoing to be impacted by this.\n  If the EPA is forced to regulate at the statutory 250-ton threshold--\nwhich, as I said, once this is litigated I believe that is what the \ncourts are going to find--farms with as few as 25 dairy cattle would be \nforced to apply for a title 5 permit and pay a fee for each ton of \ngreenhouse gases emitted by their cattle: the cow tax. That is what \nthis is about. This is not, as I said, about the science of climate \nchange. It is not about Republicans wanting to delay. We don't control \nthe agenda around here. It is not about big oil. It is about small \nbusinesses, family farms, and ranches trying to make a living, trying \nto create jobs in the economy and constantly having Washington stand in \nthe way and throw new hurdles and impediments and obstacles and \nbarriers in their way.\n  What the Murkowski resolution does, very simply, is it forces us to \nanswer a fundamental question and that is should Congress be acting on \nlegislation that would direct these activities or do we allow a bunch \nof unelected bureaucrats at an agency downtown to move forward with \nregulations that would impose massive new costs on the American economy \nat a time when we are trying to create jobs and get this economy on its \nfeet. That is the straightforward, simple question put forward by the \nresolution from the Senator from Alaska.\n  I hope my colleagues here realize, irrespective of what they think \nabout the science of climate change, irrespective of all the other \narguments that are being used as a distraction here on big oil and \nRepublicans delaying this debate, when you get down to the fundamental \nquestion, that is what the issue is, whether this Senate wants to be on \nrecord about allowing a bunch of unelected bureaucrats to move forward \nwith the regulations that would impose massive new costs on our \neconomy, not just on big polluters, large polluters--who, by the way, \nare going to pass those costs on--but directly hitting the small \nbusinesses, farms, the ranches that are the very backbone of the \nAmerican economy.\n  This is not, by the way, just a Republican issue. There are lots of \nDemocrats who have weighed in on this and there are lots of Democrats I \nbelieve here in the Senate today who I hope will be willing to support \nthis resolution. But I want to read for you very quickly here, because \nI know my time is running out, a couple of things that have been said \nby Democrats in the House of Representatives. Collin Peterson, a \nCongressman from Minnesota, has said:\n\n       The Clean Air Act was never meant to be used for this but \n     they're trying to do it anyway. . . . Most everyone I've \n     heard from about this thinks that elected officials--not EPA \n     bureaucrats--should decide how to address our energy \n     problems.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Mr. THUNE. John Dingell called this a ``glorious mess,'' if the EPA \nmoves forward with this. I have other statements from the Democratic \nMembers of the House of Representatives which I will be happy to submit \nfor the Record, as well as a letter from a bunch of Representatives in \nmy State supporting the Murkowski resolution.\n  I yield my time and hope my colleagues will support this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, at this time I yield 5 minutes to the \nSenator from Nebraska.\n\n[[Page S4820]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, let me, if I might, start out and say how \nmuch I appreciated the comments by the Senator from South Dakota. Many \nmonths ago I did a roundtable with a great company in Nebraska, Nucor \nSteel. Nucor Steel is one of those companies you hope takes a look at \nyour State and creates the jobs that they have in your State--and they \nhave. They employ about a thousand people. They do everything right. \nThey are very pro-America. They are a well-managed company. They are a \ncompany that pays well. On average across the Nucor system, their wages \nare about $70,000 a year. For that area of any rural State, that is \nhuge. That is huge.\n  We sat down in this roundtable. As the Senator from South Dakota \npoints out, the impact on our businesses--the first thing I asked the \nfolks of Nucor Steel, I said to them, Where is your competition? Who \nare you competing with?\n  They said: The Chinese.\n  I said: The Chinese?\n  They said: Absolutely. When we go out and fight for a contract to \nkeep these people employed, we are fighting with the Chinese.\n  I said: Let me ask you, talk to me about the impact of all of this \nlegislation and various proposals on climate change on your company and \nthat competitive relationship.\n  They were very blunt and straightforward. They said: Very simply, \nMike, here is what happens. We go in a situation where we cannot \ncompete. Already, this is a very tough business. If you pile onto us \nthese additional requirements, we are in trouble immediately.\n  Here is what I want to say about the Murkowski amendment, to get \nstarted here today. I respect the Senator from Alaska for bringing this \nforward because this is the kind of debate we should be having on this \nvery important issue on the Senate floor and on the House floor. This \nshould not be a situation where we have relegated or allowed the \nresponsibility to be taken over by bureaucrats here in Washington, DC.\n  I rise today to offer my support for Senator Murkowski's resolution \nof disapproval. At the end of last year, as we all know, EPA announced \nthat greenhouse gas emissions would be regulated under the Clean Air \nAct. But Congress never designed the law to do that. Yet this \nadministration seems absolutely bent on this overreaching, regardless \nof, congressional intent. That is why I am one of the cosponsors on \nthis resolution.\n  The resolution is very simply our way of saying, here in Congress, \nthe Clean Air Act was never designed to allow you, the EPA, to regulate \ngreenhouse gases. This endangerment finding is simply bad for \neverybody. It is bad for Nucor Steel, it is bad for business, and it is \nbad for every American out there who flips on a light switch.\n  EPA tells us over 6 million entities will be captured by these new \npermitting requirements. Who are they? They are commercial buildings, \nthey are hospitals, they are ethanol plants. You can keep naming \nbusiness after business that will get caught up in this. Thousands of \nbusiness owners would now have to go to the EPA if they plan to expand \nthrough new construction or modifications. One Nebraska manufacturer \nrecently wrote to me, concerned with this very stark reality, and said: \n``These regulations will certainly influence our future decisionmaking \nregarding acquisitions, expansions, and new plants.''\n  So at a time where our economy is struggling, where everybody is \ntrying to figure out the best pathway to create jobs----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nSenator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Let me wrap up and ask my colleagues to support this \nvery important effort by Senator Murkowski.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to first say how much I support \nthe Murkowski resolution, and I will be voting for it. But I want to \npoint out, as ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, how it is \nwe got into this circumstance and why it is not justified. Why it \nshould never have happened, and why it is a product of the worst kind \nof judicial activism. And finally, why we need to see how we can work \nour way out of it.\n  In 1970, the Congress passed the Clean Air Act, and they allowed EPA \nto regulate pollutants. Rather than try to specifically define \npollutants, they said it would be defined by the Director of the EPA, \nand he would have that decision-making authority. That is the way it \nwas for many years.\n  Then years went by and people began to talk about global warming. \nGlobal warming developed a certain momentum and a number of scientists \nsigned onto this idea. Even though CO2 is a plant food and \nthe more CO2 that is in the atmosphere the better plants \ngrow. And even though we breathe out CO2 and plants breathe \nin CO2 which produces the oxygen that we breathe in this \nwonderful system that we are a part of. They concluded that \nCO2 was increasing because we were taking carbon fuels \nmostly from our soils, burning it, and that was increasing the \npercentage of CO2 in the atmosphere. Presumably it had at \none time been in the atmosphere and had been sucked up by plants.\n  So this argument arose that it would create global warming. In 1997 \nCongress had a vote on the Kyoto accord, to deal with whether we wanted \nto take these firm, aggressive steps to reduce CO2. By a \nvote of 97 to 0 we voted not to do that. We were not prepared to do \nthat.\n  Someone filed a lawsuit. In 2007, it came before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. The Supreme Court was asked to decide on the prohibition of air \npollutants, which passed in 1970 when nobody was thinking about global \nwarming, instead they were thinking about particulate matter, \nNOX and SOX, acid rain, and those kinds of \npollutants that go into the atmosphere. The question was, did that word \n``pollutant'' include CO2?\n  To me, a responsible court would have said Congress had all these \nyears to pass a law and specifically add CO2 as a pollutant \nif they wanted to. In fact, we have amended the law and never added it. \nThey would have asked, Is this a big economic issue we are deciding? It \nis a huge economic issue, because it would give the Environmental \nProtection Agency the right to regulate every single emission of \nCO2--every automobile, every factory, every home, every \nhospital, every steel mill; everybody who emits CO2 would be \nunder the regulation of the EPA.\n  They voted and by a 5-to-4 margin the Supreme Court of the United \nStates just declared--just by dictate declared--that Congress intended \nto cover CO2 when they passed the Clean Air Act of 1970.\n  It is a stunning thing. It is a huge activist decision. In my \nopinion, it shows how dangerous judges are who are not committed to \nrestraint and responsible action--how dangerous it can be when you give \nthem the power to pass something Congress would not have passed. They \ndidn't pass it then. And in my opinion, they would not pass it today. \nBut the Supreme Court said so.\n  I support the Murkowski resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I too support strongly the Murkowski \namendment. There has been a lot of misinformation spread about this. \nLet me clear up a couple of things. First, this resolution is not about \nthe science of climate change. It has nothing to do whatsoever with \ngreenhouse gases or the Earth's temperature.\n  It would not prevent the Senate from considering climate legislation \nif that is what the Senate chooses to do. Nor does this resolution have \nanything to do with the spill in the gulf coast, although some have \ntried to make it appear that way. Let's remember this resolution was \nintroduced months before that spill even began. It has nothing to do \nwith the disaster. We should not exploit this serious crisis for \npolitical gain, as the White House has tried to do.\n\n[[Page S4821]]\n\n  So what is the resolution about? Well, it boils down to a simple \nquestion: Should the Environmental Protection Agency be allowed to act \nunilaterally to set climate and energy policy through new Clean Air Act \nregulations without the delegation or approval of Congress. And the \nanswer is no. It is wrong for the administration to try to achieve its \ngoals by any means possible, in this case by going around the \nlegislative branch and by using the EPA to enact sweeping economic and \nenergy regulation.\n  In order to stop that, we need to approve this resolution. Let me \nprovide a bit of context for how we got to this point. In December of \n2009, the EPA finalized so-called endangerment findings for six \ngreenhouse gases, allowing it to establish greenhouse gas emission \nstandards for a few new motor vehicles.\n  Once those standards go into effect, under the law EPA has no choice \nbut to follow through and issue regulations for stationary sources of \ngreenhouse gas emissions. In fact, the EPA has estimated that about 6 \nmillion of these stationary sources: buildings, and facilities, \nincluding hospitals, nursing homes, schools, farms, and so on, will be \nsubject to regulation.\n  There will also be a new regulation of homes and RVs and cars and \ntractors and so on. The new regulation will touch every corner of our \neconomy and necessarily lead to higher energy costs, increasing the \ncost of nearly everything, and in the process killing jobs.\n  President Obama himself said that under the plan he favors, \nelectricity prices ``would necessarily skyrocket.'' Well, the Murkowski \ndisapproval resolution would nullify the legal effect and force of the \nEPA's endangerment finding. It would prevent the EPA from using the \nClean Air Act to set up a regulatory regime to impose backdoor climate \nregulations that would lead to a job-killing national energy tax.\n  Americans have made it very clear that they do not like the idea of \nlegislation that will increase their energy bills and raise their \ntaxes. They want Congress and the administration to focus on \nstrengthening the economy and providing incentives to job creators \nrather than burdening them with new regulations. They deserve to be \nheard. If they say through their representatives they do not want a \nnational energy tax in the form of cap-and-trade legislation to pass \nCongress, then the administration should not be able to circumvent \ntheir will by simply having the EPA do it.\n  This is a clear up-or-down vote to stop a power grab by unelected \nofficials at the Environmental Protection Agency, and to force any \nclimate and energy regulation to go through a democratic process \nconducted by Congress.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Murkowski resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, under the unanimous consent agreement, \nwe had reserved 5 minutes for Senator Wicker, but I am to going to \nyield those 5 minutes to Senator Hutchison.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Alaska for her great \nleadership in bringing this to the floor. I support this resolution. \nWhile cap-and-trade legislation has stalled in the Senate, the \nadministration is pursuing a backdoor approach to implement new \nregulations. The EPA's use of the Clean Air Act as a vehicle to expand \nits authority is a political maneuver that will allow the agency to \nbypass Congress and regulate greenhouse gases.\n  This is the prerogative of Congress and Congress has not acted \nbecause it would be a mistake to act. So here comes the regulatory \nagency to bypass Congress because they cannot get congressional \napproval to do what they are trying to do.\n  This vote has nothing to do with the oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico. \nIt is unfortunate that some are trying to use this tragedy in the Gulf \nof Mexico as some sort of leverage against this resolution. We all \nagree that we need a responsible energy policy that strikes a critical \nbalance between the protection of our environment, natural resources, \nand the preservation of American jobs. It is the responsibility of \nCongress to implement such a balanced policy.\n  It is also the responsibility of Congress to consider the economic \nimpact that regulations will have on Americans throughout our country. \nHere is how these regulations will affect my home State of Texas. In \nTexas, more than 30,000 businesses will be in industries that will now \nbe newly subject to the EPA regulations.\n  Texas' agriculture industry, which accounts for $106 billion, or 9.5 \npercent of Texas' total gross State product, would be \ndisproportionately damaged by the proposed regulations because of their \nuse of fertilizers which are already regulated.\n  Across the country, small businesses, which are the backbone of our \neconomy, and farmers and ranchers, which are the backbone of our \neconomy, will be devastated by these regulations. According to the U.S. \nSmall Business Administration's Office of Advocacy, the smallest \nbusinesses bear a 45-percent greater burden than their larger \ncompetitors.\n  The annual cost per employee for firms with fewer than 20 employees \nis over $7,000 to comply with their regulatory burden. Actions from the \nEPA are going to give foreign competitors an advantage over American \nbusinesses. While our businesses will become burdened with these new \nregulations, companies in China and India will have free rein in U.S. \nmarkets.\n  As our economy begins to recover, the last thing families and small \nbusinesses need is a backdoor energy tax that is going to raise their \ncosts across the board. Rather than imposing invasive regulations, we \nneed a responsible energy policy that focuses on making alternative \nsources of energy, such as nuclear, wind, and solar commercially \navailable. We all agree on that. That would be a balanced approach to \nan energy policy, which is what elected representatives should be \nmaking.\n  This vote is to prevent a federal bureaucracy from doing the work of \nthe elected representatives of the people. I am alarmed by this further \nattempt of the administration to circumvent congressional authority. I \nam sorry to say but this is becoming a hallmark of this administration, \nmore regulation. And if Congress does not agree, let the agencies do \nit.\n  I am dealing in the Commerce Committee right now with the FCC that is \ndoing exactly the same thing. They are going to impose net neutrality \nrules when Congress has not authorized the regulation of the Internet \nin that way. It is a pattern that is beginning to show itself and it is \nwrong for our country.\n  I am going to stand strong against cap and trade. I will certainly \noppose the audacious attempt by this administration to bypass Congress \nand implement new regulations without the authority of Congress.\n  As a solution to climate change, we need to work together to promote \nthe use of clean and renewable sources of energy. We need to work on \ncreating jobs, not tax small business to keep us from being able to \ncreate the new jobs.\n  It is important that we work together. We are the elected \nrepresentatives of the people. The EPA is not. And this is overreach. \nIf we do not stop it, who will? Who will stop bureaucracy and agencies \nthat are not authorized by Congress to take on more and more regulatory \nresponsibility that is not theirs, and that is going to cost jobs in \nour country?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The growth of government is breathtaking in this \ncountry. I urge my colleagues to think about this and support the \nMurkowski resolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, has all time expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to Senator Kerry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized \nfor 15 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, we have heard the arguments on both sides \nof this debate. But for all the discussion and all the rhetoric, the \nchoice before us is really stark and simple. This is a vote and choice \nbetween recognizing the greatest environmental risk of our time or \nlegitimizing the deniers. It is a choice between protecting the health \nof\n\n[[Page S4822]]\n\nour families and the air we breathe or continuing a pattern of \npollution that threatens our children and our communities. It is a \nchoice between getting serious about policies that will put America on \na real path to energy independence or increasing our Nation's oil \ndependency by 450 million barrels.\n  The stakes for our country are enormous. And if you have any doubt \nabout that, any doubt at all, look no further than what is happening in \nthe Gulf of Mexico even as we debate this choice. Every hour on our \ntelevision screens we are watching another tragic and costly reminder \nof the hazards of our oil addiction, all that from only a single \naccident at a single offshore oil well.\n  In April 2007, the Supreme Court for the first time issued a ruling \non the issue of climate change. The Roberts Court was asked to consider \nthe Bush administration's refusal to issue greenhouse gas standards for \ncars and trucks. The case hinged on two key issues: (1) does the Clean \nAir Act authorize regulation of greenhouse gases and (2) if so, should \nEPA set emissions standards for motor vehicles. The decision by the \nmajority in the landmark Massachusetts v. EPA case was conclusive on \nboth fronts. The justices determined that ``the harms associated with \nclimate change are serious and well recognized,'' and they firmly and \npositively identified greenhouse gas emissions as the cause of those \nharms. In light of that assessment, they found that greenhouse gases \n``fit well within the Clean Air Act's capacious definition of `air \npollutant.' '' In light of that, the justices directed EPA to fulfill \nits obligation under the Clean Air Act to determine, based on \nscientific evidence alone, whether greenhouse gas emissions from cars \nand trucks pose a threat to human health or welfare. This \n``endangerment finding'' was finalized in December of last year.\n  The resolution under consideration today, S.J. Res. 26, seeks to \noverturn this finding and permanently prohibit EPA from ever issuing a \nsimilar determination, regardless of the strength of the science and \nthe urgency of action.\n  This resolution is not based in substance or in fact. We know that \nthe threats of climate change are widespread, compelling and urgent.\n  In fact, on May 19, the National Research Council, our Nation's \nleading scientific body, declared in its most comprehensive study to \ndate that the evidence of climate change is ``overwhelming.'' They \nurged ``early, aggressive, and concerted actions to reduce emissions of \ngreenhouse gases.''\n  However, the resolution we are debating today would achieve precisely \nthe opposite goal. We are being asked to literally vote down the \nscience, squander billions of barrels of oil savings, and shirk our \nresponsibility to address the greatest energy, national security, and \nenvironmental challenge of our time.\n  By invalidating the scientific finding that greenhouse gases pose a \nthreat to human health and welfare, this resolution would remove the \nlegal basis for the landmark agreement that was reached last year to \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions from cars and trucks. According to \nthe Union of Concerned Scientists, this agreement is on track to save \nAmerican consumers a total of $34 billion and create 263,000 American \njobs in 2020. This agreement also takes a tremendous step toward energy \nindependence by reducing our oil consumption by 1.8 billion barrels. By \nremoving EPA's authority to jointly implement these regulations with \nthe Department of Transportation, this resolution comes at the very \nsteep cost of 450 million barrels, almost one quarter of these oil \nsavings.\n  And, that is just the minimum amount by which this dangerous \nresolution will increase our oil dependence. In light of President \nObama's recent announcement that the administration plans to extend the \nvehicles standards beyond 2016, the prohibition on EPA action will \neliminate significant additional opportunities in the future to reduce \nour Nation's oil consumption, increase our energy security, and draw a \nbright line between ourselves and those nations that would do us harm.\n  So why are we being asked to affirmatively reject a scientific \nfinding based on ``overwhelming evidence'' and potentially billions of \nbarrels of oil savings? Congress, we are told, needs more time to \ndevelop energy and climate legislation and the Federal Government must \nbe stopped from making any progress in the interim.\n  As someone has been meeting with my colleagues now for over a year, \nsitting down with all the stakeholders, I am struck by the irony that \nmany of the proponents of this argument are the very same people who at \nevery opportunity have avoided engaging in a serious legislative effort \nto tackle these issues. On the one hand, they say it is a job for \nCongress not the EPA, then they stand in the way of Congress doing the \njob in the first place. And they stand in the way even at a time when \nwe have brought together an unprecedented coalition of industry and \nenvironmental support for action in this Congress. If you do not want \nthe EPA to act, but you will not let Congress lead, when are we going \nto solve this challenge?\n  Here is how Ron Brownstein, one of the keenest observers of \nWashington, summed it up: ``It's reasonable to argue that Congress, not \nEPA, should decide how to regulate carbon. But most of those Senators \nwho endorsed Murkowski's resolution also oppose the most plausible \nremaining vehicle for legislating carbon limits: The comprehensive \nenergy plan that Senators John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, ID-\nConn., recently released. Together, those twin positions effectively \namount to a vote for the energy status quo.''\n  Let's not kid ourselves. The Senate has never solved a problem by \ndelaying. And on the issue of climate change, we have delayed action \ntoo long, for two decades we have stood still. We have stood still \nwhile other countries race ahead, while we lose market share in a \nglobal market, and while China and India create jobs and profits racing \nahead with technology that Americans invented.\n  Mike Splinter, the CEO of Applied Materials, crystallized our choice \nin his May 25 op-ed. He said, ``Our failure to act has consequences. \nTen years ago, the U.S. accounted for 40 percent of worldwide solar \nmanufacturing. Today that figure is less than 10 percent. Meanwhile, \nChina has gone from producing five percent of the world's solar panels \nin 2007 to nearly half last year . . . Over the next five years, China, \nIndia and Japan will out-invest the US in energy technology by at least \nthree-to-one.''\n\n  And still here we are debating the science itself, still distracted \nby campaigns to foster the idea that climate change was ``theory rather \nthan fact.'' That is the same campaign the tobacco industry waged for \ndecades, arguing that the link between cigarettes and lung cancer was \n``theory rather than fact.''\n  Well, you can delay the inevitable only so long. If you put science \non trial, as they did in the famous Scopes Monkey trial in 1925, the \ntruth will win out. And I will tell you the science on climate change \nis more definitive than ever and more troubling than ever.\n  Globally, temperatures are at an all-time high, with the first decade \nof this century conclusively establishing as the hottest decade on \nrecord. Man-made pollution is acidifying our oceans at a rate at least \n10 times faster than previously thought, creating inhospitable physical \nconditions for shell-building animals that serve as the basis of our \nocean food chain. Sea level rise is threatening cities like Boston, \nwhere city officials are actively planning for how to manage 100-year \nfloods that are now becoming 20-year floods, in the face of global sea \nlevel rise of three to six feet by 2100. Worsening drought conditions \nwill create persistent drought in the Southwest and sharply increase \nWestern wildfire burn area. And the National Academy of Sciences has \nconfirmed that these damages may be irreversible for 1,000 years.\n  Those who say we are not ready, we need more time, miss the fact that \nwe know what we have to do and we know how to do it in a way that makes \neconomic sense. We have debated bipartisan energy and climate \nlegislation in the Senate for years, beginning in earnest with the \nMcCain-Lieberman bill of 2005. The House of Representatives passed a \ncomprehensive energy and climate bill nearly 1 year ago, and the Senate \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee reported out a similar bill last \nfall. Over the last several months, Senator Lieberman and I, with the \nhelp of Senator Graham, built on these\n\n[[Page S4823]]\n\nefforts to develop the American Power Act.\n  Our legislation adopts the formula originally developed by \nRepublicans and implemented by President George H.W. Bush, that \nenvironmental goals should be achieved at the lowest possible cost to \nAmerican consumers and businesses. In fact, the nonpartisan Peterson \nInstitute for International Economics just completed the first \nindependent analysis of the American Power Act, and found that the bill \nwould generate a decade of multimillion-dollar investments, creating \n200,000 new jobs a year and reducing foreign oil imports by 40 percent. \nThe study also says that because of the strong consumer protection \nprovisions in the bill, American families will see a $35 net decrease \nin energy costs annually through 2030.\n  The Senate can and must take action this year, and the American Power \nAct provides the foundation for getting the job done. I urge my \ncolleagues who recognize the threats caused by our oil dependence to \nclose the gap between words and action and join us in passing a bill \nthis year. We have collectively kicked the can down the road long \nenough, and the Nation is less secure as a result. It is time to stand \nwith 75 percent of the American people and pass energy and climate \nlegislation that makes a meaningful and lasting difference.\n  Before I yield the floor, I would like to make one final point. While \nmany members have come to the floor today to eviscerate the EPA and \ncreate a caricature, the reality is that the Agency is taking a \nthoughtful, measured, step-wise approach to regulating greenhouse gas \nemissions. Administrator Jackson has logically committed to addressing \nthe largest sources first: new power plants or factories that emit over \n100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions, or existing plants that \nundergo significant expansions representing over 75,000 tons, and they \nwon't go into effect until over a year from now. Contrary to the wild \nclaims you have heard today, these regulations will not impact small \nbusinesses or family farmers, and will remain focused on only the \nlargest polluters for at least the next 6 years.\n  Mr. President, protecting our environment does not have to be a \npartisan issue. On the first Earth Day in 1970, more than 20 million \nAmericans, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, all turned out to \nprotest the pollution of our environment. And later that year, \nPresident Nixon signed the EPA law because Republicans recognized as \nmuch as Democrats that we had to put an end to rivers catching on fire, \nGreat Lakes dying, and air pollution so great that on some days here in \nWashington you could barely see the Capitol from Arlington Cemetery.\n  It has been 40 years since we put the EPA in charge of cleaning up \nour water and air, and its track record is indisputable. Russell Train, \nthe EPA Administrator during the Nixon and Ford administrations, \nemphasized in a recent letter opposing the Murkowski resolution that \nthe economic benefits of the Clean Air Act have exceeded its costs 10 \nto 100-fold. But the resolution under consideration today would stop \nthe EPA in its tracks, without any sort of alternative plan for \naddressing the greatest environmental threat of our time. Let's stop \nthe demonizing and get to work.\n  Today we should be debating how to craft comprehensive energy and \nclimate legislation, not how to reverse the important progress that is \nunderway. This amendment is a distraction. It is an excuse. It is time \nfor the Senate to do what this institution was meant to do, and provide \nleadership on an issue that is crying out for it.\n  I have been listening carefully to a whole bunch of our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle come to the floor and talk about what this \nis not about. Every single one of them has laid out a rationale for \ndoing away with something as if it were a regulation. They come to the \nfloor and, frankly, there have been very few facts here, because I keep \nhearing about the tailoring rule of the EPA, that does not take effect \nuntil 2016, which lays out a whole process by which we normally do \nthings.\n  But we keep hearing our folks on the other side of the aisle say this \nis not something that Congress intended, or this is not something we \nshould leave to the bureaucracy. Neither could be further from the \ntruth.\n  We created the law on which this is based. The Congress passed the \nClean Air Act, and the Supreme Court of the United States, not a \nbureaucracy, made a fundamental health finding decision that, in fact, \nglobal climate change is happening, and that the pollutants of \ngreenhouse gases are, in fact, included in what the Clean Air Act \nenvisioned.\n  The Supreme Court has dictated this policy, and they dictated it as a \nmatter of health, not as a matter of some bureaucratic rule. We do not \nhave a rule in front of us right now. We have a process by which the \nEPA is going to go through, determine what they may or may not do.\n  I heard my colleague from South Dakota come to the floor and say: \nWell, all we are trying to do is delay this so Congress can act. This \nis going to be the great hypocrisy test resolution. We are going to see \nhow many of those folks who are here on the floor saying: We need to \nleave it to Congress, how many of them are actually going to show up \nand vote to do what we need to do in order to change things. How many \nof them are going to be on the front lines trying to, in fact, make the \nthings happen that have to happen in order to restrain greenhouse \ngases?\n  We heard him say: We are just delaying this. No, they are not just \ndelaying it. That is not true. Because under the Administrative rule \nact, when you reject a resolution, have a resolution of rejection, as \nthis is, you are specifically not allowed to come back with the rule or \nanything like it.\n  Let me read specifically from there. It says:\n\n       A rule shall not take effect if the Congress enacts a joint \n     resolution of disapproval.\n\n  That is what this is.\n\n       (2) A rule that does not take effect under paragraph 1 may \n     not be reissued in substantially the same form, and the new \n     rule that is substantially the same as such rule may not be \n     issued.\n\n  There it is, plain and simple, folks. That is what is happening here. \nThis is an effort to permanently prevent the EPA from ever taking up \nthe question of greenhouse gases and their right to restrain them.\n  Let me read exactly what the Supreme Court said. This is the Supreme \nCourt. And let me put a little politics history behind this. In 1999, \nunder the Bush administration, the first Bush administration, they did \nnot want to do this, for all of the same reasons people do not want to \ndo it now. So people went to court to get them to do what they are \nsupposed to do in the public interest. But it was challenged. It went \nall the way to the Supreme Court, and here is what the Supreme Court of \nthe United States said. Greenhouse gases ``fit well within the Clean \nAir Act's capacious definition of air pollutant.''\n  So the Supreme Court of the United States, not a bureaucracy, found \nthat the intent of Congress was properly being fulfilled in the effort \nto restrain greenhouse gases. What Senator Murkowski and colleagues are \ntrying to do here is undermine the health finding. This, in fact, is \nrepresented by the Supreme Court.\n  The Court found that climate science has already indicated that \nrising levels of greenhouse gases were warming and harming the Earth. \nThey go through that reasoning. The Court then said they reviewed the \nhistory of the Clean Air Act and found that in 1970, Congress added a \nbroad definition of ``welfare,'' including ``effects on climate.''\n  Finally, the Court found that the Clean Air Act's sweeping definition \nof ``air pollutant'' unambiguously includes greenhouse gases. That is \nwhy we are here today.\n  What our colleagues are trying to do is prevent this from happening. \nThey are repealing an entire health finding.\n  It is kind of interesting. Look at the people who represent health in \nthe United States: the American Academy of Pediatrics, Children's \nEnvironmental Health Network, American Nurses Association, American \nLung Association, American Public Health Association, National \nAssociation of County and City Health Officials, Trust for America's \nHealth, Physicians for Social Responsibility, National Environment \nHealth Association, American College of Preventative Medicine, and on \nit goes. All of them are opposed to what Senator Murkowski is doing \nbecause it does not represent the health interests of the country.\n\n[[Page S4824]]\n\n  We have heard a lot of arguments, but for all the discussion and \nrhetoric, the choice before us is stark and simple. This is not a \nsimple delay. This is brought to us by some of the same people who have \nresisted doing anything about many of these things for ages. Why is it \nthat the United States is more dependent today on foreign oil than we \nwere before September 11? It is because we haven't done anything to \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. We have an opportunity to do it \nnow. This is about that.\n  The same people have resisted changes through the years--resisted \nCAFE standards, resisted changing where and how we produce oil, a long \nlist of things that have been prevented from happening. The American \npeople today are paying $100 million a day to Ahmadinejad and Iran in \norder to buy oil because we haven't reduced it.\n  The option is whether we are going to get serious about those other \nthings. This is a vote between whether we recognize the greatest \nenvironmental risk of our time or whether we legitimize deniers of \nthat. It is a choice between protecting the health of our families and \nthe air we breathe or whether we continue a pattern of pollution that \nthreatens our children and communities. That is what the EPA was set up \nto protect. It has protected that through the years. This is a question \nof whether we are going to get serious about policies that will put \nAmerica on a path to energy independence or increase our Nation's oil \ndependence by another 450 million barrels.\n  The stakes for our country are enormous. If Members have any doubt \nabout that, every day on television everybody is seeing what is \nhappening in the gulf, the result of one single accident, one single \noffshore oil well.\n  In April of 2007, the Supreme Court, for the first time, issued a \nruling on the issue of climate change. Some people don't like it. The \nRoberts Court was asked to consider the Bush administration's refusal \nto issue greenhouse gas standards for cars and trucks. The case hinged \non just two things: Does the Clean Air Act authorize the regulation of \ngreenhouse gases, and, if so, should the EPA set emission standards for \nmotor vehicles?\n  The decision by the majority was conclusive on both fronts. In light \nof that, the Justices directed the EPA to fulfill its obligation under \nthe Clean Air Act to determine--I emphasize--based on scientific \nevidence whether greenhouse gas emissions for cars and trucks pose a \nthreat to human health.\n  On May 19, the National Research Council, which is our Nation's \nleading scientific body, declared in its most comprehensive study to \ndate that the evidence of climate change is overwhelming. They urged \nearly, aggressive, and concerted actions to reduce emissions of \ngreenhouse gases. The resolution we are debating today would achieve \nabsolutely the opposite goal. We are being asked to vote down the \nscience, to squander billions of barrels of oil savings, and shirk our \nresponsibility to address the greatest national security and \nenvironmental challenge of our time.\n  Some may say, no; they are just trying to restrict the bureaucrats \nfrom doing this. Everybody understands what this battle is all about. \nBy invalidating the fundamental scientific finding that greenhouse \ngases, in fact, pose a threat to human health and welfare, this \nresolution would remove the legal basis, the legal foundation for the \nagreement that was reached last year to regulate greenhouse gas \nemissions from cars and trucks.\n  According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, this agreement, the \nagreement to which I am referring, is on track to save American \nconsumers a total of $34 billion and to create 263,000 American jobs in \n2020. The agreement also takes a huge step forward toward energy \nindependence by reducing our oil consumption by 1.8 billion barrels. If \nwe remove the EPA's authority to jointly implement those regulations \nwith the Department of Transportation, then we lose the foundation for \nproceeding forward with that benefit. That is the minimum amount by \nwhich this resolution would increase our oil dependence.\n  In light of President Obama's recent announcement that the \nadministration plans to extend the vehicle standards beyond 2016, the \nprohibition on the EPA action would eliminate significant additional \nopportunities in the future to reduce our Nation's oil consumption, \nincrease our energy security, and draw a bright line between ourselves \nand those nations that want to do us harm.\n  Why are we being asked to affirmatively reject a scientific finding \nthat has been based on overwhelming evidence, and why would we be asked \nto reject potentially billions of barrels of oil savings? We are told \nCongress needs more time to develop energy and climate legislation. The \nFederal Government has to be stopped from making progress in the \ninterim.\n  I have been meeting with my colleagues now for over a year at least, \nover 20 years that I have been working on this issue. The distinguished \nchairwoman of the Environment and Public Works Committee, similarly, \nand others, have been at this for a long time. I am struck by the irony \nthat many of the proponents of this argument are the very same people \nwho, at every opportunity, have avoided engaging in a serious \nlegislative effort to try to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or deal \nwith climate change.\n  On the one hand they say it is the job of Congress, not the EPA. Then \nthey stand in the way of Congress doing its job in the first place. \nThey stand in the way even at a time when we have built an \nunprecedented coalition of industry--the faith-based community, the \nnational security community, businesses small and large, \nenvironmentalists, all of whom believe we now have a method by which we \ncan grow jobs in our country, increase energy independence, and reduce \npollution all at the same time.\n  Let me share with colleagues what Ron Brownstein, one of the keenest \nobservers of Washington, summed up in writing the following:\n\n       It's reasonable to argue that Congress, not EPA, should \n     decide how to regulate carbon. But most of those Senators who \n     endorsed Murkowski's resolution also opposed the most \n     plausible remaining vehicle for legislating carbon limits.\n\n  I want to make sure we understand something as we do this. A lot of \npeople have come to the Senate floor to eviscerate the EPA and create a \ncaricature of that Agency, when that Agency, frankly, is taking a \nthoughtful, measured, stepwise approach to regulate greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n  Administrator Jackson has said she is committed to addressing the \nlargest sources first, new powerplants or factories emitting more than \n100,000 tons of greenhouse gas emissions, and then going to those over \n75,000 tons. None of that will even go into effect until a year from \nnow through the normal administrative public process that we have set \nup for our agencies to represent us.\n  It is astonishing to me that this has become a partisan issue. In \n1970, 20 million Americans came out of their homes to march in the \nstreets because they saw the Cuyahoga River in Ohio light on fire. They \nwanted to stop the pollution. We passed the Clean Air Act, Clean Water \nAct, Safe Drinking Water Act, marine mammal protection, coastal zone \nmanagement. The history of the implementation of those acts has been to \nclean up rivers, clean up lakes, and see fish swim again where they \ndidn't, to be caught again by kids who go fishing with their parents. \nWe brought that back. Now we are trying to undermine the ability to \ncontinue that job, to make the health and welfare of our citizens \nbetter, and to lead the world with respect to these technologies. The \nUnited States is not leading in one of these technologies today. It is \ntime for us to understand, we need to get our act together.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kerry. We now turn to \nSenator Lieberman for 5 minutes, followed by Senator Merkley for 5 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Boxer for her \nleadership in this matter.\n  I rise to oppose the resolution offered by my friend from Alaska, and \nshe is my friend. I rise to say that I think, though I oppose the \nresolution, that debate on the resolution has clarified the choices \nMembers of the Senate have on this matter. I think it has illuminated \nthe scientific consensus, and\n\n[[Page S4825]]\n\nin the end, the defeat of this resolution, which I hope for and \nsupport, will actually increase momentum to adopt comprehensive energy \nand climate legislation this year which is the real alternative to \nexecutive action by EPA next January.\n  I know several of my colleagues have argued today that this \nresolution is about stopping EPA from regulating greenhouse gas \nemissions and preserving that role for Congress. But the resolution \ndoes, of course, much more than just offer an opinion about who should \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions. It rejects EPA's finding that ``six \ngreenhouse gases taken in combination endanger both the public health \nand the public welfare of current and future generations'' of \nAmericans. It would also prevent EPA from reaching a similar conclusion \nin the future.\n  To me, that means this resolution looks an awful lot like an attempt \nto impose political judgments on scientific judgments. That is wrong.\n  There has been a lot of talk over the years of basing what we do on \nsound science. This resolution would lead us in exactly the opposite \ndirection. Should the resolution become law, Congress would in effect \nbe saying EPA was wrong when it reached its conclusion that global \nwarming emissions harmed public health. Since that finding was the \nbasis for EPA's tailpipe emissions standards, the Murkowski resolution \nwould send EPA back to the drawing board on those rules, which are \nbroadly supported by the business and environmental communities and \nsignificantly increase both our dependence on foreign oil and air \npollution.\n  Regardless of whether my colleagues believe Congress or the EPA \nshould determine our national strategy for addressing the threat of \nglobal warming, I hope they can agree that unchecked carbon dioxide \nemissions endanger human health and welfare. Frankly, I thought that \ndebate was over. Climate change is happening. The science is \nconvincing. The current pattern of energy consumption is just making a \nbad problem worse. It is time to move past the debate about climate \nscience and engage in an honest, productive, bipartisan conversation \nabout what we can do as a nation, as a people privileged to be leaders \nof this Nation, to combat the problem, the challenge that science tells \nus is happening.\n  The solution we come up with can and will create good jobs. It can \nand will ensure our role as a leader in the global clean energy \neconomy. It can and will safeguard our national security by \nsafeguarding our energy security. Last month, Senator Kerry and I \npresented the American Power Act, which I think achieves all of those \ngoals I have stated and more. It is the product of months of \ndiscussions with Republicans and Democrats, the business community, and \nthe environmental community. Together I think we came up with an \ninnovative approach to addressing both our energy and climate \nchallenges. It enjoys broader support than any similar proposal I have \never been involved in from the business and environmental communities. \nIt is a coming together of the work of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee under Chairman Boxer and the Energy Committee under Chairman \nBingaman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I would say, finally, there is a path forward that \nallows Congress to act but does not reject the science of climate \nchange. That path forward is a ``no'' vote on the resolution and a \n``yes'' vote on comprehensive energy and climate legislation like the \nAmerican Power Act.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before we hear from Senator Merkley, I \nwant to note that immediately following him, Senator Bingaman will have \n5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, today I rise in opposition to the \nresolution before us from my colleague from Alaska.\n  Since 1970, the Environmental Protection Agency has been charged with \nresponding to and identifying threats to our atmosphere, threats that \naffect public health, threats that affect weather, threats that affect \nclimate.\n  During this time, the EPA has identified and responded to many \nthreats: sulfur dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; mercury, a potent \nneurotoxin; lead, lead that was poisoning the air our children breathed \nand affecting their mental development. In each of these cases, we had \na force that said: We must respond.\n  Now, today, we have before us a resolution which says: It does not \nmatter that our public health is being affected. We are going to \noverturn the finding. We are going to call the science invalid. We are \ngoing to say politics, not science, should be the foundation of our \npolicy.\n  This, of course, is the attitude that was put forward year after year \nduring the Bush administration: Take the scientific papers and shred \nthem. Take the scientists and set their views aside. Today, we have a \ncontinuation of that Bush strategy of burying science. It is the wrong \nfoundation for public policy to bury science. We should take and \nrespond responsibly.\n  We have now before us a finding that was developed actually by the \nscientists in the Bush administration. You might recall, it was the \nBush administration scientists who first developed the finding related \nto changing the atmosphere with the global warming gases of methane and \ncarbon dioxide and other gases that are changing the chemistry of the \nenvironment, and that we have to respond to protect the health of our \ncitizens--a straightforward concept, supported by the scientists of the \nlast administration and by the scientists of this administration.\n  Not only that, but we are proposing in this resolution to undo the \ntailpipe emissions rules that reduce our demand on foreign oil. This \nresolution will increase our demand for foreign oil by 455 million \nbarrels per year. That is a lot. Let me translate that. That is not \nequivalent to the amount of gasoline to drive around the Equator once. \nNo. That is not equal to the amount of gas to drive around the Equator \n10 times. Not at all. It is not even equal to the amount of gas to \ndrive around the Equator 1,000 times. This is an increase in our \ndependence on foreign oil equal to the amount of gasoline that would \npropel a car around the Equator 10 million times.\n  This means far more money in the hands of foreign governments that do \nnot share our national interests. This means a compromised national \nsecurity. This means a lot of additional carbon dioxide being put into \nthe air. And this means a lot more harm to the citizens of the United \nStates.\n  Burying science is wrong. This resolution that challenges our \nnational security, diminishes our economy, and threatens the atmosphere \nand our public health is also wrong. It must be defeated in this \nChamber.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I will vote ``no'' on the Murkowski \nresolution of disapproval. Senator Murkowski and I have worked together \non a comprehensive energy bill this Congress and also on a cap-and-\ntrade bill in the last Congress. She has been very consistent in her \nview that we need to act on the issue of global warming but that we \nneed to be sensitive to the impacts of such legislation on our economy.\n  I appreciate the concerns she has voiced with respect to the need to \nprotect industry from onerous regulation. I firmly believe those views \nare sincere. I disagree, however, with the substance of this \nresolution, in that, regardless of overall intent, it is asking \nCongress to overturn a scientific finding made by some of our best \nscientists. In my view, the EPA should not be prevented from continuing \nits work to reduce greenhouse gas emissions until Congress is able to \nprescribe a more permanent fix.\n  For the past several Congresses, we in Congress have been engaged in \na dialog on how best to provide a permanent fix. There have been many \nbills introduced on the topic. We have had several votes on specific \nlegislation. Each time, though, we have fallen short of actually \nenacting legislation. Now, as a result of the Supreme Court ruling, we \nare in a situation where the EPA is required by law to take action to \nregulate greenhouse gas emissions.\n  There is a near universal agreement among Members of the Senate that \nit\n\n[[Page S4826]]\n\nwould be better for Congress, rather than the EPA, to take action and \nto prescribe the means of regulating greenhouse gases. Congress has the \nability to consider the whole economy and the global scope of the \nproblem in a way that is not available to the Administrator of the EPA \nunder the Clean Air Act. Congress can design and enact policy that \nwould be mindful of the wide range of stakeholders and minimize its \neconomic impacts, and ensure a smooth transition to a clean energy \neconomy.\n  I continue to support action by the Congress to regulate greenhouse \ngases instead of direct regulation by the EPA under the Clean Air Act. \nHowever, the resolution before us is not about whether the EPA should \nbe regulating greenhouse gases or how they should go about it. We are, \ninstead, being asked to vote on whether the EPA was correct in its \nfinding that ``current and increasing levels of greenhouse gases \nthreaten the public health and welfare of current and future \ngenerations.''\n  Frankly, there is nothing controversial in this fundamental \nscientific finding. It has survived intense scrutiny by thousands of \nscientists and interested parties the world over in the past decades. \nJust last month, in a report delivered by the National Academies of \nScience at the request of Congress, this finding was further supported \nby our Nation's top scientists. So this vote would amount to a \ncongressional rejection of the most basic findings of climate science, \nand how we vote today will be looked on by many, including the \ninternational community, as they evaluate America's commitment to \naddress this global problem.\n  Finally, I have reviewed the EPA's actions on greenhouse gas \nemissions and their recent tailoring rule that would ensure that only \nthe very largest sources would be subject to any kind of regulation. Of \nthese very large sources, only those that are new or are pursuing major \nmodifications will be required to implement new control technologies.\n  As EPA considers what technologies must be implemented, the economic \nviability of the technology is taken into account as well. I believe it \nis important that EPA continue with its work and that we in Congress \nget on with taking the steps we need to take. For these reasons, I urge \na ``no'' vote on this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I am assuming that time on the \nDemocratic side has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time has expired.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I thank the Chair.\n  At this time, in our remaining 30 minutes, it shall be allocated as \nfollows: Senator Coburn for 5 minutes, Senator Rockefeller for 10 \nminutes, followed by Senator McCain for 5 minutes, and then I will \nconclude with 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have listened to a great deal of the \ndebate. I have heard it claimed that the EPA has scientists; that none \nof us are--except that is not accurate. There are about four or five \ntrained scientists in the Senate, and I happen to be one of them. But \nthe whole predicate that we heard from the Senator from Massachusetts \nwas: The basis was the Supreme Court. They are certainly not \nscientists.\n  The other thing I would reject is what the Senator from New Mexico \nsaid. As a scientist--and if you read the minority opinions on all the \nreports they have cited--this is not settled science. Even if it were, \nthis is one Senator who would say this is not the time to do this. Our \neconomy is still on its back, and it is going to be that way for the \nnext 4 years. We have massive problems in front of us. And we are going \nto add a ruling--not a congressional ruling, a bureaucratic ruling--\nthat is going to kill jobs, that is going to increase the cost of \neverything we produce in this country because it all starts with \nenergy. It is going to mandate changes in behavior that will affect \nevery family in this country. So even if it were absolutely true, I \nwould tell you we should not be doing it now.\n  The second thing is to say that the EPA is going to do this. Do you \nrealize the EPA cannot even train 250,000 contractors for lead paint? \nThey blew it. They totally blew it. They were incompetent, and, \nconsequently, we have hundreds of thousands of people who today still \nare not working on older homes because of the EPA's incompetence.\n  So for us to claim we have to do this now, and we should not reject \nthis now, is like cutting off our nose to spite our face. No matter \nwhat anybody says, it is going to have a major impact on our economy at \nthe time when we cannot afford to have another negative drag on our \neconomy.\n  Even if it is true--it is not; but even if it is--it would be stupid \nfor us to do this now, especially when the rest of the world is not \ncoming along at all and the footprint we might minimize will not have \nany impact on the health of Americans. So we are going to have a \ncertain amount of CO2 no matter what because the Chinese \ncertainly are not doing it, the Indians certainly are not doing it, and \nthey are building one smokestack a day in China right now.\n  So for us to take this action--in light of the incompetency at the \nEPA, in light of our economic situation we find ourselves in--I find it \nhighly ironic, even if it is the right thing to do, now is not the \nright time to do it, given the place where we find ourselves \neconomically in this country.\n  Then, finally, I have been in this body for 5 years, and I have \nheard, time and time again, the people opposing this motion to disagree \ncomplain about an administration taking away our rightful legislative \nduty. This is not something that should come from a bureaucracy. This \nhas way too big of an impact.\n  If we cannot get it through Congress, it should not happen. That is \nwhat our country is set up on. Instead, by default, we are going to \nallow a bureaucracy to take over what we are supposed to be doing? The \nway this country works is, if we do not do it, it should not be \nhappening because there is not a consensus in the body to get a clean \nenergy program out of the Senate. So you cannot have it both ways. You \ncannot complain about it when you are seeing it in things you like and \nnot complain about it when it is things you do not like.\n  I will finish with this one point: We better be very careful in this \nbody about what we are doing. We are playing with the future of 200 \nmillion Americans that is extremely precarious at this point in time \nfrom an economic standpoint. We can claim all the long-term negative \nhealth consequences, but as a physician, if you do not have an economy \nor you have an economy that crumbles, no matter what you have done on \nthat, you have not helped anybody.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I yield back and thank the Senator from \nAlaska for the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from West Virginia is recognized \nfor 10 minutes.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n  I rise today to lend my support to the Murkowski Resolution of \nDisapproval for one simple but enormously important reason: because I \nbelieve we must send this strong and urgent message that the fate of \nour economy, our manufacturing industries, and our workers, including \nour coal workers, should never be placed solely in the hands of the \nfederal Environmental Protection Agency. I have long maintained this in \nCongress. I have been around here for a while. I was a Governor for 8 \nyears. I think the elected people, and not the unelected EPA, have a \nconstitutional responsibility here and on an issue which is so totally \nimportant. We are accountable to those people.\n\n  Some here seem to talk about other aspects of this. I tend to focus, \nas a VISTA volunteer who went to West Virginia and lived among coal \nminers, on people and all the problems, including the problem of \nclimate change, that attend to their future.\n  I am not here to deny or bicker fruitlessly about the science, as \nsome would suggest. In fact, I would suggest that I think the science \nis correct. However, it doesn't one iota deter from my support of the \nMurkowski resolution.\n  I care deeply about this Earth and resent anybody who suggests \notherwise about either me or the people of my State. I care about the \nfundamental human commitment--the higher calling we all have--to be a \nsteward.\n\n[[Page S4827]]\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions are not healthy for the Earth or her people, \nand we must take significant action to reduce them. We must develop and \ndeploy clean energy, period. I accept all of that. But EPA regulation \nis not the answer. EPA has little or no authority to address economic \nneeds. They say they do, but they don't. They have no ability to \nincentivize and deploy new technologies. They have no obligation to \nprotect the hard-working people I represent with deep and abiding \npassion--people who changed my life. I was born anew in the coalfields \nof West Virginia at the age of 26. So I fight for my people. I \nunderstand I am a Senator, but I am a Senator from West Virginia, and I \nhave a right to fight for them, and I do, and I support Senator \nMurkowski's amendment because of that. Their jobs matter. Their people, \ntheir work matters. Their lives matter. Any regulatory solution that \ncreates more problems than it fixes and causes more harm than good in \nthe real lives of real people, if they are affected badly, is no \nsolution at all. I won't accept it. It is not something I will be a \npart of.\n  We are capable of tackling this great challenge in a way that \nsupports rather than undermines our economy and our future. But the \nprocess has to work. It has to be open. It has to be not the property \nof a couple of people, but it has to be something the Congress comes to \nunderstand. I have always felt that if you went to more than 10 percent \nof the Congress, House and Senate, and asked them to explain what cap \nand trade means, they would have no idea. That was one of our problems \nwith the health bill. It is fairly important that people understand \nwhat it means on this bill--not on this bill but the bill that is being \ntalked about.\n  I am willing to work with people on a solution, but it has to be \nlegislative because on this, above all, the Congress must decide. I \ndon't care about the Supreme Court. I don't care about EPA in the sense \nof them being the final voice on the future of my people in the State \nthat has some of the most carbon of any in the country. I know people \nlaugh at coal. We don't. You can't run this country without coal. I am \nfor all alternative fuels, even nuclear, to my surprise. I am for all \nof them. But when you add them all up, nobody can make the point that \nyou can do any of this without coal. Does it have to be cleaner? \nAbsolutely. Is there any excuse for not making it cleaner? No, there is \nnot. But you can take 90 to 95 percent of the carbon out of it. That is \na solution for our people, and we mine coal. We mine coal and send it \nto the States of people who are drawing up this bill. I just wish they \nknew us a little better.\n  I asked Administrator Jackson to clarify the EPA timetable as well as \nthe impact of EPA regulations on industrial facilities. She responded \nquickly to my letter. She was nice about it. She showed some \nwillingness to set a timetable, moved it up about a year, and I \nappreciate that. But she also made clear that the EPA's regulations \nwill go forward regardless of whether Congress has acted on a \ncomprehensive energy policy and regardless of whether Congress has \ngiven the EPA a direction in law about how and when and upon whom those \nregulations should be imposed.\n  So I introduced my own legislation to suspend EPA action for 2 years. \nIt is a little different from the Murkowski legislation, but it makes \nthe same point. The EPA can't decide. We have to. Some can ridicule \nthat. I don't. I am elected to protect my people and my country, but \nfirst comes my people and especially on this issue.\n  I support legislation to prevent any future catastrophe like the oil \nspill, which is, to my mind, a totally separate issue and has no \nbusiness being discussed at the same time this is being discussed. I \nalso support legislation to advance new clean energy and clean coal \ntechnologies.\n  West Virginia is poised to lead a major part in the effort on clean \ntechnology because we know energy. We have lived with it for the last \n150 years. We know coal. We know natural gas. We are coming to know CCS \nas few others do. It is a triumph when one of our power plants reduces \n90 percent of the carbon emissions from the flue stream that it treats. \nThat is a triumph to us--maybe to nobody else, but to us it is because \nit happened and it came from the stimulus package and we were a part of \nthat.\n  The fact is, we in West Virginia know and embrace what too many \nothers either don't understand or will not choose to see, which is that \nour Nation is dependent on coal for more than 50 percent of its \nelectricity today, and nothing is going to change that fact. All the \nrenewables in the world will not change that fact.\n  So I close. Even if the country achieves maximum success for all of \nthe new ideas on the table for new green energy, our American quality \nof life and the rapid rise of energy needs around the globe will drive \nthe same or greater need for coal for many generations to come. So we \nbetter do coal correctly. It is going to be coal that solves it.\n  Coal mining is hard. It is dangerous. Most people have never been \ndown a mine. A few people who have discussed this don't know what they \ntalk about when they talk about it. And it is not the fault of a coal \nminer. He just mines or she mines the coal that is out there. That has \nto be handled at the stationary source.\n  I don't want EPA making all those rules. I don't want EPA turning out \nthe lights on America. As I said, coal can be cleaner. But the \nresponsibility for putting in place laws and policies that spur new \ntechnologies and new ideas and the responsibility for any major energy \nand environmental policy change lies not with the Federal regulatory \nagency acting in isolation--I don't even know where EPA is located--but \nwith the Congress, with the people who are elected--us--to be included \nin a process which has not been well managed to do the right thing.\n  I proudly support the Murkowski resolution, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am here to speak on the Murkowski \nresolution before us.\n  The American people deserve to fully understand what this vote is \nreally about and what is at stake for them if Congress fails to prevent \nEPA from unilaterally imposing massive regulations that will damage our \neconomy and destroy jobs.\n  I wish to be clear to my colleagues and to the American people. This \nvote is not about the science of climate change. It is not about \nwhether Congress should or should not create policies to limit carbon \nemissions. It is not about protecting oil companies or, as the White \nHouse has absurdly claimed, the oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico. What \nthis resolution is really about is whether the American people, through \ntheir elected representatives, get a say in our Nation's energy policy \nthrough their elected representatives or if they will be bound by the \nwhims of the unelected bureaucrats at the Environmental Protection \nAgency. More importantly, it is about protecting the American people \nfrom a crippling backdoor energy tax that we, and small businesses and \nlarge, cannot afford.\n  I wish I could provide my colleagues and the American people with a \ndetailed assessment of the impact EPA's proposed regulations would have \non our economy, but the EPA has refused to provide Congress a \ncomprehensive analysis of the potential economic impact. To paraphrase \nSpeaker Pelosi's comment that we have to pass ObamaCare so we can find \nout what is in it, I guess EPA will need to impose new regulations on 6 \nmillion buildings, facilities, farms, and other ``stationary sources'' \nbefore we find out how much it will cost or what impact it will have on \nthe economy.\n\n  There is one thing we can all agree on: Allowing the EPA to be turned \nloose on the American people is a terrible idea that will be extremely \nexpensive. A spokesman from the Edison Electric Institute, which, to \ntheir shame, supports congressional efforts to pass a cap-and-trade \nbill, stated that the only certainty is that EPA regulations to limit \ncarbon emissions would be far more expensive than if done by Congress.\n  Let's not forget what we now know about the legislation that was \npassed in the other body. That would cost families upwards--every \nfamily--of $1,000 a year. In fact, the Office of Management and Budget \nwarned that:\n\n       Making the decision to regulate CO2 under the \n     Clean Air Act for the first time is likely to have serious \n     economic consequences for\n\n[[Page S4828]]\n\n     regulated entities throughout the U.S. economy, including \n     small business and small communities.\n\n  Even some bureaucrats at the EPA must have realized how crippling \nthese regulations would be to small businesses and farmers, which is \nwhy they proposed a tailoring rule to delay the effect these \nregulations would have on the American public. Unfortunately for the \nAmerican people, the tailoring rule stands on shaky legal ground.\n  This is really an Orwellian kind of experience. Demonstrating an \nunparalleled disregard for congressional intent, the EPA is attempting \nto make a case that Congress intended to regulate greenhouse gas \nemissions under the Clean Air Act, even though greenhouse gas emissions \nwere not formally addressed by the act. Conversely, EPA claims that the \ntons-per-year threshold set by Congress in the Clean Air Act should not \napply to greenhouse gases. In simpler terms, EPA believes that although \nCongress didn't cover greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, it \nreally did, and although Congress set thresholds for covered \npollutants, it really didn't.\n  Finally, for those who claim this is somehow about protecting oil \ncompanies, I suggest we listen to what over 425 companies and \norganizations are saying about these regulations. Small business men \nand women across the country are telling us that EPA's proposed \ngreenhouse gas requirements will stifle economic growth and \ndisadvantage them in the global marketplace. I suggest we listen.\n  So here we are. Here we are. Last Tuesday, we had a vote where people \nturned out in massive numbers against what is going on in Washington. \nThey believe their Constitution is being taken away from them. They \nbelieve they no longer have a voice in what we do here. What this EPA \ndecision would do is deprive the Congress, our Nation's elected \nrepresentatives, of a role in profound decisions that would have \ntremendous effects on the economy of this country.\n  I strongly suggest that no matter how you stand on the issue of \ngreenhouse gas emissions or climate change, you reject this government, \nunelected bureaucrat takeover of a significant portion of the U.S. \neconomy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. How much time remains on the Republican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, as we conclude the day's debate on this \nresolution of disapproval, I will say that the debate has been good. \nMany points have been raised, and I appreciate that. I will say, \nthough, as I have listened throughout the course of the 6 hours, I have \nheard consistently on the side of those who support this resolution of \ndisapproval--I have heard consistently that this is about jobs, it is \nabout the health of our economy, it is about the strength of the \neconomy as a whole and about really ensuring, again, that our Nation \nremains strong while at the same time we take care of our environment. \nThese are not mutually exclusive goals--never have been and never will \nbe.\n  I want to address some of the statements that have been made here and \nmade very clearly.\n  First is the issue of overreach--overreach by the EPA into the domain \nof the legislative branch. This has been spoken to so many times as we \nhave discussed this resolution of disapproval--that the overlapping \ntriggers that are contained in the Clean Air Act effectively give the \nEPA control of our Nation's energy and climate policy. I do not think \nthat is a sane and rational policy when we cede our authority in the \nlegislative branch to effectively allow our energy and climate policy \nto be developed and implemented by an agency, that being the EPA. This \nhas huge implications for the separation of powers and our \nconstitutional system of checks and balances, not to mention what I \nsaid at the outset--the jobs and the recovery from this economic \nrecession.\n  This is not a debate about the science. Science has been discussed a \nlot. Really, this is about how we respond to the science. We are not \nhere to decide whether greenhouse gas emissions should be reduced. We \nare here to decide if we are going to allow them to be reduced under \nthe structures of the Clean Air Act. Unlike what some of my colleagues \nhave said, this resolution doesn't gut the Clean Air Act at all. It \ndoesn't address it. It does not change the text in any way. It only \nprevents a massive expansion of its authority.\n  It has been suggested that somehow or other this resolution is a \nbailout; somehow or other this is tied to the disaster in the gulf; \nsomehow or other this is all tied to the oil industry. Again, this is \nabsolutely not anything that has to do with the disaster in the gulf, \nin no way, shape, or form.\n  The suggestions that somehow or other this is all about big oil \nbelies the coalition of support that has been built across this \ncountry, from Maine to Alaska and all the points in between--530 \norganizations, different stakeholders all over the board, in terms of \nwhy they feel EPA should not be setting climate policy for this \ncountry.\n  You cannot see this chart because the print is so small. I apologize \nfor that. But there are 530 organizations, businesses, stakeholders, \nand advocacy groups that have endorsed this bipartisan resolution. So \nyou look through here and you say: OK, are these all the oil and gas \norganizations that are in this country? But I will just direct you to \nsome of the ones from, for instance, Texas. Texas is an oil- and gas-\nproducing State.\n  Look at Texas. There is the Texas Agricultural Cooperative Council, \nthe Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, Texas Aromatics, \nTexas Association of Agricultural Consultants, Texas Association of \nDairymen, Texas Cattle Feeders Association, Texas Citrus Mutual, Texas \nCotton Ginners' Association, Texas Independent Ginners Association, \nTexas Food Processers Association, Texas Forestry Association, Grain \nand Feeders Association, Nursery and Landscape Association--and I am \nonly halfway through the Texas organizations that support our \nresolution of disapproval.\n  So the suggestion that somehow this is all tied into the oil \nindustry, again, just simply does not comport with what has been \nhappening. Why are these organizations standing up and speaking out and \nsaying this is not the path we should be taking with climate? It goes \nback to the jobs. It goes back to the issue of where we are as an \neconomy. It goes back to the level of bureaucratic overlay that will be \nimposed on the California Citrus Mutual or the California Cotton \nGrowers Association or the Carpet and Rug Institute or the pizza \ncompany from Ohio.\n  This is absolutely about how we as a Nation determine those policies \nthat will, in fact, allow us to have the clean air we all want. But we \ncan achieve those goals in a way that isn't going to kick our timing in \nthe head. Who can do that? Is it the EPA, whose mission is solely and \nexclusively that we have to follow the letter of the law here? The \nletter of the law says to not only go after the big polluters but all \nthe way down to the small emitters, which emit 250 tons of carbon per \nyear. And every effort EPA may want to make in terms of tailoring, all \nit is going to take is one lawsuit that challenges that tailoring to \ninject the uncertainty back into the market, back into the business \nplace. So once again we have an economy that just can not get back on \nits feet.\n  This is not a referendum on any other bill that is pending in \nCongress, but it is a check on EPA's regulatory ambition. It presents \nan opportunity for us to stop the worst option for regulating \ngreenhouse gases from moving forward, while we work on a more \nresponsible solution.\n  I want to take a moment to thank my colleague from West Virginia, who \nspoke very passionately about why he supports this resolution--because \nof the people he represents. I ask all of us to look to the people we \nrepresent. Look at your small businesses, your farmers, your ranchers, \nyour pizza manufacturers. Look to them. Look to the health of their \nfamilies and their communities.\n  I have a packet here that outlines the broad support for this \nresolution among the Alaska stakeholders. It is everything from our \nAlaska State Legislature to our Governor, our seafood processors, our \nsmall business refiners, those who are trying to get an Alaska gas line \nin place, our native corporations, the assembly from Anchorage,\n\n[[Page S4829]]\n\nletters from local mayors. I am listening to what the people of Alaska \nare saying. They are making very clear that they want to ensure that \nwhen we develop climate policy, the ``we'' is ``we the people,'' we the \nelected Members of Congress, and not those unelected bureaucrats within \nan agency who will not only develop that policy but then in turn \nimplement that policy. The Alaskans I am hearing from are saying: Make \nsure that as we as a State try to build our economy, we can do so in a \nmanner that allows us time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is up.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nremaining time on our side be divided as follows: myself, 2 minutes; \nSenator Udall of Colorado, 5 minutes; Senator Lautenberg, 5 minutes; \nand Senator Boxer for the remainder of the time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, this debate is not about the overreach of \nan agency because indeed this Congress charged EPA with responding to \nthreats to our atmosphere that endanger the public health of our \ncitizens. We asked them to do that because we know that if it was \ndecided on this floor piece by piece, it would be politics over policy. \nSo we gave them the responsibility to respond to lead, to respond to \nmercury, to respond to global warming gases, and they are exercising \nthat responsibility in a very moderate fashion.\n  Second, this is about science because this resolution does not say we \naccept the science but we are going to change the way we respond to it. \nIt doesn't say that. It says we reject the science. It says we reject \nthe endangerment findings to the public health of our citizens.\n  Third, this is about big oil. Have no doubt, this resolution \nincreases our dependence on the Middle East and Venezuela to the tune \nof an enormous amount, so much that you would have to drive a car \naround the Equator 10 million times to consume that oil. It is wrong \nfor our national security and wrong for our economy, and if you have \nany doubt, take a look at the impassioned plea from the oil industry, \nsaying: Please, don't pass this. Why do they not want us to pass this? \nThey want to sell us that gas from the Middle East and Venezuela and \ndrive a car around the Equator 10 million times or the equivalent \nacross America.\n  So for our national security and for our economy to create jobs, we \nmust reject this resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from \nCalifornia for her leadership on this crucial resolution before us.\n  I rise in opposition to the resolution offered by my good friend, the \nSenator from Alaska.\n  Recent events have given us pause. If there has ever been a wake-up \ncall, then surely the images of oiled pelicans, docked charter boats, \nand the sickening plume of oil cascading into the blue waters of the \ngulf should provide it.\n  Time and time again, we have seen opportunities to seize our energy \nfuture passed up because of our addiction to fossil fuels, our tendency \nto put off difficult choices or our habit of letting partisanship get \nin the way. This unsustainable path has led us to a complacent sense of \nsecurity, and now look at where we are--caught off guard by a tragic \nset of events in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  As the gulf disaster has made clear, our existing sources of energy \ncome at a cost greater than just the price at the pump. They can be \ncatastrophically damaging to our economy, our national security, and \nour environment. I don't have any illusions about our need for \ntraditional energy sources, and on that I agree with the Senator from \nAlaska. The more quickly we transition to cleaner energy, the sooner we \nsecure a strong and vibrant future for America.\n  Every year, we send nearly $800 billion overseas to buy oil from \nforeign countries, some of which clearly don't have our interests at \nheart. But I believe the resolution we are debating today would help \ncontinue this reliance.\n  Let's not be fooled. We are in a race against foreign competitors in \nthe European Union and in Asia to meet the world's demand for clean \nenergy. Advanced and entrepreneurial countries like ours should do well \nin such a race. Instead, over the last 5 years, as clean energy started \nto boom, the U.S. renewable energy and trade deficit ballooned by 1,400 \npercent. China, South Korea, and Europe are all pulling ahead of us in \nthis crucial race.\n  I just returned from China, along with Senators Feinstein and Hagan. \nMy impression, quite simply, is that China appears to be taking bolder \nactions than the United States.\n  For example, the largest wind farms and solar farms in the world are \nbeing built in China. Moreover, China is investing heavily in safe \nnuclear powerplants and clean coal technology.\n  Perhaps, though, most troubling is their development of clean energy \nis in part financed by Americans who see more stable support and a \nbetter investing climate for clean energy abroad.\n  I believe the resolution from the Senator from Alaska, however well \nintended, signals to investors that our country is not ready to fully \nsupport these investments in clean energy.\n  While there is a compelling economic and national security case to be \nmade for transitioning to a clean energy portfolio, that is not the \nonly reason. Scientists, industry, and State and local officials all \nagree that climate change is a challenge our society must address.\n  In my home State in Colorado, we are already witnessing the effects \nof climate change. Increased threats from drought, wildfire, and the \nbark beetle infestation are not theoretical, they are real. Come to my \nState and see those effects.\n  I firmly believe to fully jump-start this inevitable revolution we \nmust put a price on carbon. Some have suggested this would lead to job \nloss. I disagree. Our experience in Colorado tells a different story. \nBy setting renewable targets, we have helped create an exciting, \nvibrant, growing clean energy economy in Colorado that has delivered \nthousands of new jobs. Those jobs have remained in this economic \ndownturn because they are real jobs, they are future jobs, they provide \nthe energy we need.\n  Our financial markets and our energy markets have been waiting for \nyears for leadership from the Congress on this issue. Despite the \neconomic, the environmental, and the national security interests at \nstake, some of my colleagues seem to be dead set on throwing up \nbarriers in front of investors. This is in part why I am opposing this \nresolution. It sends a message that the status quo is acceptable. It is \nnot. We need a clear path forward, we need a price on carbon, and we \nneed to set achievable standards for renewable energy to create a \npositive environment for private investment.\n  This resolution would block that path. No less than our safety and \nour security is at stake. I urge my colleagues to vote against this \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank Senator Udall for his remarks.\n  I turn to a real leader on clean air, clean water, a real fighter for \nthe health and safety of our children and our families, Senator \nLautenberg, for 7 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California \nand commend her for the struggle we have had with this issue when, in \nfact, there should not be any struggle.\n  This is not an issue, in my view, that ought to be debated. To reduce \nthe protection we want to offer our families to me sounds silly, and I \nbelieve to the American public it is going to sound silly as well. I do \nnot ascribe any evil intent on the part of the Senator from Alaska, but \nI think it is absolutely mistaken.\n  The question before us today is simply, Whose side are you on? Do you \nwant to afford your children and your grandchildren the most protection \nthey\n\n[[Page S4830]]\n\ncan have against foul air, against contamination, against pollution \ngenerally, or are you worried about the oil companies? We should not \nhave to worry about them. As a matter of fact, they ought to worry a \nlittle more about us--a heck of a lot more about us.\n  Taking nothing away from the experience and the knowledge the Senator \nfrom Alaska brings, I was in Alaska the second day after the Exxon \nValdez ran aground. I saw the casual attitude that prevailed with \nExxon. It told me something about the thinking of these companies. \nThere it was, the ship was foundering. We had people already up there. \nThere were heroic efforts by people from Fish and Wildlife, by people \nfrom the Park Service, Interior, up there caressing little seals, \ntrying to get the oil off them so they could survive, eagles and all \nkinds of animals.\n  What happened there--and I use this as an example--what happened \nthere is that Exxon was assessed a penalty. They paid the compensatory \ndamages, but they were assigned a penalty for their behavior. They were \nfined $5 billion. Instead of paying at that time when they made $3 \nbillion--equivalent to $6 billion in today's currency--when they spent \nall their time in court on lawyers, the $5 billion that was owed to the \nAmerican people was cut down to $500 million. That is the attitude. We \nsee it with BP--all kinds of disguises, all kinds of fabrications, all \nkinds of lies, wanting to talk about: This is not such a bad thing; we \nwill take care of it.\n  First they offered to take care of it. Then they said they will pay \nthe claims and then legitimate claims. Always modifying.\n  The question is, Whose side are we on? The side of big oil, the \npeople who are right now responsible for much of the destruction in the \nGulf of Mexico or are you on the side of your own children, your own \ngrandchildren?\n  I have experienced it, as most families have, with a child who has \nasthma and another one who has diabetes. We are not sure of the source \nof these conditions, but if my colleagues vote for this resolution they \nare voting to allow a clear and present danger to the health of their \nown families. How can they do that?\n  The American Academy of Pediatrics, 60,000 members, all of them well \ntrained in science and medicine, has been clear in the warning that \nclimate change will have the most dramatic effect on children.\n  What is our responsibility? To me, the responsibility is to take care \nof our kids however we can do it, protect them from all kinds of \ndangers. Here is one that will just increase it if we permit this \nresolution to go through.\n  Think about your grandchildren coughing and gagging on foul air in \nthe future. I see it in my own family. My oldest grandchild is 16. He \nhas asthma. When the atmosphere is bad, he is in terrible shape. When \nmy daughter takes him--he is a good athlete--to play baseball or \notherwise, the first thing she checks is where is the nearest clinic so \nif he starts to wheeze, she can get there in a hurry.\n  We have seen a troubling increase of asthma. The rate of asthma in \nchildren has doubled, and we know carbon pollution causes increased \nasthma attacks.\n  More global warming means increases in malaria and food and water \nshortages that will devastate children around the globe. Global warming \nis upon us. We have to solve the problem and with that the pollution of \nthe air.\n  Put simply, this resolution is an attack--unintentionally I am sure--\non children's health but that is going to be the result. That is why \nthe groups that support children and health are opposed to Senator \nMurkowski's resolution.\n  The resolution puts politics--politics--ahead of science. The science \nis clear: Emissions from burning coal and oil are sickening children \nall around the world, and if we can help them--I don't care what \ncountry they are in--we should help them. But we want to take care of \nthose in our country.\n  The resolution asks Senators to say to the scientists: You are wrong, \nscientists. I say leave the science to the scientists and not to the \npoliticians.\n  At the same time, big oil and their lobbyists will stop at nothing to \nkeep our country's dependence on oil, to have us victimized by people \nwho are not our friends, taking our money and at the same time fouling \nour air. For too long, they have had our country by the barrel and by \nthe throat.\n  This resolution is a gift to BP. I don't think BP deserves any \ncontributions from the U.S. Congress or from the American taxpayers \nright now.\n  This resolution is a direct attack on the Clean Air Act. For the last \n40 years, the Clean Air Act has led to cleaner skies and healthier \nchildren. When we strengthened the Clean Air Act, big oil rang an alarm \nthat the changes would cost too much and shut down businesses and put \nAmericans out of work. The actual costs were less than one-fifth of the \nestimates that were projected.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for their family, vote for science, which \nmeans to vote against the Murkowski resolution. We have to meet our \nobligations to future generations, and we have to get serious and solve \nour Nation's problems and move toward a clean energy future and not \nmore carbon pollution and oil.\n  I urge my colleagues to please vote for their children, vote for \ntheir families, vote no on this resolution and keep the future clean \nfor the sake of our children and grandchildren. Don't worry about the \noil companies. They will take care of themselves.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, anyone who has opened a newspaper or turned \non a radio in West Virginia recently is aware of the ongoing discussion \nabout the future of the coal and manufacturing industries. There is no \ndoubt that the West Virginia coal industry and many West Virginia \nworkers have been dealt a difficult hand over the past ten years, and \nare indeed facing some uncertainty about their futures. Such \nuncertainty is a pressing public concern for our State--and for many \nother States--and Senator Murkowski has sought to propose a resolution \nthat she evidently feels would respond to those concerns. However, we \nneed to do something other than hold a political vote on the Murkowski \nresolution, which has zero prospect of enactment, and which would not \nalleviate uncertainty about the future even if it did pass the Senate. \nThe Murkowski resolution would only foster confusion. I believe that \nthe best and most practical course of action is for the Senate to pass \na bill that provides certainty and real answers for West Virginians and \nall Americans--a bill that will be passed by the Congress and signed by \nthe President before new requirements that would broadly affect our \neconomy are imposed by regulation.\n  I understand that the Senate Democratic leadership is willing to move \nforward on a bill that pre-empts EPA action, and can win 60 votes in \nthe Senate, be approved by the House, and be signed by the President \ninto law. Senator Rockefeller recently proposed legislation to provide \na temporary pre-emption of EPA. I know that I am joined by many others \nin West Virginia in my belief that the Senate find a way to accomplish \nthat objective--an objective that I know Senator Rockefeller and I both \nshare.\n  I have recently secured commitments from my fellow Senators to \nprovide on the order of $2 billion for each major power plant that \ninstalls clean coal technology during the coming decades--with \nadditional funding available to larger projects. I am also negotiating \na commitment to provide the West Virginia region with billions more \nannually to strengthen new and existing regional businesses, to \ncomplete the construction of better highways, and to provide other \ncritical investments to ensure that the next generation of West \nVirginians will have a bright future at home in the Mountain State. \nPresident Obama has also assured me of his ongoing support for these \npriorities of mine.\n  The way to ensure that we make these transformative new investments \nin the future of West Virginia, and in the Appalachian coal industry, \nis for Congress to do the difficult work of enacting the necessary \npolicies. The Murkowski resolution does not accomplish that objective, \nand it may even undercut our ability to achieve it. The resolution is \nan open-ended denunciation of many leading scientific studies and \nregulatory initiatives. Were it to be enacted, the resolution could \nactually hamper important Federal initiatives--including rules that \nwill assist in the deployment of clean coal technologies\n\n[[Page S4831]]\n\nlike carbon capture and storage. I also note that the Murkowski \nresolution is being considered by the Senate via an unusual legislative \nprocess that constrains debate and prohibits Senators from offering \namendments.\n  As I have said before, to deny the mounting science of climate change \nis to stick our heads in the sand and say ``deal me out'' of the \nfuture. But we have also allowed ourselves to ignore other realities. \nIt is a simple fact that the costs of producing and consuming Central \nAppalachian coal continue to rise rapidly. Older coal-fired powerplants \nare being closed down, and they appear unlikely to be replaced by new \ncoal plants unless we very soon adopt several major changes in federal \nenergy policy. In 2009, American power companies generated less of \ntheir electricity from coal than they have at any other time in recent \nmemory. In the last month alone, two major power companies have \nreportedly announced that they will idle or permanently close over a \ndozen coal-fired powerplant units that have consumed millions of tons \nof West Virginia coal in recent years. Moreover, an even larger portion \nof America's aging fleet of coal-fired powerplants could be at risk of \nbeing permanently closed in the coming years--and the ability to sell \ncoal in those markets could be lost for an indefinite period, if there \nis no new Federal energy policy to support the construction of new coal \nplants.\n  Some companies may feel that it is helpful for Congress to go on \ndenouncing a new energy policy that makes it once more attractive to \nbuild new coal plants. But those companies are taking this opportunity \nto invest in natural gas, or other types of investments. They are not \nthinking about fighting for the longer term future of coal jobs and \nother jobs in West Virginia. I am. In the meantime, what happens to the \nminers, other workers, local governments, and many West Virginia \ncitizens during the course of further delay on a new energy bill? They \ncontinue to be laid off, and to struggle with insufficient revenue, and \nto remain frustrated about their uncertain future.\n  So, there is a long list of compelling reasons to oppose this \nresolution, and a rather short list of reasons to support it. For the \nsake of West Virginia's best interests, and the vital longer-term \ninterests of our Nation and our world, the Senate must now move \npromptly to take responsible, decisive, and effective action on a \nmoderate but major new energy policy.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today, we are going to be voting on a \nsignificant yet controversial resolution introduced by Senator \nMurkowski. This resolution, S.J. Res. 26, squarely confronts the issue \nof how the United States will address the issue of climate change and \nthe regulation of greenhouse gases. The resolution speaks directly to \nwhether or not the Environmental Protection Agency should be allowed to \nregulate sources of greenhouse gases. This is an important issue for \nthe U.S. Senate to address.\n  In short, the Murkowski resolution disapproves of EPA's recent \nendangerment finding that greenhouse gases are a threat to public \nhealth. This rule is a result of a 2007 Supreme Court ruling directing \nEPA to make a determination as to whether or not greenhouse gases are a \npublic endangerment. After 2 years of consideration of the scientific \nevidence, the EPA found that six greenhouse gases are a threat to \npublic health. Senator Murkowski's resolution would nullify this \ndecision.\n  While I am sympathetic to the concerns raised by Senator Murkowski, \nthe impact of her resolution would be, among other things, to negate \nthe significant progress the EPA has made in increasing fuel economy \nstandards for vehicles. For that reason I am unable to support it.\n  Instead, I am working with my colleague, Senator Rockefeller, to pass \nhis bill, S. 3072, of which I am a cosponsor, to preserve the EPA's \nability to regulate emissions from vehicles but allow the Congress an \nadditional 2 years to address the regulation of all other sources of \ngreenhouse gases.\n  Like, Senator Murkowski, I believe that the best way to address \nclimate change is to allow Congress time to pass comprehensive \nlegislation, not rely on regulations handed down by the EPA. A \nlegislative approach would allow us to mitigate what likely would \nresult from EPA regulation of stationary sources: unfair cost increases \nthat will be borne by millions of Americans who have no choice but to \nrely on energy produced from coal. This is my biggest concern, as \neighty-five percent of the energy produced in Missouri comes from coal.\n  I have long stated that I cannot support an approach to greenhouse \ngases regulation that will unfairly impact Missourians or unduly harm \nMissouri's small businesses just because they happen to be in a state \nthat is largely reliant on coal energy. Unfortunately, while the \nresolution offered by Senator Murkowski is an attempt to give Congress \ngreater time to address these types of concerns in any climate \nregulation, it also negates a historic agreement between the EPA and \nthe auto industry. This goes too far.\n  Last year, in an unprecedented announcement, the auto industry agreed \nto allow the federal government to set new standards for vehicle \nemissions and worked in concert with the government to set these new \nstandards. This was a model of effective, reasonable negotiated \nrulemaking and should be embraced, not negated. These new standards \nwill reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil by a projected 1.8 billion \nbarrels, while providing real benefits for consumers. Compared with \ntoday's vehicles, a family purchasing a vehicle under the new standards \nwill save, on average, more than $3,000 on fuel costs over the life of \nthat vehicle. If the Congress passes Senator Murkowski's resolution, it \nwill effectively eliminate these new standards. I believe it would be a \nmistake to jeopardize the progress we have made with the auto industry, \nlose the consumer benefits of increased fuel economy and lose the \nbenefit to our national security of reducing our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  This is why I am working with Senator Rockefeller to pass his \nalternative approach to delay EPA regulation of all other sources of \ngreenhouse gases for 2 years. I believe this is a better option that \nwill not unfairly penalize Missourians. I look forward to working with \nSenator Rockefeller, as well as Leaders Reid and McConnell to secure a \nvote on this very important legislation.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the resolution \nof disapproval offered by Senator Murkowski. This resolution is a \nstunning departure from the science of climate change. It jeopardizes \nour ability to address a continuing threat to our national security and \npublic health by overturning EPA's science-based finding that global \nwarming pollution endangers the public health and welfare. The United \nStates is making progress--in solar, wind and other alternative energy \nsources--job creators that will sustain our future. We are also making \nprogress in reducing the harmful pollutants in our air which threaten \nfuture generations. But this resolution would not continue this \nprogress--it would take us back by weakening the Clean Air Act, a \nproven tool in addressing air pollution.\n  But what would taking away EPA's ability to protect the health and \nwelfare of Americans from greenhouse gas pollution mean in our day to \nday lives? For the people of Maryland, who are particularly vulnerable \nto the effects of climate change because of the state's expansive \ncoastline, it would mean our coasts would be eroded at an accelerated \npace---many areas losing more than 260 acres a year. It would also mean \nsteadily rising sea levels in Ocean City, which could lose billions of \ndollars in tourism. And, it would lead to a rise in asthma and lung \ndisease rates, which already disproportionately hits our urban areas, \nlike Baltimore. With these clear threats to our livelihoods, now is not \nthe time to take a major tool out of the toolbox that could help combat \nthe prevalence of greenhouse gases in our daily lives. This is politics \nas usual in a time where we need solutions.\n  The resolution being considered today sends the wrong message to the \nAmerican public, to our businesses and to the world. It sends the \nmessage that the U.S. Congress is not taking the threats to our \nenvironment seriously. It sends the message to our businesses that it \nis okay to continue with the status quo. And in a time where we need \nthe innovation, the technology, and the workforce that is committed to \ntransitioning the United States to a\n\n[[Page S4832]]\n\nclean energy society, this is not the message that we want to send. The \nmessage that we need to send is that we are committed to a national \nenergy policy that protects our families, protects the quality of our \nair and water, and creates jobs for the 21st century.\n  The timing of this resolution is also very concerning. In recent \nweeks, due to the crisis in the gulf, we have seen what our unhealthy \naddiction to oil can do. This resolution will prevent progress that we \nhave made in breaking this. Without these regulations in place, \nAmericans will use 455 million more barrels of oil, which equals the \namount of oil that would be in the gulf if the spill raged on for 65 \nyears. We must break this cycle.\n  The U.S. Senate must make it clear how we will deal with the reality \nof climate change. Stripping the authority of the EPA to address the \nissue is not the way to make progress. Instead it is a serious and \ncounterproductive step backwards. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nopposing this resolution.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Mr. President, I rise today to strongly support the \nsenior Senator from Alaska's resolution of disapproval over the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's regulation of greenhouse gas \nemissions under the Clean Air Act. The EPA has completely overstepped \nits bounds with this action and I am proud to support Senator \nMurkowski's effort to undo this harmful regulation.\n  A colleague of mine, currently serving here in the Senate, once \nremarked that: ``Overburdensome and unnecessary Federal regulations can \nchoke the life out of small businesses by imposing costly and often \nineffectual remedies to problems that may not exist.''\n  This statement was made by the majority leader and I could not agree \nmore with it, especially when staring such a problem in the face as we \nhave here with EPA's draconian new rules. The majority leader's \nstatement was made in 1996 shortly after passage of the Congressional \nReview Act. This important tool, designed to rein in out of control \nFederal bureaucracies, is the same tool that we are using today in this \ndisapproval resolution currently being debated.\n  Make no mistake--the Congressional Review Act was designed to take on \nthis exact sort of executive overreach. The Obama administration's EPA \nis making a huge power grab by twisting the principles of the landmark \nClean Air Act and declaring greenhouse gas emissions a danger to public \nhealth and welfare. Now, I will not use this time today to debate the \nscience of greenhouse gas effects on climate change, nor the effects of \nclimate change on the planet. However, greenhouse gases are found \nnaturally in abundance in our atmosphere. In fact, the most famous \ngreenhouse gas, carbon dioxide, is emitted whenever we exhale. The \npurpose of the Clean Air Act was to reduce substances toxic to humans, \nnot substances that are not directly harmful to us.\n  Because the Clean Air Act was not designed for this kind of \nregulation, the actions EPA has taken will not work and will have a \ndevastating effect on the economy and business in the United States. \nCarbon dioxide will be considered a ``regulated air pollutant'' under \nthese regulations, thus requiring EPA to massively increase the number \nof entities it will regulate. In fact, the number of permits for new or \nmodified construction will soar from 280 to 41,000. The additional \nTitle V permits, which are required to begin these operations, will \nexplode from 14,700 to 6.1 million applications. This would seem to me \nto be a regulatory burden on an agency that cannot possibly be met \nwithout a massive infusion of taxpayer dollars.\n  Thus, we know that an enormous amount of new entities will come under \nthe regulation of the Clean Air Act. Who will be newly roped into this \ngovernment regulation? Essentially anyone, such as office buildings, \napartment complexes, large retail stores, small businesses, farms, \nhospitals, power plants, and schools. It is difficult to fathom just \nhow massively intrusive this Federal expansion will be.\n  This action by EPA also represents a rule by fiat of government \nbureaucrats. The Clean Air Act as written makes no mention of \naddressing global warming. To change this, the elected representatives \nof the people, Congress, should be the ones making the decision, not \nunelected bureaucrats in Washington. When Congress considers \nlegislation, the people who elected them expect that they will consider \nall the effects of what is being debated. The EPA does not have this \nconsideration, which is obvious by the way they have completely \ndisregarded any and all of the economic consequences of their actions. \nCongress does, though, and has to weigh the effects of policies upon \nthose that they will be implemented on. Elected officials need to be \nresponsive to legislation such as this that will prevent the \nstrengthening and recovery of the American economy. For instance, \nCongress can factor in the extremely poor timing of this as our economy \nis trying to drag itself out of recession. However, proponents of this \nregulation in the Obama administration know it will not pass Congress, \nso they are trying to do it by bureaucratic fiat instead of letting the \nelected representatives of the people work out a reasonable compromise \nto the problem.\n  It is for these reasons that I strongly support the Murkowski \nresolution of disapproval over EPA's actions. I hope the majority \nleader remembers what he said almost 15 years ago about the burdens of \nunnecessary regulation and the use of these sorts of resolutions. I \nhope our other colleagues heed his advice, as I intend to, and vote to \nsupport this resolution.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to express my strong opposition \nto S.J. Res. 26, which would invalidate the EPA's endangerment finding \nfor greenhouse gas emissions issued last December. This disapproval \nresolution is the absolute wrong approach to energy and climate policy \nin this country. Not only does it fly in the face of the science \ncurrently available on this issue, but it also ties our hands at a \ncritical moment when we should be exploring every option available to \nus for mitigating the potentially disastrous environmental, economic, \nand national security-related effects of climate change.\n  The scientific evidence currently surrounding our planet's changing \nclimate could not be clearer, or the need to address it more urgent. \nThere is broad consensus in the scientific community that most of the \nrise in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is \ndue to human activity and that this warming trend could have \npotentially far-reaching consequences for the environment, agriculture, \nand public health. The EPA's endangerment and cause or contribute \nfindings, which state that greenhouse gas emissions threaten public \nhealth and that emissions from new motor vehicles regulated under the \nClean Air Act contribute to climate change, unequivocally reflect this \nlongstanding scientific consensus. Indeed, the EPA's conclusions are \nbased on empirical assessments from such highly respected, nonpartisan \ninstitutions as the U.S. Global Climate Research Program and the \nNational Research Council.\n  Nevertheless, in spite of the veritable mountain of evidence \ndemonstrating that we need to immediately begin addressing this \nchallenge, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have chosen to \nignore the available science and bury their heads in the sand by \nsupporting this ill-conceived disapproval resolution. They are, in \neffect, voting to continue the failed policies of the Bush \nadministration, which for 8 long years ignored sound science, ridiculed \ngood policy, and relegated the U.S. to the back bench in the race to \ndevelop and deploy clean, renewable sources of energy.\n  This is not a path on which we can afford to continue. As the ongoing \ntragedy in the Gulf of Mexico clearly shows, our Nation's failure to \ncomprehensively address climate change and free our country from its \naddiction to oil and other fossil fuels poses a serious threat to our \neconomy and the public's well-being. It is now time for the United \nStates to take a leading role in this effort--to reach into the deep \nwell of technical expertise and ingenuity of its citizens--and build a \nnew, clean energy economy that will create new jobs and help rescue the \nplanet from some of the most deleterious impacts of climate change.\n  Today we are presented with a choice. Do we acknowledge the \nscientific near-certainty of climate change and the critical role the \nEPA must play in addressing it? Or do we hamstring our Nation's \nenvironmental\n\n[[Page S4833]]\n\nexperts, gut a national oil savings program, and reject sound science? \nWe must send a strong message to the American people and the rest of \nthe world that the United States is fully committed to robustly \nconfronting climate change and pioneering new, innovative approaches to \nenergy policy that move our country away from its dangerous \noverreliance on fossil fuels. I urge my colleagues to reject this \nmisguided legislation.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, our Nation is not lacking in complex \nchallenges. But among the most complex and difficult is this: How can \nwe deal with the reality of climate change while also strengthening an \neconomy that has depended for so long on fossil fuels? There is no \ndenying the difficulty of meeting those often conflicting goals. The \nresolution before us purports to respond to this challenge, but I \ncannot support the approach that Senator Murkowski offers. Let me \nexplain why.\n  Senator Murkowski offers a resolution of disapproval of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency's endangerment finding regarding the \nharmful effects of greenhouse gas emissions. This resolution's impact \nwould be to block EPA from implementing that rule.\n  First, I believe we all should understand that the subject of this \nresolution--EPA's endangerment finding--is a product of scientific \nreview of the facts regarding climate change. Current law, and a \ndecision by the U.S. Supreme Court, require EPA to act in the face of \nthese facts. If you believe in the science, as I do, then you must \neither acknowledge EPA's responsibility to act or seek to change the \nlaw that imposes that responsibility.\n  Second, as a practical matter, I am afraid this resolution, if \nenacted, would have an effect quite different from its sponsors' stated \nintent. The argument in favor of the resolution is that EPA regulation \nof greenhouse gases would unwisely harm our economy. In fact, for my \nState, passage of this resolution more likely would produce economic \nharm. That is because it would undo a carefully crafted agreement among \nthe Federal Government, auto manufacturers, environmental groups and \nothers, reached more than a year ago, relating to national greenhouse \ngas emissions standards for vehicles. This agreement resulted in a \nsingle, national standard for such emissions, binding on all States \nthrough 2016. The certainty and predictability of a binding national \nstandard is vital for vehicle manufacturers. To help them pursue the \npath to a clean-energy future, that path must be clearly marked, and \nnot confused by the myriad of different turns they would face if \nindividual states are allowed to set their own standards.\n  EPA at one point granted California a waiver permitting that State to \nseparately regulate greenhouse gas emissions from mobile sources. \nCalifornia officials have agreed, for 2010 to 2016, to a joint NHTSA-\nEPA process for regulating carbon emissions from vehicles. If the \nMurkowski resolution is enacted, California would presumably act to use \nits waiver, and other States would follow. The economic impact of \nvarying State regulation would harm manufacturers that are the economic \nbackbone of many States and communities across this Nation. Auto \nmanufacturers and auto workers have made clear, in letters to the \nCongress, their concerns that the result of this resolution's passage \nwould be to upend a clear national standard binding on all States. \nWhile the supporters of this resolution may not intend such a \nconsequence, it is surely there, and that is why I cannot support this \nresolution.\n  Let me also take this opportunity to point out that my commitment to \na single national emissions standard that is binding on all States also \nleads me to oppose the Kerry-Lieberman climate change bill in its \ncurrent form. Why? Because carbon dioxide is a global problem. The \nthreat of greenhouse gas emissions is not unique to any State. There is \nan urgent need for government action to confront the problem of carbon \ndioxide, but the need is for strong national and international action. \nTo suggest that the need is different from one side of a State line to \nthe other actually undermines the argument that carbon dioxide is a \nglobal threat that knows no boundaries.\n  Just as vehicle manufacturers and workers have made clear their \nconcerns that the Murkowski resolution threatens a single, binding \nnational standard, they have also made clear their concerns about the \neffects of the Kerry-Lieberman bill as currently written. As the United \nAuto Workers Union has pointed out in a letter to Senators, that \nproposal ``fails to provide regulatory predictability for the \nautomotive sector because it does not require continuation of the Obama \nadministration's historic achievement in promulgating one national \nstandard for greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy for light duty \nvehicles.'' The UAW is right. The Kerry-Lieberman bill, while hinting \nthat there should be a single national standard, does not commit the \nNation to such a standard. In order to gain my support, it must include \nsuch a commitment.\n  So, let no one misunderstand my vote today. I oppose the Murkowski \nresolution because it will unravel the agreement on a single national \ncarbon standard for mobile sources binding on all States through 2016. \nI also oppose the Kerry-Lieberman bill as currently drafted because it \ndoes not ensure such a standard beyond 2016.\n  I ask unanimous consent that several letters be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                       Alliance of\n\n\n                                     Automobile Manufacturers,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 17, 2010.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Pelosi, Leader Reid, Leader Boehner, and \n     Leader McConnell: On behalf of the Alliance of Automobile \n     Manufacturers and its 11 member companies, I am writing to \n     express concern over proposed Resolutions of Disapproval that \n     would overturn the Environmental Protection Agency's \n     Endangerment Finding on greenhouse gas emissions. Automakers \n     agree with the fundamental premise that Congress should \n     determine how best to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \n     However, if these resolutions are enacted into law, the \n     historic agreement creating the One National Program for \n     regulating vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions \n     would collapse.\n       At this time last year, the auto industry faced the \n     alarming possibility of having to comply with multiple sets \n     of inconsistent fuel economy standards. First, NHTSA was in \n     the process of promulgating new fuel economy standards as \n     required by Congress under the Energy Independence and \n     Security Act of 2007. Second, EPA was preparing to propose \n     greenhouse gas standards under the Clean Air Act, in the wake \n     of the Supreme Court's decision in Massachusetts v. EPA. \n     Finally, California and 13 other states were planning to \n     enforce their own state-specific greenhouse gas standards. \n     (As a practical matter, greenhouse gas standards are the \n     functional equivalent of fuel economy standards, since the \n     amount of greenhouse gases emitted by a vehicle is \n     proportional to the amount of fuel consumed.) These multiple \n     standards would not have been aligned with each other, \n     presenting all automakers with a compliance nightmare across \n     the country. The state-by-state standards were especially \n     problematic for the industry, as manufacturers generally \n     faced the likely prospect of having to implement product \n     restrictions in some states, but not others, in order to \n     comply. Clearly, the industry wanted--then and now--a ``one \n     regulation fits all'' resolution to this problem.\n       To achieve that result, the Obama Administration brokered a \n     historic agreement in May 2009 to create the One National \n     Program for fuel economy and greenhouse gas standards. Under \n     that agreement, NFITSA and EPA committed to coordinate their \n     rulemaking processes and promulgate a joint regulation \n     establishing consistent fuel economy and greenhouse gas \n     standards for the 2012-2016 model years. California agreed \n     that manufacturers who complied with the federal greenhouse \n     gas rules would be deemed to be in compliance with the state \n     standards for model years 2012-2016. The auto industry agreed \n     to suspend litigation seeking to overturn the state \n     standards, and ultimately to dismiss such litigation once the \n     conditions agreed to by the manufacturers have been met.\n       In a letter to Senator Rockefeller dated February 22, 2010, \n     Administrator Jackson stated that the disapproval resolutions \n     would have the unintended effect of ``prevent[ing] EPA from \n     issuing its greenhouse gas standard for light-duty vehicles, \n     because the endangerment finding is a legal prerequisite of \n     that standard.'' This, in turn,\n\n[[Page S4834]]\n\n     would likely result in the disintegration of the One National \n     Program agreement. It is our understanding that California \n     would not abide by the agreement if EPA is unable to regulate \n     greenhouse gases. If the One National Program agreement were \n     dissolved, the manufacturers would be back where they started \n     last May with a NHTSA regulation coupled with a patchwork of \n     states adopting regulations inconsistent with NIITSA's. As we \n     stated in a letter to Senator Feinstein on September 24, \n     2009, this would present a myriad of problems for the auto \n     industry in terms of product planning, vehicle distribution, \n     adverse economic impacts and, most importantly, adverse \n     consequences for their dealers and customers.\n       The Alliance believes that the One National Program \n     resolution fostered by the Obama Administration is critical \n     to the efficient regulation of motor vehicle greenhouse gas \n     emissions and related fuel economy in the United States, not \n     only for the 2012-2016 model years, but also for the 2017 \n     model year and beyond. The ongoing existence of a national \n     program for motor vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas \n     standards for all future model years should be the shared \n     goal of not only the Administration and the industry, but \n     also Congress and the States, for the benefit of the \n     environment, the public, and the ability of the industry to \n     create and maintain high quality jobs.\n       It is time for Congress and the Administration to enact and \n     implement measures to make a national program permanent for \n     2017 and beyond. However, given what appears to be the \n     inevitable consequence of the proposed Resolutions of \n     Disapproval, we do not believe they are the proper vehicles \n     for Members of Congress to express their legitimate concern \n     that Congress, and not EPA or the states, design the national \n     response to climate change. Instead we urge Congress to move \n     quickly to ensure that the national program does not end in \n     2016, and we stand ready to work with members to develop a \n     federally-led process to achieve a permanent national \n     program.\n       Thank you for the opportunity to explain the impact of \n     these resolutions on the auto industry. Please feel free to \n     contact me if you have any questions or need additional \n     information.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dave McCurdy.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 7, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: This week the Senate may take up Senator \n     Murkowski's disapproval resolution that would overturn the \n     EPA's endangerment finding on greenhouse gas emissions. The \n     UAW opposes this misguided effort and urges you to vote \n     against this disapproval resolution.\n       In our judgment, Congress should move forward to enact \n     comprehensive climate change legislation that will reduce \n     greenhouse gas emissions. Although we recognize the \n     difficulties involved in this effort, we believe that \n     legislation can be crafted that will reduce global warming \n     pollution while at the same time creating jobs and providing \n     a boost to our economy. In particular, we believe such \n     legislation can help to provide significant investment in \n     domestic production of advanced technology vehicles and their \n     key components, as well as other energy saving technologies. \n     But such progress would be undermined if a disapproval \n     resolution were to overturn EPA's endangerment finding.\n       The UAW understands the concerns that have been expressed \n     about EPA attempting to use its authority under the Clean Air \n     Act to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from various \n     industries. However, we believe the best way to address these \n     concerns is for Congress to move forward with comprehensive \n     climate change legislation that properly balances concerns of \n     various regions and sectors, and establishes a new coherent \n     national program to combat climate change.\n       The UAW also is deeply concerned that overturning EPA's \n     endangerment finding would unravel the historic agreement on \n     one national standard for fuel economy and greenhouse gas \n     emissions for light duty vehicles that was negotiated by the \n     Obama administration last year. As a result of this agreement \n     among all stakeholders, NHTSA and EPA engaged in a joint \n     rulemaking effort that will result in significant reductions \n     in fuel consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by 2016. At \n     the same time, these joint rules retain the structural \n     components that Congress enacted in the 2007 energy \n     legislation, thereby providing important flexibility to full \n     line manufacturers and a backstop for the domestic car fleet. \n     Most importantly, California and other states have agreed to \n     forgo state-level regulation of tailpipe emissions and abide \n     by the new national standard that has been created by these \n     NHTSA and EPA rules. This will avoid the burdens that would \n     have been placed on automakers if they had been forced to \n     comply with a multitude of federal and state standards. The \n     UAW is very pleased that all stakeholders recently agreed to \n     continue efforts to extend this national standard from 2016 \n     to 2025.\n       However, the critically important progress that has been \n     achieved with these historic agreements will be undermined if \n     EPA's endangerment finding is overturned. Without this \n     finding, EPA may not be able to implement the current rule on \n     light duty vehicles. In the absence of the EPA standard, \n     California and other states could move forward with their \n     standards, thereby subjecting auto manufacturers to all of \n     the burdens that the one national standard was designed to \n     avoid.\n       For all of these reasons, the UAW opposes Senator \n     Murkowski's disapproval resolution that seeks to overturn \n     EPA's endangerment finding. We urge you to vote against this \n     measure. Thank you for considering our views on this \n     important issue.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n     Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n         International Union, United automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America,\n                                     Washington, DC, May 19, 2010.\n       Dear Senator: Last week Senators Kerry and Lieberman \n     released a discussion draft of far reaching climate change \n     legislation entitled the ``American Power Act.'' The UAW \n     supports the enactment of an economy-wide program to reduce \n     greenhouse gas emissions. However, we were deeply \n     disappointed with the Kerry-Lieberman proposal. In our \n     judgment, the Senate should insist that a number of \n     significant problems in this proposal must be corrected \n     before it moves forward.\n       First, although the American Power Act contains a program \n     to encourage investment in the domestic production of clean \n     vehicles and their key components, it fails to provide \n     adequate funding for this program. Significantly, the funding \n     (through the allocation of carbon allowances) is lower than \n     the funding that was provided for similar programs in the \n     original Boxer-Kerry bill and the Waxman-Markey bill that \n     passed the House. Thus, the American Power Act represents a \n     step backwards on this important issue.\n       The UAW believes that substantially higher funding levels \n     are justified, both by the enormous contribution that clean \n     vehicles will be making to the reduction in greenhouse gas \n     emissions, and by the much higher costs associated with these \n     emission reductions compared to costs in other sectors. We \n     also believe that higher funding levels are needed to ensure \n     that the vehicles of the future will be produced in this \n     country by American workers by building on the success of the \n     existing manufacturers' incentive program.\n       Second, the American Power Act fails to provide regulatory \n     predictability for the automotive sector because it does not \n     require continuation of the Obama administration's historic \n     achievement in promulgating one national standard for \n     greenhouse gas emissions and fuel economy for light duty \n     vehicles. Instead, it would allow auto manufacturers to be \n     subjected to conflicting federal and state standards. The UAW \n     believes that this also represents a step backwards.\n       Third, the American Power Act fails to provide regulatory \n     predictability for businesses in general because it would \n     allow states to require companies to surrender federal carbon \n     allowances. This represents a back door means of allowing \n     individual states to de facto lower the federal cap on carbon \n     emissions, and to shift the burdens imposed on different \n     regions and sectors under the federal climate change program. \n     In addition to introducing an enormous element of \n     uncertainty, the UAW is deeply concerned that this will lead \n     to economic warfare between the states.\n       Fourth, the American Power Act fails to protect American \n     businesses and workers from unfair foreign competition \n     because the border adjustment provisions allow for too much \n     discretion, and thus may never be invoked. Furthermore, the \n     border adjustment provisions do not apply to finished \n     products that contain large amounts of energy-intensive \n     materials, such as motor vehicles and their parts, and hence \n     would not provide any protection for the domestic auto \n     industry.\n       Fifth, the American Power Act does not contain any program \n     to provide assistance to dislocated workers and communities. \n     The transition to a clean-energy economy will inevitably \n     cause some dislocation. In our judgment, a portion of the \n     revenues generated by the climate change program should be \n     earmarked to assure that adequate assistance is made \n     available to workers and communities that are adversely \n     impacted by this transition.\n       The UAW strongly urges the Senate to insist that the \n     foregoing defects in the American Power Act must be fixed \n     before this legislation moves forward. Thank you for \n     considering our views on these important issues.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Alan Reuther,\n                                             Legislative Director.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague. How much time \nremains on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There are 14\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am going to wrap it up in about 10 \nminutes and then go to the vote.\n  Before the Senator from New Jersey leaves the floor, if I may have \nhis attention, I thank him so much. He put this whole vote in the exact \nright perspective. Big oil supports the Murkowski resolution. That is a \nfact. They have sent a letter saying they support the Murkowski \nresolution.\n  Why do you think they support the Murkowski resolution? The reason \nis,\n\n[[Page S4835]]\n\nthis resolution would repeal, overturn, do away with the endangerment \nfinding made by the Environmental Protection Agency that says that \ncarbon pollution is a danger to our families, to their health.\n  Senator Lautenberg just said it from the heart. If ever there was a \nvote to find out whose side you are on, this is it. What could be \nclearer?\n  Let's put up a chart. Let's look at some of the public health \norganizations that are opposing the Murkowski resolution. I will only \nlist a couple of them: The American Academy of Pediatrics--they know \nthat carbon is a danger to our children--the Children's Environmental \nHealth Network; the American Nurses Association; the American Lung \nAssociation; the American Public Health Association.\n  Whose side do you want to be on? We had a letter from 1,800 U.S. \nscientists, from the Union of Concerned Scientists. Do you want to be \non the side of the special interests or do you want to be on the side \nof the children and the families and the people who gave their whole \nprofessional careers to protecting the health of our families?\n  This is one of those votes. This is what we call a turning-point vote \nin everyone's career. When we look back at this vote, our grandchildren \nwill want to know: Where was the Senate on this important vote?\n  We know this resolution is opposed by America's leading public health \nexperts. They do not want us to repeal a health finding. What is next? \nSomebody else will have a brilliant idea to repeal a scientific finding \nthat nicotine causes cancer. Oh, we can debate that. What is next?\n  Someone else will say: Lead is no problem in paint. Let's repeal that \nfinding. Think of all the children who would be adversely impacted with \nbrain damage if we did that.\n  The choice is with Senators: Stand with big oil or stand with the \nchildren, the families, the doctors, the public health people. This is \na moment in time.\n  There may not be bipartisan opposition on this floor. I think the \nvast majority of my Republican friends are going to support Senator \nMurkowski. But look at the outside world where we are getting support \nfor our side.\n  EPA Administrators under Nixon, Ford, and Reagan oppose the Murkowski \nresolution. People forget, the environment used to be an issue that was \nbipartisan. The EPA--that has been so criticized by my Republican \nfriends--was created by Richard Nixon, was supported by Gerald Ford and \nRonald Reagan. What has happened? How did this happen? I think it goes \nback to politics and special interests and the money that flows in \nhere.\n\n  But that is another debate for another time. Today, we have a very \nsimple proposition before us in the Murkowski resolution: Should we \nrepeal the health finding and the scientific finding that is the basis \nfor regulating greenhouse gas emissions?\n  Ronald Reagan's EPA Administrator, Richard Nixon's EPA Administrator, \nFord's--Russell Train, William Ruckelshaus--very strongly opposed. They \nurge the Senate to reject this and any other legislation that would \nweaken the Clean Air Act or curtail the authority of the Environmental \nProtection Agency to implement its provisions.\n  It is the Environmental Protection Agency--the EPA--not the \nenvironmental pollution agency. If somebody wants to turn it into that, \nthey ought to come here and make that proposal. We can debate it.\n  There is enough pollution in the gulf to teach us a lesson today. How \nironic that this is coming before us.\n  How about jobs? The people on the other side say supporting the \nMurkowski resolution is supporting jobs. That is false. The U.S. \nautomakers oppose the Murkowski amendment. They say it will lose jobs. \nIf these resolutions are enacted, the historic agreement creating the \none national program for regulating vehicle fuel economy would \ncollapse.\n  We are finally getting the U.S. auto industry on its feet. With the \nMurkowski resolution, if it became law, that is all over and our auto \nindustry will falter again.\n  The auto workers also come out against the Murkowski resolution. They \nare deeply concerned that overturning this endangerment finding would \nunravel the historic agreement on one national standard for fuel \neconomy and greenhouse gas emissions.\n  If you haven't been convinced on the jobs question in the auto \nindustry, if you are not convinced on the health argument, let's look \nat a statement made by 33 U.S. generals and admirals. Climate change is \nmaking the world a dangerous place, threatening our security.\n  I don't have time to read every word, but it says the State \nDepartment, the National Intelligence Council, the CIA, all agree and \nare all planning for future climate-based threats. America's billion-\ndollar-a-day dependence on oil makes us vulnerable to unstable and \nunfriendly regimes.\n  We have a list of the people who signed onto that. I will just read a \nfew, and I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this \ndocument.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Climate Change is Making the World a More Dangerous Place\n\n       It's threatening America's security. The Pentagon and \n     security leaders of both parties consider climate disruption \n     to be a ``threat multiplier''--it exacerbates existing \n     problems by decreasing stability, increasing conflict, and \n     incubating the socioeconomic conditions that foster terrorist \n     recruitment. The State Department, the National Intelligence \n     Council and the CIA all agree, and all are planning for \n     future climate-based threats.\n       America's billion-dollar-a-day dependence on oil makes us \n     vulnerable to unstable and unfriendly regimes. A substantial \n     amount of that oil money ends up in the hands of terrorists. \n     Consequently, our military is forced to operate in hostile \n     territory, and our troops are attacked by terrorists funded \n     by U.S. oil dollars, while rogue regimes profit off of our \n     dependence. As long as the American public is beholden to \n     global energy prices, we will be at the mercy of these rogue \n     regimes. Taking control of our energy future means preventing \n     future conflicts around the world and protecting Americans \n     here at home.\n       It is time to secure America with clean energy. We can \n     create millions of jobs in a dean energy economy while \n     mitigating the effects of climate change across the globe. We \n     call on Congress and the administration to enact strong, \n     comprehensive climate and energy legislation to reduce carbon \n     pollution and lead the world in clean energy technology.\n       Lieutenant General Joseph Ballard, US Army (Ret.); \n     Lieutenant General John Castellaw, USMC (Ret.); Lieutenant \n     General Robert Gard, Jr., Army (Ret.); Lieutenant General \n     Claudia Kennedy, US Army (Ret.); Lieutenant General Don \n     Kerrick, US Army (Ret); Lieutenant General Frank Petersen, \n     USMC (Ret.); Lieutenant General Norman Seip, USAF (Ret.); \n     Vice Admiral Donald Arthur, US Navy (Ret.); Vice Admiral \n     Kevin Green, US Navy (Ret); Vice Admiral Lee Gunn, US Navy \n     (Ret); Major General Roger Blunt, US Army (Ret.); Major \n     General George Buskirk, US Army (Ret); Major General Paul \n     Eaton, US Army (Ret.); Major General Donald Edwards, US Army \n     (Ret); Major General Paul Monroe, US Army (Ret); Major \n     General Tony Taguba, US Army (Ret); Rear Admiral John Hutson, \n     JAGC, US Navy (Ret.); Rear Admiral Stuart Platt US Navy \n     (Ret.); Rear Admiral Alan Steinman, US Coast Guard (Ret.); \n     Brigadier General John Adams, US Army (Ret); Brigadier \n     General Stephen Cheney, USMC (Ret); Brigadier General John \n     Douglass, US Air Force (Ret.); Brigadier General Michael \n     Dunn, US Army (Ret.); Brigadier General Pat Foote, US Army \n     (Ret); Brigadier General Larry Gillespie, US Army (Ret); \n     Brigadier General Keith Kerr, US Army (Ret.); Brigadier \n     General Phil Leventis, USAF (Ret); Brigadier General George \n     Patrick, III, USAF (Ret); Brigadier General Virgil Richard, \n     US Army (Ret); Brigadier General Murray Sagsveen, US Army \n     (Ret.); Brigadier General Ted Vander Els, US Army (Ret); \n     Brigadier General John Watkins, US Army (Ret); Brigadier \n     General Steve Xenakis, US Army (Ret.).\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a list of lieutenant generals, \nvice admirals, major generals, rear admirals, brigadier generals--and \nall of them real patriots--saying to us: We cannot become more \ndependent on oil, and as a result of this Murkowski resolution, that is \nwhat would happen.\n  How much more do we want to spend on importing foreign oil? We are up \nto a billion dollars a day, and it is going to people who don't care \nfor us very much, in case you didn't notice that. We want to get off \nforeign oil. We want to unleash the capital in our own country. And our \nown businesses are telling us this--that those dollars would come in if \nin fact we move forward and enact legislation that makes sense. The \nMurkowski resolution would simply stop us in our tracks.\n  More than a thousand businesses have weighed in against the Murkowski \nresolution--a thousand businesses. The resolution would eliminate\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\nincentives for innovations that could drive a clean energy economy. The \nMurkowski resolution would send the wrong signal to the American \nbusiness community. That is signed by an organization representing 850 \nbusiness leaders. The resolution will jeopardize and hinder progress. \nThat is signed by Business for Innovative Climate and Energy Policy. \nThen the Silicon Valley Leadership Group, on behalf of 320 member \ncompanies, opposes the resolution from Senator Murkowski. The member \ncompanies in the leadership group provide nearly 250,000 local jobs or \none out of every four private-sector jobs in Silicon Valley.\n  So whether you are voting on this on the basis of the health of our \nchildren, whether you care about the auto companies, whether you care \nabout jobs and the rest of the economy and the ability of this economy \nto create good jobs or because you feel we need to get off our billion-\ndollar-a-day habit of importing oil, you have a lot of important issues \nto think about.\n  I want to close with looking at something no one wants to look at--no \none can bear to look at. If anyone thought that carbon isn't a danger, \nlook at what carbon pollution is doing on the ground in the gulf \nregion--in the water, on the beaches, in the marshlands. Do you think \nthat a pollutant like this, when it goes in the air, causes no problem?\n  There was a cartoon in today's paper that showed a cap going over the \nwell--which we all hope is going to succeed--and out of that well is \nescaping some of the carbon pollution. It is going into the air and \nunder it, it says: Now it is no problem.\n  My colleagues of the Senate, this is a point in time we have to make \na decision. We are not experts in public health here. We chose as our \ncareer to say that we want to be on the side of the people who send us \nhere. This is the moment. Choose sides: It is big oil and all that \ncomes with it and all the polluters or it is protecting our families.\n  I urge a no vote to proceed to this resolution, and I ask that the \nregular order occur on the vote at this time.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I wish to thank my colleagues from the \nbottom of my heart for this vote. This was, in many ways, a turning \npoint for the Senate, because what was before us was unprecedented, the \nfirst time we had ever been asked to repeal a health finding, a \nscientific finding, a finding that was made by scientists and health \nofficials in the Bush administration and the Obama administration.\n  That finding, as we know, is the predicate, is the basis for curbing \npollution, carbon pollution, that we know is harmful to our families. \nWe see what carbon pollution is doing in the gulf, to the wildlife. We \nknow what it is doing to an entire way of life. We know what it is \ndoing to the fishermen, to the people who rely on recreation for jobs, \nto the people who rely on tourism.\n  Tonight we had a choice. We could have decided to stand with the \npolluters, big oil mostly, who were behind the Murkowski resolution, or \nwe could have decided, which we did, to stand with those who are \nlooking out for our kids, the doctors, the physicians who treat them, \nthe pediatricians, the Lung Association, the public health agencies in \nall of our States.\n  We did the right thing, and this was important. It also means we are \ngoing to move to alternative energy. We are going to move to the \nmillions of jobs that will come about when we have technologies made in \nAmerica for America. I want to see the words ``Made in America'' again. \nSo we are on that path right now.\n  I want to thank the extraordinary leadership of our leaders, Senators \nReid and Durbin. They went that extra mile. I want to thank the staff \nof the Environment and Public Works Committee, headed by Bettina \nPoirier, extraordinary staff. I want to thank the cloakroom here and \nall the people here who helped us make sure that every Senator was able \nto be heard.\n  Senator Murkowski and I worked very well together debating this in a \ncivil manner. I want to say, as I note Senator Lautenberg standing \nhere, I felt the moment this debate came together was when he came to \nthe floor to make a statement, brief though it was. He talked to us not \nfrom his notes but from his heart, about what it means to him as a \ngrandparent to watch a grandchild suffer and struggle through asthma, \nand as he has noted on this floor on more than one occasion, his family \nmaking sure that when this child plays in an athletic tournament or \ngoes somewhere, how close is the emergency room.\n  This is what we are dealing with today, pollution. And today we said: \nWe stand with the physicians, we stand with the scientists, and we are \ngoing to move forward toward a clean energy economy and all of the jobs \nthat will come with it, and all of the technologies that will make \nAmerica a leader in the world.\n  At this time I yield the floor to my friend Senator Durbin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Durbin pertaining to the submission of S.

That \nis $20 trillion with a T.\n  Let's stop for a minute and take note of that amazing number.

But in my short time in Washington, it has been a little \nunsettling to hear the\n\n[[Page S4837]]\n\nwords like ``billion'' and ``trillion'' thrown with little regard to \nthe impact these incredible numbers have on our economy, both now and \nin years to come.\n  For example, yesterday the Federal Reserve Chairman warned us that \nthe federal budget is on an unsustainable path. In 1987, when the \nnational debt was approaching $1 trillion, then-President Ronald Reagan \ncalled it ``out of control.'' One can only imagine what he would be \nsaying today.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle argued that voting against the \ndebt extenders is about partisan politics and that borrowing another \n$80 billion from China to pay for these programs is somehow just \nanother drop in the bucket.\n  I have to respectfully disagree. That could not be further from the \ntruth. When, if not now, when our Nation's debt is growing at a record \npace with no end in sight, will we as elected officials start standing \nup and making the hard decisions we were sent here to make? Today I am \nsaying to my colleagues: Please start to tear down the terrible prison \nof debt we are building for our children, our grandchildren, and our \ngreat-grandchildren. We need to start finding ways to pay for things \nand stop spending so much, stop treating everything as an emergency to \ntry to get around the pay-go rules put in place before I got here.\n  If we continue down this path of reckless spending and borrowing, I \nbelieve--and others do throughout the country--the consequences are \ndire. To be blunt, the push for higher taxes and more dependence on \ngovernment debt threatens American leadership in the world as well as \nour national and economic security. As we continue to borrow more and \nmore from countries that are not necessarily friendly to us, it leads \nus down a path similar to what we are seeing with the European model as \nit is decaying before our very eyes.\n  Look at Greece right now, where unchecked government spending has \nthreatened the financial stability of the entire European Union. We are \nat a point where soon our excessive level of debt will start to hinder \nthe economic growth we so desperately need to get the economic engine \nmoving and continue to create jobs and be competitive.\n  Make no mistake, I believe we should temporarily extend unemployment \nbenefits and other measures such as the summer jobs program and address \nthe critical issue of lack of jobs for American citizens. We can and \nshould provide temporary relief for the neediest among us, but we need \nto find a way to pay for it without taxing or resorting to borrowing \nmore money. The fact is, we could easily pay for these extensions by \ncutting unnecessary spending such as the nearly $50 billion of unused, \nunallocated, or unobligated stimulus funds. Instead we are raising \npermanent taxes by more than $50 billion extra, including taxes on \nentrepreneurial businesses and investors, the venture capitalists that \nhope to be the economic engine and job creators of tomorrow.\n  The administration and the majority party say these taxes are \nnecessary to help to partially offset this extension, but these taxes \nare necessary because of our reckless spending habits. During the last \n18 months, this administration and the Congress have spent more money \nthan the previous administration spent on Iraq, Afghanistan, and the \nKatrina recovery combined. It was with straight faces they promised to \nusher in a new era of fiscal responsibility.\n  Last year the President and the Congress pushed through an Omnibus \nappropriations bill that included an 8-percent increase in \ndiscretionary spending. This was followed by the infamous, nearly \ntrillion-dollar stimulus bill that has not created one new net job. In \nfact, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts alone since its passage \nhas increased. The President signed another omnibus spending bill with \na 12-percent annual increase and jammed through the trillion-dollar, \ngovernment-run health care bill that was at great cost and clearly was \nopposed by the American people.\n  The problem is on both sides of the aisle. The President has said he \nwould like to go through the Federal budget line by line and identify \nwasteful programs. By golly, let's do it. Let's do a top-to-bottom \nreview of every Federal program, weed out the waste and fraud and put \nwhat is left over to help with these needed programs. In his budget, \nthe President has identified programs to terminate and cuts that would \nsave nearly $25 billion next year. Let's do it. This could help pay for \nsome of these emergency extensions.\n  Yet year after year, Congress continues to earmark their special pet \nprojects within the budget without any hope for any type of termination \nof that practice.\n  In addition, we need to do a top-to-bottom review of all Federal \nprograms, including the military, and we must get aggressive about \nreining in waste, fraud, and abuse and demand a clawback of some of the \nbillions in overpayments made to Federal contractors that have been \nowed to us for many years. Let's use that money to help offset the \namount we are trying to pay in the extenders bill. Fraud in Medicare \nand Medicaid costs the taxpayers more than $60 billion annually, and \nthe GAO has investigated numerous programs that are failing to fulfill \ntheir missions. Yet more money from Congress is given to them each \nyear, year after year. No respectable business would be run this way, \nnot in Massachusetts, not in New Hampshire, not anywhere.\n  There is no shortage of ways Washington can rein in its excessive \nspending habits while also funding these worthwhile programs. But it is \ngoing to require elected officials to make hard and even sometimes \nunpopular choices. If we begin using commonsense steps to get our \nfiscal house in order, we can absolutely put our country back on a path \nto fiscal security, get back to fiscal sanity, and get our appetite for \nspending and borrowing under control. Both are crucial for the fiscal \nand economic stability of our country.\n  We can start down the path today by saying no to the extender bill \nthat would add close to $80 billion to our over $13 trillion national \ndebt right now, an amount we cannot afford and something our children, \ngrandchildren, and great-grandchildren will be forced to pay back.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to speak about the BP Deepwater \nHorizon oilspill and the need for comprehensive energy legislation.\n  We just defeated a resolution that was an attempt to take our country \nbackward in our energy policy at a time when moving forward could not \nbe more critical. We are in the midst of the worst environmental \ncatastrophe in our Nation's history. This oilspill is a tragedy--a \ntragedy for our environment; our wildlife, which is dying in a coat of \ncrude; a tragedy for the people of the gulf whose land and livelihood \nhave been destroyed and threatened; and a tragedy for the workers on \nthat oil rig who were killed or injured and their families.\n  My constituents are furious, and so am I. I have gotten over 5,000 \ncalls and letters from Minnesotans demanding action and accountability \nfor this disaster.\n\n  Well, let there be no question: BP, British Petroleum, will be held \nresponsible for all costs incurred as a result of this oilspill. The \ncompany had no viable plan in place to deal with a spill of this \nmagnitude. It is an outrage, and the taxpayers must not be left holding \nthe bag for BP's failure.\n  But some losses can never be recovered. Fragile ocean and coastal \necosystems have suffered irreparable harm, with massive losses of birds \nand fish and damages to wetlands that provide a critical buffer against \ngulf hurricanes. Fishermen will have no way to support their families \nin these tough times. And kids will go to the beach only to find sand \nand water drowned by oil. Worst of all, we can never replace the 11 \nworkers who lost their lives in this tragedy, nor can we hope to fully \ncompensate the families of the victims\n\n[[Page S4838]]\n\nfor their losses--losses that were entirely preventable.\n  While we do not yet know all of the technical details of why this \nspill occurred, one thing is clear: BP blatantly neglected to invest in \nsafety, and the Federal Government did not do a thing to hold the \ncompany accountable.\n  BP knew about safety concerns on the Deepwater Horizon long before \nthe explosion occurred in April. The New York Times reports that BP \nknew 11 months ago that there were potential safety problems with the \nwell casing and the blowout preventer. The casing BP installed last \nsummer was never proven to withstand the water pressure of deepwater \ndrilling. Shortly before the explosion in April, the company installed \na risky, cheap casing--to save money.\n  And then there is the blowout preventer, which is supposed to close \noff the well in the case of a disaster. The blowout preventer was \nmalfunctioning and leaking fluid a month before the explosion, and BP \nknew this, but BP chose profits over safety.\n  Where was the Federal Minerals Management Service during all of this? \nWhere was the body charged with regulating safety in the oil industry? \nThis was a dismal failure of Federal oversight, with exemption after \nexemption granted to BP by an ineffective agency overridden with \nconflicts of interest. The ineffectiveness of MMS is inexcusable. Just \nearlier this week, I asked MMS for a list of all of BP's deepwater \nprojects in the gulf--a seemingly simple task. Instead of getting me a \nlist, MMS told my staff they did not know how many deepwater projects \nBP has in the gulf. This is unconscionable.\n  BP's poor safety record is not new. OSHA data compiled by the Center \nfor Public Integrity shows that the company accounted for 829 of the \n851 willful safety violations industry-wide at oil refineries cited by \nOSHA in the last 3 years. Those numbers speak for themselves.\n  It is not that BP could not afford to invest in safety. This \nrecession, which has been devastating to so many families in Minnesota, \nin New Hampshire, and across the country, has been a lucrative time for \nBP. The company's first-quarter profits this year amounted to over $6 \nbillion--$6 billion. That is more than double their first-quarter \nprofits from last year. And we found out recently that BP has spent $50 \nmillion on advertising to manage its image after the oilspill and plans \nto pay over $10 billion in dividends to its shareholders this week. I \nwould suggest they hold off on that.\n  So this is not a company that could not afford to invest in safety. \nThey just chose not to. Let me repeat that. This is not a company that \ncould not afford to invest in safety. They just chose not to. And if \nthey had, those 11 workers would be alive today and their families \nwould have them.\n  But we cannot only look back. We have to look forward. If there was \never a moment in our history when it has become obvious we cannot drill \nourselves to energy independence, it is now. We are not just talking \nabout caring for the environment or worker safety. This spill is a call \nto action to secure the future of our country. It is time to kick our \naddiction to oil. We need to face our energy challenge head-on and \nenact bold, comprehensive energy and climate legislation, and we need \nto do it now.\n  We know it can be done. Minnesota is a national leader in renewable \nenergy policies. My State produces 9.4 percent of its electricity from \nwind power--the second highest in the country. We are well on our way \nto meeting our State renewable energy standard of 25 percent renewable \nenergy by 2025, and we have passed a law to increase our ethanol blend \nto 20 percent starting in 2013. Minnesota shows us what is possible as \na country.\n  There are still Members of this body who argue that comprehensive \nenergy and climate legislation can wait, that we can continue with \nbusiness as usual. Well, that argument simply does not hold. What will \nit take--what will it take--beyond the biggest oilspill in our \ncountry's history to convince skeptics it is time to wean our country \noff of oil? How many more oilspills will it take?\n  Today, we face a choice. We can choose not to enact comprehensive \nlegislation that puts a price on carbon and watch as the clean energy \njobs and innovation of the 21st century go oversees to China and Japan \nand India and South Korea and Germany--you name it--because those \ncountries definitely are not waiting to act. China is now the largest \nmanufacturer of wind turbines and solar panels in the world. It is \nadding 100,000 new clean energy jobs every year. Those are jobs that \nshould be here in America. Our other choice is to spur American \ninnovation and create jobs to build a new economy based on clean \nenergy. I can guarantee you that you are never going to see a 60-day \nethanol spill threaten the livelihoods of shrimpers and oystermen and \nfishermen. And you are never going to see a wind turbine blow up and \npollute the ocean and threaten all manner of wildlife and the coastline \nof America or kill 11 men. So the choice is obvious to me, and it is \nobvious to the rest of the world too.\n  Earlier this week, I was in a meeting, and I heard a story about \nGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel. When someone asked the Chancellor \nabout encouraging U.S. companies to support a price on carbon, she \nsaid: No, I don't want to do that; I don't want to wake the sleeping \neconomic giant that is the United States. She and the rest of the world \nknow that if we do not put a price on greenhouse gas emissions, America \nstands to lose. We stand to lose our jobs to other countries, and we \nstand to lose the essence of what has made America great all throughout \nhistory--our ability to innovate, to create, to solve the world's \nproblems through new technologies that make the world a better place to \nlive. Well, we just cannot let that happen.\n  It is not going to be easy to transition away from oil. But running \naway from challenges has never been the American way. The American way \nis to face our problems and to innovate ourselves out of them. That is \nwhat has made us the global economic leader.\n  So now is our time to lead again. If we do not act on comprehensive \nenergy and climate legislation, even after this catastrophe in the \ngulf, our children and our grandchildren are going to look back on this \nand on us with complete bewilderment: What were they waiting for? That \nis what they are going to ask. What were you waiting for?\n  This moment and this oilspill remind me of the fable of the man stuck \non the roof during a flood. Someone comes up to him with a ladder, as \nthe waters rise, but he waves them away, saying: No, no, no, go save \nothers. I know God will save me.\n  The water gets higher, and a man in a rescue boat comes along to help \nhim.\n  He said: No. Fine. Fine. God will save me.\n  Then a helicopter comes, and the man yells up: No, no, leave me. God \nwill save me.\n  Finally, the waters rise to the roof and the man drowns, and in \nheaven, he asks God: Why didn't you save me?\n  And God says: What do you mean? I sent you a ladder, a boat, and a \nhelicopter. What else does it take?\n  Right now, the United States is the man on the roof, waiting, as our \nenergy problems get worse and opportunities pass us by one by one. \nWell, I am not willing to let that happen. In the coming months, we in \nthis great body are going to have to work together, make compromises, \nand craft a long-term energy and climate policy that serves our country \nfor the betterment of future generations. I want to be able to look my \ngrandchildren in the eye, I want to be able to look my great-\ngrandchildren in the eye, too, and tell them that we did everything we \ncould to leave this world a better place than the one we were born \ninto. The stakes are too high not to act, and not to act now. So let's \nwork to craft a comprehensive energy policy.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 2 weeks ago, we considered the Wall Street \nreform bill, and the occupant of the chair was a key player in the \nactivities of the Banking Committee that led up to the floor \nconsideration.\n  I offered an amendment during the course of that debate on the Wall \nStreet reform bill. I knew that the basic reason for Wall Street reform \nwas twofold: holding big banks accountable for how they operate and \nempowering consumers to make good financial choices.\n  The bill Senator Dodd and the committee brought to the floor was a \nstrong one. In the process of taking up and voting on amendments, in \nmany ways the Senate made the bill even stronger. Now a conference with \nthe House is underway, and I look forward to seeing the best Wall \nStreet reform bill possible signed into law by President Obama.\n  During the course of that debate, I offered an amendment to the bill \nthat attracted a lot of attention--more than I anticipated. My \namendment sought to give small businesses and merchants and their \ncustomers across America a real chance in the fight against the \noutrageously high swipe fees charged by Visa and MasterCard credit card \ncompanies.\n  Nearly $50 billion in credit and debit card interchange fees are \ncollected each year, and this interchange system is entirely \nunregulated.\n  To explain the process, if I go to my favorite restaurant in Chicago \ntomorrow night with my wife and receive my bill and hand over my credit \ncard to that restaurant--and let's say the bill is for $100--the credit \ncard company will honor the bill, pay it to the restaurant, but then \ncharge the restaurant as much as 3 percent of the bill for the use of \nmy credit card, and that is known as a swipe or interchange fee.\n  You might say, well, doesn't the restaurant negotiate with the credit \ncard company about whether it is 3 percent, 2 percent, or 1 percent? \nThe answer is no. Those fees are dictated by the credit card companies. \nMerchants and businesses have little power in even challenging, let \nalone changing, the so-called interchange and swipe fees.\n  Other than my credit card, I could present something known as a debit \ncard, which more and more people use every day. A debit card, instead \nof allowing the Visa company to pay my bill, and then I pay them, \nactually would deduct the money from my checking account, so the money \nmoves directly from my bank through to the bank of the restaurant to \npay the bill.\n  In that situation, the credit card company is not on the hook very \nmuch because the money is moved directly from the checking account to \nthe account of the restaurant. It is not a question of whether I pay my \nmonthly bill or whether I pay the interest on that bill; there is very \nlittle risk associated with the so-called debit card.\n  Yet what we are finding is that the credit card companies are \ncharging the same fees for debit cards they are charging for credit \ncards. Merchants and businesses across America say there is not as much \nrisk associated with them, so why are they charging more? That is the \nbasic mechanism that I approached with my amendment, which was adopted \non the floor with 64 Senators voting in favor.\n  Visa and MasterCard dominate the credit and debit card industry in \nAmerica. They establish the interchange rates that all merchants--and \nby extension, their customers--pay to banks whenever a card is swiped \nor used. There is no one watching out in the process for businesses and \nconsumers. There is no agency of government with the authority to \nensure that these fees charged by the credit card companies are \nreasonable. Visa and MasterCard just set the fees as they see fit and \ntell the merchants to take it or leave it. But how easy would it be to \nrun a restaurant or major business in America today if you didn't \naccept credit and debit cards?\n  Visa and MasterCard envision an American economy where ultimately all \nsales are conducted electronically across their networks, where they \nand the card-issuing banks receive a cut of every sale and transaction \nin America.\n  It is no surprise they want as big a cut as possible. They want to \nmaximize their profits. Right now, they have the market power to make \nthat happen. They can raise their fees whenever they want.\n  Who ends up paying the highest interchange fees charged by these \ncredit card companies such as Visa and MasterCard? Small businesses. \nMany of them are literally driven out of business by these high fees \nthey cannot control and cannot negotiate. They don't have the market \npower to do it. Those who stay in business have to raise the prices on \ncustomers to pay the fees.\n  My amendment requires debit card fees to be reasonable, and it cleans \nup some of the worst abuses by Visa and MasterCard.\n  Yesterday, we had a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee and \npresent was an Under Secretary in the Department of Justice, Christine \nVarney. She is in charge of the antitrust section. I asked her whether \nthe recent reports that had been published in many newspapers across \nAmerica that the major credit card companies are being investigated by \nthe antitrust division were true. She said she could not comment on the \ncase other than to say they have verified the fact that an antitrust \ninvestigation is underway against Visa and MasterCard.\n  I applaud that. I understand why she could not go into detail. I \napplaud that investigation. These major credit card companies have \nbecome so big and powerful and coordinate their activities so much that \nI think such an investigation is long overdue.\n  My amendment requires that debit card fees be reasonable, and it \ncleans up some of the worst abuses. The amendment was adopted with 64 \nSenators voting in favor, including 17 Republicans. It was a major \nvictory for small business and merchants and consumers across America. \nIt will help small businesses grow and create jobs, which we definitely \nneed in this economy, and it will put us back on sound economic \nfooting. It will help American families, each of whom pays an estimated \n$427 a year, to subsidize this $50 billion interchange fee system for \nVisa and MasterCard.\n  I thank each of my colleagues who joined me in that vote, including \nthe Presiding Officer.\n  I know my amendment has earned me the wrath of Wall Street, the wrath \nof the big banks, and the wrath of Visa and MasterCard. Even before the \nlast votes were counted on my amendment, Visa and MasterCard and \nlobbyists for the big banks were already plotting a way to kill this \namendment. Financial industry lobbyists are swarming the Halls of \nCongress as we speak. You can hear the stampede of the Gucci loafers \naround every corner. They are arguing that reducing debit card \ninterchange fees to a reasonable level, as my amendment would require, \nis unacceptable. In their view, there is absolutely nothing wrong with \ncharging unreasonably high fees in a business where there is virtually \nno competition.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider the enormous benefits of the \namendment that was adopted. Our language will help every single Main \nStreet business that accepts debit cards keep more of their money, \nwhich is a savings they can pass on to their consumers. Every grocery \nstore, convenience store, flower shop, and every restaurant will be \nable to reduce the fees they paid to the big banks for debit card \ntransactions.\n  This is a real boost for that industry and, believe me, they know it. \nThey are fighting hard to convince Members of the House now that what \nwe did in the Senate is the right thing for small business across \nAmerica. It has led the Merchants Payments Coalition, this group that \ncame together in support of my amendment--2.7 million merchants, \nrepresenting 50 million American employees--to endorse this bill--the \noverall bill--and to work for its passage because of this amendment.\n  It is not just businesses that benefit from the amendment. Charities \nwill benefit. Think about that. Charities that accept donations by \ndebit cards will see a savings. Universities will save money on card \nfees, and so will public agencies, such as your local motor vehicle \ncommission in your home State, public transit agencies, and even the \nU.S. Postal Service.\n  Also, under my amendment fewer taxpayer dollars will be spent by \nlocal, State, and Federal Government agencies for the payment of these \ninterchange fees.\n\n[[Page S4840]]\n\n  I am going to hold a hearing next week in my appropriations \nsubcommittee about the amount of money paid by American taxpayers each \nyear to Visa and MasterCard for interchange fees. It is an enormous \namount of money. It is an amount that I think is unwarranted because, \nbasically, the Federal Government is going to pay these bills. No \nquestion about it. Yet some of the interchange fees charged to our \ngovernment are much higher than the fees charged to businesses.\n  Last year, the city of Chicago paid $7.5 million in interchange fees. \nThe Illinois Tollway authority paid $11.6 million in interchange fees. \nOur cities' transit agencies and units of government could put this \nmoney to better use than paying Visa and MasterCard.\n  Next week, this hearing will bring out the amount of money paid by \nthe Federal Government. Consumers will benefit from the amendment as \nwell. Debit interchange fee reductions will lead to lower consumer \nprices at grocery stores, convenience stores, and other retailers that, \nunlike Visa and MasterCard, have to vigorously compete with one another \non price. They will have an incentive to pass the savings on to their \nconsumers.\n  My amendment explicitly allows merchants to provide discounts when a \ncustomer pays by cash, check, or debit, instead of credit.\n  I told a story on the Senate floor before, and I think it illustrates \nperfectly what we are up against. When you go to the airport to leave \ntown, there are places where you can buy magazines, newspapers, chewing \ngum, and the like. I was standing in line at a register while somebody \nin front of me took a package of chewing gum, put it on the counter, \nand handed over a credit card.\n  I noticed as she rang up the $1.50--whatever it was--and started \nrunning the credit card through that the cashier was doing this \nroutinely. I asked her afterward, when I was next up: Is that the \nlowest amount anyone put on a credit card while you have worked here?\n  She said: No. Thirty-five cents is the lowest amount.\n  I guarantee that merchant lost business, probably on the $1.50, \ncertainly on the 35 cents, because they have to pay the credit card \ncompany regardless of the amount of the purchase, and the credit card \ncompany forbids, prohibits the merchant, the business from saying: You \ncan't use a credit card for something, for example, that is under $5. \nThey cannot do it.\n  What we are trying to do is create some sense where we do not \npenalize merchants and small businesses. I know Visa and MasterCard are \nthrowing a lot of money into their campaign against my amendment. It is \none of the most fiercely lobbied provisions I have seen since I have \nserved in the Congress. I have heard their arguments, and they just do \nnot hold water.\n  They argue that there have been no hearings in Congress on the issue \nof interchange fees prior to my amendment. Actually, in the last 5 \nyears, there have been six congressional hearings specifically on \ninterchange fees, plus two reports from the General Accountability \nOffice.\n  The second myth they have been pushing is that my amendment will hurt \nsmall banks and credit unions. Mr. President, we discussed this after \nthe amendment passed, when you were on the floor. As a result of my \namendment, which I changed at the last moment, it says that any \ninstitution issuing a credit card with less than $10 billion in assets \nis not covered by the provisions of my amendment--$10 billion. That \nmeans that out of 8,000 credit unions across America, exactly 3 would \nbe governed by my amendment. Yet the credit union industry and all of \ntheir representatives are roaming all over Capitol Hill saying: This is \ngoing to kill us. In fact, they are specifically exempted from this \namendment.\n  When it comes to banks, the $10 billion asset threshold would mean \nthat out of about 8,000 banks in America, only about 90 will end up \nbeing covered by this amendment.\n  You say to yourself: Durbin, why did you go through all this trouble \nfor 90 banks and 3 credit unions? It turns out that these 90 banks and \n3 credit unions do 65 percent of the credit card business in America. \nThe big boys are the ones who will be touched by this amendment, as \nthey should be.\n  I heard this line from the Independent Community Bankers of America \nand the Credit Union National Association, that they are the ones who \nare going to be hurt. Three credit unions, 80 banks, or 90 at the most, \nwill be affected by it.\n  I just sent a letter to these organizations telling them what I have \nbeen telling small banks and credit unions in my home State of \nIllinois--that my amendment will not disadvantage them. In fact, we \nwent to great lengths to protect them. We exempt 99 percent of the \nbanks and 99 percent of the credit unions.\n  Visa and MasterCard cannot come here and lobby and expect anybody to \nbelieve them because we know what credit card companies do to you. They \ndo not have a lot of friends on Capitol Hill. The big banks, the ones \nthat issue the credit cards, cannot come around either, basically \nbecause the Wall Street reform bill was focused on these banks and some \nof their nefarious activities, at least questionable activities. Whom \ndo they have fronting for their arguments? The little credit unions \nthat come in and say this is going to be terrible. What they do not \ntell Members of Congress is that the Durbin amendment specifically \nexempts them from any coverage of this amendment.\n  My amendment does not allow merchants to discriminate against cards \nissued by small banks or credit unions. That is another argument they \nmake: If the Durbin amendment goes through, a lot of businesses and \nrestaurants will not take the credit cards issued by the small \ninstitutions. There are specific provisions now that prohibit \ndiscrimination against the issuer of the credit card. Those are not \nchanged by the Durbin amendment.\n  Credit unions fear the card networks will reduce their fees if this \nprovision is enacted. Imagine--think this through. Since the Durbin \namendment will not change the fees small banks issuing credit cards \nwill receive, they are afraid that out of spite Visa and MasterCard \nwill unilaterally cut their fees. I have news for them: Visa and \nMasterCard can do that today even without the Durbin amendment. They \nhave the power to dictate these interchange fees to small banks and \ncredit unions alike. That is what is fundamentally unfair, and that is \nthe situation facing merchants and businesses across America today.\n  I hear small banks say that even though the Durbin amendment reduces \nthe interchange fee rates, Visa and MasterCard are threatening that if \nthe amendment becomes law, they are going to go ahead and reduce the \nrates they set for small banks. That is certainly in their power today, \nbut it is certainly against the economic interests of Visa and \nMasterCard.\n  Small banks have to understand--credit unions as well--that Visa and \nMasterCard want more credit cards out there, more people using them. \nDiscouraging the use of credit cards is certainly not in their business \nmodel. Visa and MasterCard only get paid if the card is actually swiped \nor the interchange fee is charged. They would lose that revenue if they \ncut small bank interchange fees so much so that the banks would stop \nissuing credit cards.\n  The only reason Visa and MasterCard might decide to reduce small bank \ndebit interchange rates is if the big banks told Visa and MasterCard \nnot to let the small banks get more interchange revenue than they do. \nBig banks hate the thought of small banks getting higher interchange \nrates because the small banks could use that money to eat into the big \nbanks' share of the debit card issuer market.\n  Many have long suspected that Visa and MasterCard operate primarily \nto serve the big banks. We are certainly going to find out.\n  I say to those who have come to lobby me for over 25 years from the \ncredit union industry, I am really troubled by the pattern of conduct I \nhave seen on this legislation. I saw it before when we were dealing \nwith the issues of bankruptcy and foreclosure, when we specifically \nexempted the credit unions, and yet they refused to break from the \nbiggest bankers--the American Bankers Association--in their position on \nthis issue. We are seeing it again today. We specifically exempt all \nbut three credit unions, and the credit unions are doing the bidding of \nthe big banks and the credit card companies.\n  I think of the origin of credit unions, which came to be when people \nacross\n\n[[Page S4841]]\n\nAmerica decided they wanted to have a fighting chance against banks, \nthat they would come together, pool their savings, and loan to one \nanother with reasonable interest rates. We rewarded this credit union \nmodel by saying we would not consider them for-profit banks. We would \nexempt them from certain Federal taxation because they were different--\ndifferent in their goals, different in their principles, different in \ntheir business models.\n  But the more I watch them on issue after issue, there is not a dime's \nworth of difference between the big banks and the credit unions when it \ncomes down to the really tough issues. As soon as the big banks snap, \nthe Credit Union Association jumps. That is what is going on here. It \nis unfair to those who honor the credit union movement and what it \nstands for, and it is unfair that their leaders do not have at least \nthe vision to understand that this kind of approach is at the long-term \nexpense of the reputation of a fine association which has served so \nmany millions of Americans, including my family, for a generation.\n  The banks also argue that because my amendment requires debit fees to \nbe reasonable and proportional to the cost of processing a transaction, \nthey will not be able to cover the possible risk of fraud. That is a \npretty bold argument for them to make.\n  Visa, MasterCard, and the banks for years have been urging consumers \nto use payment methods that run higher fraud rates. On April 21, an \narticle ran in the American Banker entitled ``Counterintuitive Pitch \nfor Higher-Fee Debit Category.'' The article discusses how JPMorgan \nChase, one of the Nation's largest debit card issuers, has urged all \nits customers to sign for its debit transactions rather than enter a \nPIN number. As the article points out, entering a PIN number greatly \nreduces the risk of fraud. The reason JPMorgan Chase urged its \ncardholders to use signature debit cards is the interchange fees for \nsignature cards are higher. They make more money when you sign than \nwhen you use a PIN number. They are willing to absorb the possibility \nof fraud in a signature rather than in a PIN number, which is more \nsecure. The banks do not appear to be nearly as concerned about lower \nfraud as they are about higher fees.\n\n  Visa, MasterCard, and the banks have also been blocking the \nintroduction of fraud-proof card technology in the United States, again \nbecause they want to keep interchange rates high. For example, many \ncountries have chip and PIN cards where a card has a microchip that can \nonly be activated by the use of a PIN number. The banks and card \ncompanies in this country have stifled that technology.\n  When debit fraud does happen today, the big banks usually try to \ncharge back the fraud loss to the merchants on the grounds that the \nmerchants somehow violated Visa's and MasterCard's operating rules.\n  As long as big banks are guaranteed the same interchange revenue no \nmatter how much or how little fraud they have, the banks have no \nincentive to keep fraud costs low. My amendment will give big banks a \nreal incentive to reduce fraud.\n  Finally, I hear the banks argue that by reducing debit interchange \nfees, my amendment would force the banks and card companies to raise \nfees on customers. I try not to laugh when I hear this one because when \nwere the banks and card companies not raising fees on their customers? \nDidn't we just see them fall all over themselves to gouge cardholders \nbefore last year's Credit CARD Act took effect? I cannot tell you how \nmany letters I received in the mail during the grace period before the \nlaw went into effect announcing higher interest rates on the credit \ncards my family uses. It is not as if banks and card companies were \nreducing fees to cardholders as interchange rates were being hiked over \nthe last few years. Rather, they ratcheted up fees on both the \ncardholder side and on the merchant side. They try to take advantage of \nboth sides whenever they can.\n  We need to ensure that this system works fairly both for consumers \nand for small businesses. And last year's Credit CARD Act and my \namendment will work together to do so.\n  In conclusion, I call on my colleagues to stand up for the merchants \nand small businesses across America, to push this amendment across the \nfinish line in the conference committee on Wall Street reform. This \namendment represents one of the biggest wins for small businesses and \nconsumers in years. It will help small businesses grow and create more \njobs. Do not let the Wall Street lobbyists and the friends of the \ncredit unions who are working for them fool you. This is all about big \nbank profits. Do not let them kill this amendment. Do not let them \nbring down this broad, bipartisan effort to give small businesses a \nfighting chance against Visa and MasterCard.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I see my colleague from North \nDakota is with us.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4841-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4841]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BP'S RESPONSIBILITY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak about the \nSTART treaty briefly. Before I do, let me mention, as I have \npreviously, that I have been sending messages to the Justice Department \nand others. I was pleased with the Attorney General's comments today \nabout the oilspill in the gulf, the gusher of oil that continues in the \ngulf, and about BP's responsibility.\n  There is no question that BP has said they pledged to cover \nlegitimate costs as a result of this oilspill. The question I have is, \nIs that a binding agreement? And the answer from the Justice Department \nat a hearing recently was, no, it is not binding. If that is the case, \nif it is not binding--and I believe it is not--we need to move to take \nsteps to make that pledge binding.\n  There are people today who are trying to figure out how on Earth do \nthey get through this situation. In addition to oil spilling out into \nthe gulf--and it has been doing that I think for 52, 53 days--there are \npeople on a dock in a small town somewhere who are fisher men and \nwomen. They have a boat and they fish for a living. But their boat is \nidle at the end of the dock because they cannot fish. Yet they have to \nmake a payment on that boat at the end of the month. Up and down the \ngulf, there are significant consequences of this situation. The \nquestion is, Who is going to reach out to help those folks? They did \nnot cause these problems.\n  I think it is important for BP to be asked to put a significant \namount of money into a fund, a recovery fund of sorts, and that fund be \nhandled by a special master and perhaps by a counselor from BP.\n  In any event, it is important to turn this from a pledge into a \nbinding commitment and to do so soon so that money begins flowing to \nthose who are substantially disadvantaged by what has happened and this \ndisaster that has occurred in the Gulf of Mexico.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4841-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4841-S4843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              START TREATY\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me speak for a moment with respect to \nthe New START treaty. Strategic arms reductions are very important. We \ndo not think about them very much. We deal with big issues and small \nissues in the Senate. Sometimes the small issues get much more \nattention than the big issues. But one is coming for sure to the floor \nof the Senate that is a very big issue; that is, the Strategic Arms \nReduction Treaty that was negotiated with the Russians. This is really \na big issue and very important. I want to describe why and describe why \nI feel so strongly about it. I have spoken on the floor previously \nabout this, but I want to do it again, describing a Time magazine \narticle from March 11, 2002. The March 11, 2002, Time magazine article \nreferred back to 2001, right after 9/11--It said this:\n\n       For a few harrowing weeks last fall, a group of U.S. \n     officials believed that the worst nightmare of their lives--\n     something even more horrific than 9/11--was about to come \n     true. In October, an intelligence alert went out to a small \n     number of government agencies, including the Energy \n     Department's top-secret Nuclear Emergency Research Team, \n     based in Nevada. The report said that terrorists were thought \n     to have obtained a 10-kiloton nuclear weapon from the Russian \n     arsenal and planned to smuggle it into New York City. ``It \n     was brutal,'' a U.S. official told Time. It was also highly \n     classified and closely guarded. Under the aegis of the \n     Whitehouse's Counterterrorism Security Group . . . the \n     suspected nuke was kept secret so as not to panic the people \n     of New York. Senior FBI officials were not in the loop.\n\n\n[[Page S4842]]\n\n\n  Some while later, Graham Allison, who is an expert on nuclear \nproliferation wrote about this incident in a book titled ``Nuclear \nTerrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe.'' In his book, he \npoints out:\n\n       One month to the day after the attacks of 9/11, a CIA agent \n     codenamed Dragonfire reported that al-Qaida terrorists had \n     stolen a ten kiloton Russian nuclear bomb from the Russian \n     arsenal and may have smuggled it into New York City. Vice \n     President Cheney moved to a secret mountain facility along \n     with several hundred government employees. They were the core \n     of an alternative government that would operate if \n     Washington, DC were destroyed. President Bush dispatched \n     Nuclear Emergency Support Teams to New York to search for the \n     suspected nuclear weapon. To not cause panic, no one in New \n     York City was informed of the threat, not even Mayor \n     Giuliani. After a few weeks, the intelligence community \n     determined that Dragonfire's report was a false alarm.\n\n  But as they did the postmortem on this, they understood that no one \nclaimed it could have been impossible that a nuclear weapon could have \nbeen stolen from the Russian arsenal. No one claimed it would have been \nimpossible--having stolen a Russian nuclear weapon--to smuggle it into \nNew York City or a major American city. No one claimed it would have \nbeen impossible for a terrorist group--who wanted to kill several \nhundred thousand people with a nuclear weapon--to have been able to \ndetonate that nuclear weapon.\n  Now, as I indicated, I describe that as it was described in Time \nmagazine in 2002, and as it was written about in the book by Graham \nAllison, a former Clinton administration official, in his book titled, \n``Nuclear Terrorism: The Ultimate Preventable Catastrophe.'' I describe \nthat and the apoplectic seizure that existed in parts of the U.S. \ngovernment when it was thought that 1 month after 9/11 al-Qaida had \nstolen a nuclear weapon and was prepared to detonate it in an American \ncity. And on that day, we wouldn't have had 3,000-plus Americans \nmurdered, we would have had hundreds of thousands of Americans losing \ntheir lives. Yet that was about one nuclear weapon--one, just one. The \nloss of one nuclear weapon.\n  Now, it turns out it Dragonfire's report wasn't true. The FBI agent \ncodenamed Dragonfire heard it, passed it along, but it turned out it \nwas not accurate. But that was just one nuclear weapon. There are about \n25,000 nuclear weapons on this planet. This chart shows the Union of \nConcerned Scientists' estimate for 2010 estimate that Russia has 15,100 \nnuclear weapons, the United States has 9,400, China about 240, France \n300, Britain 200, and Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea each \nhave some. So 25,000 nuclear weapons, and I have described the terror \nof having just one end up in the hands of a terrorist group. If it ever \nhappens--when it ever happens, God forbid--and hundreds of thousands of \npeople are killed, life on this planet will be changed forever.\n  Now, Mr. President, we have a lot of nuclear weapons on this planet \nof ours, and we understand the consequences of their use. These \npictures from August of 1945 show the consequences of the dropping of \ntwo nuclear weapons--one in Hiroshima and one in Nagasaki. Those \npictures are, all these years later, still very hard to look at. That \nis the consequence of two nuclear weapons.\n  I was recently in Russia visiting a site that we fund in the Congress \nunder the Nunn-Lugar program. I want to show some photographs about \nwhat we have been doing to try to back away from the nuclear threat, to \ntry to see if we can reduce the number of nuclear weapons and the \nnumber of delivery vehicles to deliver those nuclear weapons.\n  This is a photograph of the dismantlement of a Blackjack bomber. This \nBlackjack bomber was a Russian bomber--a Soviet Union bomber prior to \nRussia--that would carry a nuclear weapon that would potentially be \ndropped on the United States, then an adversary during the Cold War. \nYou can see that we dismantled that Russian Blackjack bomber, and this \nis a piece of a wing strut.\n  I ask unanimous consent to show a couple of samples.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. This is a piece of a wing strut of a Russian bomber. We \ndidn't shoot it down. We cut the wing off. I happen to have a piece of \nit. This was happening because our colleagues, Senators Nunn and Lugar, \nput together a program by which we actually paid for the dismantlement \nof Russian bombers.\n  I also have copper wiring from the ground-up copper of the electrical \nwires of a Russian submarine. We didn't sink that submarine. We paid \nmoney to have that submarine destroyed, as part of our agreement with \nRussia to reduce that country's nuclear weapons.\n  This is a hinge from a silo in the Ukraine that previously housed a \nmissile with warheads aimed at the United States. There is now planted \non that ground sunflowers, not missiles, because we paid the cost of \nreducing delivery vehicles and reducing nuclear weapons in the \nstockpile of the former Soviet Union.\n  This is a program that works--a program that is unbelievably \nimportant. And as I and some others viewed these programs in Russia, we \nunderstood again the importance of what we have been doing under the \nNunn-Lugar program: The Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus are now \nnuclear weapons free. That didn't used to be the case. There are no \nnuclear weapons in those three countries. Albania is chemical weapons \nfree. We have deactivated, under the Nunn-Lugar program, 7,500 former \nSoviet nuclear warheads. And the numbers of weapons of mass destruction \nthat have been eliminated, and their delivery vehicles, are 32 \nballistic missile submarines--gone, eliminated; 1,419 long-range \nnuclear missiles; 906 nuclear air-to-surface missiles, and 155 nuclear \nbombers. All of this has been done under a program that very few people \nknow about--the Nunn-Lugar program. It works. It is a great program.\n  But, as I have indicated, there are still thousands and thousands and \nthousands--it is estimated this year 25,000--of nuclear weapons on this \nplanet. So what do we do about that? This administration engaged with \nthe Russians for a new treaty because the old START treaty had expired. \nThis new treaty--the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty--was \nnegotiated over a lengthy period of time. It required a lot of \npatience, a great deal of effort, but this administration stuck with \nit. They negotiated, completed, and signed this treaty.\n  The President of Russia and our President met in Prague, the Czech \nRepublic, and signed this treaty. Now it needs to be ratified by the \nSenate.\n  I want to talk just a bit about the need to do that. I think all of \nus understand the urgency. There are some who feel strongly that \nperhaps we should begin the testing of nuclear weapons. I don't support \nthat. I don't think we should. I think we need to be world leaders on \nthese issues. We have stopped nuclear testing. Others have stopped \nnuclear testing as well, and we ought to continue that posture.\n  There are some who feel we should begin building new nuclear weapons. \nI don't believe we should. That doesn't make any sense. That is the \nwrong signal for us to send to the world.\n  There are some who believe that we need to make additional \ninvestments in the area of life extension programs and investments in \nmaking certain that the nuclear weapons that do exist in the stockpile \nare weapons in which we have the required confidence that those weapons \nare available, if needed. The President has asked that funding to do \nthat be made available.\n\n  I chair the subcommittee that funds those programs, and I believe we \nwill make available what the President requests. It is reasonable, it \nseems to me, to not only proceed--hopefully, on a bipartisan basis--to \naddress something as important as the START treaty, but at the same \ntime make sure that the programs that we have always had--the life \nextension programs and the programs that make sure that we have \nsufficient confidence in the weapons that exist--are funded \nappropriately. That is what the President has recommended in the budget \nthat he has sent to the Congress.\n  It just seems to me there is so much to commend to this Congress the \nneed to ratify an arms control treaty here. Mr. Linton Brooks, the NNSA \nAdministrator under George W. Bush, said this, talking about the newly \nnegotiated treaty and the President's budget request:\n\n       START, as I now understand it, is a good idea on its own \n     merits, but I think for those\n\n[[Page S4843]]\n\n     who think it's only a good idea if you have a strong weapons \n     program, I think this budget ought to take care of that. \n     Coupled with the out-year projections, it takes care of the \n     concerns about the complex and it does very good things about \n     the stockpile and it should keep the labs healthy.\n\n  I don't quote Henry Kissinger very often, but Henry Kissinger says it \npretty well when he says:\n\n       It should be noted I come from the hawkish side of this \n     debate, so I'm not here advocating these measures in the \n     abstract. I try to build them into my perception of the \n     national interest. I recommend ratification of this treaty.\n\n  Henry Kissinger says he recommends ratification of this treaty. And, \nfinally, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Mullen:\n\n       I, the Vice Chairman, and the Joint Chiefs, as well as our \n     combatant commanders around the world, stand solidly behind \n     this new treaty, having had the opportunity to provide our \n     counsel, to make our recommendations, and to help shape the \n     final agreements.\n\n  It is not just us, but it is our children and their children that \nhave a lot at stake with respect to reducing the number of nuclear \nweapons, reducing the delivery vehicles. It is the case that the amount \nof plutonium that will fit in a soda can, the amount of highly enriched \nuranium the size of a couple of grapefruits will produce a nuclear \nweapon that will have devastating consequences. So one of our \nobligations is to try to make sure nuclear material--the material with \nwhich those who wish to make nuclear weapons can make those weapons--\nstays out of the hands of terrorists. That is one of our jobs. We are \nworking very hard on that. We have programs that work on that \nconstantly.\n  Second is to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons. I described \nthe countries that we know have nuclear weapons. Now we have to stop \nthe proliferation and stop other countries from getting nuclear \nweapons. That is our responsibility. We have to be a world leader to do \nthat.\n  As I said, if, God forbid, somehow in the future--5 years, 10 years, \nor 20 years from now--a nuclear weapon is exploded in a major city, and \nhundreds of thousands are killed, life on this planet is not going to \nbe the same. That is why it seems to me that a very important start--\nand this is just a start, not a finish--is to take this treaty that has \nbeen negotiated, bring it to the floor of the Senate, and have this \ndiscussion. I would expect there will be Republicans and Democrats who \nwill come down on the same side of this issue--that it is a better \nworld, a safer world when we meet our responsibility to lead on the \nissues of nonproliferation, when we meet our responsibilities to lead \non the matter of reducing nuclear weapons and reducing delivery \nvehicles.\n  That is what this New START treaty does. It does it in a very \nresponsible way. So my hope will be that in the coming 2 months or so \nthat we will have a robust discussion of the START treaty and have the \ncelebration of having had the debate and had the vote and then \nexclaiming to the world that this was a success--that this treaty was a \nsuccess. Yes, a first step but a success.\n  Beyond this treaty, there will be other negotiations that will take \nus to other areas in reductions. I think, as a result, if we do what we \nshould be expected to do, this can be a safer world.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4843-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4843]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING THE DAILY SPARKS TRIBUNE\n\n  Mr. REID.

According to initial reports, Major \nCulver died of injuries sustained when an improvised explosive device \ndetonated near his vehicle. Major Culver was assigned to the 2nd \nSquadron, 108th Calvary, Army National Guard, Shreveport, LA.\n  My heart goes out to the family of Major Culver, who made the \nultimate sacrifice on behalf of our Nation. Major Culver's wife and \nchildren reside in El Dorado. His mother and father live in Shreveport, \nLA.\n  As a member of the Louisiana National Guard, Major Culver served \nthree tours of duty in Iraq. During his military career, he was awarded \nnumerous service medals and was posthumously awarded two Bronze Stars \nand a Purple Heart, as well as a Combat Action Badge from the State of \nLouisiana.\n  Culver was an active member of the El Dorado community, serving in \nvarious capacities with Boy Scouts, Campfire Girls, Union County 4-H \nFoundation board, Saddle Club, Main Street El Dorado, and the John C. \nCarroll VFW Post 2413, where he was the post commander at the time of \nhis death.\n  Along with all Arkansans, I am grateful for the service and sacrifice \nof all of our military servicemembers and their families. More than \n11,000 Arkansans on Active Duty and more than 10,000 Arkansas \nreservists have served in Iraq or Afghanistan since September 11, 2001.\n  It is the responsibility of our Nation to provide the tools necessary \nto care for our country's returning servicemembers and honor the \ncommitment our Nation made when we sent them into harm's way. Our \ngrateful Nation will not forget them when their military service is \ncomplete.

Mr. President, I rise today to address comments made on \nthe floor of the U.S. Senate on June 8, 2010. The senior Senator from \nMontana accused me of slandering an individual. That individual is \nPresident Obama's nominee to be the next Centers for Medicare and \nMedicaid Services, CMS, Administrator, Dr. Donald Berwick.\n  The Senator from Montana is incorrect. I want the record to \naccurately reflect the foundation on which I made my comments on the \nfloor. I told the Senate that the nominee to be the next CMS \nAdministrator ``loves the British health care system and says we are \ngoing to need to ration care. The new Director of Medicare is planning \nto ration care.''\n  I based my comments solely on historic statements made and articles \nwritten by the nominee about the British health care system and \nrationing care.

I ask unanimous consent that my letter to Senator \nMcConnell dated June 9, 2010, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2010.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Senate Minority Leader,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell: I am requesting that I be consulted \n     before the Senate enters into any unanimous-consent \n     agreements or time limitations regarding S. 3019/H.R. 3695, \n     Billy's Law.\n       I support the goals of this legislation and believe that \n     information regarding missing persons and unidentified \n     remains should be accurate and properly maintained. However, \n     I believe that we can and must do so in a fiscally \n     responsible manner. My concerns are included in, but not \n     limited to, those outlined in this letter.\n       While this bill is well-intentioned, it costs the American \n     people over $64 million. This legislation has received no \n     process in the Senate Judiciary Committee, as it was only \n     recently introduced on February 23, 2010. As a member of the \n     Judiciary Committee, I believe, prior to floor consideration, \n     legislation under the committee's jurisdiction should be \n     processed in regular order. Appropriate hearings and debate \n     in committee markup are essential to all legislation, \n     especially legislation like Billy's Law, which spends \n     significant federal dollars, authorizes new programs and \n     requires the sharing of personally identifiable information \n     between government databases.\n       Although additional resources may be necessary, we should \n     act responsibly by reviewing current operations, evaluating \n     their effectiveness, and then determining the best strategy \n     for addressing the areas with the most need. That cannot be \n     accomplished with constant use of the hotline process. The \n     Congressional Research Service estimates that 94% of all \n     measures passed by the Senate do not receive a roll call \n     vote. The hotline process is even more detrimental to \n     transparency and oversight when legislation, like Billy's \n     Law, is hotlined without going through regular committee \n     order.\n       Moreover, it is irresponsible for Congress to jeopardize \n     the future standard of living of our children by borrowing \n     from future generations. The U.S. national debt is now $13 \n     trillion. That means over $42,000 in debt for each man, woman \n     and child in the United States. A year ago, the national debt \n     was $11.2 trillion. Despite pledges to control spending, \n     Washington adds $4.6 billion to the national debt every \n     single day--that is $3.2 million every single minute.\n       In addition to the above, there are several specific \n     problems with this legislation. First, Billy's Law seeks to \n     authorize the National Missing and Unidentified Persons \n     System (NamUs), an online repository for information about \n     missing persons and unidentified remains. However, this \n     database has been in operation, without Congressional \n     authorization, since 2007. Before we seek to condone an \n     existing program by providing a Congressional authorization, \n     we should perform rigorous oversight of NamUs to determine \n     whether there is existing waste, fraud and abuse or ways to \n     increase its efficiency. Without the opportunity to conduct \n     hearings and committee markup, it is impossible to \n     effectively examine and evaluate the current operation of \n     NamUs.\n       Second, merely to maintain NamUs, Billy's Law authorizes \n     $2.4 million per year for fiscal years 2011 through 2016, \n     totaling $14.4 million, without corresponding offsets. This \n     authorization exceeds the yearly sum of $1.3 million the \n     Department of Justice indicates is necessary to maintain the \n     database. Furthermore, according to the Congressional \n     Research Service, Congress already provides funding for NamUs \n     via the National Institute of Justice and the Community \n     Oriented Policing Service. I am concerned that this bill will \n     enable NamUs to double dip into multiple sources of funding \n     for the same purposes.\n       Third, the bill requires the National Crime Information \n     Center (NCIC) database and NamUs to share information on \n     missing persons and unidentified remains. While the bill \n     requires the Attorney General and Director of the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation (FBI) to establish rules on \n     confidentiality of this information, I remain concerned about \n     the protection of this personally identifiable information.\n       NamUs is accessible not only by law enforcement, but also \n     the public. NamUs is comprised of two smaller databases--the \n     Missing Persons Database and the Unidentified Remains \n     Database. While the Unidentified Remains Database does not \n     allow the public to enter information and restricts certain \n     information from being accessed by the public, the Missing \n     Persons Database allows both the public and law enforcement \n     to submit information about missing persons. There is no way \n     to guarantee the consistency and accuracy of publicly entered \n     information. The ability of NamUs and NCIC to share \n     information via this legislation magnifies these concerns.\n       Fourth, the bill also establishes an Incentive Grants \n     Program to provide law enforcement, coroners, medical \n     examiners and other authorized agencies with grants to \n     facilitate reporting information to both NCIC and NamUs. \n     These grants can be used for very broad purposes, including \n     hiring, contracting and ``other purposes consistent with the \n     goals of this section.'' I believe that state and local law \n     enforcement and other state or locally-run agencies should \n     bear the burden of reporting state and local information. If \n     these databases are, in fact, effective and further the \n     investigations carried out by state and local law \n     enforcement, they should be willing to prioritize funding in \n     their own budgets to utilize the databases accordingly.\n       Furthermore, the task of investigating missing person and \n     unidentified remains cases often falls primarily on state and \n     local law enforcement. As a result, the federal government \n     should not bear the entire cost for either the Incentive \n     Grants Program or the operation of the NamUs database. For \n     the Incentive Grants Program, the bill authorizes $10 million \n     per year for fiscal years 2011 through 2015, totaling $50 \n     million that is not offset by reductions in real spending \n     elsewhere in the federal budget. In addition, there is no \n     limit on the amount that the Attorney General may award for \n     each grant. Rather, the Attorney General has the discretion \n     to determine how much each grantee receives.\n       In addition to offsets for federal spending on these \n     programs, I believe all funding in this legislation should be \n     borne at least equally between the states and the federal \n     government. It is clear that state and local law enforcement \n     will be utilizing NamUs often. In fact, the Incentive Grants \n     Program authorized in this bill is specifically to help state \n     and local entities ``facilitate the process of reporting \n     information regarding missing persons and unidentified \n     remains to the NCIC database and NamUs databases. . . .''\n       While there is no question that law enforcement should \n     endeavor to quickly locate missing persons and return them to \n     their families, the federal government is already making \n     efforts to facilitate this process. Congress should, like \n     many American individuals and companies do with their own \n     resources, evaluate current programs, determine any needs \n     that may exist and prioritize those needs for funding by \n     cutting from the federal budget programs fraught with waste, \n     fraud, abuse and duplication.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Tom A. Coburn, M.D.,\n     United States Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4844-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4844-S4845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING DOROTHY KAMENSHEK\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring \nthe memory of Dorothy Kamenshek who passed away on May 17 at her home \nin Palm Desert, CA. She was 84 years old.\n  Dorothy Kamenshek was born in Norwood, OH, on December 21, 1925. Her \ngifts on the diamond were evident from the time she attended the \ntryouts for an all women's baseball league in Cincinnati while she was \na high school senior. Her performance at the tryouts earned her an \ninvitation to participate in the final tryouts that were held at \nWrigley Field in Chicago. From the Wrigley Field tryouts, Ms. Kamenshek \nwould emerge as one of two women from Cincinnati who were selected to \nplay in the fledgling All-American Girls Professional Baseball League.\n  The All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was the \nbrainchild of Chicago Cubs owner, Phillip Wrigley, who sought to fill \nthe void that had been created by the disbanding of many minor league \nteams as a result of young men who were drafted into the armed services \nduring World War II.\n\n[[Page S4845]]\n\nThe existence of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League \nnearly paralleled the span of Ms. Kamenshek's playing career from 1943-\n1954. During her career, Ms. Kamenshek all-around excellence on and off \nthe field earned her the admiration of many fans and the respect of her \npeers.\n  Ms. Kamenshek was undoubtedly one of the finest players in the All-\nAmerican Girls Professional Baseball League. The league's all-time \nbatting leader with a .292 average, she had a smooth left-handed swing \nthat earned her consecutive batting titles in 1946 and 1947. The \nleadoff hitter for the Rockford Peaches, she used her speed on the base \npaths to create havoc for her opponents as she compiled 657 stolen \nbases during her career. An all-around baseball player, Ms. Kamenshek's \nwork with the glove once prompted former New York Yankees first baseman \nWally Pipp to observe that she was ``the fanciest fielding first \nbaseman that I've ever seen, man or woman.''\n  Ms. Kamenshek would lead her team, the Rockford Peaches, to four \nchampionships before her career was curtailed by a back injury. A \ndriven person who was not going to rest on her laurels, she earned a \nbachelor's degree in physical therapy from Marquette University after \nher baseball career. In 1961, she moved to California where she worked \nas a staff physical therapist, supervisor and chief of therapy services \nfor the Los Angeles County disabled children's services agency. After \nher retirement from Los Angeles County in 1980, she continued to treat \npatients in acute care on a part-time basis for the next 6 years.\n  In 1992, the story of Ms. Kamenshek and the other women who played in \nthe All-American Girls Professional Baseball League was introduced to a \nnew generation of Americans by the popular movie ``A League of Their \nOwn.'' In the movie, the character of Dottie Hinson, played by Geena \nDavis, was presented as the best player in the league and was named \nDottie as a tribute to Ms. Kamenshek, who was affectionately known as \nDottie to her friends. In 1999, Sports Illustrated named Ms. Kamenshek \none of its top 100 female athletes of the 20th century.\n  On the field, Dorothy Kamenshek is widely regarded as the greatest \nfemale baseball player ever. Off the field, her legacy will be one of a \npioneer who, through sheer talent and determination, achieved \nexcellence in a sport that was once deemed to be beyond the physical \ncapacity of females. Dorothy Kamenshek inspired generations of \nAmericans to chip away at the glass ceiling to follow their dreams and \npursue endeavors and careers of their own choosing.\n  She will be dearly missed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4845-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n        100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE FOUNDING OF DANTE, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 100th \nanniversary of the founding of Dante, SD. Small towns like Dante embody \nSouth Dakota values, and are the cornerstone of our State.\n  Dante was founded as a railroad town when a group of farmers were \nconcerned with their ability to haul grain between Wagner and Avon. The \nfarmers approached the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad to set \nup a depot between the towns. After getting a petition signed, the \nrailroad expanded to the newly formed town. Planted in 1907, Dante was \nincorporated in 1912. Originally called Mayo after H.T. Mayo who \ndonated the land to the town, the railroad company objected to the \nname. Mr. Mayo was asked for a name to which he reportedly said, ``Call \nit Dante's Inferno for all I care!'' In 1911, Dante had flourished \nenough to support the Dante Bowling Alley and Pool Hall. The school was \nopened in 1912 and stayed open until 1971.\n  To celebrate the town's anniversary, Dante will be having music, a \nsoftball tournament, games and more. With something for everyone, this \nweekend's celebration is sure to be an enjoyable experience as Dante \ncomes together to celebrate this historic anniversary. I would like to \ncongratulate the people of Dante on reaching this historic milestone, \nand offer them best wishes on the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4845-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4845]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO DR.

Mr. President, today I wish to bring special \nrecognition to Dr. Ann Marie Phillips Southerland.\n  Dr. Southerland has elected to retire from Pensacola Junior College \nafter 42 years of distinguished service. She first joined the faculty \nof the PJC home economics department in 1975 and was promoted as an \nassistant professor in 1978, an associate professor in 1981, a full \nprofessor in 1984 and department head in 1985.\n  Recognizing her devotion to student success and years of excellence \nin teaching, Dr. Southerland was appointed to the position of district \ndirector of vocational education in 1988 and district dean of \nvocational education in 1990. In this capacity, Dr. Southerland \nspearheaded efforts and initiatives to improve curriculum, instruction \nand assessment. She challenged her colleagues to empower students and \nensure they would enter the world with the skills to compete and \nsucceed in the increasingly competitive global marketplace.\n  The success of Dr. Southerland's contributions to Pensacola Junior \nCollege were measurable, and the college appointed her to assistant \nvice president for academic affairs and career education in 2005. Yet \nDr. Southerland's reach has been felt far beyond the academic corridors \nof northwest Florida. She has selflessly dedicated her time, experience \nand energy to causes throughout the State of Florida--serving as a \nmember of the Council of Occupational Deans and working arm in arm with \nher counterparts in all 28 institutions in the Florida College System. \nWhat's more, her extensive body of academic literature has been \npublished in numerous scholarly journals and periodicals.\n  I wish to take this opportunity to commend Dr. Southerland for her \nservice and professionalism. She has been a role model and mentor for \nmany faculty, staff and students at Pensacola Junior College. She has \nmy sincere and heartfelt thanks for her devotion to educating \ntomorrow's leaders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4845-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4845-S4846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             DO THE WRITE THING WRITING CHALLENGE FINALISTS\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the Do the Write Thing Challenge, or \nDtWT, is a national program that provides middle school students across \nthe country with the opportunity to examine some of the most pressing \nissues facing their community. It encourages students to examine and \nconfront the causes and the effects of youth violence through classroom \ndiscussions and writings. The focus is on preventative measures with an \nemphasis on personal responsibility. Since the program's founding in \n1994, hundreds of thousands of students have reaped benefits from this \ncommunity-based approach to addressing these complex and tragic issues.\n  Middle school students from cities across the Nation participated in \nDtWT. These students submitted creative and poignant essays, poems, \nplays, or songs about their personal experiences with youth violence. \nThey wrote about the effect of violence in their lives and about how \nthey can contribute to efforts to eradicate it. Students also pledged \nto carry out their ideas in their daily lives. This strategy, which \nempowers young people to make positive changes in their lives and \ncommunities, has surely had a positive impact on the communities in \nwhich these students reside.\n  Each year, a DtWT Committee made up of business, community, and \ngovernment leaders from each participating jurisdiction reviews the \nwriting samples and selects two national finalists. I am pleased to \nrecognize this year's national finalists from Detroit, Karan Patrick \nand KeJaun Williams. Their creative pieces about youth violence are \nheart-wrenching and timely. Karan and KeJaun wrote personal pieces \nabout the profound impact violence has had on their young lives and \nabout the lasting consequences of their choices. They conveyed a deep \nunderstanding of the result of youth violence. I am impressed by the \nmaturity they displayed\n\n[[Page S4846]]\n\nin confronting this topic and congratulate them on being selected as \nnational finalists.\n  This summer, they will join other DtWT national finalists in \nWashington, DC, for National Recognition Week. While here, they will \nattend a ceremony in their honor. Their work also will be placed \npermanently in the Library of Congress.\n  I invite my colleagues to join me in celebrating the work of the DtWT \nfinalists and the many organizers across the country who facilitated \nopen discussions in schools about youth violence. Their work is an \nessential element in the development of local solutions to youth \nviolence in Michigan and across the Nation, and I applaud their \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4846-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              150TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE CITY OF MANISTIQUE\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the small towns and cities that dot \nthis great Nation are at the core of our country's character and \ncultural fabric. These communities, and the legacy they embody, fashion \nthe great American story through their unique chapters in this ongoing \nnarrative. It is in this spirit that I recognize the sesquicentennial \nanniversary of the founding of the city of Manistique, MI. The \nresidents of this great city will come together to celebrate this \nsignificant milestone with a summer of festivities.\n  This community in the upper peninsula was first named in 1860 by \nCharles Harvey, a businessman who sought to build a small dam on the \nManistique River. He would first name the area Epsport, after his \nwife's family name. In 1879, Epsport was named county seat of \nSchoolcraft county, and a few years later, it was renamed Manistique \nTownship. This area experienced a period of rapid development, \nbeginning in 1872 with the relocation of Weston Lumber Company to \nManistique by its founder, Abijah Weston. The rise of the timber \nindustry spurred the creation of other industries, such as limestone, \nshingles, cooperage, a box factory, a charcoal iron company and a \nhandle factory.\n  Like many small towns and cities in the upper peninsula, Manistique \nhas navigated major shifts in its core economy. The timber industry \npeaked in this region around 1920 and, along with it, the city's \npopulation, boasting close to 10,000 residents, aided also by the \nexpansion of the Soo Line Railroad to the area. As the timber industry \ndeclined, it was replaced by farming, limestone production and a paper \nmill, and after World War II, tourism emerged as a major industry. \nNestled along the northern shore of Lake Michigan where the lake meets \nthe Manistique River, this region offers tourists considerable natural \nbeauty and countless opportunities to experience the outdoors in its \nnatural state, from the shores of Lake Michigan, to the Seney National \nWildlife Refuge, to Hiawatha National Forest, to name a few.\n  Manistique's sesquicentennial anniversary is a tribute to the \nstrength and perseverance of its citizens and to the many that have \nplayed a role in the formation and evolution of this city from its \ninception. I invite my colleagues in the Senate to join me in \nrecognizing this milestone, and I wish the residents of this city \nanother century and a half of achievement and success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4846-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DAVID CURLING\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

As the \nmother of twin boys, I know that reading is the foundation for success \nin the classroom, and I encourage my boys to read not only at school \nbut also at home.

I encourage all Arkansans to make a stop at \ntheir public library today to share in the joy of learning and \nknowledge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4846-4", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4846]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING THE EL DORADO SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I salute the students, \nfaculty, and staff of the El Dorado School District for their \noutstanding efforts to maintain the health and well-being of their \nschool community. The district was recently named the Gold Award Winner \nof the 2010 Arkansas Healthy School Board, in addition to being named \nthe 2010 International PRIDE Team of the Year for their efforts to \nprevent youth drug abuse and violence.\n  El Dorado was named to the Arkansas Healthy School Board for their \nefforts to offer healthier school lunches and healthy food in vending \nmachines. As the mother of two boys, I understand how important it is \nfor parents to make healthy choices for their kids and help them learn \nto make healthy choices for themselves. Obesity is a growing problem \nacross our Nation, and if kids learn good eating habits while they are \nyoung, that knowledge will stay with them throughout their entire \nlives. In addition, kids who are healthy and feel good perform better \nat school and in all areas of their lives.\n  Unfortunately, many families in our country are unable to provide \nhealthy, nutritious meals. More than ever, families are looking to \nprograms like the National School Lunch Program to ensure children's \nnutritional needs are met. My Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 \ninvests $4.5 billion in new child nutrition program funding over the \nnext 10 years, the most historic investment in child nutrition programs \nsince their inception. This investment is fully paid for and will not \nadd to the national debt.\n  I also commend the El Dorado PRIDE Youth Team, which was named the \n2010 International PRIDE Team of the Year. PRIDE Youth Programs, \nformerly Parents Resource Institute for Drug Education, is the Nation's \noldest and largest organization devoted to drug abuse and violence \nprevention through education. The mission of PRIDE is to educate, \npromote, and support drug-free youth.\n  For the past 4 years, the El Dorado PRIDE team has been nominated as \none of the top three teams in the Nation. There are also 30 PRIDE \nmembers named each year to the National Team from all over the country. \nThis year, three El Dorado students--Allison George, Tylor Ritz and \nAmanda York--were named to the national team.\n  Mr. President, I salute the entire El Dorado community for their \nefforts to keep their schools healthy and safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4846-5", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4846-S4847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PHILIP LANDER\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, last Monday, our Nation paused to \nremember\n\n[[Page S4847]]\n\nthe sacrifices that the men and women of our Armed Forces have made \nover the past 235 years. Indeed, Memorial Day is a time to reflect on \nthe freedoms and liberties we enjoy because of the heroic deeds of \nthese brave service members. For those who made it back, many seek to \ncontinue giving back to the nation they love. Today I wish to recognize \none such veteran, Philip Lander, who is the owner of Atlantic Defense \nCompany, a small, service-disabled veteran-owned construction firm in \nmy home State of Maine that provides other veterans with an opportunity \nto find meaningful employment upon their return. For his efforts, Mr. \nLander has been named the Small Business Administration's 2010 Maine \nVeteran Small Business Champion, a truly prestigious honor that only \nbegins to highlight his incredible work to help America's veterans.\n  Indeed, Mr. Lander can lay claim to a distinguished record of service \nto our Nation dating back to 1970, when he enlisted in the U.S. Army \nduring his time at the University of Maine. After 2 years of service, \nhe returned to Maine to complete a degree in agricultural engineering \nduring which time he joined the Air National Guard. Mr. Lander was \ncalled up to active duty during several notable conflicts, including \nOperations Desert Shield and Desert Storm and the Bosnian war in the \n1990s, and was recalled to duty after the tragic events of September \n11, 2001.\n  Mr. Lander founded Atlantic Defense Company in 2005, after retiring \nfrom the U.S. Air Force the year before. Atlantic Defense immediately \ngot to work upon its inception, renovating the well-known Jordan Pond \nHouse in Maine's Acadia National Park, as well as taking on a contract \nfor the New Jersey Air National Guard rebuilding ground support \nequipment. Shortly after the scandal at Walter Reed Army Medical \nCenter, Atlantic Defense sought to help America's veterans receive the \ncare they are entitled to by assisting in the rehabilitation of the \nNation's VA hospital system. The company performed work at several \nhospitals across New England, including Togus in Maine and Westhaven in \nConnecticut.\n  Always seeking to give back to those who have served, Mr. Lander is \ninvolved in the Helmets to Hardhats program, which has the goal of \nhelping veterans of the military, Reserves, and Guard transition from \nactive duty to jobs in the construction industry. His company also \ntransports a medical van to remote spots throughout the northwest \nportion of Maine, to ensure that veterans living in those areas are \nable to receive care from the Togus VA system. Mr. Lander also seeks to \nemploy veterans in his company, which currently has 15 to 20 year-round \nemployees, as well as through subcontracting opportunities with similar \nservice-disabled veteran-owned firms.\n  It has been said of the members of our Nation's Armed Forces that \nsome gave all, but all gave some, and clearly, Philip Lander continues \nto give back even after his longtime career of service to our nation. \nHis generous and selfless efforts to employ fellow veterans and provide \nthem with critical opportunities back home is admirable. I congratulate \nhim on his recognition as the 2010 Maine Veteran Small Business \nChampion, and wish everyone at Atlantic Defense Company success in \nfuture projects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4847-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4847-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4847]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting nomination \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)--\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4847-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4847-S4848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:58 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5026.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nacting through the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, to establish and implement a birth defects prevention, risk \nreduction, and public awareness program; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, today I am proud to introduce the Birth \nDefects Prevention, Risk Reduction, and Awareness Act. This bill would \nensure that women of childbearing age and health care professionals \nhave access to clinical and evidence based information about the risks \nand benefits of drug, chemical, and nutritional exposures during \npregnancy and while a woman is breastfeeding.\n  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding and taking medication for \nchronic diseases such as asthma, hypertension, and epilepsy often have \nquestions about the risks and benefits. Most pregnant women, as we \nwitnessed last year, really want to know what the science indicates on \nwhether they should get vaccinated against H1N1 or the seasonal flu.\n  Oftentimes, women will seek answers to these important questions from \nan established pregnancy and breastfeeding information service. In \nfact, each year over 70,000 women and health care providers contact \nthese information services across the country. These information \nservices provide valuable information that empowers women. In fact, one \nstudy indicated that 78 percent of women who were considering \nterminating otherwise wanted pregnancies due to fears about exposing \ntheir fetus to a medication changed their mind after receiving \nappropriate counseling from a teratology information service.\n  It is not just women who use these services; health care providers, \nincluding physicians and pharmacists, also utilize these pregnancy and \nbreastfeeding information services. A 2009 study found that over 90 \npercent of physicians who use these services indicated that the service \nprovides high quality information that has a significant impact on \nclinical care.\n  In North Carolina, we have the North Carolina Pregnancy Exposure \nRiskline, run out of Mission Health System in Asheville. The North \nCarolina Pregnancy Exposure Riskline fields calls from a variety of \nconstituents, including health care providers, pregnant\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n\nwomen, preconception women, potential adoptive parents, and others. \nEach year, trained genetic counselors answer questions from over 300 \ncallers, who want information on the impact of maternal exposures \nduring pregnancy and while breastfeeding.\n\n  The North Carolina Pregnancy Exposure Riskline provides detailed, \nfactual information to callers on the current available data, and makes \nreferrals to pregnancy registries that are continuing to gather \ninformation so that researchers and health care providers can have the \nbest information for future women. If needed and requested, counselors \nwill refer women to pregnancy resources such as substances treatment \nfacilities or the NC Family Health Resource line, which has led North \nCarolina in information campaigns on the benefits of folic acid and \n``Back to Sleep.''\n  The North Carolina Pregnancy Exposure Riskline also supports the \nNorth Carolina Teratology Information Specialists program to provide \noutreach and education about fetal alcohol syndrome.\n  Although this is an invaluable service for many women, physicians, \nand other health care providers, pregnancy and breastfeeding \ninformation services across the country have been forced to close due \nto insufficient funding.\n  The bill I am introducing today would require the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services, through the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, to implement a birth defects prevention and public \nawareness grant program. Specifically, CDC would initiate a national \nmedia campaign to increase awareness among health care providers and at \nrisk populations about pregnancy and breast feeding information \nservices. Experienced organizations would be eligible to apply for \ngrants: to provide information; and to conduct surveillance and \nresearch of pregnancy exposures that may cause birth defects, \nprematurity or other adverse pregnancy outcomes, and maternal exposures \nthat may cause harm to a breast-fed infant.\n  I am so pleased that the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \nCongress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the March of Dimes, the \nOrganization of Teratology Information Specialists, and the American \nAcademy of Asthma & Immunology are in support of this worthwhile bill.\n  I urge my other colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nbill to provide valuable information about maternal exposures during \npregnancy and while breastfeeding.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Ms. Collins, and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 3480. A bill to amend the Homeland Seeurity Act of 2002 And other \nlaws to enhance the security and resiliency of the cyber and \ncommunications infrastructure of the United States; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nProtecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act of 2010, which I believe \nwould help secure the Nation's cyber networks against attack.\n  The Internet may have started out as a communications oddity some 40 \nyears ago but it is now a necessity of modern life and, sadly, one that \nis under constant attack. Today, Senators Collins, Carper, and I are \nintroducing legislation which we believe would help secure the most \ncritical cyber networks and therefore all Americans.\n  For all of its ``user-friendly'' allure, the Internet can also be a \ndangerous place with electronic pipelines that run directly into \neverything from our personal bank accounts to key infrastructure to \ngovernment and industrial secrets. Our economic security, national \nsecurity and public safety are now all at risk from new kinds of \nenemies--cyber-warriors, cyber-spies, cyberterrorists and cyber-\ncriminals. That risk may be as serious to our homeland security as \nanything we face today.\n  Computer networks at the Departments of Defense are being probed \nhundreds of thousands of times a day, and networks at the Departments \nof State, Homeland Security and Commerce, as well as NASA and the \nNational Defense University, have all suffered ``major intrusions by \nunknown foreign entities,'' according to reports.\n  Key networks that control vital infrastructure, like the electric \ngrid, have been probed, possibly giving our enemies information that \ncould be used to plunge us into darkness at the press of a button from \nacross an ocean. Banks have had millions and millions of dollars stolen \nfrom accounts by cyber-bandits who have never been anywhere near the \nbanks themselves.\n  In a report by McAfee--a computer security company, about 54 percent \nof the executives of critical infrastructure companies surveyed said \ntheir companies had been the victims of denial of service attacks or \nnetwork infiltration by organized crime groups, terrorists, and other \nnation-states. The downtime to recover from these attacks can cost $6 \nmillion to $8 million a day.\n  Our present efforts at securing these vital but sprawling government \nand private sector networks have been disjointed, understaffed and \nunderfinanced. We have not operated with the sense of urgency that is \nnecessary to protect Americans' cyberspace, which the President has \ncorrectly described as a ``strategic national asset.''\n  Our bill would bring these disjointed efforts together so that the \nfederal government and the private sector can coordinate their \nactivities and work off the same playbook.\n  While President Obama's creation of a cyber-security coordinator \ninside the White House was a step in the right direction, we need to \nmake that position permanent, transparent and accountable to Congress \nand the American people.\n  So, our proposal would create a Senate-confirmed White House cyber-\nsecurity coordinator whose job would be to lead all federal cyber-\nsecurity efforts; develop a national strategy--that incorporates all \nelements of cyberspace policy, including military, law enforcement, \nintelligence, and diplomatic; give policy advice to the President; and \nresolve interagency disputes.\n\n  The Director of the Office of Cyberspace Policy would oversee all \nrelated federal cyberspace activities to ensure efficiency and \ncoordination and would report regularly to Congress to ensure \ntransparency and oversight.\n  Our legislation also would create a National Center for Cybersecurity \nan Communications, NCCC, within the Department of Homeland Security, \nDHS, to elevate and strengthen the Department's cyber security \ncapabilities and authorities. The NCCC would be run by a Senate-\nconfirmed Director who would have the authority and resources to work \nwith the rest of the Federal Government to protect public and private \nsector cyber networks.\n  DHS has shown that vulnerabilities in key private sector networks--\nlike utilities and communications systems--could bring our economy to \nits knees if attacked or commandeered by a foreign power or cyber-\nterrorists. But other than pointing out a vulnerability, DHS has lacked \nthe power to do anything about it. Our legislation would give DHS the \nauthority to ensure that our nation's most critical infrastructure is \nprotected from cyber attack.\n  Defense of our cyber networks will only be successful if industry and \ngovernment work together, so this legislation sets up a collaborative \nprocess where the best ideas of the private sector and the government \ncan be used to meet a baseline set of security requirements that DHS \nwould oversee.\n  Specifically, the NCCC would work with the private sector to \nestablish risk-based security requirements that strengthen the cyber \nsecurity for the nation's most critical infrastructure, such as vital \ncomponents of the electric grid, telecommunications networks, and \nfinancial sector that, if disrupted, would result in a national or \nregional catastrophe. Owners and operators of critical infrastructure \ncovered under the act could choose which security measures to implement \nto meet these risk-based performance requirements. The act would \nprovide some liability protections to owners/operators who demonstrate \ncompliance with the new risk-based security requirements.\n  Covered critical infrastructure must also report significant breaches \nto the NCCC to ensure the federal government has a complete picture of \nthe security of these networks. In return, the NCCC would share \ninformation, including threat analysis, with owners and operators \nregarding risks to their networks. The NCCC would also produce and\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\nshare useful warning, analysis, and threat information with other \nFederal agencies, State and local governments, and international \npartners.\n  To increase security across the private sector more broadly, the NCCC \nwould collaborate with the private sector to develop best practices for \ncyber security. By promoting best practices and providing voluntary \ntechnical assistance as resources permit, the NCCC would help improve \ncyber security across the Nation. Information the private sector shares \nwith the NCCC would be protected from public disclosure, and private \nsector owners and operators may obtain security clearances to access \ninformation necessary to protect the IT networks the American people \ndepend upon.\n  Thanks to great work by Senator Carper, our legislation would update \nthe Federal Information Security Management Act--or FISMA--to require \ncontinuous monitoring and protection of our federal networks and do \naway with the paper-based reporting system that currently exists. The \nact also would codify and strengthen DHS authorities to establish \n0 complete situational awareness for Federal networks and develop tools \nto improve resilience of Federal Government systems and networks.\n\n  In the event of an attack--or threat of an attack--that could have \ncatastrophic consequences to our economy, national security or public \nsafety, our bill would give the President the authority to impose \nemergency measures on a select group of the most critical \ninfrastructure to preserve their cyber networks and assets and protect \nour country and the American people. These emergency measures would \nautomatically expire within 30 days unless the President ordered an \nextension.\n  These measures would be developed in consultation with the private \nsector and would apply if the President has credible evidence a cyber \nvulnerability is being exploited or is about to be exploited. If \npossible, the President must notify Congress in advance about the \nthreat and the emergency measures that would be taken to mitigate it. \nAny emergency measures imposed must be the least disruptive necessary \nto respond to the threat. The bill does not authorize any new \nsurveillance authorities, or permit the government to ``take over'' \nprivate networks.\n  Of course, DHS would need a lot of talented people to accomplish \nthese missions, and our bill gives it the flexibility to recruit, hire, \nand retain the experts it would need to be successful. Our bill would \nrequire the Office of Personal Management to reform the way cyber \nsecurity personnel are recruited, hired, and trained and would provide \nDHS with temporary hiring and pay flexibilities to assist in the quick \nestablishment of the NCCC.\n  Finally, our legislation would require the Federal Government to \ndevelop and implement a strategy to ensure that almost $80 billion of \nthe information technology products and services it purchases each year \nare secure and do not provide our adversaries with a backdoor into our \nnetworks.\n  More specifically, the act would require development of a \ncomprehensive supply chain risk management strategy to address risks \nand threats to the information technology products and services the \nfederal government relies upon. This strategy would allow agencies to \nmake informed decisions when purchasing IT products and services. This \nprovision would be implemented through the Federal Acquisition \nRegulation, requiring contracting officers to consider the security \nrisks inherent in agency IT procurements. The value of this approach is \nthat once security features are developed to protect federal networks, \nprivate sector customers may be able to purchase that same level of \nsecurity in the products they buy.\n  The need for this legislation is both obvious and urgent.\n  A report by the bipartisan Center for Strategic and International \nStudies, CSIS, concluded that ``we face a long-term challenge in \ncyberspace from foreign intelligence agencies and militaries, criminals \nand others, and losing this struggle would wreak serious damage on the \neconomic health and national security of the United States.''\n  Given these stakes, Senators Collins, Carper, and I are confident our \ncolleagues will join with us and pass the ``Protecting Cyberspace as a \nNational Asset Act'' in the 110th Congress.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to join Senators Lieberman and \nCarper in introducing the Protecting Cyberspace as a National Asset Act \nof 2010. This vital legislation would fortify the government's efforts \nto safeguard America's cyber networks from attack. It would build a \npublic/private partnership to promote national cyber security \npriorities. It would strengthen the government's ability to set, \nmonitor compliance with, and enforce standards and policies for \nsecuring Federal civilian systems and the sensitive information they \ncontain.\n  The marriage of increasingly robust computer technology to expanding \nand nearly instantaneous global telecommunications networks is a truly \nseismic event in human history. This information revolution touches \neverything, from personal relationships and entertainment to commerce, \nscientific research, and the most sensitive national security \ninformation. Cyberspace is a place of great, even unparalleled, power.\n  But, to tweak the familiar saying, with great power comes great \nvulnerability. Cyberspace is under increasing assault on all fronts: \ncyber vandalism, cyber crime, cyber sabotage, and cyber espionage. \nAcross the world at this moment, computer networks are being hacked, \nprobed, and infiltrated relentlessly. The purpose of these cyber \nexploits ranges from simple mischief and massive theft to societal \nmayhem and geopolitical advantage.\n  In February, Dennis Blair, the former Director of National \nIntelligence, gave this chilling assessment before the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence:\n  ``Malicious cyber activity is occurring on an unprecedented scale \nwith extraordinary sophistication. While both the threats and \ntechnologies associated with cyberspace are dynamic, the existing \nbalance in network technology favors malicious actors, and is likely to \ncontinue to do so for the foreseeable future.''\n  Consider these sobering facts:\n  Cyber crime costs our national economy nearly $8 billion annually.\n  Hackers can operate in relative safety and anonymity from a laptop or \ndesktop anywhere in the world. The expanding capabilities of wireless \nhand-held devices strengthen this cloak of cyber invisibility.\n  As our national and global economies become ever more intertwined, \ncyber terrorists have greater potential to attack high-value targets. \nFrom anywhere in the world, they could disrupt telecommunications \nsystems, shut down electric power grids, or freeze financial markets. \nWith sufficient know-how and a few keystrokes, they could cause \nbillions of dollars in damage and put thousands of lives in jeopardy.\n  As the hackers' techniques advance, the number of hacking attempts is \nexploding. Just this March, the Senate's Sergeant at Arms reported that \nthe computer systems of Congress and Executive Branch agencies now are \nunder cyber attack an average of 1.8 billion times per month.\n  Recent examples of cyber attacks are myriad and disturbing:\n  Press reports a year ago stated that China and Russia had penetrated \nthe computer systems of America's electrical grid. The hackers \nallegedly left behind malicious hidden software that could be activated \nlater to disrupt the grid during a war or other national crisis.\n  At about the same time, we learned that, beginning in 2007 and \ncontinuing well into 2008, hackers repeatedly broke into the computer \nsystems of the Pentagon's $300-billion Joint Strike Fighter project. \nThey stole crucial information about the Defense Department's costliest \nweapons program ever.\n  In 2007, the country of Estonia was attacked in cyberspace. A 3-week \nonslaught of botnets overwhelmed the computer systems of the nation's \nparliament, government ministries, banks, telecommunications networks, \nand news organizations. This attack on Estonia is a wake-up call that \nhas yet to be sufficiently heeded.\n  The private sector is also under attack. In January, Google announced \nthat attacks originating in China had targeted its systems as well as \nthe networks of more than 30 other companies. The attacks on Google \nsought to access the email accounts of Chinese\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\nhuman rights activists. For the other companies, lucrative information, \nsuch as critical corporate data and software source codes, were \ntargeted.\n  Last year, cyber thieves secretly implanted circuitry into keypads \nsold to British supermarkets, which were then used to steal account \ninformation and PIN numbers. This same tactic was used against a large \nsupermarket chain in Maine, compromising more than 4 million credit \ncards.\n  Nor are small businesses immune. Last summer, a small Maine \nconstruction firm found that cyber crooks had stolen nearly $600,000 \nthrough an elaborate scheme involving dozens of coconspirators \nthroughout the United States.\n  These attacks, and the hundreds like them that are occurring at any \ngiven time whether on our government or private sector systems, have \nushered us into a new age of cyber crime and, indeed, cyber warfare. \nThey underscore the high priority we must give to the security of our \ninformation technology systems.\n  The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, exposed the \nvulnerability of our nation to catastrophic attacks. Since that \nterrible day, we have done much to protect potential targets such as \nports, chemical facilities, transportation systems, water supplies, \ngovernment buildings, and other vital assets. We cannot afford to wait \nfor a ``cyber 9/11'' before our government finally realizes the \nimportance of protecting our digital resources, limiting our \nvulnerabilities, and mitigating the consequences of penetrations of our \nnetworks.\n  Chairman Lieberman and I have held a number of hearings on cyber \nsecurity in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. Senator Carper has been similarly active, particularly on \nexploring modifications to the Federal Information Security Management \nAct that are designed to enhance protections of Federal networks and \ninformation.\n  From our examinations of this issue, we know that there are threats \nto and vulnerabilities in our cyber networks. We also know that the \ntactics used to exploit these vulnerabilities are constantly evolving \nand growing increasingly dangerous. Now, it is time to take action. A \nstrong and sustained Federal effort to promote cyber security is a key \ncomponent of effective deterrence.\n  For too long, our approach to cyber security has been disjointed and \nuncoordinated. This cannot continue. The United States requires a \ncomprehensive cyber security strategy backed by aggressive \nimplementation of effective security measures. There must be strong \ncoordination among law enforcement, intelligence agencies, the \nmilitary, and the private owners and operators of critical \ninfrastructure.\n  This bill would establish the essential point of coordination. The \nOffice of Cyberspace Policy in the Executive Office of the President \nwould be run by a Senate-confirmed Director who would advise the \nPresident on all cyber security matters. The Director would lead and \nharmonize Federal efforts to secure cyberspace and would develop a \nnational strategy that incorporates all elements of cyber security \npolicy, including military, law enforcement, intelligence, and \ndiplomacy. The Director would oversee all Federal activities related to \nthe national strategy to ensure efficiency and coordination. The \nDirector would report regularly to Congress to ensure transparency and \noversight.\n  To be clear, the White House official would not be another \nunaccountable czar. The Cyber Director would be a Senate-confirmed \nposition and thus would testify before Congress. The important \nresponsibilities given to the Director of the Office of Cyberspace \nPolicy related to cybersecurity are similar to the responsibilities of \nthe current Director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.\n  The Cyber Director would advise the President and coordinate efforts \nacross the Executive Branch to protect and improve our cybersecurity \nposture and communications networks. By working with a strong \noperational and tactical partner at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Director would help improve the security of Federal and \nprivate sector networks.\n  This strong DHS partner would be the National Center for \nCybersecurity and Communications, or Cyber Center. It would be located \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security to elevate and strengthen \nthe Department's cyber security capabilities and authorities. This \nCenter also would be led by a Senate-confirmed Director.\n  The Cyber Center, anchored at DHS, with a strong and empowered \nleader, will close the coordination gaps that currently exist in our \ndisjointed federal cyber security efforts. For day-to-day operations, \nthe Center would use the resources of DHS, and the Center Director \nwould report directly to the Secretary of Homeland Security. On \ninteragency matters related to the security of federal networks, the \nDirector would regularly advise the President--a relationship similar \nto the Director of the NCTC on counterterrorism matters or the Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff on military issues. These dual \nrelationships would give the Center Director sufficient rank and \nstature to interact effectively with the heads of other departments and \nagencies, and with the private sector.\n  Congress has dealt with complex challenges involving the need for \ninteragency coordination in the past with a similar construct. We have \nestablished strong leaders with supporting organizational structures to \ncoordinate and implement action across agencies, while recognizing and \nrespecting disparate agency missions.\n  The establishment of the National Counterterrorism Center within the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence is a prime example of a \nsuccessful reorganization that fused the missions of multiple agencies. \nThe Director of NCTC is responsible for the strategic planning of joint \ncounterterrorism operations, and in this role reports to the President. \nWhen implementing the information analysis, integration, and sharing \nmission of the Center, the Director reports to the Director of National \nIntelligence. These dual roles provide access to the President on \nstrategic, interagency matters, yet provide NCTC with the structural \nsupport and resources of the office of the DNI to complete the day-to-\nday work of the NCTC. The DHS Cyber Center would replicate this \nsuccessful model for cyber security.\n  As we have seen repeatedly, from the financial crisis to the \nenvironmental catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico, what happens in the \nprivate sector does not always affect just the private sector. The \nramifications for government and for the taxpayers often are enormous.\n  This bill would establish a public/private partnership to improve \ncyber security. Working collaboratively with the private sector, the \nCenter would produce and share useful warning, analysis, and threat \ninformation with the private sector, other Federal agencies, \ninternational partners, and state and local governments. By developing \nand promoting best practices and providing voluntary technical \nassistance to the private sector, the Center would improve cyber \nsecurity across the nation. Best practices developed by the Center \nwould be based on collaboration and information sharing with the \nprivate sector. Information shared with the Center by the private \nsector would be protected.\n  With respect to the owners and operators of our most critical systems \nand assets, the bill would mandate compliance with certain risk-based \nperformance requirements to close security gaps. These requirements \nwould apply to vital components of the electric grid, \ntelecommunications networks, financial systems, or other critical \ninfrastructure systems that could cause a national or regional \ncatastrophe if disrupted.\n  This approach would be similar to the current model that DHS employs \nwith the chemical industry. Rather than setting specific standards, DHS \nwould employ a risk-based approach to evaluating cyber vulnerabilities, \nand the owners and operators of covered critical infrastructure would \ndevelop a plan for protecting those vulnerabilities and mitigating the \nconsequences of an attack.\n  These owners and operators would be able to choose which security \nmeasures to implement to meet applicable risk-based performance \nrequirements. The bill does not authorize any new surveillance \nauthorities or permit the government to ``take over'' private networks. \nThis model would allow for continued\n\n[[Page S4855]]\n\ninnovation and dynamism that are fundamental to the success of the IT \nsector.\n  The bill would provide limited liability protections to the owners \nand operators of covered critical infrastructure that comply with the \nnew risk-based performance requirements. Covered critical \ninfrastructure also would be required to report certain significant \nbreaches affecting vital system functions to the center. These reports \nwould help ensure that the Federal Government has comprehensive \nawareness of the security risks facing these critical networks.\n  If a cyber attack is imminent or occurring, the bill would provide a \nresponsible framework, developed in coordination with the private \nsector, for the President to authorize emergency measures to protect \nthe Nation's most critical infrastructure. The President would be \nrequired to notify Congress in advance of the declaration of a national \ncyber emergency, or as soon thereafter as possible. This notice would \ninclude the nature of the threat, the reason existing protective \nmeasures are insufficient to respond to the threat, and the emergency \nactions necessary to mitigate the threat. The emergency measures would \nbe limited in duration and scope.\n  Any emergency actions directed by the President during the 30-day \nperiod covered by the declaration must be the least disruptive means \nfeasible to respond to the threat. Liability protections would apply to \nowners and operators required to implement these measures, and if other \nmitigation options were available, owners and operators could propose \nthose alternative measures to the Director and, once approved, \nimplement those in lieu of the mandatory emergency measures.\n  The center also would share information, including threat analysis, \nwith owners and operators of critical infrastructure regarding risks \naffecting the security of their sectors. The center would work with \nsector-specific agencies and other Federal agencies with existing \nregulatory authority to avoid duplication of requirements, to use \nexisting expertise, and to ensure government resources are employed in \nthe most efficient and effective manner.\n  With regard to Federal networks, the Federal Information Security \nManagement Act--known as FISMA--gives the Office of Management and \nBudget broad authority to oversee agency information security measures. \nIn practice, however, FISMA is frequently criticized as a ``paperwork \nexercise'' that offers little real security and leads to a disjointed \ncyber security regime in which each Federal agency haphazardly \nimplements its own security measures.\n  The bill we introduce today would transform FISMA from paper-based to \nreal-time responses. It would codify and strengthen DHS authorities to \nestablish complete situational awareness for Federal networks and \ndevelop tools to improve resilience of Federal Government systems and \nnetworks.\n  The legislation also would take advantage of the Federal Government's \nmassive purchasing power to help bring heightened cyber security \nstandards to the marketplace. Specifically, the Director of the Center \nwould be charged with developing a supply chain risk management \nstrategy applicable to Federal procurements. This strategy would \nemphasize the security of information systems from development to \nacquisition and throughout their operational life cycle.\n  While the Director should not be responsible for micromanaging \nindividual procurements or directing investments, we have seen far too \noften that security is not a primary concern when agencies procure \ntheir IT systems. Recommending security investments to OMB and \nproviding strategic guidance on security enhancements early in the \ndevelopment and acquisition process will help ``bake in'' security. \nCyber security can no longer be an afterthought in our government \nagencies.\n  These improvements in Federal acquisition policy should have \nbeneficial ripple effects in the larger commercial market. As a large \ncustomer, the Federal Government can contract with companies to \ninnovate and improve the security of their IT services and products. \nWith the Government's vast purchasing power, these innovations can \nestablish new security baselines for services and products offered to \nthe private sector and the general public.\n  Finally, the legislation would direct the Office of Personnel \nManagement to reform the way cyber security personnel are recruited, \nhired, and trained to ensure that the Federal Government and the \nprivate sector have the talent necessary to lead this national effort \nand protect its own networks. The bill would also provide DHS with \ntemporary hiring and pay flexibilities to assist in the establishment \nof the center.\n  Some have suggested that this effort can be led from the White House \nalone--why create a new center at DHS and two Senate-confirmed Director \npositions? One of the great lessons of 9/11 is that true security \ndemands aggressive oversight, expert evaluation, and thorough testing \nof systems. There must be constant, real-time monitoring of security \nand analysis of threats. This task requires much more than a cyber \nczar. It requires strong civilian counterparts to the Secretary of \nDefense and the Director of National Intelligence. These Directors, at \nthe White House and at DHS, would serve as those counterparts.\n  The National Security Agency and other intelligence agencies possess \nenormous skills and resources, but privacy and civil liberties demands \npreclude these agencies from shouldering a leadership role in the \nsecurity of our civilian information technology systems. The \nintelligence community must play a critical part in providing threat \ninformation, but it cannot lead the cyber security effort.\n  We are all acutely aware that there are those who seek to do harm to \nthis country and to our people. If hackers can nearly bring Estonia to \nits knees through cyber attacks, infiltrate our military's most \nclosely-guarded project, and, in the case of Google, hack the computers \nowned and operated by some of the world's most successful computer \nexperts, we must assume even more spectacular and potentially \ndevastating attacks lie ahead.\n  We must be ready. It is vitally important that we build a strong \npublic-private partnership to protect cyberspace. It is a vital engine \nof our economy, our government, our country and our future. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this crucial legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CARDIN:\n  S. 3481. A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nclarify Federal responsibility for stormwater pollution; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, in recent weeks the issue of polluted \nstormwater runoff from federal properties has again gained significant \nattention. I continue to have grave concerns about the failure of the \nFederal Government to pay localities for reasonable costs associated \nwith the control and abatement of pollution that is originating on its \nproperties. At stake is a fundamental issue of equity: polluters should \nbe financially responsible for the pollution that they cause. That \nincludes the Federal Government.\n  Today I am introducing legislation that makes it clear. Uncle Sam \nmust pay his bills just like every other American.\n  Annually hundreds of thousands of pounds of pollutants wash off the \nhardened surfaces in urban areas and into local rivers and streams, \nthreatening the health of our citizens and causing significant \nenvironmental degradation. A one-acre parking lot produces about 16 \ntimes the volume of runoff that comes from a one-acre meadow. These \npollutants include heavy metals, nitrogen and phosphorous, oil and \ngrease, pesticides, bacteria, including deadly\ne. coli, sediment, toxic chemicals, and debris. Indeed, stormwater \nrunoff is the largest source sector for many imperiled bodies of water \nacross the country. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, \nstormwater pollution affects all types of water bodies including in \norder of severity; ocean shoreline, estuaries such as the Chesapeake \nBay, Great Lakes shorelines, lakes and rivers. Degraded aquatic \nhabitats are found everywhere that stormwater enters local waterways.\n  On October 5, 2009, President Obama issued a Federal Executive order \non sustainability which set goals for Federal agencies and focused on \nmaking improvements in their environmental, energy and economic \nperformance.\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\nAmong other requirements, the order specifically requires the \nimplementation of the stormwater provisions of the Energy Independence \nand Security Act of 2007, section 438.\n  I am the author of that provision, which requires the Federal \nGovernment to maintain the predevelopment hydrology ``to the maximum \nextent practicable'' of all new building sites or major renovations. \nThis requirement echoed the provision in the President's Chesapeake Bay \nProtection and Restoration Executive Order issued on May 12, 2009. In \nthe final Strategy for Protecting and Restoring the Chesapeake Bay \nWatershed, issued on the one-year anniversary of the Executive Order, \neach Federal agency is being called upon to implement ``the stormwater \nrequirements for new development and redevelopment in Section 438 of \nthe Energy Independence and Security Act. . .'' (pp. 33-34). These \nparallel Federal stormwater management requirements are explicit \nrecognition of the importance of controlling and managing stormwater \npollution from Federal properties.\n  As EPA requires more communities to address stormwater pollution \nthrough Clean Water Act required Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System \npermits, these communities are responding with a variety of fee-based \nmanagement systems that will allow them to mitigate, manage and prevent \nthis type of pollution.\n  The EPA requires National Pollution Discharge Elimination Permits for \nlarge communities. The President has issued two Executive Orders that \ndirectly note the need to address this type of pollution ``to the \nmaximum extent practicable.'' Clearly, these actions demonstrate that \nthe administration recognizes the importance of dealing adequately with \nstormwater pollution.\n  I believe that this administration recognizes its responsibility to \nmanage the stormwater pollution that comes off Federal properties. But \nthat responsibility needs to translate into payments to the local \ngovernments that are forced to deal with this pollution. That \ncommitment needs to be more than an Executive order. Adopting the \nlegislation that I am introducing today will remove all ambiguity about \nthe responsibility of the Federal Government to pay these normal and \ncustomary stormwater fees.\n  This is a matter of basic equity. I call upon all of my colleagues to \njoin me in supporting this simple legislative remedy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill he \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3481\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. FEDERAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR STORMWATER POLLUTION.\n\n       Section 313 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 \n     U.S.C. 1323) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(c) Federal Responsibility for Stormwater Pollution.--\n     Reasonable service charges described in subsection (a) \n     include reasonable fees or assessments made for the purpose \n     of stormwater management in the same manner and to the same \n     extent as any nongovernmental entity.\n       ``(d) No Treatment as Tax or Levy.--A fee or assessment \n     described in this section--\n       ``(1) shall not be considered to be a tax or other levy \n     subject to an assertion of sovereign immunity; and\n       ``(2) may be paid using appropriated funds.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 3482. A bill to provide for the development of solar pilot project \nareas on public land in Lincoln County, Nevada; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the American Solar \nEnergy Pilot Leasing Act of 2010. Solar energy development is a \ncritical factor in creating jobs and making the United States energy \nindependent. This legislation will provide a pilot program for the \nDepartment of the Interior to develop a solar leasing program in \nNevada.\n  The Secretary of the Interior, though the Bureau of Land Management, \nBLM, is currently developing a west wide solar energy program based on \nexisting laws and regulations. The BLM, however, does not currently \nhave the legal authority to lease public lands for solar development. \nThis bill will establish, in Lincoln County, the first Federal solar \nleasing program in the U.S., which will serve as a pilot project for \nthe Department of the Interior in order to guide development of solar \nleasing throughout the west in the years to come.\n  The American Solar Energy Pilot Leasing Act designates two solar \ndevelopment zones in Lincoln County for commercial solar energy \ndevelopment. The 10,945 acre Dry Lake zone and the 2,845 acre Delamar \nValley zone are within high solar potential areas identified by the BLM \nand were selected by Lincoln County based on extensive public input. \nSince the solar zones border the Southwest Intertie Project, SWIP, \ntransmission corridor, these projects will create the opportunity for \nsouthern Nevada and California to tap directly into Lincoln County's \nabundant renewable power resources.\n  Our bill directs the agency to consult with the County and local \nstakeholders before offering both parcels for lease not more than 60 \ndays after the bill becomes law. In order to ensure efficient and wise \ndevelopment throughout the west, the BLM is also directed to establish \ndiligent development requirements to ensure leased areas are \nefficiently developed and to promulgate regulations to guide \ndevelopment of the burgeoning solar leasing program.\n  The act directs the BLM to set a royalty rate at a level that will \nencourage efficient production of solar energy and ensure a fair return \nto the public for the necessary development of the public lands. As \npart of this program, the BLM is given the flexibility to charge a \nlower royalty, or even no royalty, for up to five years after energy \ngeneration begins as an incentive to promote the maximum generation of \nsolar energy.\n  Royalties and fees from these solar leasing pilot projects will be \ndisbursed into four accounts. Thirty-five percent will be deposited \ninto the Renewable Energy Mitigation Fish and Wildlife Fund--\nestablished by this act to protect and restore wildlife and their \nhabitat and to implement the Land and Water Conservation Fund in \nNevada. The State of Nevada and Lincoln County will each receive 25 \npercent of the collected royalties and fees. The last 15 percent will \nbe directed to the BLM to fund renewable energy permit processing over \nthe next 10 years. At the end of that 10-year period, this 15 percent \nwill be directed to the Renewable Energy Mitigation Fish and Wildlife \nFund, in addition to the 35 percent initially set aside for this \naccount.\n  As you know, I have been a longtime champion for the development of \nclean, renewable energy resources. Nevada has unparalleled potential \nfor solar energy development and is poised to lead our Nation in clean \nenergy development and innovation. This is a significant step toward \nmoving our country away from dirty fossil fuels and creating a new job \nmarket in the west. The model established by this legislation will also \nreinvest a responsible portion of the royalties and fees from solar \nenergy development into the states and rural communities whose land is \nbeing used to power our Nation.\n  I would like to thank Lincoln County and a great number of sportsmen, \nranchers, and conservationists who have helped us shape this \nlegislation. I am pleased to bring this bill to the committee and I \nlook forward to working with Chairman Bingaman, Ranking Member \nMurkowski and the other distinguished members to move this bill through \nthe legislative process.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3482\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 549\n\n       Whereas, on June 9, 2010, the Chicago Blackhawks hockey \n     team won the Stanley Cup;\n       Whereas the 2010 Stanley Cup win is the first Stanley Cup \n     win for the Blackhawks since 1961, when John F. Kennedy was \n     president and the Peace Corps was first established;\n       Whereas the Blackhawks joined the National Hockey League in \n     1926 and have a rich history in the League;\n       Whereas the Blackhawks were 1 of the original 6 teams in \n     the National Hockey League;\n       Whereas, during a very difficult period for the National \n     Hockey League, the Blackhawks remained a strong and \n     competitive team, winning the Stanley Cup in 1934, 1938, and \n     1961;\n       Whereas the Stanley Cup championship appearance in 2010 is \n     the first for the Blackhawks since 1992;\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\n       Whereas the Blackhawks posted a regular season record of \n     52-22-8, and the team dominated opponents during the \n     playoffs, with 12 wins and only 4 losses, including a sweep \n     of the number 1-seeded San Jose Sharks to win the Western \n     Conference championship and advance to the Stanley Cup \n     finals;\n       Whereas General Manager Stan Bowman, Head Coach Joel \n     Quenneville, President John F. McDonough, and owner Rocky \n     Wirtz have put together and led a great organization;\n       Whereas several Blackhawks players competed in the Olympic \n     games and faithfully returned to the Blackhawks to help \n     secure a championship, including--\n       (1) Patrick Kane, who played for the United States;\n       (2) Jonathan Toews, Brent Seabrook, and Duncan Keith, who \n     played for Canada; and\n       (3) Tomas Kopecky and Marian Hossa, who played for \n     Slovakia;\n       Whereas all 34 active players, whose shared goal was to end \n     the 49-year championship drought, collectively contributed to \n     a victorious season, including Kyle Beach, Bryan Bickell, \n     Dave Bolland, Nick Boynton, Troy Brouwer, Adam Burish, Dustin \n     Byfuglien, Brian Campbell, Brian Connelly, Corey Crawford, \n     Jassen Cullimore, Jake Dowell, Ben Eager, Colin Fraser, \n     Jordan Hendry, Niklas Hjalmarsson, Marian Hossa, Cristobal \n     Huet, Kim Johnsson, Patrick Kane, Duncan Keith, Tomas \n     Kopecky, Andrew Ladd, Shawn Lalonde, John Madden, Antti \n     Niemi, Danny Richmond, Brent Seabrook, Patrick Sharp, Jack \n     Skille, Brent Sopel, Jonathan Toews, Hannu Toivonen, and Kris \n     Versteeg;\n       Whereas the 2010 Blackhawks players follow in the giant \n     footsteps of the great players in Blackhawk history who have \n     had their numbers retired, including Glenn Hall (#1), Keith \n     Magnuson (#3), Pierre Pilote (#3), Bobby Hull (#9), Denis \n     Savard (#18), Stan Mikita (#21), and Tony Esposito (#35);\n       Whereas the city of Chicago welcomes the first championship \n     in the city in 5 years with open arms;\n       Whereas a new generation of young fans in Chicago and \n     around the State of Illinois are discovering the joy of \n     championship hockey; and\n       Whereas the Nashville Predators, Vancouver Canucks, San \n     Jose Sharks, and the Philadelphia Flyers proved to be worthy \n     and honorable adversaries and also deserve recognition: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) congratulates the Chicago Blackhawks on winning the \n     2010 Stanley Cup;\n       (2) commends the fans, players, and management of the \n     Philadelphia Flyers for allowing the Chicago Blackhawks and \n     the many supporters of the Chicago Blackhawks to celebrate \n     the first Stanley Cup win for the team in 49 years at the \n     Wachovia Center, the arena of the Philadelphia Flyers; and\n       (3) respectfully directs the Enrolling Clerk of the Senate \n     to transmit an enrolled copy of this resolution to--\n       (A) the 2010 Chicago Blackhawks hockey organization; and\n       (B) the Blackhawks owner Rocky Wirtz.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Chicago has its cold days, and icy \nsidewalks in the winter. But this year's winter proved to be the right \nopportunity for the perfect conditions for Illinois' most recently \nacclaimed sons and daughters, the Chicago Blackhawks hockey team, which \nwon the Stanley Cup last night in Philadelphia.\n  The city of Chicago and State of Illinois have some of the best \nsports fans in America, particularly when it comes to hockey. Last \nnight the fans received their reward as they watched Towes, the \nyoungest captain in the National Hockey League at age 22, hoist the \nStanley Cup over his head as the team ended a 49-year drought and again \nbecame the National Hockey League champions; 49 years, and now \nchampions again.\n  It gives us Cubs fans hope. The fight song of the team begins, ``Here \ncome the hawks, the mighty Blackhawks.'' The team lived up to that song \nlast night as they defeated the Philadelphia Flyers and in a hard-\nfought game in overtime in the sixth game of the series. An amazing end \nto a great season. Just over 4 minutes and 6 seconds into the overtime, \n2010 Olympian Patrick Kane scored with an amazing shot you have to see \nto believe. His efforts were matched by goals from teammates Dustin \nByfuglien, Patrick Sharp, Andrew Ladd, and 21 saves by the fabulous \ngoal tender Antti Niemi.\n  The last time the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup was 1961. John \nKennedy was President. They also won that cup in six games with the \nassistance of hockey legends Bobby Hull, Stan Mikita, and Murray \nBalfour. Who can forget those legendary players?\n  This is the fourth Stanley Cup win for a team with a rich hockey \nhistory that began in 1926. Today we celebrate the players who will be \ntomorrow's legends. This achievement was not achieved without the hard \nwork and determination on the part of the team, the front office, and \nthose incredible players.\n  I congratulate their coach, Joel Quenneville, on his unbelievable 2-\nyear run in leading the team to victory; also to team president John \nMcDonough who brought new life to the Chicago Blackhawks, and the city \nof Chicago, and owner Rocky Wirtz, maybe the only major sports owner in \nAmerica who is cheered wildly whenever his name is mentioned at a game. \nHe assembled a strong office team that developed the Blackhawks into \nchampions. This victory was the result of the exceptional gamesmanship \nof all of the players and all of the work from the staff and the \nassistance and encouragement from owners and fans.\n  I congratulate all of them for this remarkable achievement. I am \nproud to have the Blackhawks in my State of Illinois. Illinois sports \nfans have developed patience when it comes to their teams, and truly \ngreat things can come to those who wait.\n  With two Illinois teams earning national championships in 5 years--\nthat is the Chicago White Sox and the Chicago Blackhawks--our fans can \ncelebrate the recent triumphs and hope for many years to come.\n  Now I have a resolution that I have sent to the desk. It is working \nits way through the Senate, and we are hopeful that before the end of \nthis session, with the bipartisan cooperation of cheering for these new \nStanley Cup champions, we will be able to enact this resolution and \nsend it off so tomorrow's victory parade and rally will be complete. I \nknow they are waiting anxiously for the receipt of the Senate \nresolution. So I hope we can get this done this evening.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Last night, and well into this morning, the sounds of \ncelebration rang through the streets of Chicago.\n  Throughout the city, a proud anthem was sung, an anthem which begins:\n  Here come the Hawks--the mighty Blackhawks.\n  Many consider the Stanley Cup to be the most difficult trophy to win \nin all of professional sports.\n  But last night, thanks to an extraordinary Blackhawks team, the \nhistoric Stanley Cup has returned to Chicago for the first time in \nnearly half a century.\n  This incredible season caps an impressive renaissance for one of the \nNational Hockey League's oldest and most storied franchises.\n  When Rocky Wirtz took the helm of this organization following the \nloss of his father, longtime Blackhawks owner Bill Wirtz, he moved \naggressively to restore his team to excellence.\n  He reached out to the Chicago community, which comprises some of the \ngreatest sports fans in the world.\n  He brought fresh talent to the team's roster and coaching staff, and \npartnered with Chicago institutions like WGN-TV to bring hockey to a \nwider audience.\n  As a result, he was able to catch lightning in a bottle, and set his \nteam on the path to a truly historic season.\n  From the very beginning of this year, every Hawks fan could tell that \nthis team showed some real promise.\n  Time and again, they battled adversity and overcame it.\n  Time and again they were tested, but in each successive game, they \nlaced up their skates and took to the ice with growing confidence and a \nfiery will to win.\n  Finally, after a dominant regular season and an outstanding showing \nagainst playoff opponents, only the Philadelphia Flyers stood between \nthem and their first national title in 49 years.\n  There is no question that both of these teams deserved to be in \ncontention for the Stanley Cup.\n  There is little doubt that these fine athletes, from Philadelphia and \nChicago, are among the very best in the sport of hockey.\n  So it was no surprise that this year's Stanley Cup Finals proved to \nbe an exciting and hard-fought series of games.\n  I congratulate the Flyers and their fans on an outstanding season, \nand I applaud their sportsmanship throughout the year. They played with \ngrit and determination, right up to the very last moment.\n  But in the end, there can be only one champion.\n  And last night, in a thrilling overtime performance that brought the \ncity of Philadelphia to a standstill and the City of Chicago to its \nfeet, the\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\nBlackhawks indisputably won the Stanley Cup.\n  That is why I am proud to join my good friend Senator Durbin to \nintroduce a Senate Resolution in honor of this team.\n  And I ask my colleagues to join with us in celebrating this \nremarkable achievement.\n  I congratulate the owners, the entire coaching staff, and every \nmember of the Blackhawks organization.\n  And I applaud each and every athlete who took part in this incredible \nvictory.\n  Their names are etched forever into Chicago sports history, just as \nthey will soon be etched into the Stanley Cup Trophy itself.\n  Finally, I would like to congratulate the people of Chicago, and \nBlackhawks fans all over the country, who have kept the faith for 49 \nyears, never doubting that greatness would one day return to their \nhockey team.\n  I got married in 1961. That is the last time they won the Stanley \ncup.\n  Their day has finally come, and this championship belongs to them.\n  I am proud to join them in celebration, and I am eager to see the \nStanley Cup on display back home in Chicago, right where it belongs.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I certainly want to offer my \ncongratulations to the city of Chicago. Being from Massachusetts, \nhaving the World Champion Red Sox, Celtics, New England Patriots, \nBruins, New England Revolution, I can certainly appreciate the victory \nthat was brought to the city of Chicago. Certainly when the President \nhas them to the White House, I am hoping he will offer the same \ncourtesy to the NCAA Champion Boston College mens' hockey team as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/10/senate-section/article/S4859-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 550--DESIGNATING THE WEEK BEGINNING ON JUNE 14, 2010, \n     AND ENDING ON JUNE 18, 2010, AS ``NATIONAL HEALTH INFORMATION \n    TECHNOLOGY WEEK'' TO RECOGNIZE THE VALUE OF HEALTH INFORMATION \n                 TECHNOLOGY TO IMPROVING HEALTH QUALITY\n\n  Ms. STABENOW (for herself and Ms. Snowe) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE; TABLE OF CONTENTS.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Cruise \n     Vessel Security and Safety Act of 2010''.\n       (b) Table of Contents.--The table of contents for this Act \n     is as follows:\n       Sec. 1. Short title; table of contents.\n       Sec. 2. Findings.\n       Sec. 3. Cruise vessel security and safety requirements.\n       Sec. 4. Offset of administrative costs.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) There are approximately 200 overnight ocean-going \n     cruise vessels worldwide. The average ocean-going cruise \n     vessel carries 2,000 passengers with a crew of 950 people.\n       (2) In 2007 alone, approximately 12,000,000 passengers were \n     projected to take a cruise worldwide.\n       (3) Passengers on cruise vessels have an inadequate \n     appreciation of their potential vulnerability to crime while \n     on ocean voyages, and those who may be victimized lack the \n     information they need to understand their legal rights or to \n     know whom to contact for help in the immediate aftermath of \n     the crime.\n       (4) Sexual violence, the disappearance of passengers from \n     vessels on the high seas, and other serious crimes have \n     occurred during luxury cruises.\n       (5) Over the last 5 years, sexual assault and physical \n     assaults on cruise vessels were the leading crimes \n     investigated by the Federal Bureau of Investigation with \n     regard to cruise vessel incidents.\n       (6) These crimes at sea can involve attacks both by \n     passengers and crewmembers on other passengers and \n     crewmembers.\n       (7) Except for United States flagged vessels, or foreign \n     flagged vessels operating in an area subject to the direct \n     jurisdiction of the United States, there are no Federal \n     statutes or regulations that explicitly require cruise lines \n     to report alleged crimes to United States Government \n     officials.\n       (8) It is not known precisely how often crimes occur on \n     cruise vessels or exactly how many people have disappeared \n     during ocean voyages because cruise line companies do not \n     make comprehensive, crime-related data readily available to \n     the public.\n       (9) Obtaining reliable crime-related cruise data from \n     governmental sources can be difficult, because multiple \n     countries may be involved when a crime occurs on the high \n     seas, including the flag country for the vessel, the country \n     of citizenship of particular passengers, and any countries \n     having special or maritime jurisdiction.\n       (10) It can be difficult for professional crime \n     investigators to immediately secure an alleged crime scene on \n     a cruise vessel, recover evidence of an onboard offense, and \n     identify or interview potential witnesses to the alleged \n     crime.\n       (11) Most cruise vessels that operate into and out of \n     United States ports are registered under the laws of another \n     country, and investigations and prosecutions of crimes \n     against passengers and crewmembers may involve the laws and \n     authorities of multiple nations.\n       (12) The Department of Homeland Security has found it \n     necessary to establish 500-yard security zones around cruise \n     vessels to limit the risk of terrorist attack. Recently \n     piracy has dramatically increased throughout the world.\n       (13) To enhance the safety of cruise passengers, the owners \n     of cruise vessels could upgrade, modernize, and retrofit the \n     safety and security infrastructure on such vessels by \n     installing peep holes in passenger room doors, installing \n     security video cameras in targeted areas, limiting access to \n     passenger rooms to select staff during specific times, and \n     installing acoustic hailing and warning devices capable of \n     communicating over distances.\n\n     SEC. 3. CRUISE VESSEL SECURITY AND SAFETY REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Chapter 35 of title 46, United States \n     Code, is amended by adding at the end the following:\n\n     ``Sec. 3507.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed \nto the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 211, H.R. 3360.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3360) to amend title 46, United States Code, \n     to establish requirements to ensure the security and safety \n     of passengers and crew on cruise vessels, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to support the Cruise Vessel \nSecurity and Safety Act of 2010 and glad to join the full Senate today \nin passing this important bill. This legislation will improve the \nsafety of Americans traveling on cruise ships by increasing security \nand crime reporting regulations.\n  Far too many incidents of sexual assault and other serious crimes \ncontinue to occur on board cruise ships despite ongoing media and \nCongressional attention to this problem. I have long worked to improve \nprotections for crime victims through landmark legislation including \nthe Victims of Crime Act and the Violence Against Women Act. I applaud \nSenator Kerry for his leadership in ensuring those protections extend \nto Americans traveling aboard cruise ships.\n  This important legislation will require the cruise industry to comply \nwith a number of commonsense security provisions, such as providing \npeep holes and locks in sleeping cabins, and it mandates cruise vessel \npersonnel to contact both the FBI and the U.S. Coast Guard as soon as a \nserious crime is reported.\n  I am particularly pleased to see that the legislation will improve \nthe treatment and protections victims receive on board a cruise ship \nfollowing a crime. For example, a licensed medical practitioner will be \nrequired on board all ships to provide immediate treatment, including \nmedications to prevent sexually transmitted diseases after an assault \nand to conduct forensic examinations to help collect critical evidence \nfor later prosecution. I have worked hard to ensure that these kinds of \nservices to assist victims and to facilitate successful prosecution of \nthose who commit terrible crimes are available throughout the country. \nI am glad that this bill will help ensure that Americans traveling at \nsea receive these same vital services.\n  These important commonsense provisions will help prevent further \ncrimes from happening by improving security measures on our country's \ncruise ships, while also improving our ability to hold the perpetrators \nof these serious crimes accountable. I am pleased to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. DORGAN.
