Mr. President, the choices in this health care debate \nshould be about which ideas contain the best solutions to fix a \nseverely broken system. The choices in this health care debate should \nbe about how best to lower costs while increasing quality of care and \nhow best to bring security and stability back to health care. The \nchoices in this health care debate should be about how to make it \neasier to stay healthy. But for some, the choice seems to be whether we \nshould do anything, whether to act at all. This is a false choice. That \nis not a choice we have. Not acting is not an option.\n  A week or so ago, the Republican leader in the House of \nRepresentatives said:\n\n       I think we all understand that we've got the best health \n     care system in the world.\n\n  Unlike the vast majority of Americans, he seems pretty content with \nthe status quo.\n  Just this week, the junior Senator from South Carolina said that we \njust need to ``get out of the way and allow the market to work.'' In \nother words,\n\n[[Page S7810]]\n\nhe says: Let's do nothing. Let's repeat the same mistakes of the past \nand dig ourselves deeper and deeper into this hole the Obama \nadministration inherited.\n  That is not responsible and is not legislating. That approach does \nnothing to help the millions of Americans who live just one accident, \none illness, or one pink slip away from losing their health coverage. \nThat posture certainly does nothing to help the millions of Americans \nwho have no health insurance to begin with. If we just get out of the \nway, as the Senator suggests, health care costs will get higher and \nmore people who have health care this year will not be able to say the \nsame next year. Today, 14,000 people in America will lose their health \ninsurance. Yesterday, 14,000 people already lost their health \ninsurance. Tomorrow, 14,000 people will lose their health insurance. No \nweekends off, no holidays--14,000, 7 days a week.\n  If we let the market work its will, as the Senator suggests, less \nthan a decade from now you will have to spend almost half of the \nfamily's income on health care. That is not sustainable. If we sit this \none out, as the Senator suggests, more parents will decide they can't \ntake their children to the doctor when they are hurt or sick because it \nsimply costs too much to pay the medical bills, and more small \nbusinesses will lay off more of their workers because it simply costs \ntoo much to give them health coverage. If, as the Senator suggests, we \ndo nothing, we will keep our economy from recovering, keep businesses \nfrom growing, and keep families from getting the doctor visits and \nmedicine they need to stay healthy. Allowing the market to work is code \nfor letting the greedy insurance companies, companies that care more \nabout profits than people, continue to deny coverage because one has a \npreexisting condition or they have gotten a little too old or maybe \nthey have even changed jobs.\n  We have already seen what happens when we do nothing. Over the past 8 \nyears of inaction, the costs of health care rose to record levels and \nthe number of Americans who cannot afford insurance did the same. Right \nnow in Nevada, far more than 100,000 people already lack coverage, the \ncoverage they need to have adequate care when they get sick or hurt. We \ncan't afford to treat these people in emergency rooms, which is where \nthe uninsured go for treatment. That is the only place they can go in \nmany instances. If we don't act, many more Nevadans will lose their \ncoverage and many around America will also lose their coverage.\n  There are a lot of good ideas about how to fix the health care system \nin America. At this critical time for our economy's health and our \ncitizens' health, it is important we exhaustively determine what those \nchanges should be. The question is not whether we should explore any of \nthem; our job is to determine which of these paths will lead us back to \nrecovery, prosperity, and good health.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/22/senate-section/article/S7810-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7810]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday, the President, to his \ncredit, acknowledged what the American people have been telling us for \nweeks: that the Democratic health care proposals currently making their \nway through Congress aren't where they need to be. I couldn't agree \nwith him more.\n  All of us recognize the need for reform. That is not in question. And \nthat is why day after day, I have come to the floor of the Senate and \nproposed concrete, commonsense reforms that all of us can agree on, \nreforms that would increase access, decrease costs, and guarantee that \nno one in this country would be forced to give up the care they \ncurrently have.\n  As I have said repeatedly, we should reform malpractice laws; \nencourage wellness and prevention programs that encourage healthier \nlifestyles like quitting smoking and fighting obesity; promote more \ncompetition in the private insurance market; and address the needs of \nsmall businesses in a way that doesn't kill jobs in the middle of a \nrecession.\n  Unfortunately, the administration seems bent on its own proposal for \na government-driven plan that costs trillions of dollars and asks small \nbusinesses and seniors to pay for it.\n  Once this plan is implemented, the American people could be left with \na system that none of them would recognize and that most of them would \nregret--a system in which health care is denied, delayed, and rationed, \na system which delivers worse care than Americans currently receive at \nan even higher cost. Americans want reform. But they don't want this. \nAnd they don't want either of the two proposals we have seen so far.\n  Both proposals could lead to a government takeover of health care, \nincrease long-term health care costs, and cost trillions of dollars--on \nthe backs of seniors, small businesses, and by adding hundreds of \nbillions of dollars to the already-staggering national debt.\n  The President has said that both of these bills need work. And in my \nview, Democrats in Congress should listen to the President and come up \nwith something Americans really want. This may take time. But Americans \nwould rather that we get these reforms right than just get them \nwritten. When it comes to health care, Americans are sending a clear \nmessage: slow down and get it right. It is a message many of us have \nbeen delivering for weeks, and it is a message one of the Senate's top \nDemocrats in the health care debate seemed to echo yesterday when he \nsaid that the critical test isn't whether we meet a certain deadline \nbut whether we get this reform right, whether it stands the test of \nhistory.\n  We know Americans reject an artificial deadline on closing Guantanamo \nwithout a plan on what to do to keep us safe from the detainees who are \nhoused there. And they regret accepting a rushed and artificial \ndeadline on the stimulus. Health care is simply too important to rush, \njust to meet a date someone picked out of the air.\n  The arguments we have heard in favor of rushing just don't square \nwith reality.\n  The administration and some in Congress say that we have to pass \nthese bills right away because rising health care costs are an imminent \nthreat to the economy. Yet the Democrat plans we have seen so far would \nmake the problem worse. According to the independent Congressional \nBudget Office, the Democrat proposals would very likely increase \noverall health care spending, not reduce it. There goes that argument.\n  Others say we need to pass these bills right away because people \ncan't live under the current system a day longer. Yet many of the \nproposals we have seen wouldn't even go into effect for at least \nanother four years. There goes that argument.\n  Some say that under the proposals we have seen Americans won't lose \nthe coverage they have. Yet independent studies show that millions \nwould be pushed off plans they currently have and like. There goes that \nargument too.\n  The only possible explanation for passing a bill in 2 weeks that \ncould hand over one-sixth of the U.S. economy to the government is that \nthe longer this plan sits out in the open, the more Americans oppose \nit. Already, Americans are shocked at the idea of funding a government \ntakeover of health care on the backs of seniors through cuts to \nMedicare or through taxes on small businesses in the middle of a \nrecession. They are shocked to hear that the final proposal could force \ntaxpayers to fund abortions. They have serious concerns about adding to \nthe national debt. And they are worried about the prospect of being \nforced off the plans they currently have. These concerns are serious. \nThey should be taken seriously, not brushed aside in the service of \nsome artificial deadline.\n  No one in Washington wants to block health care reform. But many of \nus do want to take the time that is needed to deliver the kinds of \nreform that Americans actually want, not a so-called reform that leads \nto a government takeover of health care that leaves people paying more \nfor worse care than they currently have.\n  The President was right. The proposals we have seen are not where \nthey need to be--not even close. But that does not mean reform is not \npossible,\n\n[[Page S7811]]\n\nthat reform is not coming, or that anyone does not want reform. What it \ndoes mean is we need to take the time to get the health care reforms \nthe American people want. That is what they expect, and we should do no \nless.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/22/senate-section/article/S7811-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of S. 1390, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 1390) to authorize appropriations for fiscal \n     year 2010 for military activities of the Department of \n     Defense, for military construction, and for defense \n     activities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military \n     personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Thune amendment No. 1618, to amend chapter 44 of title 18, \n     United States Code, to allow citizens who have concealed \n     carry permits from the State in which they reside to carry \n     concealed firearms in another State that grants concealed \n     carry permits, if the individual complies with the laws of \n     the State.\n       Brownback amendment No. 1597, to express the sense of the \n     Senate that the Secretary of State should redesignate North \n     Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1618\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time until noon will be equally \ndivided and controlled between the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. \nThune, and the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin, or their designees on \namendment No. 1618, offered by the Senator from South Dakota.\n  The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, amendment No. 1618 is a very simple \namendment. It is tailored to allow individuals to protect themselves \nwhile at the same time protecting States rights.\n  My amendment would allow an individual to carry a concealed firearm \nacross State lines if they either have a valid permit or if, under \ntheir State of residence, they are legally entitled to do so.\n  My amendment does not create a national concealed carry permit system \nor standard. My amendment does not allow individuals to conceal and \ncarry within States that do not allow their own citizens to do so. My \namendment does not allow citizens to circumvent their home State's \nconcealed carry permit laws.\n  If an individual is currently prohibited from possessing a firearm \nunder Federal law, my amendment would continue to prohibit them from \ndoing so. When an individual with a valid conceal and carry permit from \ntheir home State travels to another State that also allows their \ncitizens to conceal and carry, the visitor must comply with the \nrestrictions of the State they are in.\n  This carefully tailored amendment will ensure that a State's border \nis not a limit to an individual's fundamental right and will allow law-\nabiding individuals to travel, without complication, throughout the 48 \nStates that currently permit some form of conceal and carry.\n  Law-abiding individuals have the right to self-defense, especially \nbecause the Supreme Court has consistently found that police have no \nconstitutional obligation to protect individuals from other \nindividuals.\n  The Seventh Circuit explained this most simply in their 1982 Bowers \nv. DeVito decision where they said:\n\n       [T]here is no Constitutional right to be protected by the \n     state against being murdered by criminals or madmen.\n\n  Responsible gun ownership by law-abiding individuals, however, \nprovides a constitutional means by which individuals may do so, and \nresponsible conceal and carry holders have repeatedly proven they are \neffective in protecting themselves and those around them.\n  Reliable, empirical research shows that States with concealed carry \nlaws enjoy significantly lower crime and violent crime rates than those \nStates that do not.\n  For example, for every year a State has a concealed carry law, the \nmurder rate declines by 3 percent, rape by 2 percent, and robberies by \nover 2 percent.\n  Additionally, research shows that ``minorities and women tend to be \nthe ones with the most to gain from being allowed to protect \nthemselves.''\n  The benefits of conceal and carry extend to more than just the \nindividuals who actually carry the firearms. Since criminals are unable \nto tell who is and who is not carrying a firearm just by looking at a \npotential victim, they are less likely to commit a crime when they fear \nthey may come in direct contact with an individual who is armed.\n  This deterrent is so strong that a Department of Justice study found \nthat 40 percent of felons had not committed crimes because they feared \nthe prospective victims were armed. Additionally, research shows that \nwhen unrestricted conceal and carry laws are passed, not only does it \nbenefit those who are armed, but it also benefits others around them \nsuch as children. In addition to the empirical evidence, there are \nanecdotal stories as well.\n  A truckdriver from Onida, SD--a long-haul trucker--10 years ago, on a \ntrip to Atlanta, stopped at a truck stop in Georgia. He shared this \nstory recently. It is a more dated story. But a strange man suddenly \njumped on the hood of his truck, showed a gun, and started demanding \nall the cash this truckdriver had. Working on instinct, he pulled out \nthe firearm he always kept in his cab and showed the gun to the \nperpetrator, who jumped off the hood and ran away as soon as he saw it.\n  That story, while one that may not make it into the crime statistics \nor the newspapers, is the type of story that demonstrates how my \namendment will help individuals--law-abiding individuals, who travel \nfrom State to State either for work or for pleasure.\n  So it is very straightforward. The amendment, as I said, simply \nallows those who have concealed carry permits in their State of \nresidence to be able to carry firearms across State lines, respectful \nof the laws that pertain in each of the individual States.\n  So it is not, as some have suggested, a preemption of State laws. \nThere are a couple States where their individuals are precluded from \nhaving concealed carry, and in those States this amendment would not \napply. Obviously, we are, as I said before, very respectful of States \nrights and State laws that have been enacted with regard to this \nparticular issue.\n  But I might say, too, in my State of South Dakota, we have a national \nreciprocity understanding, national reciprocity concealed carry \nunderstanding, with all the other States in the country. So of the \nother 47 States where concealed carry is allowed, any of the residents \nof those States who have concealed carry permits can carry in the State \nof South Dakota. There are 10 other States that also fit into that \ncategory.\n\n  I believe if we check the records and look at the data, it is pretty \nclear the States that have enacted national concealed carry reciprocity \nagreements have not seen, as has been suggested by opponents of this \namendment, any increase in crime rates.\n  I believe this is something that is consistent with the \nconstitutional right that citizens in this country have to keep and \nbear firearms. We have, as I said, 48 States currently today that have \nsome form of concealed carry law that allows their individuals in their \nStates, residents of their States, to carry. This simply extends that \nconstitutional right across State lines, recognizing that the right to \ndefend oneself and the right to exercise that basic second amendment \nconstitutional right does not end at State borders or State lines.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues in the Senate will adopt this \namendment. I think it is a commonsense approach to allowing more people \nacross this country to have the opportunity to protect themselves when \nthey are threatened. As I said before, the statistics bear out the fact \nthat when that is the case, when people have that opportunity--States \nthat have enacted concealed carry laws have seen actually crime rates, \nparticularly violent crime rates, go down.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S7812]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Thune \namendment. The Senator from South Dakota tells us this is a very simple \namendment. He tells us his amendment is consistent with self-defense \nand the reduction of crime.\n  What the Senator from South Dakota cannot explain is why 400 mayors, \nthe International Association of Chiefs of Police, the Major Cities \nPolice Chiefs Association, and the bipartisan association known as \nState Legislators Against Illegal Guns oppose this so-called very \nsimple amendment.\n  Here is why they oppose it. The Thune amendment provides that if a \nState gives a person a permit to carry concealed weapons, then that \nperson is free to carry concealed weapons in 47 other States and the \nDistrict of Columbia. Those other States would be required to let this \nvisitor carry a concealed loaded weapon in their State, even if their \nlaws in that State would not currently allow that person to carry a \ngun.\n  Let's be clear about the effect of this amendment. There are 36 \nStates with laws governing who can carry concealed weapons, including \nwhich out-of-State permits that State will accept, if any. The States \nalready have laws. Under the Thune amendment, those laws can be \nignored. So if the Thune amendment becomes law, people who are \ncurrently prohibited from carrying concealed guns in those 36 States \nare free to do so.\n  It is absurd that we are considering this amendment today. We know \nnothing about the impact this amendment is actually going to have \nacross America. How many Senators from the 36 States that already have \nlaws governing concealed carry have had a chance to talk to their State \nlaw enforcement officials about this amendment and what it means?\n  Apparently, those who support this amendment want to move it very \nquickly. We scheduled a hearing--it is supposed to take place \ntomorrow--on this amendment before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on \nCrime. But the Senator from South Dakota did not want to wait for a \nhearing before the committee. He has asked the Senate to take up this \nmeasure today before the hearing date.\n  Here are some of the reasons this amendment is so troubling. As my \ncolleagues know, we have a federalist system--a government in \nWashington, a national government, and in each State and the District \nof Columbia State government and local control. States have adopted \ndifferent standards in their State with regard to who the State will \npermit to carry concealed weapons. Each State has considered this issue \nand decided what is safe for their residents. Elected representatives, \nelected by the people, have made that decision State by State.\n  Some States have very rigorous standards. If you want to carry a \nconcealed weapon, for example, a number of States will not allow you to \nif you are an abuser of alcohol, if you have been convicted of certain \nmisdemeanor crimes or if you have not completed a training course to \nshow you know how to use a gun. The States have established that \nstandard. If you want to go ``packin' '' in these States, you better \nnot be a habitual drunkard; you better not be in a position where you \nhave committed these misdemeanor crimes, and you have to prove by test \nand sometimes on the range that you can safely use this gun that you \nwant to carry.\n  In Iowa, you cannot have a permit to carry a weapon if you are \naddicted to alcohol or if you have a history of repeated acts of \nviolence.\n  In Pennsylvania, individuals convicted of certain misdemeanor crimes, \nsuch as impersonating a police officer, cannot have a concealed carry \npermit.\n  In South Carolina, any person who is a member of a subversive \norganization or a habitual drunkard cannot carry a handgun.\n  In California, you cannot carry a firearm for 10 years after being \nconvicted of misdemeanors, including assault, battery, stalking, \nthreatening a judge, victim, or witness.\n  Other States, in contrast, have minimal or no concealed carry \nstandards beyond the baseline of the Federal law which applies to all \nStates.\n  For example, a number of States, including Georgia, do not require \nany firearms training for a concealed carry permit. In 2008, a \nspokesman for the Georgia Bureau of Investigation told a newspaper: ``A \nblind person can get a permit in Georgia since all you have to do is \npass a background check.''\n  Two States--Alaska and Vermont--do not even require a permit to carry \na concealed weapon. Those States let anyone carry a concealed weapon. \nUnder the Thune amendment, people from those States--with virtually no \nstandards for concealed carry or no requirement to prove they know how \nto use a gun--those people could visit States where they have \nestablished standards for the safety of their residents and under the \nThune amendment legally carry a gun.\n  In other words, the visitors can ignore the law of the State--a law \nthe elected representatives of the people in that State have enacted. \nSome States do little oversight on the concealed carry permits they \nhave issued. In the year 2007, the South Florida Sun Sentinel newspaper \nfound that 1,400 people in Florida had active concealed carry licenses \neven though they had received sentences--criminal sentences--for major \ncrimes, including assault, sexual battery, child abuse, and \nmanslaughter.\n  So even in the States where they have established standards for \nconcealed carry, many of them are not keeping an eye on them. There is \nno oversight. As a consequence, people may be legally carrying in one \nState which has lax standards in obtaining the permit and no review--\nvirtually no review when it comes to the people who end up with the \npermits--and that person can travel to another State which has \nestablished standards for the safety of their own citizens and under \nthe Thune amendment legally carry a gun.\n  If the Thune amendment is enacted, States with carefully crafted \nconcealed carry laws must allow concealed carry by out-of-State \nvisitors who may not meet their own State's standards, who may even \nhave sexual battery, child abuse, or manslaughter convictions.\n  Is that going to make us safer? Do we want in my State--well, \nIllinois would be an exception because we do not have a concealed carry \nlaw. We are one of two States that do not. But for the other 48 States, \ndo we want people traveling across the border who do not meet the basic \nrequirements of knowing how to use a firearm, who do not meet the basic \nrequirements in terms of their own criminal background? Is it so \nimportant that everybody carry a gun everywhere or do we want to \nrespect States rights--States rights to determine what is safe in their \nown State? Why would we want to override some States' standards to \nallow questionable concealed carry permit holders from States with \nlower standards or virtually no standards?\n  It is not necessary for us to adopt this amendment to give individual \nStates the ability to recognize each other's concealed carry permits. \nThe Senator from South Dakota has said his State welcomes all people \nwho have concealed carry permits. But that was their decision. They \nmade that decision in their State. States are free to form concealed \ncarry reciprocity agreements with other States. Twelve States have \nalready decided to honor conceal and carry permits issued by every \nother State, obviously including South Dakota. However, 25 other States \nlook carefully at each of the other States and make this decision \nselectively. They have decided that some States have acceptable \nstandards and some do not. Eleven States and the District of Columbia \nhave chosen not to grant concealed carry reciprocity to any other \nState. They want their own laws to govern the protection of their own \npeople.\n\n  The Thune amendment is a direct assault on those States that have \nchosen not to allow reciprocity. They are California, Connecticut, \nHawaii, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, \nOregon, and Rhode Island. Over all, the Thune amendment would override \nthe selective reciprocity or no reciprocity laws of each of the 36 \nStates I have mentioned.\n  There are good reasons a State might want to be careful with who they \nallow to carry concealed weapons within their borders. Let me give some \nexamples of what has happened with concealed carry. Washington State \nresident Clinton Granger obtained a concealed carry permit despite his \nhistory\n\n[[Page S7813]]\n\nof drug addiction and schizophrenia. In May of 2008, Granger was in a \nfight at a public festival, fired a shot that hit one person in the \nface, the second person in the wrist, and then lodged in a third \nperson's leg.\n  Cincinnati resident Geraldine Beasley obtained an Ohio concealed \ncarry permit, even though she had been previously fined for unlawful \ntransportation of a firearm. In August 2007 she shot and killed a \npanhandler who asked her for 25 cents at a gas station.\n  In Moscow, ID, resident and Aryan Nation member Jason Kenneth \nHamilton was given a concealed carry permit even though he had a \ndomestic violence conviction. In May 2007, Hamilton went on a shooting \nspree, killing his wife, a police officer, and a church sexton, and \nwounding three others.\n  According to the Violence Policy Center, from May 2007 to April 2009, \nat least seven law enforcement officers were shot and killed by \nconcealed carry permit holders--these are law enforcement officers--and \nconcealed carry holders were charged in the shooting deaths of at least \n43 private citizens during that time.\n  In light of incidents such as these, it is perfectly reasonable for \nStates to decide what the standards will be for concealed carry. The \nThune amendment would override this authority of the States and \nbasically say that visitors from States with a concealed carry law \ndon't have to meet the State's standards where they are visiting.\n  The Thune amendment is troubling because it leaves law enforcement \nagencies in the dark about the concealed carry population in their own \narea. In many States, law enforcement plays a key gatekeeper role, an \noversight role on the concealed carry population. Under the Thune \namendment, that is impossible. The first person who drives in out of \nState under the Thune amendment may carry a gun and the law enforcement \nofficials wouldn't even have knowledge of it.\n  When you look at the Thune amendment, along with the amendment \noffered earlier this year by Senator Ensign that repeals the DC \ngovernment's local gun laws, we see a disturbing trend. We see Members \nfrom that side of the aisle leading an organized effort to strip State \nand local governments of their ability to keep their own communities \nsafe. There is no justification for this. The Supreme Court's decision \nin Heller made it clear that although the second amendment right is to \nbe respected in terms of the rights of individuals, there was still \nauthority to deal with this issue of concealed carry. Justice Scalia in \nthe Heller opinion specifically discussed the lawfulness of \nprohibitions on carrying concealed weapons.\n  Congress should not require one State's laws to trump another's. New \nYork should not have to let visitors on its city streets be governed by \nthe laws of Alaska when it comes to carrying guns, and it should be up \nto the State to decide who it will permit to carry concealed weapons \nwithin their borders.\n  This is not a good amendment. America won't be safer if the Thune \namendment passes. It has not gone through a hearing in the Senate. The \nSenator decided to call it up the day before that hearing was set. It \nguts State laws in 36 States. It will leave law enforcement with no \nknowledge of who is carrying concealed weapons in their State. It puts \nguns in the hands of dangerous people who could easily misuse them.\n  This amendment is opposed by law enforcement organizations, mayors, \nand State elected officials. I have received letters in opposition to \nwhat Senator Thune calls a very simple amendment from the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, the Major Cities Police Chief \nAssociation, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, a coalition of 400 mayors \ncalled Mayors Against Illegal Guns, Chicago Mayor Richard Daley, a \ngroup of State attorneys general, including my own Lisa Madigan, the \nbipartisan Association of State Legislators Against Illegal Guns, and \nmany others.\n  The amendment has been criticized in many newspapers, including USA \nToday, the Miami Herald, the Philadelphia Enquirer, the New York Times, \nthe Washington Post, and Baltimore Sun.\n  This amendment should be defeated. I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, let me, if I might, point out some of the \nstatistics, and I will also add in response to the comments of my \ncolleague from Illinois that the amendment was not applied to the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  With respect to the issue of federalism, I think it is important to \nnote that back in 2003, there were 70 cosponsors in the Senate for a \npiece of legislation that allowed retired law enforcement and current \nlaw enforcement officers to carry across State lines--obviously an \ninfringement on this notion of federalism that the Senator from \nIllinois has raised.\n  I also would point out that we do know the impact. The Senator from \nIllinois said we don't know what the impact of this is going to be. Any \nsuggestion about what impacts could occur are very hypothetical. What \nwe do know is that there are a number of States that have already \nenacted national concealed carry reciprocity agreements. In those \nStates, we also know what the impacts have been. The impacts have been \nthat clearly there has been less crime rather than more.\n  Studies have shown that there is more defensive gun use by victims \nthan there are crimes committed with firearms in this country. In fact, \nresearchers have estimated that there are as many as 2.5 million \ndefensive uses of firearms in the United States each year, though a lot \nof those go unreported because no shots are ever fired. There are lots \nof examples, and I have a list of them here I could go through \nanecdotally too. These are those that have been recorded by the press \nwhere actually the defensive use by a firearm, someone with a concealed \ncarry permit, has actually helped prevent crimes. There are countless \nexamples of those that have been documented and reported by the press, \nnot to mention, as I said, the estimated 2.5 million defensive uses of \nfirearms in the United States each year.\n  There are estimated to be about 5 million concealed carry permit \nholders in the United States today. Assuming that every instance \nreported by gun control groups of improper firearm use by individuals \nwith a concealed carry permit is true--something that can be debated, \nbut assuming that it is true--over an entire year, for over 142,857 \npermit holders, there would be one--one--improper use of a firearm.\n  Put another way, concealed carry permit holders would be 15 times \nless--15 times less--likely than the rest of the public to commit \nmurder.\n  There are some States--and some large States, frankly--that have \nissued concealed carry permits, and probably one of the largest States \nis the State of Florida. They have had a concealed carry permit law in \neffect in the State of Florida going back to 1987. Yet if you look at \nthe 1.57 million concealed carry permits that people have in the State \nof Florida, there have only been 167 of those revoked. That is less \nthan one-tenth of 1 percent.\n  As of 2008, Utah, which allows both residents and nonresidents to \nacquire concealed carry permits, had 134,398 active concealed handgun \npermits. Over the past year they have had 12 revocations or .009 \npercent because of some type of violent crime, but none of those \ncrimes, incidentally, involved the use of a gun. During the 1990s and \nthrough the decade of 2000 so far, independent researchers have found \n11 cases where a permit holder committed murder with a gun.\n  I would simply point out to my colleagues that the points that are \nbeing made by the Senator from Illinois are largely speculative. If you \ngo back to 1991, the number of privately owned guns has risen by about \n90 million to an all-time high. Over that same timeframe, the Nation's \nmurder rate has decreased 46 percent to a 43-year low, and the total \nviolent crime rate has decreased 41 percent to a 35-year low. This at a \ntime--as I said, since 1991, the number of privately owned guns has \nincreased by about 90 million to an all-time high. Also, as I said \nbefore, the number of permits that are issued across the country is \nabout 5 million nationally. My State of South Dakota has about 47,000, \nbut it is a small percentage of the overall number of Americans who \nactually could access or could get a concealed carry permit who do it. \nMost of them have a reason for doing it. Most of them are going to be\n\n[[Page S7814]]\n\npeople such as truckdrivers who are going across State lines such as \nthe example I mentioned. There are lots of people who travel.\n  For example, as another case in point, I have two daughters who are \nin college. My oldest one will graduate next year. Currently she is in \nthe safe confines of a college campus, but she attends college several \nStates away from our State of South Dakota. When she is out of college \nnext year, I fully expect--and we have discussed this--that she may get \na concealed carry permit in the State in which she resides, to have a \nfirearm in order to protect herself, because I think a lot of single \nwomen in this country do, particularly those who live in large cities \nand she would be living in a large city. When she comes home to South \nDakota she, of course, traverses several States and during the course \nof that, she crosses two States where it would be illegal to have a \nfirearm in her possession in her car to protect her as she travels \nthose vast distances across several States.\n  There are lots of examples I think of people--law-abiding citizens--\nwho, for purposes of self-defense, simply want the opportunity to, in a \nlegal way, transport that firearm and they have concealed carry \npermits. They have gone through their State's background check--and by \nthe way, all but three States that issue concealed carry permits \nrequire background checks, so it is the same thing you would go through \nin order to buy a firearm.\n  So the suggestion that all of these people are going to be able to \nget firearms: The Federal law prevents some of the very examples the \nSenator from Illinois mentioned from having access to firearms in the \nfirst place. Of course, the background checks, with the exception of \nthose three States--as a practical matter those three States, which are \nNew Hampshire, Rhode Island, and Delaware, also go through the \nbackground checks. They don't have it as a requirement to get a conceal \nand carry permit. But background checks are going to be conducted. You \nare going to find out if there is criminal behavior in the background, \nmental illness, all of those things which under Federal law would \nprevent that person from possessing a firearm in the first place.\n  I reserve the balance of my time. The Senator from Louisiana is here \nand I assume the Presiding Officer will recognize the other side.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from New \nYork.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, some would suggest that a permit to \nconceal a gun in one State should provide authority for a legal and \nvalid concealment in another State. I strongly believe that what gun \nlaws are right for New York are not necessarily right for South Dakota \nand vice versa. States should be able to make decisions and pass \nreasonable constitutional safety standards based on their public safety \nrequirements, traditions, population, crime rates, and geography.\n  It is wrong for the Federal Government to overrule a State's ability \nto enact reasonable, constitutional gun laws designed to prevent \nalcoholics, criminals, domestic abusers, those with documented grave \nmental illness, and other potentially violent and dangerous people from \ncarrying guns in our cities.\n  In fact, Senator Thune's amendment creates a double standard in \nrecognition of States rights with regard to conceal and carry laws. By \nallowing exemptions, this amendment validates the laws of States that \nban concealed weapons but then strikes down the laws of a State such as \nNew York that maintains basic safety standards for concealed carry \npermits. At a minimum, New York should be allowed to opt out and have \nan exemption.\n  This legislation would eviscerate concealed carry permitting \nstandards, moving to a new national lowest common denominator. This \nbill would even allow individuals ineligible to obtain a permit in \ntheir own State the means to shop around for a lower standard in other \nStates that offer permits to out-of-State residents, undercutting laws \nthat would otherwise render the applicant ineligible.\n  A study by the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence using FBI crime \nstatistics demonstrates that relaxing conceal and carry laws may have \nan adverse effect on a State's crime rate. Between 1992 and 1998, the \nviolent crime rate in States which kept strict conceal and carry laws \nfell by an average of 30 percent, whereas violent crime rates dropped \nby only 15 percent in States with weak conceal and carry laws.\n  A second concern is a lack of acceptable safety standards in all \nStates. According to the Washington Post, in at least two-thirds of all \nStates some form of safety training is required in order to receive a \npermit. Abusers of alcohol are prohibited from getting a permit. Those \nconvicted of certain misdemeanors are prohibited.\n  In many States, statutory requirements are minimal and do not go much \nbeyond the Federal Brady law requirements for purchasing firearms, \nmeaning that some people get conceal and carry permits despite criminal \nconvictions for violent or drug-related misdemeanors, assault, or even \nstalking.\n  It is not completely evident what a national overrule of State \nconcealed carry laws might do to local crime numbers, but trends in \nnational crime suggest that State and local governments understand what \nworks in protecting their citizens.\n  I spoke with our NYPD Commissioner Ray Kelly, who said:\n\n       The Thune amendment would invite chaos in our cities and \n     put the lives of both police officers and members of the \n     public at risk by enabling anyone with an out-of-State \n     permit, including gun traffickers, to carry multiple handguns \n     wherever they go. New York City's strict requirements as to \n     who can carry a concealed weapon have contributed to the \n     city's unparalleled public safety. Our effort, indeed our \n     entire mission, would be severely undercut by this bill. In a \n     city where 90 percent of all guns used in crimes come from \n     out of State, it is easy to see how S. 845 would pose a \n     danger to New Yorkers by greatly increasing the availability \n     of illegal handguns for purchase.\n\n  In 2008, New York had the lowest crime rate of the 25 largest cities \nin the country, and of the 261 cities with more than 100,000 residents, \nNew York's crime rate ranked 246th.\n  Mayor Michael Bloomberg attributed this success to ``using innovative \npolicing strategies and a focus on keeping guns out of the hands of \ncriminals.''\n  This week, the Washington Post cited similar success at reducing \ncrime in big cities across the country, stating that New York, \nWashington, DC, and Los Angeles are on track for fewer killings this \nyear than in the last four decades. This is part of a larger trend in \nmany big cities across the country.\n  Local and State elected officials and law enforcement officers across \nthe country, such as the International Association of Chiefs of Police \nand Major Cities Chiefs Association, are speaking out in opposition to \nthis amendment.\n  Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a bipartisan coalition of more than 450 \nmayors--including of New York City, Albany, Binghamton, Buffalo, \nRochester, and Syracuse--representing more than 56 million Americans, \nhas stated a strong opposition to this amendment.\n  I stand here today with law enforcement and these cities and States \nacross this country. They know what is best in keeping their \ncommunities safe. Commonsense gun laws focused on training, and keeping \nguns out of the hands of criminals and other dangerous people, are \nreducing crime, and we should be supporting their efforts, not gutting \nsuch basic safety standards.\n  I strongly believe in our Constitution and the second amendment and \nAmericans' right to defend themselves, but I also strongly support the \nStates' and cities' right to provide basic constitutional and \nreasonable regulation of firearms.\n  I urge my colleagues in the Senate to stand up for our local \ncommunities and the commonsense gun safety laws.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I yield to the Senator from Louisiana such \ntime as he may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Louisiana is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of amendment No. \n1618.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of this amendment, along with dozens of other \nSenators on a bipartisan basis. I urge all of my colleagues to support \nthis amendment.\n  The second amendment is a valued constitutional right. Thank God, the\n\n[[Page S7815]]\n\ncourts, particularly in recent years, have expressly recognized that. \nOf course, the Supreme Court, in the landmark Heller decision, ruled \nthat ``the individual right to possess and carry weapons in case of \nconfrontation'' is a protected fundamental constitutional right. Even \nthe very liberal Ninth Circuit Court, based in California, ruled that \nthe second amendment right to keep and bear arms is ``deeply rooted in \nthis Nation's history and tradition'' and has long been regarded as the \n``true palladium of liberty.'' That court also wrote that ``nothing \nless than the security of the nation--a defense against both external \nand internal threats--rests on the provision [second amendment].''\n  That is why this amendment is a fundamental right. What does that \nmean in everyday terms? It means the ability of citizens, particularly \nthose more vulnerable in our society, such as women, to protect \nthemselves, people such as Sue Fontenot in Louisiana, who told me:\n\n       When my family and I go out at night, it makes me feel \n     safer just knowing I am able to have my concealed weapon.\n\n  It is personal safety and security. It is a fundamental ability to \nprotect one's self, one's family, and one's property. So if that is a \nfundamental right, and if we have reasonable laws and reasonable \npermitting processes, why shouldn't Sue Fontenot have that freedom, \nright, and security when she visits other States, which also allow \nconcealed carry?\n  This isn't just anecdotal quotes, this is also backed up by \ncriminological studies. Studying crime trends around the country in the \nUnited States, John Lott and David Mustard concluded:\n\n       Allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons deters violent \n     crimes. . . . When State concealed hand gun laws went into \n     effect in a county, murders fell by 8.5 percent and rapes and \n     aggravated assaults fell by 5 and 7 percent.\n\n  In the 1990s, Gary Kleck and Marc Gertz found guns were used for \nself-protection about 2.5 million times annually. That number, of \ncourse, dwarfs these tiny numbers and anecdotal evidence of limited, \nvery tiny numbers of improper use of guns by folks with concealed carry \npermits.\n  Responding to the Kleck and Gertz study, the late Marvin Wolfgang, \nself-described ``as strong a gun control advocate as can be found among \ncriminologists in this country,'' said he agreed with the methodology \nof the study.\n  Our amendment will simply allow law-abiding Americans to exercise \ntheir fundamental right to self-defense, by using the full faith and \ncredit clause of our U.S. Constitution.\n  As we do this, as we protect that fundamental individual right, we \nalso protect States rights. I think it is very important to address \nsome of the arguments with regard to States rights that have been made \nby the other side.\n  We do not mandate the right to concealed carry in any State that does \nnot allow the practice. Some States, such as Illinois and Wisconsin, \nfall into that category. We do not mandate a concealed carry right in \nthose States. In addition, our amendment does not establish national \nstandards for concealed carry. It does not provide a national concealed \ncarry permit. It simply allows citizens who are able to carry in their \nhome States to also carry in other States, but only if those other \nStates have concealed carry permits.\n  We also respect the law of those other States, in terms of where guns \ncan be carried and where they cannot be carried. So we explicitly \nrespect that State law by requiring that State laws concerning specific \ntimes and locations in which firearms may not be carried must be \nfollowed by the visiting individual, and that is very important.\n  Finally, we absolutely protect and enshrine current Federal law, in \nterms of background checks and people with criminal problems or mental \nproblem, who cannot carry guns. If an individual is prohibited by \ncurrent Federal law from carrying a firearm, we absolutely protect and \nenshrine that. Let me say that again. If under current Federal law an \nindividual is prohibited from carrying a gun, that is fully protected.\n  At the end of the day, this is, again, a fundamental debate about \nwhat is the problem in terms of violent crime? Is the problem law-\nabiding citizens who follow the law, who take all of the time and all \nof the trouble needed to get concealed carry permits, go through \nbackground checks, fill out forms, and do everything that is required \nby their home States? Is that class of people the fundamental cause of \nviolent crime or is the dominant, 99.9 percent fundamental problem in \nthe violent crime arena people who don't follow the law, who ignore the \nlaw, who ignore a concealed carry law, ignore those requirements, as \nwell as every other law on the books--unfortunately, including laws \nagainst murder and armed robbery and other violent crime?\n\n  Clearly, in the minds of commonsense Americans, it is the latter \ncategory of folks that is the problem, not the former. The statistics \nand the evidence and the history bear that out. So concealed carry is a \nuseful and essential tool for law-abiding citizens to be able to \nprotect themselves and stop and deter violent crime. It is not any \nsignificant source of violent crime whatsoever. We have the numbers \nthat bear that out. We have some States that allow reciprocity now. Ten \nStates now allow reciprocity under their State law.\n  Have they seen incidents of problems with concealed carry permits \nfrom other States? No. Have they seen spikes in violent crime because \nof this reciprocity? No. Again, because this is a fundamental right, \nand because it goes to people's security, because criminological and \nother studies are on our side and don't show any spike in violent crime \nby this but in fact show crimes prevented and deterred by concealed \ncarry, I urge all of my colleagues to support this important \nreciprocity amendment.\n  Groups around the country who respect the second amendment and find \nthat a fundamental and important right are certainly supporting this \namendment. The National Rifle Association, NRA, is a strong supporter \nof this amendment. I thank them for that and for their leadership. They \nare also specifically scoring this amendment in terms of Member votes. \nGun Owners of America, another leading gun rights second amendment \ngroup, is a strong supporter of this amendment and is specifically \npushing for passage and scoring Members' votes. The Owner-Operator \nIndependent Drivers Association, the Passenger-Cargo Security Group, \nand many other groups around the country are strong supporters of this \namendment, because the second amendment is a fundamental right because \nconcealed carry does work, because it prevents crimes and deters crime \nand doesn't significantly add, in any meaningful way, to the crime \nproblem.\n  Again, like with a lot of gun control debates, this comes down to a \npretty fundamental question: Do you think the big problem with regard \nto violent crime is the law-abiding citizen, the one who takes the time \nand goes to the trouble of filling out the forms and following all the \nrules for concealed carry? I don't. Or do you think the fundamental \nproblem--99.99 percent of the problem--is the criminal who doesn't \nrespect that law, because he doesn't even respect laws against murder, \narmed robbery, and other violent crimes? That is the problem. \nCommonsense Americans know that.\n  This amendment will protect law-abiding citizens and provide another \neffective and important tool against those criminals who are the \nproblem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois has 47 \nminutes 34 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield 10 minutes to Senator Schumer from New York.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank all my colleagues who are working \nwith us on this amendment. The Senator from California, who will speak \nafter me, has been such a leader on these issues. She and I were \ncommenting that this is probably the most dangerous piece of \nlegislation to the safety of Americans when it comes to guns since the \nrepeal of the assault weapons ban, which she led the charge on to pass. \nI thank my colleague from New Jersey, Senator Lautenberg, who has been \na leader on gun issues and has done such a great job; also, Senator \nMenendez, Senator Gillibrand, Senator Durbin, and so many others who\n\n[[Page S7816]]\n\nare working with us today on this issue.\n  Today we are here to urge all our colleagues to oppose this \nlegislation. The legislation would do nothing less than take State and \nlocal gun laws and tear them up. It would take the carefully crafted \ngun laws in New York and tear them up. It would do the same in 47 other \nStates.\n  The great irony of this amendment is that the pro-gun lobby has \nalways said: Let the States decide. Now they are doing a 180-degree \nturn and saying: Let the Federal Government decide and impose the \nlowest common denominator, when it comes to carrying concealed weapons, \non all the States, except Illinois and Wisconsin which do not have any \ncarry laws.\n  We know the gun lobby is strong. We know there are many Members on \nboth sides of the aisle who believe strongly in an individual's right \nto carry arms. But this legislation goes way beyond the previous pro-\ngun laws we have voted on this session. It is a bridge too far. It \nthreatens the safety of millions of Americans, particularly in urban \nand suburban areas. It directly threatens the safety of millions of New \nYorkers. Let me illustrate.\n  Our neighboring State of Vermont--it is a beautiful State; I have \ngreat respect for it and its two Senators--is a rural State. It has a \nstrong libertarian belief, and it has a very lenient concealed carry \nlaw. The Vermont law says that if you are 16 years of age, you can \napply for a gun license and you automatically get a concealed carry \npermit and you get the gun. That is all you have to do.\n  Can you imagine if this law passed what would happen? Known gun \nrunners would go to Vermont, get a gun license, get a concealed carry \npermit, and they could get 20, 30, 50 guns concealed in a backpack, in \na suitcase, and bring them and sell them on the streets of the south \nBronx or central Brooklyn, bring them to Central Park or Queens, and \nour local police would have their hands tied.\n  One of the points I would like to make to my colleagues about this \namendment is it endangers not only the citizenry but our police \nofficers. Today, at about this time, the mayor of the city of New York \nand our police commissioner will be speaking out against this proposal. \nOur police commissioner is particularly upset because his job is the \nsafety of police officers. When a police officer stops someone in a \ncar, they now have the safety and sanctity of mind to know that if that \nperson has a gun in their car, it has been approved by the New York \nCity Police Department. There are people who need to carry guns for \nself-defense or other purposes. After this law passes, they have no \nsuch peace of mind, no such safety. Imagine you are a police officer \nand you stop someone. They could be from 47 different States with 47 \ndifferent requirements, and you are responsible to figure out if that \nperson has a gun in his car and has the right to carry a gun in his \ncar. It is impossible to do in our larger urban areas.\n  For that reason, each State has carefully crafted its concealed carry \nlaws in a way that makes the most sense to protect its citizens. \nClearly, large urban areas, such as New York, merit different standards \nthan rural areas, such as Wyoming. To gut the ability of local police \nand sheriffs to determine who should be able to carry a concealed \nweapon makes no sense. It could reverse the dramatic success we have \nhad in reducing crime in most parts of America.\n  That is one point I wish to stress. One of the things I am proudest \nof, what our government has done over the last 20 years--Federal, \nState, local--is greatly reduce crime. My city of New York gained 1 \nmillion people, I think, in large part because people were no longer \nafraid to come and live in New York. If you ask the experts--not me, \nnot Senator Thune, not any of us who have political beliefs that might \ndiffer--ask the police experts: What is one of the top reasons we have \nbeen able to reduce crime in our cities, it is that we have had \nreasonable laws on guns, and we have allowed our larger urban, more \ncrime-ridden areas to have stricter laws than our rural areas.\n  I understand in my State of New York that guns are a way of life in \nlarge parts of the State, and I respect that. The Heller decision is a \ndecision I welcomed. I talked about the right to bear arms in the \nConstitution. I believed in it even before Heller. But you know--and \nthis is what I would like to say to my friends on the other side of the \naisle and in the NRA--no amendment is absolute. You are right when you \nsay: Why should the first, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth amendments \nbe expanded as far as we can and the second amendment be seen through a \npinhole of militias? You are right. But similarly, no amendment is \nabsolute.\n  Most of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle support laws \npreventing the spread of pornography. That is an infringement of the \nfirst amendment but a reasonable one because there is a balancing test. \nMost of my friends on both sides of the aisle would support libel laws. \nIf somebody says something very defamatory about a citizen, they should \nhave the right to sue, of course. That is a limitation on the first \namendment. We don't rail against it.\n  The concealed carry laws of the States are reasonable limits on the \nsecond amendment. If you are to believe the second amendment should \nhave no limits, of course, you would vote for this amendment. But then \nI ask you the contrary question that some who are pro-gun ask those of \nus who believe in more gun control. How is it that the second amendment \nshould have no limits but the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, \nseventh, and eighth should have limits? Of course, if reasonable limits \nin a balancing test exist, and if there is any balancing test that \nmakes sense, it is the one of allowing each State to come up with its \nconcealed carry law.\n  I don't think this is an amendment of which anyone can be proud. I \nunderstand the power of the gun lobby. I understand we have different \nbeliefs and represent different States. But we are not trying to say \nwhat South Dakota should do. Why should South Dakota say what New York \nor California should do?\n  When I spoke--and I have great respect for the sponsor of this \namendment--when we were speaking in the gym yesterday morning, he said \none of the problems he hears about in his area--and I understand it--is \na truckdriver in the cab of his truck carries a gun and is allowed to \ncarry a gun. Why should that truckdriver, when he crosses State lines, \ngoes from South Dakota to North Dakota, be limited? I can understand \nthat argument. But this amendment goes way beyond that. It doesn't talk \nabout one weapon. It doesn't talk about a person who has been granted a \nlicense because he needs it for protection as he commerces across State \nlines. It is unlimited based on whatever the lowest common denominator \nState would do.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, a couple quick observations, if I may. \nFirst, I need to correct for the record the State of South Dakota has \nreciprocity agreements with 27 States. It does not have national \nreciprocity, which I think gets at the very point I am making; that is, \nanybody who has a concealed carry permit in one State is so confused by \nthis patchwork of laws we have that they cannot determine which State \nis legal and which State is not legal. That is a very serious problem \nfor people such as truckdrivers, such as individuals who want to \nprotect themselves when they travel across the country.\n  In terms of the arguments made to individuals who have access to \nfirearms, the 1968 Gun Control Act prohibits individuals from even \npossessing a firearm if the individual is under indictment or convicted \nof a crime punishable by more than a year, is an unlawful user or \naddict of a controlled substance, has been adjudicated to be mentally \nill or committed involuntarily to a mental institution, is subject to a \ncourt order restraining him or her from domestic violence or has been \nconvicted of a domestic violence misdemeanor.\n\n  My amendment does nothing to change Federal law. But if individuals \nare not allowed to possess a firearm, they certainly are not going to \nbe able to conceal and carry one.\n  I might add, with regard to the issue taking multiple guns in a sack \nand transporting them, there are Federal laws that prevent trafficking \nin firearms already. We do nothing to address\n\n[[Page S7817]]\n\nthat issue. What we simply do is allow those law-abiding citizens who \nhave concealed carry permits in their home States and choose to defend \nthemselves when they travel around the country to do that.\n  Florida is a case in point. Florida is a big State that has had \nconcealed carry permits for over 20 years and has agreements with \nmultiple States. There is no evidence whatsoever in the State of \nFlorida that there has been any suggestion of increasing crime.\n  Rather, I suggest the opposite would be true. I say to my colleague \nfrom New York that if someone who has a concealed carry permit travels \nto the State of New York, and I will say anybody who has a concealed \ncarry permit from the State of South Dakota goes to New York and is in \nCentral Park, Central Park would be a much safer place.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Will my colleague yield for a question?\n  Mr. THUNE. I yielded time to the Senator from South Carolina. I will \nbe happy to yield for a question later on the time of the Senator from \nNew York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be given \n30 seconds to ask the Senator a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. THUNE. I object, Mr. President. The Senator from South Carolina \nhas been yielded time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from South \nCarolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I always thought this debate kind of went \ndown the side of liberal versus conservative until I got to understand \nduring the confirmation hearings of Judge Sotomayor that Senator \nFeingold is probably one of the strongest gun guys in the Senate. So I \nhave had to recalibrate where I stand on this issue in terms of trying \nto pigeonhole people.\n  The point of the amendment, No. 1, is it should not be on the Defense \nbill. I think we all agree with that. We are talking about a Defense \nauthorization bill to protect our troops and provide them the equipment \nthey need and give them a pay raise. Now we are talking about guns and \nhate crimes. I don't know how we got here as a body, but we are here.\n  If you had to pick a nongermane amendment to talk about that makes \nsome sense, that most Americans, I think, would like us to be talking \nabout, it would be something fundamental to our country. I think most \nAmericans are a little bit right to center on an issue such as this, \nfor lack of a better phraseology. Most Americans believe in lawful and \nresponsible gun ownership. Quite frankly, that is what this is trying \nto bolster.\n  I make an observation that if you take the time to get a concealed \ncarry permit in South Carolina or any other State that allows it, you \nlet the law enforcement authorities know you are interested in owning a \ngun, you go to a training seminar that most States have to be able to \nget the permit or you have to go through whatever hoops the State set \nup to be able to carry a weapon in a concealed fashion, that you are \nprobably not high on the list of people who want to use a gun to commit \na crime. You would be incredibly stupid. You are pointing out to the \nwhole State: Hey, I have a gun. I argue that the people who go through \nthe exercise of getting a concealed carry permit are the ones you \nprobably want to have a gun because they seem to understand the \nresponsibility that goes with owning it.\n  The idea of does this make us less safe by allowing reciprocity \nnationwide makes no sense to me. I think of all the people we need to \nworry about committing gun crimes and violence unlawfully, the people \nwith concealed carry permits are probably last on the list.\n  Americans do object to guns being used in the commission of crimes, \nand a lot of States have enhanced punishment whereby if you use a \nfirearm in the commission of a crime your incarceration time can go up. \nIn other words, we want to deter people from using a gun in the \ncommission of a crime, and I think most Americans agree with those \nlaws. I think the city of Richmond was one of the first cities in the \nNation to have enhanced punishment for the use of a weapon. It is true \nthat some people do misuse a weapon. Some people misuse a car. But it \nis a fundamental right under our Constitution, according to our Supreme \nCourt, to possess a gun.\n  This amendment makes sense at every level. If I go through the \nprocess of getting a concealed carry permit in South Carolina and I go \nto another State that has a similar law, I automatically get the \nbenefit of that law--no more than that law. So I don't know what the \nlaw is about carrying a gun in Central Park in New York. I know this: \nIf you have a permit to carry a gun in South Dakota or South Carolina \nand you go to New York, you don't have any greater rights than the \npeople in New York. And I also understand that whatever Federal \nrestrictions on gun ownership that exist are not changed by this.\n  So this is pretty common sense to me. If someone goes through the \nprocess of getting a permit to carry a weapon in their own State and \nthey choose to go to another State, they automatically get the benefit \nof that State's law when it comes to concealed carry. They do not get \nany more, they do not get any less, and it may be less than I would \nhave in South Carolina. But because we are a group of people who travel \naround and visit among ourselves, this Federal legislation allows us to \ngo from one State to the next and get the benefit of any law that may \nexist when it comes to concealed carry. But the precondition is that \nyou would have to have that permit in your own State and you have to go \nthrough the rigors of getting that permit in your own State.\n  To anybody who says this makes America less safe or more dangerous, \nagain, that just makes no sense to me. Whatever gun crimes are being \ncommitted out there, they are not being committed, as an overwhelming \ngeneral rule, by the people who have gone through the process of \ngetting a permit and who carry a weapon. So, to me, it makes sense.\n  I congratulate my friend from South Dakota and tell him he has done \nsomething I think most Americans would agree with. He has allowed the \nAmerican public to be able to travel and get the benefit of whatever \nlaw exists in a State when it comes to carrying a weapon--no more, no \nless. And this argument that people are somehow going to start carrying \na weapon across the border makes no sense because whatever Federal \nrestrictions there are on arms trafficking still stand.\n  At the end of the day, this legislation will help people who follow \nthe law and obey gun laws to travel throughout the country without \ntripping themselves up and getting in trouble when they do not mean to \nget in trouble. If we didn't have this law, it really would be a mess. \nWhat we are trying to do is provide some clarity to gun ownership in \nAmerica. We are not enhancing the ability to commit a crime. Quite \nfrankly, I think it is the other way around; if everybody had the same \nattitude about gun ownership as people who get a permit, the country \nwould be okay.\n  We are not changing any law that regulates trafficking of firearms. \nWe are not allowing criminals to get access to guns. We are simply \nallowing people who go through the process of getting a permit in their \nown State to travel to any State in the Union which has a similar law \nand to get the benefit of that law. That will make life better for \nthem, it will make life better in terms of legal compliance, and I \nthink it is a proper role for the Federal Government to play.\n  This amendment enhances our second amendment rights. It doesn't \nchange them in a way that makes America less safe. It allows people who \nare going to do the right thing to be able to do the right thing with \nsome knowledge as to what the right thing is.\n  So Senator Thune has done the country a great service, and I think we \nwill have a big vote--I hope we will--across party lines. You don't \nhave to agree with my right to carry a weapon lawfully. You may not \nchoose that same right for yourself. But that is kind of what makes the \ncountry great--the ability for one citizen to understand that even \nthough I wouldn't make that choice, as long as you make a choice \nresponsibly, I am going to allow you to do that. That is what makes \nthis a very special place.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n[[Page S7818]]\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty-seven minutes 13 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would say for the record that I have \nmany more Democrats seeking time than I have time. I wish to alert \nthose who are coming to the floor that they are going to have to accept \nan abbreviated time. We did not have all the time we hoped for this \nmorning. I ask each of my speakers to also try to abbreviate their time \nin the interest of accommodating their colleagues.\n  I yield 15 minutes to Senator Feinstein and hope that she will yield \nback a sizeable portion of it.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I rise today to speak in strong opposition to this \namendment. If passed, this amendment would require States like \nCalifornia to allow people with concealed weapon permits from other \nStates to carry a concealed gun, or guns, even if they have failed to \nmeet California's stringent requirements for obtaining a permit.\n  Over 4 million people hold concealed weapon permits in the United \nStates, so this is no minor shift in policy. In fact, it would be a \nsweeping change with deadly consequences.\n  It completely undermines the rights of State government to protect \npublic safety. This amendment essentially overturns the standards and \nregulations that many States have enacted to prevent concealed weapons \nfrom falling into the wrong hands. This is not a philosophical debate, \nit is a matter of life and death.\n  My home State, California, sets a very high bar for those who wish to \nobtain a concealed weapon permit. It does not honor permits granted \nelsewhere. In fact, only 40,000 permits have been granted in California \nand we have a population of 38.2 million people. Contrast that with \nFlorida, a State of about half the size at 18 million people--it has \n580,000 permits; Georgia has 300,000 permits. Let me repeat, \nCalifornia, the nation's most populace State, has but 40,000 concealed \ncarry permits.\n  California's strict rules ensure that felons, the mentally ill, and \npeople who have been convicted of certain misdemeanor offenses or are \nconsidered a threat to others are automatically disqualified.\n  Those who do meet these qualifications do not automatically receive a \npermit. Specifically, in order to obtain a concealed weapon permit in \nCalifornia, an applicant must, No. 1, undergo fingerprinting and pass \nthrough a Federal background check; No. 2, complete a course of gun \ntraining; No. 3, be considered a person of good moral character by the \nlocal sheriff; and No. 4, just as importantly, demonstrate a good cause \nfor needing a concealed weapon permit. This gives State and local \nauthorities the discretion.\n  This amendment will force California to honor permits issued by all \nother States, including those which allow minors, convicted criminals, \nand people with no firearm safety training to carry concealed weapons. \nOnly the time, place, and manner requirements of a State would remain \nintact under the Thune amendment. For example, if the State of South \nCarolina had a law making it illegal to carry a weapon into an office \nbuilding that was government owned, that law would still be valid for \nall out-of-State concealed carry permit holders. However, this is a \nvery narrow exception.\n\n  This isn't just bad policy, it is extremely dangerous policy. The \nThune amendment is designed to undermine the rights of States to \ndetermine their own rules and regulations for concealed weapons \npermits. Here we have people who believe in States rights. Yet when it \ncomes to something they really want, they are willing to pounce on \nStates rights and destroy them.\n  California's standards, I admit, are tougher than most, but many \nother States routinely deny concealed weapon permits for various \nreasons: 31 States prohibit alcohol abusers from obtaining concealed \ncarry permits; 35 States prohibit persons convicted of misdemeanors \nfrom carrying concealed weapons; 31 States require completion of gun \nsafety programs. The Thune amendment obliterates all of these public \nsafety standards.\n  It is important to note that 12 States voluntarily honor concealed \nweapon permits carried in any other State. Another 25 States recognize \npermits issued by States with similar or equivalent concealed weapon \npermits standards. But 11 States, including California, choose not to \nrecognize any out-of-State permits. These States have made a choice \nabout what is best for their citizens, and that choice ought to be \nrespected. This amendment says that the views of California's Governor, \nsheriffs, police, and its citizens don't matter, but the views of those \nwho promote guns do matter. I cannot accept that.\n  If this amendment were to pass, it would possibly allow those with \nconcealed weapon permits to bring one or more banned assault weapons \ninto our State.\n  We have consulted with the Congressional Research Service, and they \nstate the following:\n\n       The amendment would appear to have a preemptive effect on \n     State reciprocity laws or regulations because it would appear \n     to require those States which have more stringent eligibility \n     requirements for concealed carry to recognize the permits of \n     other States where the eligibility requirements are less \n     stringent.\n       It could be argued that the language of this amendment is \n     broad enough such that it would allow certain firearms that \n     are banned from purchase or possession in one State to be \n     brought into that State. For example, one could legally \n     purchase, possess, and carry a concealed permit for a firearm \n     that is banned in States like California, Connecticut, \n     Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and New York.\n\n  That is not my statement, that is the opinion of the Congressional \nResearch Service. This amendment would put in jeopardy States' assault \nweapons control laws. I don't know whether that was intended, but this \nis a very broad and vague piece of legislation that is being debated. \nIf this amendment is agreed to, I believe assault weapons will be \nbrought into California and other border States. These weapons could \nend up being smuggled into Mexico.\n  Some say, that an armed society is a polite society, and they portray \nconcealed weapon carriers as responsible citizens who are simply \nexercising their rights. Earlier this morning on television, I heard a \nSenator say that only good, responsible people have these permits. That \nsimply is not true. Let me give an example.\n  In April, Richard Poplawski killed three Pittsburgh police officers. \nHe had the right to carry a weapon in Pennsylvania even though he was \nthe subject of a restraining order filed by an ex-girlfriend.\n  In March, Michael McLendon killed 11 people, including the wife of a \ndeputy sheriff, before taking his own life following a gun battle with \npolice in Alabama. He too, had a concealed weapon permit.\n  When I hear people on television saying only the good people get \nthese permits, that is simply not true. In my view, these unstable men \nshould never have been permitted to own any weapon for any reason. \nLastly, in February of this year, Frank Garcia killed four people in a \nshooting rampage in upstate New York. He held a concealed weapon permit \nin that State. This year, too many people have been killed by those who \nhave the right to carry a concealed weapon. We do not want other \nState's concealed weapons permitees in the State of California. We have \n38 million people. It is a diverse, disparate population. Guns do not \nhelp. I believe it is unlikely these men would have obtained concealed \nweapon permits in my State and, candidly, we want to keep it that way.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter from \nthe Governor of our State, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who opposes this \namendment, along with 400 U.S. mayors and the International Association \nof Chiefs of Police.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                State Capitol,\n\n                                    Sacramento, CA, July 20, 2009.\n     Hon. Dianne Feinstein,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Feinstein. I am writing to seek your \n     assistance in protecting states' rights by opposing Senator \n     Thune's amendment to the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, \n     which would allow people who are issued concealed weapons \n     permits in their home state to carry those weapons in any \n     state. This amendment would undermine the rights and \n     responsibilities of state governments across this nation.\n       This is a simple question of protecting California's \n     ability to determine who is allowed to carry a concealed \n     weapon within\n\n[[Page S7819]]\n\n     our borders. Other states have less stringent requirements \n     than ours, which means that a permit holder who would be \n     ineligible for a concealed weapon under California law would \n     be able to obtain a permit from another state and, under \n     Senator Thune's amendment, still carry that weapon in \n     California.\n       Our elected representatives--with the support of the \n     majority of Californians--have set guidelines that are \n     stricter than most states'. In California, background checks \n     are conducted using a fingerprint-based system so the state \n     can verify that the recipient of the permit is eligible to \n     possess a firearm under state and federal law. Also, if a \n     person becomes ineligible to possess a firearm because he or \n     she was convicted of a felony or other disqualifying crime, \n     that information is forwarded to their local agency so the \n     permit can be revoked.\n       I have consistently supported states' rights to determine \n     their own fates on a variety of issues. This amendment would \n     trample the rights I have worked hard to protect, and I urge \n     your opposition:\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Arnold Schwarzenegger,\n                                                         Governor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I believe the amendment is reckless. I believe it is \nirresponsible. I believe it will lead to more weapons and more violence \nin the streets of our Nation. I hope and pray this body will turn down \nthis very ill-advised amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time remaining is 25 minutes 4 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. The other side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 32 minutes 37 seconds.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I yield up to 15 minutes to the Senator \nfrom Virginia.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise in support of this amendment. I \nbelieve it is reasonable. It is not as draconian in its implications as \nmany of my colleagues, whom I greatly respect in terms of their \nconcerns, are anticipating.\n  I would also like to say there has been a lot of misinformation on \nthe Senate floor about this amendment, to the effect it will allow \nfelons, people who are mentally defective, and other dangerous \nindividuals to carry weapons on the streets of American cities and also \nto buy up hordes of guns and transport them into places, as Senator \nSchumer mentioned, such as New York City. My colleague from New York \ngave as an example, in his terms, a Crip or a Blood moving to Vermont, \nestablishing residency, then bringing a permit down into New York and \nbeing able to carry a weapon with impunity.\n  I think the reality of that particular situation is the gang members \nalready have their guns. They don't need this bill. In fact, this \namendment has protections that would prevent those who engage in \ncriminal activity--such as gang members--from taking advantage of this \nlegislation. The people who need this bill are the ones the gang \nmembers might be threatening.\n  With respect to standards of conduct, aspects of criminality, and \nissues of mental health, it is important to note there is a Federal \nfloor under this amendment that guarantees certain standards will be \nmet regardless of varying State standards. If you read the amendment, \nit states:\n\n       A person who is not prohibited by Federal law from \n     possessing, transporting, shipping or receiving a firearm--\n     and who meets other conditions, may be granted reciprocity.\n\n  If you go into the Federal law, and I am going to read from 27 CFR \nsection 478--this is the current standard in terms of being able to \npossess a firearm or ammunition.\n  Anyone who--\n\n       Has been convicted in any court of a crime punishable by \n     imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year;\n       May not possess a firearm.\n\n  Anyone who:\n\n       Is a fugitive from justice;\n\n  Anyone who:\n\n       Is an unlawful user or addicted to any controlled \n     substance;\n\n  Anyone who:\n\n       Has been adjudicated as mentally defective or has been \n     committed to a mental institution;\n\n  Anyone who:\n\n       Is an alien or illegally or unlawfully in the United States \n     or an alien admitted to the United States under a \n     nonimmigrant visa;\n\n  Anyone who:\n\n       Has been discharged from the Armed Forces under \n     dishonorable conditions;\n\n  Anyone who:\n\n       Having been a citizen of the United States, has renounced \n     his or her citizenship;\n\n  Anyone who:\n\n       Is subject to a court order that restrains the person from \n     harassing, stalking, or threatening an intimate partner or \n     child of such intimate partner; or\n\n  Anyone who:\n\n       Has been convicted of a misdemeanor crime of domestic \n     violence--cannot lawfully receive, possess, ship, or \n     transport a firearm.\n\n  In addition:\n\n       A person who is under indictment for a crime punishable by \n     imprisonment for a term exceeding 1 year cannot lawfully \n     receive a firearm.\n\n  Those are the Federal guarantees, the floor under which this \nreciprocity legislation operates.\n  Senator Lautenberg has said in his comments that passing this \nlegislation is akin to allowing someone from another State to come into \nyour State and follow their speed limits. This is not an accurate \ninterpretation of this amendment. The amendment specifically provides \nthat anyone carrying a firearm into another State must follow the laws \nregarding firearms usage in that State, and I quote from the amendment:\n\n       . . . in a State that allows residents of the State to \n     obtain licenses or permits to carry concealed firearms . . .\n\n  A person gaining reciprocity is:\n\n       Entitled to carry such a firearm subject to the same laws \n     and conditions that govern specific places and manner in \n     which a firearm may be carried by a person issued a permit by \n     the State in which the firearm is carried.\n\n  I would say the better analogy at work here is the driver's licensing \nprocess itself. States decide the conditions under which a license can \nbe granted, but the nature of interstate travel allows licenses issued \nin another State to be recognized across the country, so long as the \nholders of those licenses obey the laws of the State in which they are \ndriving.\n  I also keep hearing that this amendment will increase the number of \npurchases of handguns and other weapons. I would like to clarify for \nthis body, as someone who holds a concealed carry permit, a permit to \ncarry does not allow anyone to purchase a firearm automatically. One \nstill has to go through the entire process of the background check as \nif you did not have a permit.\n  Illegal firearms sales are a separate matter for this body to \naddress--one that we clearly should be focusing on--but they fall \noutside the parameters of this amendment.\n  The issue of gun usage in our country understandably divides people--\nusually along the lines of those who believe that any relaxation of gun \nlaws will benefit criminal and violent activity versus those who \nbelieve gun laws need to be modified in order to allow law-abiding \npeople to defend themselves. I have a great deal of empathy for those \nwho have been the victims of gun violence. I have worked with citizens \ngroups as well as our Governor in the aftermath of the Virginia Tech \nshootings, to focus our approach. We have made significant improvements \nin our laws since then, including working to modify privacy laws as \nthey relate to mental health matters, which was the primary concern in \nthe Virginia Tech shooting, and also to improve the instant background \ncheck process. I will continue to work on these areas.\n  I also believe very strongly that the violence we see in our streets \nand in our neighborhoods must be addressed. But very little of that \nviolence has ever been caused by those who seek permits to carry. As I \nmentioned before, the people who are perpetrating that kind of violence \nalready have their guns. Their access to those guns is a matter we \nshould all focus on. But few criminals are going to go down to the \ncounty courthouse and file for a permit. Those who seek permits to \ncarry and who are within the Federal guidelines specifically addressed \nin this bill seek to do so in order to protect themselves from the \nviolence we see on our streets.\n\n  I would say, when I look at this amendment, a couple clear examples \ncome to mind. One is my father who, in his later years, lived in \nFlorida and then Arkansas, and would drive alone in his car to come and \nvisit me and my brother, who lived in Minnesota. It was usually at \nleast a 2-day journey. My father was older. He was by himself in\n\n[[Page S7820]]\n\nthe car. He was a classic target of potential criminal activity.\n  He carried a weapon, a firearm, when he traveled. When he stopped at \nnight and went into a motel, he brought that weapon with him. You check \nin a motel by yourself, you are 77 years old, people are going to start \nlooking at you. I don't think people who are in that situation need to \nwonder if they are committing a felony by having a gun to be able to \ndefend themselves when they are in that situation.\n  Somebody else who comes to mind are all these truck drivers we see on \nthe roads anytime we are on the interstate. These are independent \ncontractors. They are people who are out there making a living the hard \nway. They constantly cross State boundaries. They have to worry about \nwhether their truck is going to break down. They have to wonder \nsometimes, where they stop, whether they are going to be victimized if \nthey sleep in the cabin of their own truck. Many can legally carry in \ntheir own State. Do they have to worry, if they pull over for the night \nin another State, if they try to defend themselves they are committing \na felony? This is the type of situation I believe this legislation is \nattempting to address.\n  I believe it will have a beneficial effect. I believe strongly we \nneed to work together in this body to address other situations of gun \nviolence in this country. I am glad to add whatever insights I can have \nto do so, but I support this legislation and I intend to vote for it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield 9 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey, Senator Menendez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor saddened by the \ntragic death yesterday of Marc Dinardo, 1 of 5 of New Jersey's finest \npolice officers shot last week by a gunman. He was killed, not by a \nlaw-abiding gun owner like millions of Americans, a sportsman or a \nhunter, but by one lone armed man, too willing to pull the trigger to \nkill another human being in cold blood.\n  Last night, or the night before, gunshots were fired in Jersey City. \nIn Newark, three people were killed, the victims of gun violence.\n  The statistics are staggering. In 1 year, 30,896 people died from gun \nviolence, 12,791 people were murdered, another 69,863 people survived \ngun injuries, 48,676 people were injured in a gun attack.\n  According to the Brady campaign, in 1 year, 20,784 American children \nand teens were shot in murders, assaults, suicides, accidents or by \npolice intervention. Homicide was the second leading cause of death for \nyoung people ages 10 to 24 years old, and 84 percent of victims were \nkilled by a firearm. Amazingly, firearm homicide is the second leading \ncause of death for young people ages 1 to 19.\n  These numbers are shocking. I think about what this amendment does, \nwhom it affects, and I cannot help but ask who is it who feels the need \nto carry a concealed weapon and for what purpose? One must ask how we \nwould ever want to permit, as a matter not of State but Federal law, \nthose whose motives may not be pure to walk into a playground, school, \ncrowded stadium in any State licensed under Federal law to carry a \nconcealed weapon in their coat pocket or bag. Do we honestly believe \nthat person will be the priest or the rabbi? Do we think it will be the \nmother taking her child to a school, saying: Let me think, I have the \nhouse keys, the cell phone--oh yes, the permit for the gun in my bag.\n  Will it be the law-abiding sportsmen using their rifles for target \npractice? Sportsmen don't need to conceal their weapons.\n  Whom do we think will benefit from this amendment? Whom do we think \nwill carry a concealed Glock 39 through the streets of our cities, \nperhaps into a playground, stadium, church or mosque? It will not be \nthat mother or that hunter. It will not be that sportsman. As Paul \nHelmke, the president of the Brady Campaign, so aptly pointed out, it \nwill be something like Richard Poplowski, the White supremacist, armed \nwith an AK-47, who allegedly murdered three Pittsburgh police officers \non his front porch.\n  He was a concealed carry permit holder. It will be Michael McClendon, \nthe suicide shooter who went on a rampage in Alabama, murdered ten \npeople, then shot himself. He too was a concealed weapon carry permit \nholder.\n  It will be criminals such as Michael Iheme, charged with first-degree \nmurder in the shooting death of his wife in St. Louis Park, MN. She had \nan active restraining order against her husband because of a history of \ndomestic violence. After shooting his wife, he called 911 and said, ``I \nkilled that woman that messed my life up.'' He was a concealed carry \npermit holder as well.\n  We are being asked to seriously consider an amendment that would \nbenefit those criminals, not their victims, an amendment that would \noverride State laws and federally mandate States to recognize the \nconcealed weapon permits of people such as these three notorious \ncriminals, even though they may not be residents of that State, even \nthough they may be legally barred from possessing weapons in that \nState.\n  Let's make no mistake, this amendment is a blatant infringement on \nStates rights, a stealth repeal of States' hard-fought gun laws. It \nstrips legislators and Governors duly elected by the people to \nrepresent the best interests of their constituents to make sound, \ncompetent, informed judgments about how best to regulate guns in their \nown State, to make those judgments based on the recommendations and \ninput of law enforcement officials who know and understand the specific \nsituation on the ground, on the street, in their cities, in their \ncommunities.\n  Even the Congressional Research Service has found this amendment \nwould have a preemptive effect on State reciprocity laws. They said in \ntheir report:\n\n       This amendment is broad enough such that it would allow \n     certain firearms that are banned from purchase or possession \n     in one State to be brought into that State. For example, one \n     could legally purchase, possess, and carry a concealed permit \n     for a firearm that is banned in States such as California, \n     Connecticut, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, and \n     New York.\n\n  In my view, this would turn the clock back on reasonable, responsible \ngun laws that States such as New Jersey have passed to protect us from \nmen like Richard Poplowski, Michael McLendon, and Michael Iheme. On the \ncontrary, common sense, logic, reason, rationality, good judgment all \nsay that that amendment will make our streets less safe.\n  And, contrary to the usual approach of my Republican colleagues to \nmaximize States rights, this amendment will trample the right of States \nto pass their own laws that keep guns out of the hands of criminals.\n  Too many times, for too long, we have seen blood on our streets from \nsenseless, pointless, lethal gun violence. We have tried, in our States \nand in this Chamber, to mitigate it. We have tried in our own ways to \nstop it. We have all been outraged at those who, in language, attitude, \nand demeanor, seem to accept it as part of American culture. I do not \naccept it as such.\n  We cannot stand down from battle being waged by law enforcement in \nevery city and State against gun violence in our streets. Our charge, \nour solemn responsibility, is to end the violence, not add to it. There \nare too many guns on our streets as it is, but there are also too many \npeople willing to use them.\n  Let's not make it easier to carry a concealed weapon against the \nwishes of the people of a State whose elected representatives express \ntheir will and say, not in our State, to blithely, legally have a \nFederal mandate that would permit them to cross State lines into your \nneighborhood or my neighborhood.\n  The evidence is before us in the names of Richard Poplowski, Michael \nMcLendon, and Michael Iheme, all of whom had permits to carry a \nconcealed weapon. If their States want to permit it, fine, but why \nshould they come into my State and create the opportunity to murder \nsome innocent family when my State, my government, my legislature has \ndetermined that, in fact, there is a better way to protect our \ncitizens.\n  When we go down this road, it is a slippery slope. Some day, some \nFederal issue will come in your State and you will not want the Federal \nGovernment to tell your State how to protect your citizens. If you \npermit this to happen today, then it will happen tomorrow in a way that \nyou will not like. That is a dangerous precedent. That is a precedent I \ndo not think we want.\n\n[[Page S7821]]\n\n  Finally, let us remember the victims. Let us remember Officer Marc \nDinardo and all of the victims of gun violence who, in fact, are out \nthere protecting us each and every day. They will not know the good guy \nfrom the bad guy. They will know if this amendment passes and becomes \nlaw that someone could have a concealed weapon on them. At the end of \ntheir day, their lives will be greater at risk. That is not something I \nwant on my conscience. I do not know which Member of the Senate wants \nit on theirs.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I do not want to get into the weeds here, \nbut the Senator mentioned Michael Iheme. He did not have a carry \npermit. One of the other gentleman whom he mentioned, Willie Donaldson, \nevidently the court recognized that the person had acted in self-\ndefense and he did not do any jail time for it.\n  The broader point is, criminals commit crimes, that is what they do. \nCriminals kill people. This is not directed at criminals, this is \ndirected at law-abiding citizens who want to protect themselves. The \nstatistics I mentioned earlier make it very clear. If you want to look \nat the studies, there is a lot more defensive gun use by victims than \nthere are crimes committed with firearms. It is further estimated that \nthere are as many as 2.5 million defensive uses of firearms in the \nUnited States each year. Again, many of those go unreported.\n  But I think you have to come back to the point that of the 5 million \npeople in this country who are concealed carry permit holders, if you \nassumed that every instance of reported crime by gun control groups, of \nimproper firearm use by individuals with concealed carry permits, if \nevery one of those is true, something that can be debated, but let's \nassume it is true, over an entire year for every 142,857 permit \nholders, there would be one improper use of a firearm.\n  To put that another way, concealed carry permit holders would be 15 \ntimes less likely than the rest of the general public to commit murder. \nThe point I am making is criminals commit crimes. That is what they do. \nThey are criminals. Criminals kill people. What we are trying to do \nhere is to allow law-abiding people to protect themselves from \ncriminals when they travel across State lines, striking the right \nbalance between Federal, the Constitution, which protects an \nindividual's second amendment right, and State laws. We are not \npreempting State laws. Illinois and Wisconsin preclude or prevent \nanybody from owning a concealed carry permit or having a concealed \ncarry permit in their States. So this amendment does not even apply to \nthem. Nobody can carry a concealed weapon in either of those States. It \nrecognizes the rights of States and all of the State laws that apply. \nMost States have place and time restrictions. In my State of South \nDakota you cannot carry in a place that serves alcohol, you cannot \ncarry in schools, you cannot carry in courthouses.\n  So to suggest that somebody is going to transport a whole bunch of \nguns, which would be a violation of Federal laws because there are laws \nagainst trafficking, into an area of a State, public school, or \nsomeplace like that, are wild exaggerations and scare tactics that are \nnot based on any evidence. The data we have that suggest the contrary.\n  I yield such time to the Senator from Wyoming as he may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, today I rise in support of the Thune \namendment. The Thune amendment to me is very straightforward. It does \nnot preempt State concealed carry laws, it does not create a Federal \nconcealed carry permit. It simply allows law-abiding individuals, law-\nabiding individuals to lawfully carry concealed firearms across State \nlines while following the laws of the host State.\n  Just like a driver's license--this is my Wyoming driver's license--\njust like a driver's license, the Thune amendment is a license for \nself-defense across State lines. It means with this license--my \nconcealed carry license from Wyoming--I will not be limited to Wyoming. \nJust like a regular driver's license, just about the same photo, \nidentification issues, and the only difference is this one from Wyoming \nsays ``concealed firearm permit.'' It has on it a picture of a handgun.\n  Well, today we are hearing the same arguments against the Thune \namendment that we heard from the people who wanted to ban assault \nweapons. During that semiautomatic assault weapons debate, we heard all \nof the scare tactics. We heard: There will be blood all over the \nstreets. Terrorists will be able to purchase Uzis and AK-47s. Our \ncities will turn into the Wild West. The lives of law enforcement will \nbe in danger.\n  This is simply not the case. A study for the Department of Justice \nfound 40 percent of felons had not committed certain crimes because \nthey feared the potential victims would be armed.\n  The National Institute of Justice conducted a survey that found that \n74 percent of criminals who had committed burglaries or violent crimes \nsaid they would be less likely to commit a crime if they thought the \nvictim would be armed.\n  In States where concealed carry permits are issued, it is a fact that \nthe crime rates go down. Let's take a look at Illinois and Florida. \nIllinois does not allow concealed carry permits. The number of murders \nlast year in Chicago, 511.\n  Since Florida passed their concealed carry bill and signed it into \nlaw, violent crime has dropped by 32 percent, and murders in Florida \ndropped 58 percent.\n  Criminals do not get licensed to carry guns. Criminals do not fill \nout the paperwork, go to the courthouse, get fingerprinted, and wait \nweeks to receive their concealed carry permit. Criminals issue their \nown concealed carry permits.\n  In the District of Columbia, crime rates are high because the \ncriminals have the advantage over the victims. The gun laws in the \nDistrict outlaw law-abiding citizens from self-defense while people \nwalk home from work or from the store. They know it is highly unlikely \nin the District of Columbia that the victims will be carrying a gun for \nself-defense.\n  This is a commonsense amendment. It makes sense for law-abiding gun \nowners all across the country. I urge my colleagues to vote in support \nof the Thune amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask that the Senator from New Jersey be recognized for \n9 minutes and then, after an intervening speaker on the other side of \nthe aisle, the Senator from California be recognized for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I rise in strong opposition to the \namendment that is being offered, because it would override our safety \nlaws, gun safety laws in my State and other States across the country. \nThe Thune amendment is an outright violation of States rights.\n  The fact is this vote is not about the Second Amendment, it is not \nabout gun rights, this is about respecting local communities and \nletting them make their own decisions about how to keep their streets, \ntheir homes, and their businesses safe.\n  As this dangerous amendment gets pushed to a vote, we are seeing \nopposition grow across this country. In addition to newspaper \neditorials, we are seeing Governors and mayors and local law \nenforcement calling on the Senate to vote against this amendment.\n  This placard shows the wide-ranging groups opposing this amendment, \ngroups opposed to the Thune amendment: Over 450 mayors, people who have \nresponsibility for those in their community, Major Cities Chiefs \nAssociation, International Association of Chiefs of Police, State \nLegislators Against Illegal Guns, National Network to End Domestic \nViolence.\n  In a letter to the Senate, the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice implored Congress to:\n\n       Act quickly and take all necessary steps to defeat this \n     dangerous and unacceptable legislation.\n\n  That is from the International Association of Chiefs of Police. They \nknow what to do about concealed guns, and they will decide within their \nown communities. But the Thune amendment\n\n[[Page S7822]]\n\ndoes not just steal States of their right to create their own laws, it \nabolishes State laws that are on the books right now. The Thune \namendment throws State laws out the window.\n  For the 35 States that have chosen to keep criminals with misdemeanor \nconvictions from carrying concealed weapons, this amendment abolishes \ntheir laws. For the 31 States that have chosen to keep alcohol abusers \nfrom carrying concealed weapons, this amendment abolishes their laws.\n  The Thune amendment would force States to accept the weakest standard \nin the country and brings about a race to the bottom. Many of us \nrepresent States that do not want lax standards on who can walk around \nour communities with a weapon hidden in their garments.\n  To make matters worse, the Thune amendment not only overrides a \nState's concealed weapons laws, it could also override a State's \nassault weapons ban. That means if we have a ban in my State and \nsomeone gets a concealed weapons permit, they could bring an assault \nweapon into our State. This means even if a State has a ban on assault \nweapons, under this amendment, someone could legally enter that State \nwith a hidden Uzi or assault weapon and travel around with it. Think \nabout it. If a State's residents are not permitted to carry a \nparticular weapon, someone can come into that State with a weapon that \nnow is prohibited in that State.\n  That is one of the reasons more than 450 mayors across the country \nhave expressed alarm about the Thune amendment. As these mayors \nexplained in a letter to the Congress:\n\n       Each state ought to have the ability to decide whether to \n     accept concealed carry permits issued in other states.\n\n  I don't want it in New Jersey, and I think Members across this \nChamber will say: No, I don't want it in my State as well.\n  Supporters of this amendment like to claim that only law-abiding \ncitizens get their hands on concealed weapons permits. But that is not \ntrue. In Alaska, for example, criminals who have repeatedly committed \nviolent misdemeanors are permitted to carry concealed weapons. In \nAlaska, criminals who have repeatedly committed sex offenses are \npermitted to carry concealed weapons. According to a new study, during \nthe 2-year period between May 2007 and April 2009, people holding \nconcealed handgun permits killed at least 7 police officers and 44 \nother innocent people across the country.\n  Recently we have seen several gruesome examples of senseless murders \ncommitted by people holding concealed weapons permits. A few months \nago, a 28-year-old concealed weapons permit holder went on a murderous \nrampage in Alabama. First he shot and killed his mother. Then he gunned \ndown 10 others, including 2 young mothers and a father and an 18-month-\nold girl.\n  A few weeks later, another concealed weapons permit holder went on a \nkilling spree in Binghamton, NY. This gunman drove a car up to a \ncitizenship services center and barricaded the back door with his car \nso the innocent people who were inside would be trapped as he proceeded \nto kill those who were in his sights. The gunman sprayed gunfire \nthroughout the center, killed 13 people, and wounded several more \nbefore taking his own life.\n  The next day another concealed carry permit holder destroyed more \nlives. In Pittsburgh, two police officers arrived at a house to quell a \ndomestic conflict. The two officers were ambushed and killed by the \ngunman who held a concealed weapons permit. Minutes later, the gunman \nshot and killed a third officer who arrived at the scene.\n  The special interest gun lobby is hanging its hopes on the prospect \nthat this Chamber will abandon common sense and pass the Thune \namendment. But this gun lobby's dream is a nightmare for our country. \nIt violates States rights and it will make it easier for gun \ntraffickers to move firearms. If the Thune amendment becomes law, \ntraffickers could now load up a car and take guns across State lines \nlegally, as long as the driver has a concealed weapons permit in any \nState.\n  History will record that this Senate was asked to decide whether to \nput families further in danger or keep them safe, whether to savage \nState laws or honor them, and whether to usurp States rights or \npreserve them. I hope my colleagues will do the right thing. I urge \nthem to vote no, no, no, on the Thune amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I think a little bit of history is \nimportant for us now. Let me give a quote of what Thomas Jefferson had \nto say. It is important for us to hear him. We recognize his wisdom in \nlots of what he did for us as one of the Founders of this country. Here \nis what he said about guns: Gun control laws disarm only those who are \nneither inclined nor determined to commit crimes. Such laws only make \nworse for the assaulted and better for the assailants. They serve, \nrather, to encourage rather than to prevent homicides, for an unarmed \nman may be attacked with greater confidence than an armed man.\n  Granted, that was in a different day and time, but his words ring \ntrue. To those who are opposing this amendment who truly believe we \nought to have a total ban on firearms, I recognize that is a legitimate \nposition for some of those people. But what I find both disingenuous \nand also curious and funny at the same time is the number of my \ncolleagues who now come to the floor to preserve States rights when 95 \npercent of their votes, in the last Congress and this one and the ones \nthat preceded, voted to take away those very same States rights in \nevery other area of freedom.\n  We just had a hearing on a Supreme Court Justice. She got it wrong on \nthe second amendment. The second amendment is written into the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights. Why was the 14th amendment even \nbrought up to Congress? The historical debate shows that during \nreconstruction, freed Black slaves were losing their right to own a gun \nsimply because they were Black, simply because they were freed slaves. \nMany Southern States passed laws taking that right away. The due \nprocess of the 14th amendment came about so that we could preserve the \nright of individuals to own arms and defend themselves.\n  What I find ludicrous in this debate is any discussion of an assault \nweapons ban or assault weapons. You can't conceal one. That is No. 1. \nNo. 2, we had the Senator from New Jersey mention the Uzi. It is \nillegal to own an Uzi in this country. So you are already a criminal, \nyou are already a felon, you are already one of those individuals \nJefferson was talking about when you claim to say that we are going to \nstep all over State laws.\n  We had a vote in terms of honoring States rights in terms of the \nnational park bill on guns. Twenty-nine of my colleagues, thirteen of \nwhom now are defending States rights, stepped all over States rights \nwith their vote against the Coburn amendment when it came to allowing \npeople to have supreme their State law in terms of national parks.\n  Nobody comes to the Senate floor a purist. The vast majority of \npeople who are debating against this amendment on the fundamental \nprinciple of stepping on States rights have a voting record that 98 \npercent of the time they don't care about States rights; they care \nabout the Federal Government.\n  I have an offer. Any Member who wishes to vote against this \namendment, if you will all endorse the Enumerated Powers Act and see \nthat we pass it through Congress, then you can demonstrate your \nfidelity to the 10th amendment. Except nary a one of those who are \nopposing this amendment has endorsed the Enumerated Powers Act in this \nCongress or the last. The arguments ring hollow when we talk about the \n10th amendment because the true action would be to recognize the \nlimited powers of the Federal Government to enforce the 10th amendment, \nand we wouldn't be having this debate.\n  States rights are convenient only when it comes to something we don't \nlike. They are rarely utilized to truly defend States rights. You have \nto follow the laws of the State you are in; that is respecting States \nrights. For every incident and tragedy of somebody who had a concealed \ncarry permit, we can give you 10,000 tragedies of those where gun \ncontrol allowed the criminals to have guns but the innocents not.\n\n[[Page S7823]]\n\n  I hope the American people will look at this debate and say: There is \na fundamental right in this country, which the Supreme Court will get \nright in this next session, that is guaranteed to us as part of our \nliberty. It was inculcated into everything our Founders did. Knowing it \nto be true, it was written into our Constitution. Many of the rights we \nhave today that we cling to so dearly were never even considered by our \nFounders but have come about as a result of what the judicial branch \nhas said.\n  If you are going to use States rights as a position to defend your \nvote against this bill, I suggest that your constituencies look at your \nother votes on States rights and see if there isn't some big dissonance \nwith that position. You will find it in every case.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be yielded 7 \nminutes rather than 5. I have cleared that with Senator Durbin.\n  Mr. THUNE. How much time remains on the other side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes 35 seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I ask unanimous consent for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I agree with the Senator from Oklahoma on \none thing. I hope the American people are watching this debate. I truly \ndo. We are talking about a radical proposal that is opposed by \nDemocrats and Republicans in my home State. I have never seen the \nphones ringing off the hook to this degree.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement by \nthe California Police Chiefs Association.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                        California\n\n\n                                    Police Chiefs Association,\n\n                                     Sacramento, CA July 21, 2009.\n     Re Protect America's police officers, our citizens, and \n         states rights by voting no on the Thune amendment (S.845/\n         H.R.197/H.R. 1620).\n\n     Senator Barbara Boxer,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Boxer, the California Police Chiefs \n     Association is strongly opposed to the Thune Amendment \n     (S.845). This legislation would require California to honor \n     concealed carry permits granted by other states, even when \n     those permit holders could not meet the standards required by \n     California law. This would strip California of the power to \n     create its own public safety laws, and hand that power to the \n     states with the weakest protections. The Thune Amendment \n     would also empower gun traffickers and threaten the safety of \n     our police officers.\n       California, like most states across America, has intensely \n     deliberated how best to balance community safety needs with \n     the rights of our citizens to bear arms. We have, like almost \n     all states, set various standards in addition to those in \n     place under federal law. The linchpin of California concealed \n     carry permitting is local law enforcement discretion. In \n     addition to certain explicit statutory provisions, such as \n     the exclusion of violent misdemeanants and certain juvenile \n     offenders, California police chiefs and sheriffs have the \n     discretion to deny a permit if they believe an applicant will \n     present a danger to public safety. California also requires \n     each applicant to complete a firearms safety course, \n     demonstrate moral character, and justify the reason for \n     applying for a permit. California's standards keep guns out \n     of the hands of dangerous criminals. The Thune Amendment, \n     however, would permit citizens of states with less strict \n     laws to freely carry concealed weapons in our state.\n       This legislation will also aid and abet gun traffickers. \n     Criminal traffickers already rely on states with weak laws as \n     a source for the guns they sell illegally, according to a \n     report issued by Mayors Against Illegal Guns in December \n     2008. In fact, the report showed that 30% of crime guns \n     crossed state lines before they were recovered. This bill \n     would frustrate law enforcement by allowing criminal \n     traffickers to travel to their rendezvous with loaded \n     handguns in the glove compartment. Even more troubling, a \n     trafficker holding an out-of-state permit would be able to \n     walk the streets of any city with a backpack full of loaded \n     guns, enjoying impunity from police unless he was caught in \n     the act of selling a firearm to another criminal.\n       Finally, this law would not only frustrate our police \n     officers, it would endanger them. Policing our streets is \n     perilous enough without increasing the number of guns that \n     officers encounter. Confusion among police officers as to the \n     legality of firearm possession could result in catastrophe. \n     Congress should be working to make the job of a police \n     officer more safe--not less.\n       As President of the California Police Chiefs Association, I \n     urge you to protect California's ability to protect its \n     communities from gun violence by voting against the Thune \n     Amendment (S. 845/H.R. 197/H.R. 1620).\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Bernard K. Melekian,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. The police chiefs, letter is so tough and so strong. It \nreads in part:\n\n       The California Police Chiefs Association is strongly \n     opposed to the Thune amendment. The legislation would require \n     California to honor concealed carry permits granted by other \n     States, even when those permit holders could not meet the \n     standards required by California law. The Thune amendment \n     would empower gun traffickers and threaten the safety of our \n     police officers.\n\n  If there is one thing we should do for our police officers, it is not \nmake their lives any tougher than they are. We recently lost four \npolice officers in Oakland. The whole community suffered along with \nthose families. My police chiefs talk about this:\n\n       A trafficker holding an out-of-State permit would be able \n     to walk the streets of any city in America with a backpack \n     full of loaded guns, enjoying impunity from police unless he \n     was caught in the act of selling a firearm.\n\n  This is one of the strongest letters I have ever seen from my police \nchiefs. This debate is not about the right to own a gun. That has been \nsettled by the Supreme Court in the Heller case. It is about allowing \nStates to determine their own laws. And I totally get why some more \nrural States with fewer people would have different laws on conceal and \ncarry than a State of 38 million people, my home State of California. \nLeave us alone. Leave us alone. You want to have conceal and carry with \nvery few requirements, fine. We have conceal and carry with many \nrequirements, and it is working.\n\n  Some States do not have any limit on the number of weapons you could \ncarry with one conceal and carry permit. So someone could come into my \nState, go into one of my schoolyards, and open up a duffle bag full of \nperfectly legal weapons.\n  We have approximately 3,300 gun deaths each year in my State. Let me \nrepeat that: 3,300 gun deaths each year in California. Each one of them \nhas a story of tragedy behind it. A lot of them are kids. So do not \ncome down here and tell my State what we should be doing. I support \nyour State. You should support my State. And that is exactly what \nGovernor Schwarzenegger says. He says we have a right to write our own \ngun laws.\n  Mr. President, 34 California mayors and 400 mayors nationwide oppose \nthe Thune amendment, as does the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice.\n  We have a lot of work to do. We have to work on health care. We have \nto work on energy independence. We have to work on getting down the \ndeficit. We have to work on bringing down the debt. We have to work on \neducating our kids. But, oh, no, we are spending hours on an amendment \nthat is offered that tells our States their laws are not to be \nrespected when it comes to conceal and carry.\n  Do you know there are some States that allow a spousal abuser to \ncarry a concealed carry weapon? Do you want that spousal abuser, maybe \nin a state of rage, to walk into another State with a duffle bag full \nof weapons? And my senior Senator--she read this, and she is a pretty \ngood expert on this issue--says you could have an assault weapon in \nthere. Is that what we want?\n  It is ironic, as we deal with health care issues--do you know what it \ncosts to try to sew up somebody and heal somebody who has been a victim \nof a gunshot wound? We are training our doctors who go over to Iraq and \nAfghanistan in our cities.\n  So all my colleagues on the other side who come here and talk about \nBig Brother--Big Brother--going into their States and telling their \nStates what to do, this is a case of Big Brother, clear and simple.\n  If I need to protect my people in California, I want to leave it to \nmy people in California. I do not want to come in and tell them they \nhave to live with other State laws that are weaker. It is just wrong. \nIt flies in the face of States rights. It flies in the face of common \nsense. And again, the supreme irony is, it is coming from folks who say \nthey love our States, they respect our States, the Federal Government \nhas too much power. But all of a sudden--\n\n[[Page S7824]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I hope we will vote against this amendment \nbecause this is not what we need in America--more gun deaths and more \npolice being put in the line of fire.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, when the Supreme Court handed down its \ndecision in District of Columbia v. Heller I applauded the Court for \naffirming what so many Americans already believe: The second amendment \nprotects an individual right to own a firearm. The Heller decision \nreaffirmed and strengthened our Bill of Rights.\n  Vermont has some of the least restrictive gun laws in the country. \nOne does not need a permit to carry a concealed firearm, and citizens \nof Vermont are by and large trusted to conduct themselves responsibly \nand safely. In my experience, Vermonters do just that. Like many \nVermonters, I grew up with firearms and have enormous respect and \nappreciation for the freedoms the second amendment protects. Like other \nprotections in our Bill of Rights, the second amendment right to keep \nand bear arms is one that I cherish.\n  As a prosecutor, I protected the rights of Vermonters to possess \nfirearms. As a Senator, I have carefully considered Federal efforts to \nregulate firearms, and always with an eye toward the burdens it may \nimpose on the second amendment rights of law-abiding American citizens.\n  Justice Scalia's decision for the Supreme Court in Heller \nacknowledged that some reasonable regulation can and does coexist with \nthe second amendment, just as it does for other rights in our Bill of \nRights. The States have traditionally played the strongest role in \nregulating firearms based on State and local concerns. Most firearms \nregulation is decided within States as an issue of State police power. \nThis is how it should be.\n  I feel strongly that the principles of federalism demand that the \nFederal Government minimize its intrusion into the policy judgments \nmade by State and local officials, citizens and State legislators, \nespecially in matters of public safety. I believe this is true whether \nthe Federal Government seeks to restrict the activities of Americans or \nit seeks to second-guess what State officials have decided is proper \nregulation. Whenever the Federal Government imposes its will some \ncitizens may be happy, but others will be disappointed. This is \nparticularly true when such Federal action involves matters of safety \nand police power at the State level. The Federal Government plays a \nrole in regulating the importation of firearms and has in providing a \nframework for interstate commerce.\n  Senator Thune's amendment imposes the policy judgments of the Federal \nGovernment on the States. Just as I would vigorously oppose any Federal \neffort to restrict the ability of a State to allow its citizens to \ncarry firearms in a concealed manner, I oppose this effort to second-\nguess the judgments of State and local officials across the country in \nrelation to permitting people to carry a concealed firearm. Just as I \nwould resist Federal legislation that prohibited States from entering \nreciprocity agreements with each other to honor one another's concealed \ncarry permits, I do not believe the Federal Government ought to be \nforcing States to treat citizens from other States differently than it \ntreats its own on this public safety matter. The Thune amendment \nrepresents the Federal Government intruding into the gun laws of the \nStates. It could even result in some States repealing their concealed \ncarry laws to avoid the impact of the Federal law.\n  What works in Vermont does not necessarily work in New York City. And \nwhat works in New York City would not get a warm welcome in Vermont. \nThat is the beauty of our Federal system. When it comes to public \nsafety and police power, the Federal Government ought to respect the \njudgments of the States, their citizens, elected officials, and law \nenforcement agencies.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 2 years ago I opposed a bill \nconsidered by the Senate Judiciary Committee to strip State and local \npolice departments of their ability to enforce rules and policies on \nwhen and how their own officers can carry weapons. Today, I continue to \noppose attempts to supersede or limit State gun control laws, and for \nthis reason I oppose Senator Thune's amendment that would infringe on \nthe ability of State and local governments to regulate concealed guns \nin their jurisdictions. I have said it before, and I say it again--each \nState should be able to make its own judgment about whether citizens \ncan carry concealed weapons within their jurisdictions. There is no \nreason for Congress to override gun safety measures in any State.\n  Yet the Thune amendment would override the laws of 48 States by \nrequiring them to recognize concealed carry permits from other States, \neven if the permit holder would not be allowed to possess or carry a \ngun under the laws of those States. Currently, only two States--\nIllinois and Wisconsin--have a total prohibition against concealed \ncarry weapons. This amendment would require the remaining 48 States to \nrecognize a permit granted by another State that has issued a concealed \nweapon permit. Such a system leads to ludicrous results. For example, \nunder the Thune amendment, a person who can't obtain a concealed carry \npermit in his home State could apparently circumvent his State law by \nfinding another State in which that person would be eligible for a \nnonresident permit and then, using the reciprocity granted by the \namendment, carry the concealed weapon back home.\n  State and local governments do not have a one-size-fits-all approach \non gun control. Yet the Thune amendment treats them as if they were all \nthe same. Under this amendment, a State would be prevented from \nlimiting who can carry a concealed gun in its jurisdiction. In doing \nso, the amendment threatens the safety of our citizens, our \ncommunities, and our States.\n  States need the right to control who can carry a concealed weapon in \ntheir jurisdiction. What State officials, law enforcement, and \nlegislators decide are the best policies for rural States may not be \nthe best policies for urban States--and vice versa. This bill creates a \nrace to the bottom, in which gun owners can get a permit in a State \nwith the least restrictive licensing regulations and use that gun in \nevery other State--except Illinois and Wisconsin, where there is a \ntotal prohibition. The amendment even entitles residents in Alaska and \nVermont, the two States that allow residents to carry concealed guns \nwithout permits, to carry their guns in other States.\n  In 35 States, such as Massachusetts, a permit holder must have \nattended a safety course. Other States don't require a safety course, \nand residents in Alaska or Vermont are not required to have a permit at \nall. Yet, with the adoption of the Thune amendment, gun owners would be \nable to carry a concealed weapon without a safety course in all these \nStates. This is absurd. In addition, other State licensing laws, which \nprohibit permits for individuals with criminal backgrounds or substance \nabuse problems, would be waived under the Thune amendment if the \nindividual is issued a permit in a jurisdiction with more permissive \nregulations.\n  According to the most recent statistics, in 2006, an average of nine \nyoung people aged 19 and under were killed by a gun each day in the \nUnited States. In 2007, an average of 48 children a day were nonfatally \nwounded. The scourge of gun violence frequently attacks the most \nhelpless members of our society--our children. Does the Thune \namendment--authorizing more widespread use of concealed guns--improve \nthese statistics? Does creating a system that reduces the regulations \nfor permits for many concealed gun carriers improve these statistics? I \nthink not.\n  In fact, it was found that concealed handgun license holders in Texas \nwere arrested for weapon-related offenses at a rate 81 percent higher \nthan that of the general population of Texas, aged 21 and older. \nExpanding the ability of a concealed gun holder to carry his weapon in \na far larger number of jurisdictions will not lower gun deaths or \ncrime.\n  Our brave police forces face risks every day in the line of duty. \nPolicing the streets, and even routine traffic stops, are perilous \nenough without increasing the number of guns that officers encounter. \nUnder the Thune\n\n[[Page S7825]]\n\namendment there is no easy way for a police officer to determine the \nlegality of a gun being concealed by an individual with a permit from \noutside the State. This confusion, and the increase in the number of \nguns on the street, could result in violent incidents, some of which \ncould lead to more deaths from gun violence. The Senate should be \nworking to make the job of police officers safer. The Thune amendment \ndoes the opposite.\n  The amendment takes away the right of a State to determine who can \ncarry a concealed gun within that State. As a result, the amendment \nwill increase the number of concealed guns that will be allowed on any \ngiven street. More than 400 mayors, numerous State legislators, the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, and the Major Cities \nChiefs Association oppose this amendment because of the danger it \nbrings to our streets, our citizens, and our law enforcement. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to vote against Senator Thune's amendment. \nIt is unwise policy that could lead to tragic results.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, how much time is left on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Nine minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, the Senator from California has made some \ncomments, and actually both Senators from California talked about the \nissue of assault weapons. Of course, assault weapons--as my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma pointed out, it is very difficult to conceal an assault \nweapon. It is not something you are going to be running around--it is \nnot a concealed weapon. Obviously, when you get into the State of \nCalifornia, those weapons are illegal.\n  I think it is fair to point out again that any State can impose \nrestrictions on the people who come into their State with a concealed \ncarry permit from another State. So State laws still trump when it \ncomes to the place where guns can be carried.\n  To this issue of multiple guns being brought into a State, States can \nalso say the permit only applies to one gun. Obviously, that is an \nissue on which a State can rule. Secondly, the issue of multiple guns I \nwould think would fall under the rubric of trafficking, which is a \nFederal offense. It is illegal. For people who have committed crimes, \nthat is illegal under Federal laws. They cannot get guns in the first \nplace--or at least they are not supposed to get guns. It is a Federal \ncrime if they do. People who have a history of mental illness--all \nthese issues are addressed in Federal law, which provides a floor \nagainst all these types of things that are being suggested.\n  Much of what has been suggested here really is scare tactics, it is \nfear mongering. There is no basis on which to make many of the \narguments. It is totally speculative that somehow this amendment is \ngoing to lead to all kinds of people, thugs and gangsters, getting guns \nand then transporting them someplace else in the country.\n  I will tell you, I do not think there are too many criminals--by the \nway, criminals commit the crimes. The Senator from New Jersey talked \nabout the thousands who are killed by guns every year. Most of them are \nkilled by criminals. There may have been an exception or two where \nsomebody had a concealed carry permit, but relative to the general \npopulation, it is minuscule.\n  If you think about the number of crimes that are committed every year \nby criminals, what we ought to be doing is focusing on criminals, the \npeople who commit crimes. Criminals are not going to go down to the \ncourthouse in Sioux Falls, SD, and say: I want to get a concealed carry \npermit, or anywhere in this country, for that matter, because almost \nevery State, with three exceptions, by law does a background check. So \nin order to own a gun or possess a gun, you have to go through a \nbackground check. So to get a concealed carry permit, you also have to \ngo through a background check. I do not think most criminals are going \nto be going down and saying: I want to get a background check so I can \nget a gun so I can haul it and commit a crime in some other State. That \nis ludicrous. Think about the logic of that. For anybody who has a \ncriminal record, obviously, the background check is going to reveal \nthat. They are not going to be able to either acquire a gun or get a \nconcealed carry permit, which means they are going to do what they \nusually do; that is, get those firearms illegally and commit crimes and \nfelonies because that is what criminals do.\n  I want to mention some of those who have endorsed this amendment. The \nNRA has endorsed this amendment. Gun Owners of America--I have a letter \nfrom them endorsing this amendment. Citizens Committee for the Right to \nKeep and Bear Arms has endorsed this amendment. The Owner-Operator \nIndependent Drivers Association, which, as I pointed out, represents a \nlot of the truckdrivers across the country, endorses this. This is a \nreal issue for them because they are traveling across State lines in \ninterstate travel on a regular basis. This is something they have \nadvocated for a long time. The Passenger-Cargo Security Group, which, \nof course, represents a lot of those who fly cargo in this country, has \nendorsed it. GOProud has endorsed this amendment. And the Pink Pistols \ngroup has endorsed this amendment. So there are a number of groups, \norganizations out there that have endorsed this amendment that believe, \nas I do, it represents a commonsense approach that balances the \nconstitutional right people in this country have to keep and bear \narms--the second amendment right. It is in the Bill of Rights. All the \nother amendments in the Bill of Rights apply across State lines, and it \nseems to me, at least, this one should too, subject to restrictions \nthat are imposed by the individual States. This does not preempt any of \nthose.\n  States have different restrictions that apply and restrict the place \nand the manner in which firearms may be transported into their States. \nSo what we are simply trying to do is clarify this patchwork of \ndifferent regulations and laws and requirements that different States \nhave all over the country, so people, law-abiding citizens--not the \ncriminals who are being referred to who commit the crimes in this \ncountry--so law-abiding individuals who want to defend themselves \nagainst those very criminals have the opportunity to do so by being \nable to possess a firearm if they have a concealed carry permit.\n  As I said, every State is a little different as to how you go about \ngetting one of those permits, but every State has its own requirements, \nand all of the States, with a couple exceptions, have background checks \nas a part of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Two minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning around Washington, hundreds \nof lobbyists strapped on their suits and their ties and went to work \nwaiting for the Thune amendment and his theory and their theory on \nkeeping America safer by putting more guns on the street. Across \nAmerica today, thousands of law enforcement officials strapped on their \nguns and their badges and went out on those mean streets to risk their \nlives to keep us safe.\n  Did you listen to the groups that have endorsed the Thune amendment? \nDo you know what is missing? Not a single law enforcement group \nsupports John Thune's amendment. The men and women who are risking \ntheir lives for our safety every day do not support his amendment. They \noppose it. Do you know why they oppose it? Because they realize there \nare different standards in different States for concealed carry and in \nsome States almost no standards at all. They realize that in 17 States \nyou do not need to even prove you know how to fire a gun safely. And \nunder John Thune's amendment, those people can go into States that \nrequire a test or even a test on a firing range--the 31 States that \nrequire it--and they can carry a gun without any evidence that they \nknow how to use it.\n  There are also some 35 States that prohibit people convicted of \ncertain misdemeanor crimes from carrying concealed firearms. That means \nthat 13 other States can send their people in\n\n[[Page S7826]]\n\nwith convictions for these misdemeanors and they can carry a firearm \nlegally under John Thune's amendment.\n  Let me say, finally, they realize, too, that if you happen to be a \ndrunk driver in a State--17 States--you can still get a concealed carry \npermit. It does not matter how many times you have been convicted for \nDUIs, whether you are a habitual drunkard, an alcoholic, you can still \nget a concealed carry permit in 17 States. Senator Thune wants those \npeople to be able to drive into your State, where you say, frankly, you \ncannot have a concealed carry permit if you cannot handle alcohol--he \nwants them to be able to come into those States and to have the right \nto carry a firearm.\n  Will that make us safer? The men and women in uniform, who went out \nthis morning and are out there right now protecting us, say no. And \nthat is what we ought to say to the Thune amendment: No.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, let me point out what I pointed out \nearlier. This amendment does not apply to the District of Columbia. But \nI also want to come back to a basic point; that is, how did we get here \ntoday? Why are we here? Well, we are here, supposedly, to be talking \nabout the Defense authorization bill. But last week the Democratic \nleadership decided to put a hate crimes amendment on the floor as the \nfirst amendment to the Defense authorization bill--unrelated, \nnongermane to the underlying Defense authorization bill.\n  The hate crimes bill, it could be argued, preempts a lot of State \nlaws because a lot of States have their own laws with regard to hate \ncrimes. But we decided here--the Democratic leadership did--that it was \nmore important to talk about hate crimes legislation than it was to \ntalk about defense-related amendments.\n  Well, my view was, they are going to offer a hate crimes amendment on \nthe floor of the Senate. What better way to prevent hate crimes than to \nallow the potential victims of hate crimes to defend themselves against \nthose very hate crimes? So I was going to offer this amendment, this \nconcealed carry amendment, as a second-degree amendment to the hate \ncrimes amendment that was put on the floor last week by the Democrats. \nThe leader filled the tree, preventing us from doing that. So we worked \nit out to have this debate and to talk about this amendment today. But \nit ties in very closely to the hate crimes amendment, the legislation \nwe have had on the floor of the Senate for the last week when we should \nhave been talking about Defense authorization issues.\n  But that being said, I will come back to my basic fundamental point. \nThis is a commonsense amendment that strikes a balance between the \nconstitutional right the people in this country enjoy under the second \namendment to keep and bear arms--and which has been supported by the \nSupreme Court, I might add--and the rights of States under federalism \nto restrict that according to their own wishes and laws. And every \nState does that differently. This amendment does not preempt those.\n  The States of Wisconsin and Illinois prevent concealed carry permit \nholders, and so there is not anybody in this country who is going to be \nable to travel through Illinois or Wisconsin and carry a gun because \nthey just do not allow it. So it respects the rights of the individual \nStates. But it does allow law-abiding citizens in this country to \nexercise their constitutional right under the second amendment, and \nthat right should not end at State lines. State borders should not be a \nbarrier to an individual's right to defend themselves.\n  I believe the studies are very clear. As I have said earlier--they \nare all speculating about all the crimes that are going to be \ncommitted--people, concealed carry permit holders, if you look at the \ndata, are 15 times less likely than the rest of the public to commit \nmurder. Criminals commit crimes, not law-abiding citizens, not people \nwho go down to their courthouse to get a concealed carry permit so they \ncan defend themselves against the very criminals who routinely break \nthe laws and possess firearms illegally so they can commit crimes.\n  This is a reasonable, commonsense balance which I believe strikes the \nright balance between the constitutional second amendment right \ncitizens in this country enjoy and the States' ability to restrict that \nright. And any concealed carry permit holder who has a concealed carry \npermit in their State of residence who travels to another State has to \nabide by and is subject to the laws that are enacted by that individual \nState.\n  So, Mr. President, I hope my colleagues will vote for what is a \ncommonsense amendment that allows people across this country who are \nlaw-abiding citizens to defend themselves from the very criminals who \nbreak those laws and try to commit these crimes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, under current law each State adopts and \nenforces their own eligibility standards for who is qualified to obtain \na concealed carry permit. Carrying a concealed weapon is a crime if \nthose eligibility standards are violated and a citizen of that State \ncarries a concealed weapon. For example, 35 States prohibit those with \ncriminal misdemeanor convictions from obtaining a concealed carry \npermit.\n  The Thune amendment would federally authorize an individual who has \nbeen issued a concealed carry permit in one State the right to carry a \nconcealed weapon in 47 other States, even though those other States \nprohibit an individual who resides in those other 47 States from \ncarrying a concealed weapon. A Federal standard is thereby imposed on \nthe States.\n  The 35 States that prohibit criminal misdemeanants from carrying \nconcealed weapons are told under the Thune amendment: You can enforce \nyour own laws regarding your own residents but cannot enforce your own \nlaws against residents of the 13 States who issue concealed carry \npermits to convicted criminal misdemeanants when those nonresidents \nvisit your State. The laws of those 35 States cannot be applied to all \npersons in their States--those from 13 other States who get permits \nunder weaker laws are immunized.\n  A double standard would be adopted and would be imposed on the \nStates.\n  A terrible precedent of a national standard would also be adopted and \nimposed on the States, superseding a State's ability should they choose \nto regulate concealed possesion of a firearm in their States by \nvisiting criminal misdemeanants who do not meet their standards for \nconcealed firearms possession.\n  So while the Thune amendment says it doesn't preempt any provision of \nState law with respect to the issuance of licenses or permits to carry \nconcealed firearms, that is true only as to residents--it does preempt \nthe right of the States to apply its laws as to who can carry a \nconcealed weapon to all persons in the State, residents and \nnonresidents alike.\n  Senator Thune's statement that everyone must comply with restrictions \nof States they are in is not accurate then as to the key restriction \nrelating to who can carry concealed weapons.\n  The amendment will also create serious problems for law enforcement. \nLaw enforcement officials use concealed carry permits as an important \ntool in combating illegal trafficking. In most States, carrying a \nfirearm without a permit is a crime. The Thune amendment would hamper \nlaw enforcement's ability to identify and arrest illegal traffickers \nbefore they are able to sell their weapons on the black market, for \ninstance: This is one reason why the amendment is opposed by the \nInternational Association of Chiefs of Police, the Major Cities Chiefs \nAssociations, Mayors Against Illegal Guns and State Legislatures \nAgainst Illegal Guns.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act is enacted every year to help \nmake this a safer nation. This amendment will not do that. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote against it.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl be \nrecognized as in morning business for 10 minutes, and that Senator \nTester then be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, every American should be proud that a \nHispanic woman--one with a very impressive background--has been \nnominated for the Supreme Court.\n  In evaluating a nominee, it is important that the Senate examine all \naspects of the individual's career and his or her merit as a judge and \nnot make judgments on the basis of gender or ethnicity.\n  It starts with the judge's decisions and opinions. Also important to \nunderstanding what an individual really thinks about things are his or \nher speeches, writings, and associations.\n  Judge Sotomayor's most widely known speech is, of course, her ``wise \nLatina woman'' speech, which was given in various fora over the years. \nIt is clear that the often-quoted phrase is not just a comment out of \ncontext but is the essence of those speeches.\n  Judge Sotomayor's central theme was to examine whether gender and \nethnicity bias a judge's decision. Judge Sotomayor concludes they do, \nthat it is unavoidable. She develops this theme throughout the speech, \nincluding examining opposing arguments and examining evidence that \nsuggests that gender makes a difference. She then quotes former Justice \nSandra Day O'Connor's statement that men and women judges will reach \nthe same decision and, in effect, disagrees, saying she is not so sure. \nThat is when she says she thinks a ``wise Latina'' would reach a better \ndecision.\n  Her attempt to recharacterize these speeches at the committee hearing \nstrained credulity. I will address this issue at greater length during \nthe confirmation debate, but suffice to it say that I remain \nunconvinced that she believes judges should set aside these biases, \nincluding those based on race and gender, and render the law \nimpartially and neutrally.\n  Judge Sotomayor's address to the Puerto Rican ACLU, entitled ``How \nFederal Judges Look to International and Foreign Law under Article VI \nof the U.S. Constitution,'' also raises red flags.\n  In this speech, she inferred that foreign law should be used but \nlater testified it should not. I will also discuss at length my \nconcerns related to this matter during the confirmation debate and the \nproblems I have squaring her testimony with the contents of this \nspeech. The central point, of course, is that it is completely \nirrelevant to consider foreign law in U.S. courts. I don't believe \nJudge Sotomayor is sufficiently committed to this principle.\n  Judge Sotomayor's supporters argue that we should not focus on her \nspeeches but on her ``mainstream'' judicial record. They claim she \nagreed with her colleagues, including Republican appointees, the vast \nmajority of the time. That may be true, but as President Obama has \nreminded us, most judges will agree in 95 percent of the cases.\n  The hard cases are where differences in judicial philosophy become \napparent.\n  I have looked at Judge Sotomayor's record in these hard cases and \nhave found cause for concern. The U.S. Supreme Court has reviewed \ndirectly 10 of her decisions--8 of those decisions have been reversed \nor vacated, another sharply criticized, and 1 upheld in a 5 to 4 \ndecision.\n  The most recent reversal was Ricci v. DeStefano, a case in which \nJudge Sotomayor summarily dismissed before trial the discrimination \nclaims of 20 New Haven firefighters, and the Supreme Court reversed 5 \nto 4, with all nine Justices rejecting key reasoning of Judge \nSotomayor's court.\n  In my view, the most astounding thing about the case was not the \nincorrect outcome reached by Judge Sotomayor's court--it was that she \nrejected the firefighters' claims in a mere one-paragraph opinion and \nthat she continued to maintain in the hearings that she was bound by \nprecedent that the Supreme Court said did not exist.\n  As the Supreme Court noted, Ricci presented a novel issue regarding \n``two provisions of Title VII to be interpreted and reconciled, with \nfew, if any, precedents in the court of appeals discussing the issue.'' \nOne would think that this would be precisely the kind of case that \ndeserved a thorough and thoughtful analysis by an appellate court.\n  But Judge Sotomayor's court instead disposed of the case in an \nunsigned and unpublished opinion that contained zero--and I do mean \nzero--analysis.\n  Some have speculated that Judge Sotomayor's panel intentionally \ndisposed of the case in a short, unsigned, and unpublished opinion in \nan effort to hide it from further scrutiny. Was the case intentionally \nkept off of her colleagues' radar? Did she have personal views on \nracial quotas that prevented her from seeing the merit in the \nfirefighters' claims?\n  Judge Sotomayor was asked about her Ricci decision at length during \nthe confirmation hearing. Her defense, that she was just following \n``established Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent,'' as I said, \nis belied by the Supreme Court's opinion noting ``few, if any'' circuit \ncourt opinions addressing the issue.\n  When I pressed Judge Sotomayor to identify those controlling Supreme \nCourt and Second Circuit precedents that allegedly dictated the outcome \nin Ricci, she dissembled and ran out the clock. Her ``answers'' \nanswered nothing and, in my opinion, violated her obligation to be \nforthcoming with the Judiciary Committee.\n  I am also concerned about Judge Sotomayor's analysis--or lack \nthereof--in Maloney v. Cuomo, a second amendment case that could find \nits way to the Supreme Court next year. Maloney was decided after the \nSupreme Court's landmark ruling in District of Columbia v. Heller, \nwhich held that the right to bear arms was an individual right that \ncould not be taken away by the Federal Government.\n  In Maloney, Judge Sotomayor had the opportunity to consider whether \nthat individual right could also be enforced against the States, a \nquestion that was not before the Heller Court. In yet another unsigned \nopinion, Judge Sotomayor and two other judges held that it was not a \nright enforceable against States.\n  What are the legal implications of this holding? State regulations \nlimiting or prohibiting the ownership and\n\n[[Page S7828]]\n\nuse of firearms would be subject only to ``rational basis'' review. As \nSandy Froman, a respected lawyer and former National Rifle Association \npresident, said in her witness testimony, this is a ``very, very low \nthreshold'' that can easily be met by a State or city that wishes to \nprohibit all gun ownership, even in the home. Thus, if Judge \nSotomayor's decision were allowed to stand as precedent, then States \nwill, ironically, be able to do what the Federal District of Columbia \ncannot--place a de facto prohibition on the ownership of guns and other \narms.\n  As we have seen, Judge Sotomayor's testimony about her previous \nspeeches and some of her decisions is difficult, if not impossible, to \nreconcile with her record. Similarly, her testimony about the extent of \nher role with PRLDEF is in tension with the evidence that we have. The \nNew York Times has detailed her active involvement as recounted by \nformer PRLDEF colleagues, who have described Judge Sotomayor as a ``top \npolicy maker'' who ``played an active role as the defense fund staked \nout aggressive stances.''\n  What were the litigation positions advanced by PRLDEF during Judge \nSotomayor's tenure there? Well, it argued in court briefs that \nrestrictions on abortion are analogous to slavery. And it repeatedly \nrepresented plaintiffs challenging the validity of employment and \npromotional tests--tests similar to the one at issue in Ricci.\n  Unfortunately, I have not been persuaded that Judge Sotomayor is \nabsolutely committed to setting aside her biases and impartially \ndeciding cases based upon the rule of law. And I cannot ignore her \nunwillingness to answer Senators' questions straightforwardly. For \nthese reasons, I oppose her nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Forest Jobs and Recreation Act of 2009\n\n  Mr. TESTER. Madam President, I rise today to call on the Senate to \ntake action on a bill I introduced last week--the Forest Jobs and \nRecreation Act.\n  The Forest Jobs bill is a product of years of effort from Montanans \nwho worked together to find common ground on how to best manage and \nprotect our forests. These folks--mill owners, conservationists, \nhunters and anglers, motorized users--have fought each other for \ndecades. As little as 10 years ago, their differences were so great, \nthey were so much apart that they could not even be in the same room \ntogether.\n  In the meantime, forest management came to a virtual halt, a beetle \nepidemic swept through our forests, and not a single acre of wilderness \nwas designated in the State. Amid all the shouting, no one got what \nthey wanted, and all Montanans, and especially our forests, suffered \nfor it.\n  With help from my fellow Montanans, we are working to fix that. That \nis why I am enormously proud to carry forward their work in the Forest \nJobs and Recreation Act.\n  Besides putting aside old battles, this bill will help protect our \ncommunities from a crisis on Montana's forest lands. And make no \nmistake about it, Montana's forest communities face a crisis. Our \nforest crisis demands action, and it demands action now.\n  For example, in the Beaverhead Deerlodge National Forest in \nsouthwestern Montana, a shocking 660,000 acres of lodgepole pine are \ndead--killed by the mountain pine beetle. To put that in perspective, \nthat is just shy of 1,000 square miles. That is a big figure, even for \nBig Sky country. And it is a number that is only on the rise.\n  What follows dead trees? Fire. As I speak, 200 firefighters are \nbattling a wildfire just a few miles southwest of Deerlodge, MT, in \nthose beetle-killed trees.\n  While no amount of work in a forest could put a stop to the beetle \nkill, if enacted into law, this bill will help protect our communities \nand our water supplies from the threats of future forest fires.\n  On the Beaverhead Deerlodge Forest, the bill mandates that an average \nof 7,000 acres a year be harvested. This work will happen in the \ncontext of larger stewardship projects aimed at restoring fishing and \nhunting habitat.\n  A council of local stakeholders will work with the Forest Service to \nhelp shape each of the projects, providing a voice to local folks in \nhow we manage our forests.\n  The bill also addresses two districts on two other forests in \nMontana--the Three Rivers on the Kootenai and the Seeley on the Lolo. \nSimilar work will occur in these places: big stewardship projects that \nare driven by local collaborations so our forests, and the communities \nwithin them, will be healthier in the end.\n  Let me be clear. This bill will not just help restore our forests and \ntheir watersheds, it will help restore our communities. It will put \npeople back to work in the woods, harvesting trees, rolling up roads, \nbuilding bigger culverts for fish, and tackling stream restoration \nprojects.\n  A lot of mills have closed in Montana. We are at risk of losing more. \nIf we lose that infrastructure, we will suffer an even bigger loss. We \nwill lose the folks who know how to work in the woods. Without their \nknow-how, without the mills to process the byproduct of their work, we \nwill not be able to tackle head on the years of work that lie ahead--\nwork to restore the woods around our towns, to make them more resilient \nto the fires that may one day come.\n  Of course, in Montana, we don't just work in the woods, we play in \nthem. That is why Montanans asked me to put aside recreation areas in \nthis bill, and I did. Lands will be set aside for both motorized and \nnonmotorized use.\n  Lastly, I am proud to set aside some of Montana's best hunting and \nfishing habitats for future generations with this bill. This bill will \nkeep some spectacular wild places with the cleanest water around you \ncan imagine for our kids and grandkids to hunt and fish and hike and \ncamp, places such as the Sapphires in this picture, the Snowcrests on \nRoderick Mountain, and lands next to our world famous Bob Marshall \nWilderness.\n  It is a new day when motorized users, timber mill owners, back-\ncountry horsemen, hunters, fishermen, and conservationists all agree \nthat it is time to set aside our differences for the sake of the \nforests and for the sake of our communities.\n  I have reached out to folks in western Montana to get feedback on \nthese issues. I have held listening sessions throughout timber country, \nopen to any and all Montanans who want to work together on a \ncommonsense plan for our future.\n  Last weekend, I held a series of open meetings to announce the \nintroduction of the bill and to hear more feedback. I have invited \nMontanans to visit my Web site--tester.senate.gov--to download their \nown copy of the legislation. Folks can also click on color-coded maps \nto see for themselves exactly what we are proposing. And they can sign \nup as citizen cosponsors of this important legislation. Already, \nhundreds of Montanans have signed on to make their voices heard and to \nhelp put their shoulder to the wheel to get this bill moving.\n  I can tell you, Montana is buzzing with excitement about this \nproposal. Folks see it as an opportunity to work together to support \nthis ``Made in Montana'' solution to the conflicts that have stalemated \nus for far too long.\n  Working together, we will create jobs. Working together, we will \ncreate new opportunities for recreation. Working together, we will \nprotect Montana's clean water. And working together, we will safeguard \nMontana's fishing and hunting habitat for our kids and grandkids.\n  Montanans are blessed to live among some of this Nation's finest \npublic lands. We are willing to do our part to help wisely manage and \nprotect these lands. Now it is time for Congress to step up to the \nplate and do its part.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, with respect to the nomination of Judge \nSonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court, I \nfind that I share many of the concerns expressed by the distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl.\n  First, I want to thank Senators Leahy and Sessions for their handling\n\n[[Page S7829]]\n\nof the hearings in the Judiciary Committee on the subject of the \nSupreme Court confirmation of Judge Sotomayor. Their meetings were both \ninformative and respectful, and I think they appropriately reflected \nthe traditions of the Senate. Both Judge Sotomayor and the judicial \nconfirmation process were treated with the respect they deserve.\n  The Senate's constitutional role to advise and consent on Federal \njudicial nominations is one that all Senators take seriously. And I, \nlike most Senators, have traditionally shown significant deference to \nthe President's role in submitting to the Senate nominees for the \nFederal judiciary. It is a role that the Senate shares with the \nPresident. If a nominee was qualified by education, experience, and \njudicial temperament, then that nominee would likely be confirmed by \nthe Senate, regardless of the political party of the President.\n  But in recent years, we have seen that standard dramatically altered. \nDuring the administration of President George W. Bush, for example, \nseveral well-qualified nominees from my State for positions in the \nFederal judiciary, including Charles Pickering, Michael Wallace, and \nLeslie Southwick, saw their nominations opposed because of political \ndifferences. For better or for worse, a new standard for evaluating \njudicial nominees has emerged.\n  As has been well documented during her confirmation process, Judge \nSotomayor was confirmed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit by the Senate on October 2, 1998. I voted in favor of her \nconfirmation. However, a nomination to one of the Federal Circuit \nCourts of Appeals is not the same as a nomination to the Court of last \nresort, the highest Court in our land, the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  During her recent hearing, Judge Sotomayor was asked several \nquestions regarding statements she had made in recent years. In \nwritings and speeches, Judge Sotomayor repeatedly stated that a judge's \npersonal experiences can and will impact judicial outcomes. She has \nalso argued that judges should allow their personal sympathies and \nprejudices to influence their decisionmaking. She described the ideal \nof judicial impartiality as an aspiration she believes cannot be met in \nmost cases. These statements raise serious concerns regarding the lack \nof commitment to the notion of equal justice under the law.\n  Judge Sotomayor's responses to questions about these comments have \nfailed to alleviate my concerns about whether she would apply the law \nin an evenhanded manner. It is the responsibility of the Senate to make \ncertain that those who are confirmed to the Supreme Court not only are \nfully qualified by reason of experience and training but also that they \nshow a commitment to equal justice under the law. Some of Judge \nSotomayor's statements during the last decade have given me reason to \nquestion her fidelity to equal justice.\n  Unlike the Federal circuit court, where she has served since 1998, a \nJustice on the Supreme Court is not necessarily bound by existing legal \nprecedent. If confirmed, there would be no higher court to deter Judge \nSotomayor from making decisions that would become the binding law of \nthe land. For these reasons, I intend to oppose her nomination.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized \nfor up to 30 minutes, although I doubt I will take that long.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I take to the floor to inform the Senate \nand my colleagues about how I intend to vote on the pending nomination \nof Supreme Court nominee Judge Sotomayor. I understand the path of \nleast resistance for me personally would be to vote no. That is \nprobably true anytime you are in the minority party and you lose an \nelection. But I feel compelled to vote yes, and I feel this is the \nright vote for me and, quite frankly, for the country in this case.\n  Why do I say that? Well, elections have consequences. I told Judge \nSotomayor in the hearing that if I had won the election, even though I \nwasn't running, or Senator McCain had, she would probably not have been \nchosen by a Republican. We would have chosen someone with a more \nconservative background--someone similar to a Judge Roberts or Miguel \nEstrada. She is definitely more liberal than a Republican would have \nchosen, but I do believe elections have consequences.\n  It is not as though we hid from the American people during the \ncampaign that the Supreme Court selections were at stake. Both sides \nopenly campaigned on the idea that the next President would be able to \npick some judges for the Supreme Court. That was known to the American \npeople and the American people spoke.\n  In that regard, having been one of the chief supporters of Senator \nMcCain and one of the chief opponents of then-Senator Obama, I feel he \ndeserves some deference on my part when it comes to his first selection \nto the Supreme Court. I say that understanding, under our Constitution, \nI or no other Senator would be bound by the pick of a President. But \nwhen you look at the history of this country, generally speaking, great \ndeference has been given to that selection by the Senate.\n  While I am not bound to vote for Judge Sotomayor--voting no would be \nthe path of least political resistance for me--I choose to vote for \nJudge Sotomayor because I believe she is well qualified. We are talking \nabout one of the most qualified nominees to be selected for the Supreme \nCourt in decades. She has 17 years of judicial experience. Twelve of \nthose years she was on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. I have \nlooked at her record closely. I believe she follows precedent; that she \nhas not been an activist judge in the sense that would make her \ndisqualified, in my view. She has demonstrated left-of-center reasoning \nbut within the mainstream. She has an outstanding background as a \nlawyer. She was a prosecutor for 4 years in New York. Her record of \nacademic achievement is extraordinary--coming up from very tough \ncircumstances, being raised by a single mother, going to Princeton, \nbeing picked as the top student there, and doing an extraordinary job \nin law school. She has a strong work ethic. That all mattered to me. It \nis not just my view that her legal reasoning was within the mainstream. \nShe received the highest rating by the ABA--the American Bar \nAssociation--as ``well qualified.''\n  The reason I mention that is not because I feel bound by their \nrating, but during the Alito and Roberts confirmation hearings for the \nSupreme Court under President Bush, I used that as a positive for both \nthose nominees. I feel, as a Republican, I can't use it one time and \nignore it the other. So the fact that she received the highest rating \nfrom the American Bar Association made a difference to me.\n  Her life story, as I indicated before, is something every American \nshould be proud of. If her selection to the Supreme Court will inspire \nyoung women, particularly Latino women, to seek a career in the law, \nthat is a good thing, and I hope it will.\n  On balance, I do believe the Court will not dramatically change in \nterms of ideology due to her selection. Justice Souter, whom I respect \nas an individual, has been far more liberal than I would prefer in a \njudge. I think Justice Sotomayor will not be any more liberal than he. \nOn some issues, quite frankly, she may be more balanced in her \napproach, particularly when it comes to the war on terror, the use of \ninternational law, and potentially the second amendment. But time will \ntell. I am not voting for her believing I know how she will decide a \ncase. I am voting for her because I find her to be well qualified, \nbecause elections matter, and because the people who have served along \nher side for many years find an extraordinary woman in Judge Sotomayor, \nand I confirm their findings.\n  What standard did I use? Every Senator in this body, at the end of \nthe day, has to decide how to give their advice and consent. One of the \nthings I chose not to do was to use Senator Obama's standard when it \ncame to casting my vote for Judge Sotomayor. If those who\n\n[[Page S7830]]\n\nfollow the Senate will recall, Senator Obama voted against both Judge \nAlito and Judge Roberts, and he used the rationale that they were well \nqualified; that they were extraordinarily intellectually gifted; but \nthe last mile in the confirmation process, when it came to Judge \nRoberts, was the heart. Because 5 percent of controversial cases may \nchange society, one has to look and see what is in a judge's heart.\n  I totally reject that. If the Senate tries to have a confirmation \nprocess where we explore another person's heart, I think we are going \nto chill out people wanting to become members of the judiciary. Who \nwould want to come before the Senate and have us try to figure out what \nis in their heart? Can you imagine the questions we would be allowed to \nask? I think it would have a tremendous chilling effect on the future \nrecruitment of qualified candidates to be judges. Let me say this: \nJudge Sotomayor agreed with me and Senator Kyl that trying to find out \nwhat is in a judge's heart is probably not a good idea.\n  Senator Obama also indicated that judicial philosophy and ideology \nwere outcome determinative when it came to Judge Alito. If I used his \nstandard, knowing that her philosophy is different than mine, her \nideology is different than mine, she would have no hope of getting my \nvote. I daresay not one Republican, using the Obama standard, would \nprovide her with a confirmation vote. So I decided to reject that \nbecause I believe it is not in the long-term interest of the Senate or \nthe judiciary.\n\n  I went back to a standard I think has stood the test of time--the \nqualifications standard. Is this person qualified to sit on the Court? \nAre they a person of good character? Do they present an extraordinary \ncircumstance--having something about their life that would make them \nextraordinary to the point they would be unqualified? There was a time \nin this country where a Justice, such as Justice Ginsburg, who is \nclearly left of center, received 90-something votes in this body. There \nwas a time in this country, not long ago, where a conservative judge, \nsuch as Justice Scalia, received over 95 votes from this body. Every \nDemocrat who voted for Justice Scalia could not have been fooled as to \nwhat they were getting. They were getting an extremely qualified, \ntalented, intellectual man who was qualified for the job but had a \ndifferent philosophy from most Democrats. Someone on our side of the \naisle who voted for Justice Ginsburg had to know what they were \ngetting. They were getting someone who was very talented, extremely \nwell qualified, incredibly smart, and who was general counsel for the \nACLU. You had to know what you were getting, but you understood that \nPresident Clinton, in that case, had the right to make that decision.\n  What happened to those days? I would say to my Democratic \ncolleagues--and I am sure Republicans have made our fair share of \nmistakes when it comes to judges--that this effort, not too far in the \npast, of filibustering judges, declaring war on the Judiciary, has hurt \nthis body. In my opinion, the politicization of our Judiciary has to \nstop for the good of this country, for the good of the Senate, and for \nthe good of the rule of law in America.\n  What am I trying to do today? I am trying to start over. The \npolitical ``golden rule'' is: Do unto others as they did unto you. The \nactual Golden Rule is: Do unto others as you would have them do unto \nyou. I hope we can get back to the more traditional sense of what the \nSenate has been all about. That brings me back to the recent past.\n  This body was on the verge of blowing up. Our Democratic colleagues \nwere filibustering President Bush's nominees for the appellate court, \nand even the Supreme Court, in a fashion never known by the body. There \nwas an effort by frustrated Republicans to change the rules so all you \nneeded was a majority vote to get on the bench--the Supreme Court. This \nbody, for a couple hundred years, had not gone down that road. A Gang \nof 14 was created--7 Republicans and 7 Democrats--and they tried to \nfind a better way; they tried to get the Senate back to a more reasoned \nposition. That Gang of 14--the 7 Democrats and 7 Republicans--said \nfilibustering judges should only be done in an extraordinary \ncircumstance. We left that up to the Members of the body, but we were \nfocusing on someone who was clearly out of the mainstream when it came \nto judging.\n  If you look at Judge Sotomayor's record for 17 years, it is left of \ncenter but not the record of someone who is wearing a robe but under \nthe robe is an activist. An extraordinary circumstance would be \nsomebody clearly not qualified--a pick that is political in nature \nalone.\n  I am glad to say my colleagues on the Democratic side and the \nRepublican side who were part of that group--and they are still here--\ndid not see an extraordinary circumstance. I would like to compliment \nSenator Sessions, who did a very fine job in this hearing. He has \nacknowledged there is nothing extraordinary about this nominee for the \nRepublican Party to try to block her through filibustering. I think \nthat is a correct assessment.\n  But then it comes down to the individual vote. I have tried to \nindicate the best I can that I desire, as a Senator, to find a new way \nto start over and get back to a Senate that is more rational in its \napproach when it comes to confirmations.\n  Having said that, to my colleagues who vote no, I understand your \nconcerns and there are things about this nominee that are troubling. \nThe speeches she has given in the past are troubling because I think \nthey embrace identity politics, something I don't embrace. The ``wise \nLatina'' comment that has become famous, that she believes more often \nthan not that a wise Latina woman with her experience and background \nwould reach a better conclusion than a White male--we had a long \ndiscussion about how that does not set well with most Americans and \nthat is not what we want to be expressed by people trying to become \nSupreme Court nominees.\n  But having said that, do we want to exclude from consideration people \nwith boldness, who are edgy? Do we want milk toast nominees who are \nafraid to speak their minds and to disagree with their fellow citizens? \nI think not.\n  Her speeches, while troubling, have to be looked at in terms of her \nrecord. When we look at this 17-year record we will find someone who \nhas not carried out that speech. I will take her at her word. She \nrejected this idea of picking winners and losers and was very \nmainstream in her understanding of the role of a judge. She understood \nthe difference between a policymaker and a judge. I will take her at \nher word. I cannot understand her heart any more than she can \nunderstand mine. The speeches are troubling, but I guarantee I have \nmade some speeches that are probably troubling to people on the other \nside. I hope they would look at everything I have done, not just the \nspeeches I may have given.\n  Her time as a lawyer--this is very important to me. During the Alito \nand Roberts hearings, they were pushed hard about some legal memos they \nwrote for Ronald Reagan espousing conservative thought and how that \nmade them dangerous. How dare you write a memo about the Civil Rights \nAct that somebody on the other side may disagree with? Lawyers who \nadvocate positions should not feel chilled in terms of picking their \nclients if they hope to be a judge. The worst thing we could do is take \na lawyer's advocacy position, their clientele, and hold it against them \nfor being a judge.\n  She was a board member of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund. Some \npeople say we should not talk about her time as a lawyer or even \nmention that organization. I do not believe that at all because when I \nam looking at this nominee, I am looking at every aspect of her life.\n  During her time as a board member, the board and the organization \nadvocated positions I think are out of the mainstream, that I do not \nagree with, but certainly are legitimate positions to take--such as \ntaxpayer-funded abortion. I could not disagree with her more. I don't \nthink most Americans want their taxpayer dollars to be used to fund \nabortion. The Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund argued to the court that \nif we do not allow taxpayer-funded abortion for poor women, it is a \nform of Dred Scott kind of oppression. I could not disagree more, but \nthat is not the point. Disagreeing with me is OK.\n  What I hope will happen in the future is, if a conservative gets into \nthe White\n\n[[Page S7831]]\n\nHouse, and we pick someone who was on the other side of that case, we \nwill have the same understanding I do: being an aggressive advocate for \ncauses I disagree with does not disqualify them from being a judge, if \notherwise they have demonstrated the capability.\n  The advocacy role of a lawyer is unique. I have represented people \nwith whom I disagreed. I have represented people accused of child \nmolesting. I have been a criminal defense lawyer. There is nothing more \nnoble in our system than making the government prove their case \nregardless of how one feels about the defendant.\n  The fact that she was an advocate, choosing causes I disagree with, \ndoes not, in my opinion, disqualify her because, when I looked at her \nrecord, I did not see a judge who was continuing to be a lawyer for the \nPuerto Rican Legal Defense Fund. I saw a judge who felt bound by the \nlaw.\n  Temperament--for those Members who have practiced in court, I do not \nlike a bully judge, and I know it when I see it. I don't mind being \npressed, I don't mind being challenged, I don't mind being interrupted. \nI just do not want to be belittled in front of my clients for no good \nreason.\n  There were some things said about Judge Sotomayor, anonymous comments \nfrom lawyers who were asked by the Federal Almanac how they rate the \ntemperament of people on the Second Circuit, and Judge Sotomayor had \nsome things said that were, frankly, disturbing. But I looked at the \nother part of the record, the people who served with her as a \nprosecutor, the defense attorneys who wrote on her behalf, people who \nserved with her on the court, and I found on balance that her \ntemperament does not disqualify her. Frankly, I found somebody a lot of \npeople from different backgrounds admire.\n  Ken Starr, one of the strongest conservatives in the country, found \nher to be a qualified person who would do a good job; Louis Freeh, the \nformer Director of the FBI, is someone who came and vouched for her \ncharacter and her qualities as a person.\n  When I look at the record, the anonymous comments by lawyers who were \nasked by Federal Legal Service did not win the day, nor should they \nhave.\n  I do not know what is ahead for this country when it comes to picking \nSupreme Court Justices. I don't know what openings may occur and when \nthey will occur. I know this. Elections have to matter. I don't want to \ninvalidate elections by disagreeing with someone against whom I ran or \nI opposed politically because when the election is over, everything has \nto change to some extent. I am not bound to agree with every pick of \nPresident Obama, but when it comes to trying to show some deference, I \nwill. I will try to do better for him than he was able to do for \nPresident Bush.\n  I don't want to turn over the confirmation of judges to special \ninterest groups on the left or the right, and that is where we are \nheaded if we don't watch it. Special interest groups are important, \nthey have their say, they have every right to have their say, but we \ncan't make every Supreme Court vacancy a battle over our culture.\n  I am trying to start over. I have only been here one term plus a few \nmonths. But since I have been here, I have been worried about where \nthis country is going when it comes to judges. I happen to be here at a \ntime when we are about to change the rules of the Senate in a way it \nhad never been done in 200 years. I was new to the body, but I was \nunderstanding of the law and how our system works well enough to know \nthat I did not want to be part of that. I had not been here long, but I \nunderstood what would happen to this country if we changed the rules of \nthe Senate, even though people felt frustrated and justified to do so.\n  As a member of the minority, I promised President Obama that I would \nlook hard at his nominees. I will try to help him where I can, but I \nwill not abandon the right to say no and to stop, in an extraordinary \ncircumstance, a nominee who I think would be bad for the country and \nwould dramatically change the power of a branch of the government, the \nSupreme Court, that is very important to every American.\n  As to my colleagues who find a different decision on the Republican \nside, I can understand and appreciate why they did not feel comfortable \ngiving their confirmation votes to Judge Sotomayor. But I am trying to \nlook beyond this moment, look to the future and come up with a reason \nto support her that will create a different way of doing business, that \nwill help the judiciary, the Senate, and the country as a whole.\n  Senator Sessions did an outstanding job. Senator Leahy did a very \ngood job. People wanted to know more about her at the hearings, but she \nis limited, like every nominee, in terms of what she can say.\n  One last comment about Judge Sotomayor. She is 1 year older than I \nam. I grew up in the Deep South. I am the first person in my family to \ngo to college. I lost my parents when I was in college and had a 13-\nyear-old sister to raise.\n  She grew up in the Bronx, came to this country from Puerto Rico. Her \nmother joined the Army. She lost her dad when she was very young. Her \nmother raised Judge Sotomayor and her brother under difficult \ncircumstances. Her brother is a doctor. She has been able, Judge \nSotomayor, to excel academically and reach the highest rung of \nAmerica's legal system. That, to me, is a hell of a story. Nobody in my \nfamily ever expected me to be a United States Senator--including \nmyself. Only in America can these things happen.\n  I choose to vote for Judge Sotomayor looking at her from the most \noptimistic perspective, understanding I could be wrong but proud of the \nfact that my country is moving in the right direction when anybody and \neverybody can hit it out of the park. I would not have chosen her if I \nhad to make this choice as President, but I understand why President \nObama did choose her and I am happy to vote for her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Order for Recess\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 1:45 \ntoday, the Senate stand in recess for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I rise to talk about a bipartisan \namendment on military voting, a bill I have cosponsored, because \ncounting every vote in our elections is the foundation of our \ndemocracy. I thank Senators Schumer, Bennett, Chambliss, and Cornyn for \ntheir work on this matter.\n  This is a long overdue measure to address the problems that our \nuniformed service men and women face in exercising their constitutional \nright to take part in elections, a right for which they so bravely \nfight to protect. Military personnel have encountered many problems in \nrecent elections. They have trouble receiving timely information about \nelections in their home States. They have trouble registering and \nobtaining absentee ballots. They have trouble preparing ballots. Most \nof all, they have trouble returning the ballot to local election \nofficials in time for their vote to be counted.\n  It has been a national embarrassment to read news stories of military \nballots that have been delayed. Despite the best efforts of those \nvoters, those votes were not counted. Those military voters were \ndisenfranchised from the same democracy they are charged with \nprotecting because of administrative redtape.\n  According to a Pew Charitable Trust study, one-third of States do not \nprovide military voters stationed abroad enough time to vote. \nAdditionally, it found that 25 States and the District of Columbia need \nto improve military absentee voting to ensure our men and women \nstationed around the globe can participate in the democratic process. \nWhile it concluded that my home State of Nevada gave its voters enough \ntime to vote, there are still steps that could be taken to make the \nprocess simpler. Providing half of the country with insufficient time \nis entirely unacceptable.\n  This study went on to say that by almost every measure, military and \noverseas voting participation is much lower than the general \npopulation. In 2006,\n\n[[Page S7832]]\n\nvoter turnout was approximately 20 percent for military voters as \nopposed to approximately 40 percent for the general population. These \nstatistics illustrate that those who are fighting to protect our \ndemocracy are not being afforded the opportunity to participate in it.\n  Both the Department of Defense and State and local election officials \nhave not done enough to address these problems. The Military and \nOverseas Voter Empowerment Act of 2009 would address some of these \nproblems to help military personnel have their votes count. The bill \nestablishes new requirements for the States and for the Department of \nDefense to make it easier for military and overseas voters to \nparticipate in elections. The key requirement is for States to allow \nsufficient time for these voters who are overseas to receive their \nballots, vote, and return them in time to be counted.\n  Other provisions in the bill include having States provide online and \nfax systems to deliver registration and absentee ballots; making the \nDepartment of Defense provide improved ballot delivery and mail service \nfor troops; and having the Department of Defense provide improved \nFederal voting assistance such as designating and training voter \nassistance officers and providing registration and absentee ballot \ninformation at every installation. While these are challenges, they are \nnot insurmountable, especially when we consider the outcome--providing \nthe men and women in uniform with the opportunity to vote. We, as \nAmericans, owe them that opportunity.\n  My office has been in touch with the office of the Secretary Of State \nof Nevada to continue to work through these challenges. Implementing \nthese changes will not be simple. My colleagues and I have modified the \nbill to address some of these concerns and will continue to work with \nour States and localities going forward.\n  For example, the original version of the bill focused attention on \nthe steps that States must take, even though we know that many States, \nsuch as Nevada, have local election officials who carry out important \nelection activities. We never had any intention of reaching into States \nand rearranging that relationship. That is why the Rules Committee \nmodified the bill to clarify that election responsibilities identified \nin the bill can, of course, be delegated to the appropriate local \nelection officials. The negotiation process is ongoing because the \nobjective of ensuring that military votes are counted on election day \nis so critical.\n  I fully expect we will find new issues to work through, but we must \nkeep our eyes on the main goal--improving the system to protect the \nvoting rights of our military personnel. There are few rights we \nexercise greater than choosing our own elected officials. We cannot \ncall ourselves a democracy if we do not count the votes of our citizens \nin elections of government officials. The men and women who put their \nlives on the line for you and me to protect our country are certainly \nno exception. It is time that we take steps to protect their right to \nvote.\n  I encourage my colleagues to make sure that this particular amendment \nis included in the Defense authorization bill. This is critical ahead \nof the election so States have time to prepare and every person in the \nmilitary who wishes to exercise their right to vote is allowed to do so \nand their vote is counted in time for the 2010 elections.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/22/senate-section/article/S7832-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7832]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN.

Mr. President, as the Sergeant at Arms advised the Senate \nprior to the July 4 recess, following the service of the summons on \nJudge Kent by the Sergeant at Arms on June 24, 2009, Judge Kent \ntendered his resignation as a United States District Judge, effective \nJune 30, 2009. At the direction of the Senate, the Secretary delivered \nJudge Kent's original statement of resignation to the President. On \nJune 29, 2009, counsel to the President accepted Judge Kent's \nresignation on behalf of the President. The House of Representatives \nhas now moved that the Senate dismiss the Articles of Impeachment.\n  Mr. President, I have conferred with the distinguished Republican \nleader, Mr. McConnell, and with the distinguished Chairman and Vice \nChairman of the Impeachment Trial Committee on the Articles Against \nJudge Samuel B.

Judge Kent is no longer serving \non the Federal bench, and he has ceased drawing his judicial salary. It \nis agreed that no useful purpose would now be accomplished by \nproceeding further with the impeachment proceedings against Judge Kent.\n  Accordingly, I now move that the Senate order that the Articles of \nImpeachment against former Judge Samuel B.

They, \ntoo, deserve our utmost gratitude.\n  Mr. President, that is why we must increase funding for impact aid, a \nprogram which, in part, provides assistance to school districts that \nserve military families.\n  Throughout my career in public service, I have been a strong believer \nin education as a powerful force to shape lives--to give people the \ntools they need and the inspiration that will help them succeed.\n  But even when we see an improvement in scholastic performance at the \nnational level, certain groups of students continue to fall further and \nfurther behind.\n  Many children of Federal employees, including military personnel, \nfall into one of these groups.\n  Military installations--and other Federal facilities--occupy land \nthat might otherwise be zoned for commercial use.\n  Because of this, local school districts suffer from a reduced tax \nbase to fund their expenses.\n  This limits the amount that can be spent in the classroom and leaves \nstudents at a serious disadvantage compared with children in \nneighboring towns.\n  In North Chicago, IL--the home of the Great Lakes Naval Training \nCenter--only half of the 4,000 students meet or exceed State standards.\n  Even with some Federal assistance, North Chicago's School District \n187 is able to spend just under $7,000 per student, per year.\n  But nearby District 125 has the resources to spend nearly twice as \nmuch per pupil, and the school performs among the best in the State.\n  An increase in impact aid funding would help to level this playing \nfield, ensuring that the children of our soldiers, sailors, airmen and \nmarines are not at a disadvantage because of their parents' service.\n  Impact aid funds are delivered directly to the school districts in \nneed, so they do not incur administrative costs at the State level.\n  This makes it one of the most efficient--and effective--Federal \neducation programs.\n  Scott Air Force Base is located near Mascoutah, IL--a community whose \nschools receive impact aid funding.\n  The local school district is able to spend only $6,000 per year on \neach child, but 90 percent of the students meet or exceed State \nstandards.\n  If these are the results that some students can achieve with only \n$6,000 per year, imagine how well Mascoutah's schools might perform \nwith even a small increase in available funds.\n  It is impressive that school districts like North Chicago and \nMascoutah are able to operate as effectively as they do, especially \nwhen compared to the national per-pupil expenditure of $9,700 per \nstudent.\n  Mr. President, it is vital that we target Federal assistance to those \nwho need it most.\n  That is why I am proud to be a member of the Senate impact aid \ncoalition, a group of 35 Senators devoted to protecting this important \nprogram.\n  And that is why I believe that the $50 million we have set aside for \nschools\n\n[[Page S7834]]\n\nthat are heavily impacted by military students is a step in the right \ndirection in our commitment to military families.\n  It is time to make sure all children have access to a quality \neducation, regardless of who they are or where they are from.\n  I applaud Chairman Levin and Ranking Member McCain for their support \nof this funding in the past--and for including funding in the fiscal \nyear 2010 Defense authorization bill.\n  This funding will be significant to military children across the \ncountry.\n  To students in North Chicago, Mascoutah, O'Fallon, and Rockford--and \nhundreds of communities in Illinois and over 260,000 students in 103 \nschool districts across the United States.\n  We owe them the same support we continue to show to their parents in \nuniform.\n  And it is time to step up our efforts to meet that commitment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I will return to the issue of health care \nin America, the reform of our health care system, and how we help \nAmericans find the health insurance that is affordable to every family.\n  It is important, as we talk about this, that we get the facts out on \nthe table. I am glad to see this has become an issue that is front and \ncenter. I know the President called for a press conference tonight to \ntalk about his vision of health care. I want to set the record straight \non a number of things that have been said that I think are politically \nmotivated and, obviously, don't represent the truth.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle, including the \nPresident, have talked about Republicans representing the status quo on \nbehalf of big special interests, and they have accused us of \nrepresenting the big insurance companies, when, in fact, the voting \nrecord in the Senate has proved the exact opposite.\n  When the President was in the Senate, and when we, as Republicans, \nproposed health care reform--which we did many times while the \nPresident was a Senator--the President and my Democratic colleagues \nvoted with the big insurance companies. We had one proposal that would \nallow small businesses to come together to buy health insurance for \ntheir employees at a lower price. The big insurance companies opposed \nthat, but the Democrats voted with the big insurance companies and \nagainst the reform proposals.\n  I put forth a proposal that would have allowed individuals in this \ncountry to shop for their health insurance in any State in the country, \njust like other products and services, to have a competitive national \nmarket, which so many on the other side have called for. The big \ninsurance companies that have State-by-State monopolies opposed that \nbill. Senator Barack Obama and the Democrats voted with the big \ninsurance companies and against Americans' ability to buy health \ninsurance anywhere in the country.\n  Republicans are not standing with special interests. Look at the \nproposals that have been put on the table in the House and Senate by \nthe Democrats, which the President will be advocating when he speaks \ntonight. Let's see what party is representing special interests.\n  First of all, the abortion industry, Planned Parenthood, and other \norganizations that make their money performing abortions--their \ninterests are clearly represented in this bill. This proposal the \nPresident is advocating would require that health insurance plans cover \nelective abortions in this country, which means taxpayers who are \nmorally opposed to abortion will be forced to subsidize insurance plans \nthat pay for abortion.\n  I ask my colleagues, who is representing special interests? Who is \nrepresenting the abortion industry in this debate?\n  What about who loses their health care coverage in these new plans \nthat have been proposed? The independent Lewin Group has looked at \nthese proposed plans by my Democratic colleagues in the House and \nSenate, and they concluded that 80 million Americans who have health \ninsurance that they now like will lose it under this current proposal.\n  But who is protected? Who would not lose their health insurance? It \nis union members who are protected. Do we think that has anything to do \nwith politics--that the average American will lose their health \ninsurance but the unions that support the Democratic Party are \nprotected? Who is standing up for special interests in this health care \ndebate?\n  Let's talk about the plaintiffs' attorneys. One of the biggest \nproblems in health care today is what doctors call defensive medicine--\nrunning all kinds of unnecessary tests so they avoid all these \nexpensive lawsuits. We have talked for years about reforming the health \ncare system to eliminate these wasteful, frivolous lawsuits that cost \nso much money, and every doctor and hospital has to have huge liability \npolicies for the cost of the lawsuits that come every year. You would \nthink a health care reform proposal would have some lawsuit abuse \nreform in it. But who is protected? What special interests are \nprotected in this health care proposal? The plaintiffs' attorneys. \nThere is absolutely no tort reform, no reform of abusive lawsuits in \nthis plan.\n\n  So I ask my colleagues: Who is representing the special interests \nhere--the big insurance companies, the abortion industry, the unions, \nthe plaintiff's attorney? All of those are represented and protected in \nthis so-called health reform legislation that does nothing to help \nindividuals access affordable personal policies for themselves.\n  When the President was in the Senate, I personally every year \nproposed major health care reform. I proposed that individuals who do \nnot get their insurance at work at least get to deduct the cost of that \ninsurance from their taxes, as we let businesses do. Barack Obama voted \nagainst that, and so did my Democratic colleagues.\n  I proposed that individuals be allowed to buy health insurance \nanywhere in the country so that it would be more affordable, more \ncompetitive. Barack Obama voted against that, and so did my Democratic \ncolleagues.\n  Republicans proposed small businesses come together and buy health \ncare less expensively so they could provide more health insurance to \ntheir employees. Barack Obama voted against that, and so did my \nDemocratic colleagues.\n  I ask you: Which party is standing for the status quo of trying to \nkeep things the same? Real health care reform has been proposed in the \nSenate many times by Republicans. But the truth is, the Democrats do \nnot want individual Americans to have access to affordable health \ninsurance. What they want is a government takeover of health care. The \nPresident has made that clear by his own voting record.\n  As he holds his press conference tonight, I am sure the crowd will be \nloaded with friendly reporters, but there are a few questions I would \nlike him to answer.\n  If the major provisions in this health care bill he is promoting do \nnot take effect until 2013, which they don't, why this mad rush to pass \na bill that is over 1,000 pages that no one in this body has read? Why \nthe mad rush to pass it before we go home for the August break?\n  I can answer it for him. Because if Americans find out what is in it, \nthey are not going to support it.\n  I have a second question: You said your health care bill will cut \ncosts and not increase the deficit. But the independent analysis of the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office contradicts those claims, \nsaying it will raise costs and increase the deficit by $240 billion. \nThe policy does not support the promise.\n  A third question: The President has repeatedly said that the health \ncare bill will allow Americans who like their current plans to keep \nthem. But as I said, an independent expert group, the Lewin Group, has \nanalyzed this legislation and concluded that it will force over 80 \nmillion Americans to lose the health insurance they have today.\n  Question No. 4: The President said the other day when he was speaking \nat Children's Hospital that opponents of the plan are content to \nperpetuate the status quo. How does that compare\n\n[[Page S7835]]\n\nwith your record, Mr. President, when you were in the Senate? What \nhealth reform did you propose? Why did you vote against every health \nreform proposal that could have increased access to affordable health \ninsurance for all Americans?\n  And just a yes-or-no question: Will you guarantee that pro-life \nAmericans under your plan will not be forced to subsidize elective \nabortions?\n  I hope the President will answer some of these questions for the \nAmerican people because I am convinced that if Americans know the truth \nabout this legislation, they will conclude this is not about getting \nthem affordable health insurance or access to quality health care. This \nis a continuation of this power grab that is going on in Washington.\n  This spending spree, this proposal for more and more taxes, is a \npower grab for the government to take over yet another industry, the \nhealth care industry in America. Health care is the most personal and \nprivate service we have for ourselves and our families. Why would we \nwant to turn that over to government to make the decisions for us?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I thank you for your indulgence. I \nencourage my colleagues to read any bill we vote on before the August \nbreak.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nRepublicans have a chance to speak, the next Democrat be Senator \nKaufman.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we just heard the Senator from South \nCarolina urging Members to vote against the health care bill. He talks \nabout the truth about the health care bill. We don't have a health care \nbill before the Senate because we have two committees that are working \non it. One already reported out a bill, the HELP Committee, which \nstresses prevention, because we all know that if you look at the major \ncosts to our families, they all encompass--70 percent of them--five \nmajor diseases. I think we know what they are. They are heart issues, \npulmonary issues, cancer issues, stroke issues. We know what they are. \nPutting prevention first, which is not something we have ever done, is \ngoing to save money, is going to make our people healthier, is going to \nwork. There are many other aspects of the health bill that are very \ngood for our people.\n  I have to say, when the Senator from South Carolina comes to the \nfloor and starts attacking Democrats, I think people have to understand \nthat very Senator was quoted in the press as saying that essentially we \ncan break Barack Obama if we destroy his push for health care. He said \nit will be his Waterloo.\n  I support my colleagues' right to say what they want. They will be \njudged by what they say. They will be judged by what is in their heart. \nThey will be judged on how they act. But we are here to take care of \nthe American people, not to bring down a President or raise up a \nPresident. Our job is to represent the people who sent us here. It is \nnot to break a President. It is not to play politics with one of the \nmost important issues facing our country. And good for this President \nfor having the courage to step forward and point out that the current \nstatus quo on health care is disastrous, and, yes, we are going to \naddress it and we are going to make sure that the people in this \ncountry, if they like their health care, can keep what they have, keep \ntheir insurance. If they don't, they have a chance to buy into other \noptions. That will be their choice. We will stress prevention now. We \nwill have healthier families.\n  I want to point out that there has been a recent study that says if \nwe do nothing, if we bring down this opportunity we have to do \nsomething to better the health care system in this country, if we turn \naway from that and do nothing, in California, by 2016, Californians \nwill have to spend 41.2 percent of their income on health insurance. I \nwant you to think about that. And that is not the worst. In \nPennsylvania, Senator Casey told me, it would be over 50 percent of \npeople's incomes. How are we going to sustain that? Who can sustain \nspending 40 percent of their income on premiums? Fifty percent? It \nisn't going to happen. People will have to walk away. People will get \nsicker.\n  We cannot afford the status quo. That is why I have this chart here \nthat says: No equals the status quo. It is no, no, no. No, let's not do \nthis. No, let's not help our President. No, let's not address this \nissue. Scare tactics, throwing around words, ``government-run health \ncare.''\n  I say to my friend from South Carolina--unfortunately, he is not \nhere--government-run health care, does he want to bring down the \nveterans health care system? Just try that one with your veterans. That \nis a government-run health care system. Veterans get free health care. \nDoes he want to bring down the health care that our military gets every \nsingle day run by this government? Of course not. They are getting the \nbest care in the world on the battlefield, and it is done because \ntaxpayers pay the freight. That is a government-run health care.\n  Does my friend want to bring down Medicaid that helps the poor people \nget some insurance? I hope not because it would be tens of thousands of \npeople in his State, including many children. How about SCHIP? That is \na government-run health care system that helps our poor kids. Does he \nwant to bring it down? Why doesn't he try to do that? See where the \nvotes are. And last but not least, Medicare. Medicare is a single-payer \nsystem, government run, very low overhead costs. Our seniors love \nMedicare. Does my friend want to bring down that government health care \nsystem?\n  This is ridiculous. There is no plan that is moving forward that is a \ngovernment takeover. Yes, we keep veterans health care going and \nmilitary health care going. Yes, we keep SCHIP for the kids going. Yes, \nMedicaid. Yes, veterans. But we don't expand that except to say as we \ngo out to the American people to tell them we are going to save them \nfrom enormous premium increases, that there will be an option, a choice \nthey can make to buy into a public plan or a public interest plan. Some \nsay it could be a co-op. We don't know the details. But to have my \nfriend from South Carolina come to this floor and tell us: Vote no on \nthis health care when we don't even have a plan before us means he is \nfor the great big red stop sign because no equals the status quo. And \nno action is in itself a hostile act.\n  Employer-sponsored health care premiums have more than doubled in the \nlast 9 years. Two-thirds of all personal bankruptcies are linked to \nmedical expenses. Let me say that again. Two-thirds of all personal \nbankruptcies are linked to medical expenses. And how about this: The \nUnited States spends more than twice as much on health care per person \nthan most industrial nations, and it ranks last in preventable \nmortality. It ranks last in preventable mortality, and we spend twice \nas much as any other nation. Status quo is no, no change.\n  Is that what we want to see continued--continued increases in \npremiums for businesses, for individuals, getting to a point where it \nis 40, 50 percent of a family's income? That is not sustainable. Where \ndo they get the money for food, for clothing, for shelter?\n  The other problem we have is 46 million Americans have no health \ninsurance, including one in five working adults. What does that mean? \nIt means that the people without health insurance are waiting for a \ncrisis to occur. They don't take any preventive steps. They don't see a \ndoctor until late in the process in an emergency room. It means that we \nare picking up the bills because when people go to an emergency room \nand they cannot pay, who is picking up the tab? Those of us who have \ninsurance. That is how it goes.\n  I am hoping that the American people weigh in on this debate, as they \nhave begun to do. I was told ever since I was a young person that you \nneed to try hard when there is a problem. Try hard. Be constructive. \nDon't call other people names. You may disagree with them, respect \nthem. Don't try to bring them down, don't try to break them. Make your \narguments; put forward an\n\n[[Page S7836]]\n\nalternative. I have looked at the course of history, and history says \nto people who do nothing that they haven't contributed very much. In \nthis case, because the status quo is unsustainable, they are hurting \nour people. They are hurting our people. More than half of all \nAmericans live with one or more chronic conditions. The cost of caring \nfor an individual with a chronic disease accounts for 75 percent of the \namount we spend on health care. I have those five chronic diseases in \nfront of me. They are: Heart disease, cancer, stroke, chronic \nobstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. Those five are responsible \nfor more than two-thirds of the deaths in the USA. That is information \nthat is important because, when you look at this, many of these can be \nprevented and treated in a way so that they do not wind up costing so \nmuch and hurting our families.\n\n  We have an extraordinary opportunity before us, and I think you are \ngoing to see the parties showing who they represent. Do they represent \nthe forces of the status quo that are going to scare people or do they \nrepresent the forces of change--positive change? I think history will \nshow that those who stepped to the plate here and were constructive are \ngoing to be the ones about whom people say: She tried. He tried. He \nfixed a lot of problems. Not all of them. but they started moving in \nthe right direction.\n  Our families deserve change here. Our families cannot sit back and \nabsorb the kind of increases in health care premiums they have seen in \nthe past. We know how to fix it. If we work together, we will be able \nto fix it.\n  I wish to take a minute to thank the Republicans who are working so \nconstructively with our Democrats. You don't hear them speaking much on \nthe floor, as you did the Senator from South Carolina, who, as I say, \nwas quoted as saying he wants to make health care President Obama's \nWaterloo. He wants to break him on this. The Republicans whom you don't \nsee on the floor talking like that are the ones who are sitting with \nthe Democrats, working day after day, night after night, to solve this \nproblem.\n  I hope people will remember, when you hear these scare tactics--\ngovernment-run health care--that we don't even have a bill yet, and \nthey are saying it is about government-run health care, not one bill \nthat I have seen is government-run health care, not one. But I \nchallenge my friends. If they do not like Medicare--it is government \nrun--why not try to repeal it and see how many senior citizens come to \nyour office. If my Republican friends don't like government-run health \ncare, take away the health care from the veterans because it is \ngovernment run. Take away health care from the military. Privatize \nthat. Take away Medicaid. Take away SCHIP from our kids.\n  They are not going to do that because they know these programs work. \nAre they perfect? Of course, they are not perfect. Do we have to \ncontinue to make them better? Yes, we do. But we need to come together. \nWe need to find that sweet spot that we look for in legislation. I wish \nto, again, thank those Republicans who are meeting with the Democrats. \nBe courageous. Stick with it. Don't play politics. Don't try to bring \ndown this young President. Try to work with him. Don't threaten that \nthis is going to be a Waterloo. Don't talk about government-run systems \nwhen that is not in the bill. Don't frighten people. Because at the end \nof the day, this is our moment if we work together.\n  I certainly reach out my hand and compliment those who are willing to \nwork across party lines because we cannot sustain the health care \nsystem as it is. We can make it better, we can make it affordable, we \ncan keep choice in there, we can turn to prevention, and that is what I \nhope we will do. We will work hard, but I think we can do it with the \nhelp of some courageous folks on the other side of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business and ask the Chair to please let me know when I have \nfinished 9 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I was listening to the Senator from \nCalifornia, and with respect to her comments let me state the position \nof the Republican Senators on health care reform. Our leader, Mitch \nMcConnell, the Senator from Kentucky, stated yesterday to the news \nmedia: This isn't about winning or losing. This is about getting it \nright.\n  Health care is very personal to every one of us, to every one of our \nfamilies, and to all the American people. Our goal, on the Republican \nside, and I am sure for many Democrats as well, is to start with cost \nand make sure we can say to the American people they can afford their \nhealth care policy; and when we have finished fixing health care, they \ncan afford their government. So far, that has not been the case.\n  We have offered plans which we believe will reach that goal. Just to \ngive my own example: Last year, I joined with Senator Wyden, a \nDemocrat; Senator Bennett, a Republican, in endorsing their plan. It is \nnot perfect, but it is a very good plan, and it has a completely \ndifferent approach than the bill that came out of the Senate HELP \nCommittee or that is coming through the House. I believe it is a better \napproach.\n  The point is there are 14 Senators on that plan today--8 Democrats \nand 6 Republicans. Why isn't it being considered? It doesn't have a \ngovernment-run program in it. Why shouldn't we talk about not having a \ngovernment-run program? Medicaid, the largest government-run program we \nhave today, is used to cover low-income Americans and forces them to \ntake their health care in a system that 40 percent of America's doctors \nwon't serve because, in general, they are paid about half as much for \ntheir services as they are if they serve the 177 million of us who have \nprivate health insurance.\n  The Wyden-Bennett bill is constructed along the idea of rearranging \nthe subsidies we already give to the American people for health care \nand gives it to everyone in a way that will permit them--all the \nAmerican people--to afford a health insurance plan that is about the \nsame as a plan that congressional employees have. Literally, we would \nsay to low-income Americans: Here, take this money and buy a private \ninsurance plan of your own, like the rest of us do. This is a much \nbetter idea than dumping 20 million more people into a failed \ngovernment program called Medicaid--which is not only not serving those \nlow-income people but bankrupting States.\n  What is wrong with that idea, 14 of us think it ought to be \nconsidered? Yet it has not been given the time of day.\n  Senator Coburn and Senator Burr have proposals that I have endorsed. \nSenator Gregg has a proposal. Senator Hatch has a proposal. None of \nthem have been given the time of day.\n  We have had very friendly discussions, but they do not qualify as \nbipartisan discussions. I give the Senate Finance Committee members \ngreat credit for trying to work in a bipartisan way, but they are \nworking in a bipartisan way that is still going in the wrong direction, \nwhich is expanding an existing government plan that has failed--\nMedicaid--they are working on creating a new government plan for people \nwho lose their health care under the theories that have been proposed. \nDon't think they are not.\n  I would hope the President would see what is happening and say: Whoa, \nlet's slow down. I have stated what I want. I have put my neck out. I \nhave said to the American people, if they have a health care plan they \nlike, they can keep it. Unfortunately, under the plans we see today, \nthey are going to lose their health care. They have a very good risk of \nlosing their health care and ending up, if they are poor, with their \nonly option being a failed government program that none of us would \njoin, if we could possibly avoid it.\n  Why would we stuff 20 million people into a program we don't want to \nbe in, when we could give them the opportunity to be in a program \nsimilar to the one we are in? That is what we should be doing. On the \nRepublican side, we are saying to our Democratic colleagues: We know \nyou have the majority. We know you have the Presidency. But we have \nsome ideas we think the American people would benefit from.\n\n  We only have one chance to pass this, to change this big system we \nhave, and\n\n[[Page S7837]]\n\nwe better make sure we do it right. If you don't want to take our \nadvice, we would say, respectfully: Why don't you listen to some \nothers? There is the Mayo Clinic. The Senator from California asked: \nWhy are they talking about government programs? Because the Mayo \nClinic--often cited by the President, by many of us, as the kind of \nhigh-quality, good results, low-cost health care we would like to have \nmore of--the Iowa Clinic, the Marshfield Clinic, and other clinics say \nthese health care plans are headed in the wrong direction, and one \nreason is because they would create a new government plan which would \neventually drive the Mayo Clinic and these other clinics out of the \nmarket, which means they wouldn't be serving Medicare patients.\n  So why would we do that? I think we should take our time and get it \nright. If the Mayo Clinic is saying we are heading in the wrong \ndirection, if the Democratic Governors are saying that, if the \nCongressional Budget Office is saying we are adding to the cost and \nadding to the debt, wouldn't the wise thing be to say: Well, maybe they \nhave a point.\n  Gov. Phil Bredesen of Tennessee, a Democrat from my State, knows a \nlot about health care--Medicaid--and he says Congress is about to \nbestow ``the mother of all unfunded mandates.'' Governor Bredesen, a \nformer health care executive, continued:\n\n       Medicaid is a poor vehicle for expanding coverage. It is a \n     45-year-old system originally designed for poor women and \n     children. It is not health care reform to dump more money \n     into Medicaid.\n\n  Here is the Governor of Washington, a Democrat.\n\n       As a governor, my concern is if we try to cost-shift to the \n     States we're not going to be in a position to pick up the \n     tab.\n\n  Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, a Democratic Governor, said:\n\n       I'm personally very concerned about the cost issue, \n     particularly the $1 trillion figures being batted around.\n\n  Gov. Bill Ritter of Colorado, a Democrat.\n\n       There's a concern about whether they have fully figured out \n     a revenue stream that would cover the costs, and that if they \n     don't have all the dollars accounted for it will fall on the \n     States.\n\n  So said Gov. Jim Douglas of Vermont. And Gov. Brian Schweitzer of \nMontana said:\n\n       The governors are concerned about unfunded mandates, \n     another situation where the Federal government says you must \n     do X and you must pay for it. Well, if they want to reform \n     health care, they should figure out what the rules are and \n     how they are going to pay for it.\n\n  So instead of standing on the other side and saying the Republicans \nare saying no, I am saying the Republicans are saying yes. We support \nthe bipartisan Wyden-Bennett bill. We have offered the Burr-Coburn \nbill. We have offered the Gregg bill. We have the Hatch bill. Take our \nproposals and consider the ideas because they do not involve \ngovernment-run programs, they do not dump low-income people into \nMedicaid, where you would not be able to see a doctor. That is akin to \ngiving someone a bus ticket to a route with no buses. We already do it \nwith 60 million people, so why should we do it with 80 million people, \nwhich is the suggestion we have.\n  We want to work with the President and with our friends on the \nDemocratic side to come up with health care reform this year. We want \nto be able to say to the American people: We want a plan you can afford \nfor yourself. And when we're finished fixing it, we want a government \nyou can afford. If the Mayo Clinic and the Democratic Governors and the \nCongressional Budget Office are all saying we are headed in the wrong \ndirection, then why don't we start over and work together and try to \nget a result we can live with for the next 30 or 40 years?\n  We can only do this once, and we need to do it right.\n  I thank the President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 9 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. On the Senator's time, I will be happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't know that we are in controlled time; are we, Mr. \nPresident?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. We are not in controlled time, but \nthe next speaker to be recognized under the unanimous consent agreement \nis the Senator from Delaware, when the time of the Senator from \nTennessee has expired.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                        honoring dr. deborah jin\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I have often spoken about the need to \ninvest in technology and innovation. We cannot afford to fall behind in \nthis area after leading the world in science research and discovery for \nhalf a century.\n  Since I began coming to the floor to talk about great Federal \nemployees, I have honored individuals who have made significant \ncontributions in the areas of engineering, medicine, defense, housing \nassistance, land conservation, and international aid. The list of \nfields benefiting from the work of our Federal employees is lengthy.\n  Another such area is physics. At a time when our planet faces \nresource scarcity and higher energy costs, the work of physicists at \nFederal research institutions remains an important investment in our \nfuture security and prosperity.\n  Dr. Deborah Jin is one of these outstanding Federal employees \npioneering advances in the field of physics. She serves as a research \nteam-leader at the JILA-National Institute of Standards and Technology \njoint institute in Boulder, CO.\n  Deborah's team created a new form of matter, a major discovery in the \nrace toward superconductivity. Superconductivity, or using extremely \nlow temperatures to move electrons through a magnetic field, can \npotentially lead to breakthroughs in energy efficiency and computing. \nHer work will likely improve the lives of hundreds of millions of \npeople.\n  This achievement was far from easy. To create a new form of matter, \nDeborah and her team needed to get particles called fermions to join \ntogether in pairs. Unfortunately, fermions have a natural tendency to \nrepel each other.\n  Deborah discovered that fermions will pair up when exposed to certain \ngasses at more than 450 degrees below zero.\n  This exciting advance takes us one giant step closer to understanding \nsuperconductivity. The uses of this technology could include faster \ncomputers and cell phones, smaller microchips and more efficient home \nappliances. Potentially, superconductivity could eliminate the ten \npercent of energy lost in transfer from power plants to homes and \nbusinesses.\n  Deborah and her colleagues exemplify the spirit of ingenuity and \ndetermination that has always characterized Americans working in \nscientific research. They had been racing against six other teams from \nlaboratories around the world, and they were the first to reach this \nmilestone.\n  It is unlikely that we will be able to appreciate the full extent of \nthis breakthrough for many years, and future generations may not \nremember those who worked so hard to achieve it.\n  But, like all of those who work in public service, Deborah knows that \nshe and her team have made a difference--that the impact of their \nfindings will be felt in every subsequent discovery on the path to \nmaking superconductors a reality.\n  I call on my fellow Senators and on all Americans to join me in \nhonoring the service of Dr. Deborah Jin, her colleagues at the joint \ninstitute in Boulder, and all Federal employees working on scientific \nresearch. They are the unsung heroes of America's global leadership in \nscience and technology.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about a very \nimportant amendment, amendment No. 1725, which I think will help us \nrestore the franchise, the vote, to our deployed military overseas. \nThis is a bipartisan amendment. The lead sponsors are Senator Chuck \nSchumer and Senator Bob Bennett, the chairman and ranking member of the \nRules Committee, but this builds on the work Senator Begich and I, \nSenator Chambliss, and others have put into this effort to address what \ncan only be described as a national disgrace.\n  Our military service members put their lives on the line to protect \nour rights and our freedoms. Yet many of them still face substantial \nroadblocks\n\n[[Page S7838]]\n\nwhen it comes to something as simple as casting their ballots and \nparticipating in our national elections. Sadly, this is not a new \nproblem. President Truman urged Congress to address obstacles to voting \nfaced by troops serving in Korea. Today, however, troops deployed in \nAfghanistan and Iraq face many of the same problems.\n  In 2006, less than half of the military voters who requested absentee \nballots were successful in casting them, according to the U.S. Election \nAssistance Commission.\n  In 2008, those problems continued. More than a quarter of the ballots \nrequested by uniformed and overseas voters went either uncollected or \nuncounted, according to a recent survey of seven States with high \nmilitary voting populations.\n  In a soon to be released study of the 2008 cycle which looked at 20 \nStates with large military populations, the Heritage Foundation has \nconcluded that as many as three-quarters of our troops and their family \nmembers were ``disenfranchised by their inability to request an \nabsentee ballot'' and that as many as one-third of the ballots that \nwere requested never reached the appropriate election officials to be \ncounted.\n  Voting has remained a challenge for our troops and their families for \nmany reasons. First, our election laws are complex and multiple levels \nof government are involved. Election challenges and other unforeseen \nevents can delay the finalization of ballots. The high tempo of \nmilitary operations often requires frequent deployments for our troops \nand their families.\n  Let me describe what this amendment, which I hope we will adopt later \ntoday, does.\n  Our legislation addresses several of the biggest roadblocks our \ntroops and their families face when attempting to vote. First, this \nlegislation will provide voter assistance services to every service \nmember and family member upon transfer to a new military installation. \nAs part of each installation's in-processing, every service member will \nnow be offered an opportunity to fill out a simple form the Department \nof Defense will return to the appropriate election officials. That form \nwill update the address on file with election officials and request \nabsentee ballots for the next Federal election cycle. These voter \nassistance services will give our military personnel some of the \nsupport that civilians now enjoy through motor voter laws.\n  Second, this legislation reduces the reliance on snail male for \ncorrespondence between troops and their election officials. Under \ncurrent election laws, many troops must mail a request for an absentee \nballot, then wait for the election officials to mail them the blank \nballot, and then to return the completed ballot in time to be counted. \nThis legislation requires elections officials to create electronic \nblank ballots and to post them online. Election officials must also \naccept faxes and e-mails to expedite correspondence with our troops.\n  Together, these reforms will reduce dependence on snail mail until \nthe service member is ready to return the completed ballot to be \ncounted.\n  Third, this legislation will expedite the return of the completed \nballot to election officials. Under current law, each servicemember is \nresponsible for making sure his or her ballot is postmarked and \nreturned on time. This legislation requires the Department of Defense \nto take possession of completed ballots and ensure that they get to \nelection officials on time by using Express Mail, if necessary.\n  This legislation also requires election officials to give our troops \n45 days, at least, to return their ballots.\n  This important amendment contains many other commonsense reforms \nsuggested by other Senators and will help end the effective \ndisenfranchisement of our troops and their families. Our goal has been \nto balance responsibilities between elections officials and the \nDepartment of Defense, and I believe this amendment accomplishes that \ngoal.\n  As I said, this amendment would not be in its current posture without \nthe leadership of Senator Schumer and Senator Bennett. And I appreciate \nthem working to include two pieces of legislation I introduced earlier \nthis year, something called the Military Voting Protection Act, which, \njust this weekend was unanimously endorsed by the National Association \nof Secretaries of State, and a second piece of legislation called the \nMilitary Voters' Equal Access to Registration Act. These two pieces of \nlegislation have received broad bipartisan support from the beginning, \nincluding Senators Begich, Inhofe, Wyden, Vitter, and Hutchison. We \nhave also worked closely with leaders in the House of Representatives, \nespecially Congressmen Kevin McCarthy and Duncan Hunter.\n  All of our work was not done in Washington. We relied on support and \ntechnical assistance from the Texas Secretary of State's Office, \nespecially our Director of Elections, Ann McGeehan, dozens of military \nsupport organizations and veterans service organizations, and many \nother citizens and patriots who want our troops to enjoy their right to \nvote--that it be protected, particularly for those who defend all of \nus.\n  I urge all of our colleagues to support this amendment when it comes \nto the Senate floor, I hope, later on today, and to give this important \namendment our unanimous consent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, once every 20 years we take up critical \nissues like health care reform. Many of us believe this particular \nmoment in history is perhaps the only opportunity in our public career \nto tackle an issue of this magnitude. We know overwhelmingly the people \nof America want us to do this.\n  Many people like their health insurance policies, particularly if \nthey don't use them. But most people understand the health care system \nwe have in this country is broken. We have to fix what is broken, and \nwe have to preserve those things that are good about the current \nsystem.\n  I have heard a lot of speeches from the other side of the aisle about \nthe situation we currently face, the debate that is underway. I think \nwhat recently happened in the Senate HELP Committee is a good indicator \nof a good-faith effort by the Democratic majority and Senator Dodd to \ntry to come up with a bipartisan Republican-Democratic approach.\n  Over the course of over 60 days of hearings the Senate HELP Committee \nhad filed over 800 amendments, considered over 400 amendments, adopted \n160 Republican amendments in the course of 61 hours of straight \nhearing, and at the end of the day when the rollcall was taken, not a \nsingle Republican Senator would support the bill. I think Senator Dodd \nmade a good-faith effort, and I think we should continue to.\n  Now the Finance Committee is taking up the same bill. It will be a \nlot better bill if it is a bipartisan effort and if compromises are \nreached, if we try to do this together in an expeditious way. But if it \nbecomes a standoff where there are no Republican votes in support of it \nor where they will not negotiate, where they all vote against it, then \nI am afraid it will not be in the best interests of what the American \npeople want to see.\n\n  Yesterday on the front page of the Washington Post they had headlines \nabout some of the comments being made by some of my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle. The headline read, ``GOP Focuses Effort To \nKill Health Bills.'' Not to modify, not to improve, but to kill health \nbills.\n  From a perspective of Republican leadership, that is what our health \ncare debate is about. Many of them just want to stop health care \nreform. It has been 15 years since we made our last effort to provide \nquality, affordable health care coverage to every American. The \nRepublican National Committee chairman, Michael Steele, today suggested \nthat the President should take another 8 to 10 months to formulate a \nplan.\n  It has already been 8 months since Barack Obama won the 2008 election \non a platform of reforming health care. It has been 6 months since he \ntook office. Yet on the other side of the aisle, their chairman says \nlet's wait 8 to 10 months more.\n  It may fit in perfectly with a strategy to delay this debate as long \nas possible, but it doesn't fit in with a strategy of solving the \nproblem. Tonight,\n\n[[Page S7839]]\n\nPresident Obama will be speaking to the American people, answering \nquestions from the press on health care. Tomorrow, in a trip to \nCleveland, he will be visiting the Cleveland Clinic and some other \nfacilities to talk about health care reform. We are just a couple of \nweeks away from an August recess. We will come back in September and by \nthen I hope we can roll up our sleeves and get to work. The American \npeople want us to. They understand the problem.\n  Health care spending per person has increased rapidly over the past \n10 years, rising over 40 percent. The people of the United States spend \nover $2 trillion on health care each year. That is more than twice as \nmuch per person as any other country on Earth, and our health results \ndo not show that money is being well spent.\n  Many countries, spending a lot less, get better results. We are \nwasting a lot of money. It is money that is being taken out in fraud \nand profit taking. It is money that does not make us feel any \nhealthier. It is just money that we have to pay, many times from \npaychecks where it is a struggle to pay it.\n  The average annual premium of family coverage in Illinois during the \nGeorge W. Bush Presidency, those 8 years, went up $5,000. The average \nannual premium went from $600 a month to over $1,000 a month.\n  The employer's share rose by 72 percent, the worker's portion rose by \n78 percent. I might tell you in the same period of time, workers' wages \nwere not going up, just the cost of health care. People know this. They \nsense it is getting out of hand.\n  Clearly, two-thirds of all the personal bankruptcies filed in \nAmerica, two-thirds of them, are related to medical expenses. Over 46 \nmillion Americans have no health insurance, and 14,000 Americans lose \ntheir health insurance every single day.\n  If you hear about the 47, 48 million Americans without health \ninsurance, and say: It is a darned shame, but the poor will always be \nwith us, and we cannot solve every problem, Senator, sadly, some of \nyour neighbors, maybe some of the members of your family may find \nthemselves in that predicament soon if we do not address health reform.\n  Those of us who are lucky enough to have health insurance--for the \nrecord, Members of Congress have the same health insurance plan as \nFederal employees, 8 million of us; Federal employees and their \nfamilies, Members of Congress and staff, are in the same basic health \ncare plan. There is a lot of bad information out there about our health \ninsurance. It is a good plan, do not get me wrong, but it is the same \none Federal employees are entitled to. I think that is a fair way to \napproach it.\n  But even those of us paying for health insurance are paying a hidden \ntax. We pay up to $1,000, $1,100 per year per family to subsidize those \nwho are uninsured, who show up at the hospital and still get treated. \nThey get treated, they cannot pay for it, their expenses are shifted to \nothers who do pay. That includes those of us under health insurance, \nabout $1,100 a year.\n  At this point, we have 2.3 million more people losing health \ninsurance every year across America. It is something that should \nconcern us. But let's get down to specifics. Because I think if my \nfriends on the other side of the aisle will join us on this side of the \naisle and talk to American families about what they are going through, \nwe would get a better understanding of why this is so important and why \nwe cannot wait 8 months, 10 months, a year or more, we have to move on \nthis and do it decisively.\n  There is a fellow in my district who lives in Libertyville, IL. His \nname is Rene Apack. He has been an insurance broker for 11 years. He \nknows that business. He sells all kinds of insurance. He will sell \nprivate health insurance to close friends and family members, but he \nshies away from it when it comes to the general public because he says \nit is too complicated to explain, there are too many underwriting \ntricks and traps in those insurance policies.\n  Mr. Apack does not want to get into the business of trying to defend \nthose policies to his clients. If his clients are denied coverage for \nhealth care based on some fine print they do not understand, even \nthough he had nothing to do with it, he feels bad about it. So he \ndiscourages the sale of private health insurance to his clients.\n  Medicare, he said, is the opposite. We have heard people come to the \nfloor day after day on the other side of the aisle criticising \ngovernment health insurance. But I have yet to hear the first \nRepublican Senator call for eliminating Medicare. Medicare covers 45 \nmillion Americans, seniors and disabled, with affordable health \ninsurance. It is a government-administered program. I have yet to hear \nthe first Republican Senator say we should do away with it.\n  It is a program which saves a lot of people, some of whom retire \nbefore they reach the age of 65 and run into medical problems and pray \nthey can be eligible for Medicare and not lose their life savings. It \nhappened to a member of my family, my brother.\n  Luckily for him, Medicare kicked in at the right moment, saved his \nlife savings. It might have saved his life. He is 77 now, so for 12 \nyears Medicare has been helping to pay his bills. Mr. Apack says:\n\n       My mom, my mother-in-law, my uncle--they have Medicare \n     supplement insurance and everything works like clockwork. I \n     have never had one Medicare supplement claim denied.\n\n  It is not just his clients who have problems with health insurers, \nhis own health insurance has had a high deductible, $7,000 a year is \nhis deductible on his health insurance for his family coverage, \nhimself, his wife, and his 12-year-old son. Last year his wife was told \nshe needed a routine mammogram, basic preventive care. But they did not \nknow how much it would cost. So they did what conscientious consumers \nwould do since they knew they had to pay the first $7,000 deductible \nbefore the health insurance paid anything.\n  They called and they said: Give us a ballpark estimate of how much it \nwill cost for a mammogram. Is it $200 or $2,000? No one would tell them \nthe price.\n  Mr. Apack, an insurance broker, said: It is like walking into a \nrestaurant and ordering a meal and hoping you can afford it. In the \nend, Mrs. Apack decided it was too risky to go in for this test and not \nknow how much it would cost. She did not do it. That is not a good \noutcome.\n  Preventive care could save her life and avoid more serious and \nexpensive medical care. A while back, after his premiums increased 38 \npercent over 2 years, Mr. Apack reapplied with the same insurer, wanted \nto see if he could lower his premiums by switching to a higher \ndeductible. He answered every question on the application form. \nRemember, this man is an insurance broker. Then he got a letter from \nhis insurer, and the letter asked him: Are you sure about all the \nanswers you gave us? Do you want to stand by all the answers?\n  Then he got a phone call from the insurer, and the caller asked: Are \nyou sure there is not something you failed to tell us? And he named a \ndate 8 years earlier. The person from the insurance company said: Is it \nnot true that you had a prescription in your name filled that day 8 \nyears ago?\n  Well, finally he remembered. Mr. Apack remembered he had been in a \ncar accident that day. He was not hurt badly, but he was a little sore. \nHis doctor said: Here is a prescription for pain medication, take it if \nyou need it. He filled the prescription. Eight years later that \nprescription apparently gave his insurer pause about keeping him as a \ncustomer.\n  We talk about preexisting conditions. We talk about unknown costs in \nthe current system. To think they could go in your past and find a \nprescription you filled 8 years ago and call you back and say: Are you \nsure you have not failed to disclose something here?\n  That is what the current system is, a health insurance system full of \ntricks and traps. Those on the other side of the aisle who say we do \nnot need to change it, one Senator from South Carolina said let the \nmarket work, which means basically hands off. Mr. Steele, who heads the \nRepublican National Committee, said: Let's wait 8 to 10 more months \nbefore we get into that.\n  Do they not understand what families are facing on an everyday basis? \nMr. Apack knows he is probably luckier than some who live around him. \nOne of his neighbors pays $15,000 a year for health coverage for \nherself,\n\n[[Page S7840]]\n\nher husband, and child--more than they pay on their family mortgage.\n  He met with a client recently, a real estate company with about 50 \nemployees. Last year, the employees all decided to switch to part time \nso no one would be laid off. Their incomes are down at least 50 percent \nfrom a year ago. Their health insurance premiums went up 5 percent.\n  In the professional opinion of this Illinois insurance broker, we \nneed a better system, health care coverage that is affordable, simple, \nand fair. That is the challenge we face in the Senate. It is a \nchallenge we cannot ignore.\n  The Finance Committee now is trying to work out a reasonable way to \ndeal with this challenge. We know the providers have to be in on this \nconversation. If we are spending more than twice as much as any nation \non Earth for health care, then we obviously need to ask if there can be \nsavings.\n  United Health Care reported their earnings, if you followed that in \nthe business pages of the paper, another big recordbreaking profit, far \nbeyond expectations. Health care insurance companies are doing very \nwell.\n\n  Pharmaceutical companies historically have been some of the most \nprofitable companies. There are providers in the health care system \nthat are doing extremely well. We need to bring costs down within the \nsystem, without compromising quality. That is the challenge we face.\n  I know they tried in the HELP Committee adopting 161 Republican \namendments and could not find a single Republican Senator to support \nthe final bill. Tonight the President is going to renew the challenge, \nthe challenge to all of us not to miss this once-every-two-decades \nopportunity to deal with health care.\n  I fear, if we do that, we are going to find ourselves in an \nunsustainable position. The cost of health care is going to continue to \ngo up at expense levels we cannot handle as a nation. We have to make \nsure we have basic health care reform and get it right. We have to \nreduce costs for families, businesses, and the government. We have to \nprotect people's choice of doctors, hospitals, and insurance plans. If \nyou have an insurance plan you like, you ought to be able to keep it \nand assure affordable high-quality health care.\n  We have to make sure health insurance companies are not denying \ncoverage for preexisting conditions, health status or medical \ncondition. We have to eliminate the caps on coverage so a very \nexpensive chronic disease does not end up blowing the top off your \nhealth insurance policy and going right into your savings account.\n  We have to put a limit on out-of-pocket expenses. We have to \nguarantee equal treatment for men and women, Black, White and brown, \nyoung and old, and different geographic locations. Incidentally, I \nnoted the health insurance companies have now said they are going to \nlook into this to make sure they start billing women a little more \nfavorably than they have in the past--I wonder if it has anything to do \nwith our debate--that the basic health insurance plan in America has a \nkind of coverage and protection that is adequate for every family. We \nhave to bring down the costs.\n  One of the ways we are going to do that is provide some tax \nincentives and help for low-and middle-income families. We have to make \nsure people are paying fair premiums. Finally, we have to make sure we \nsupport small businesses. Of the 47 million uninsured, the vast \nmajority of those are people working in small businesses and their \nfamilies.\n  Senator Snowe, Senator Lincoln, myself, and others have introduced a \nbill called the SHOP bill that would give small businesses across \nAmerica the same basic option Federal employees have in the health \nbenefit program.\n  That is a way to get small businesses into purchasing pools to lower \ntheir costs, to make sure their employees and the small businesses have \nthe same benefits when it comes to health care coverage.\n  I encourage my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we have to \nget beyond ``no.'' You have to get to a point where you work with us to \ntry to change the status quo and bring about real health care reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding we may move ahead \nshortly with debate and vote on an amendment by Senator Brownback and a \nside-by-side vote on the same subject with Senator Kerry.\n  I believe Senator Kerry's amendment would be first. Hopefully, we can \nagree with that soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, we are expecting that unanimous consent \nagreement can be propounded within the next few minutes so we can \ncontinue to press forward.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to ask the distinguished \nchairman and ranking member if there is going to be a quorum call, I \nask unanimous consent that I speak until the agreement has been \nreached.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I wish to speak as in morning business \non health care. It has been the topic of conversation while the Defense \nbill has been negotiated behind the scenes. I wished to talk about \nhealth care reform because it is the issue of the day. I think America \nis focusing on this issue now, and I am so glad they are because the \nmore we learn about the proposals that are being made in the House and \nin the committees on the Senate side, the more concerns are being \nraised by the American people and by the experts who are studying the \nproposals.\n  What I am concerned about is the proposals that have been put forward \nfrom the Senate committee, and what is being put forward on the House \nside are proposals that are going to be the beginning of a government \nhealth care system that is modeled after Canada and Great Britain. What \nwe are looking at is more government, more taxes, more expensive health \ncare, and what we see less of is quality health care, less choice, less \nreimbursement to hospitals and Medicare and Medicaid; exactly the wrong \ndirection.\n  We have hospitals all over my home State of Texas that treat indigent \npatients and patients who cannot pay.\n  Every one of our hospitals, rural and urban, gets extra help from \nMedicare and Medicaid for doing these services. The problem is that \npeople go into the emergency rooms for primary care, care they could \nget from a doctor in a doctor's office if they had health care \ncoverage. But they don't, so they wait until their diseases are much \nmore progressed, and they go to an emergency room. What does that do? \nIt makes the cost of health care higher for everyone. It makes the cost \nof health care continue to go up, and it raises premiums for people who \nhave coverage. It costs taxpayers who have to pay for the emergency \nroom care in the form of tax increases.\n  What we are looking at now is a proposal that will take money out of \nthe hospitals. Every one of the hospitals in Texas will have lower \nreimbursements from Medicare and Medicaid, every one. That is estimated \nto cost more taxpayer dollars to cover the people who are going to the \nemergency room. Rural hospitals, particularly, may have to close their \ndoors. I am hearing from rural hospital administrators that they don't \nhave the money to absorb these cuts. They have a choice. They can cut \nservices, or they can close hospitals--neither of which is an outcome \nany of us wants to see.\n  In addition, there are Medicaid requirements for States. Every \nGovernor, Democratic or Republican, is saying: What are you thinking? \nMore Federal mandates that are unfunded? That is why people are so \nfrustrated with the Federal Government right now, more unfunded \nmandates. The estimate is that it would cost my home State of Texas $3 \nbillion a year to absorb just the Medicaid unfunded mandate that is in \nthe proposed bill making its way through Congress.\n  There has been an urgency. Many of the people on the floor here, as \nwell as the President, are saying: We have a deadline. We have an \nAugust deadline, and we must pass this bill by August.\n  We are talking about a complete overturning of our health care \nsystem, not reform. Reform is what we all want. We need reform in our \nhealth care system. We need lower costs and more people covered. That \nis not what the bill going through Congress will do.\n\n[[Page S7841]]\n\nIt is a complete upheaval of the health care system. It will be a \nsingle-payer government system that will start encroaching on and \ndisplacing the private health care people know and that provides the \nquality assurance we expect.\n  The private health care system will start being displaced by a big \ngovernment system that will be cheaper but will also give fewer choices \nand less service. That is the concern so many people are beginning to \nhave as more and more comes out about this health care plan.\n  In addition, there is an effort being made to pay for this big \ngovernment takeover of health care. What are the options on the table? \nThis is what is being proposed: that we will fine employers who do not \noffer private health care to their employees. That is like saying: OK, \nif you hire more people and you don't offer health care, your fines \nwill go up. So that is going to discourage the hiring of people at a \ntime when unemployment is at a record high. We should be encouraging \npeople, especially in small business, to hire people. We want to create \njobs, not cut them. Instead, we are going to increase taxes on small \nbusiness. As much as 45 percent is being proposed on small business. \nThat will make small business taxes higher than corporate taxes. \nCorporate taxes in America are among the highest in the world. Yet we \nare going to add on top of the 45 percent that the small businesses \nwill pay, 35 percent for corporate. And then you fine the businesses \nthat don't offer health care. It is almost as though we are in a self-\nfulfilling death wish. In the unemployment atmosphere in which we find \nourselves, all of a sudden we are going to pass new taxes and new fines \non small businesses which are the economic engine of America. It is \nsmall business that creates jobs, not big business, not government. Big \nbusiness does some, but mostly it is small business growing that \ncreates economic vitality. It is certainly not government.\n  When we get to bigger and bigger government, we are going to find \nourselves in a spiral where half the people are working to support the \nother half of the population. It will go down from there.\n  It is important to read what the Mayo Clinic said about the House \nbill. They said:\n\n       Although there are some positive provisions in the bill, \n     the proposed legislation misses the opportunity to help \n     create higher quality, more affordable health care for \n     patients. In fact, it will do the opposite.\n\n  This is the Mayo Clinic, one of the premier health care providers in \nthe country.\n\n       In general, the proposals under discussion are not patient-\n     focused or results-oriented. Lawmakers have failed to use a \n     fundamental lever, a change in Medicare payment policy, to \n     help drive necessary improvements in American health care.\n\n  The Mayo Clinic goes on:\n\n       Unless legislators create payment systems that pay for good \n     patient results at reasonable cost, the promise of \n     transformation in American health care will wither. The real \n     losers will be the citizens of the United States.\n\n  Today 40 percent of physicians turn away Medicaid patients because \nthe system is poorly administered and has a weak record of \nreimbursement. We know that billions of taxpayer dollars are wasted on \nfraud and abuse in Medicare every year. Are we going to emulate a \nprogram that doctors are walking away from and that is costing billions \nof wasted dollars to the taxpayers?\n  This is not responsible governing. We need to take our time. \nRepublicans have come forward and will continue to come forward with \nalternatives, alternatives that don't break the backs of taxpayers, \nthat don't break the backs of small business people, that give the \nquality health care Americans have come to expect and should. We have \nalternatives that are responsible. Small business health plans, for \none, would be the best approach to this, because more people being \ncovered means lower cost for everyone.\n  What does every family in this country want? They want a job to \nsupport their families, and they want health care coverage for their \nchildren. We can give them that by giving affordable opportunities for \nsmall businesses to give health care coverage options to their \nemployees. That is what Americans want. They don't want a big \ngovernment health care system that is going to rob them of quality and \ncost them more in the meantime.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to talk today about this important issue \nand why we must take time to do this right. If we completely overturn \nour health care system, we may never be able to get it back. We may \nnever be able to recover. We can do this right, if we take the time and \nif it is truly bipartisan, if Republicans will have a seat at the \ntable. They didn't have a seat at the table when the Senate committee \nvoted its bill out taking two Republican amendments out of 45 offered. \nThat is not bipartisanship. That is being polite and saying no. What we \nwant is to have real options that will keep the quality, keep the \nchoice, keep the private sector employment in our system and give \nfamilies a chance to have good jobs with health care coverage. We can \ndo that, if we will get together on a bipartisan basis and go forward \nin a positive way.\n  The bills coming out of the House and Senate right now, with \nvirtually no Republican input, are not right for America. That is why \nwe are saying: Let's go back to the drawing board.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1761\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be set \naside so that I may call up an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On behalf of Senator Kerry, Senator Lugar, and myself, I \ncall up amendment No. 1761.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Michigan [Mr. Levin], for Mr. Kerry, for \n     himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Levin, and Mr. Webb, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1761.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate that the United States \nshould fully enforce existing sanctions, and should explore additional \n   sanctions, with respect to North Korea and to require a review to \ndetermine whether North Korea should be re-listed as a state sponsor of \n                               terrorism)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1232. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ENFORCEMENT AND IMPOSITION \n                   OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA; \n                   REVIEW TO DETERMINE WHETHER NORTH KOREA SHOULD \n                   BE RE-LISTED AS A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On April 5, 2009, the Government of North Korea tested \n     an intermediate range ballistic missile in violation of \n     United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1695 (2006) and \n     1718 (2006).\n       (2) On April 5, 2009, President Barack Obama issued a \n     statement on North Korea, stating that ``Preventing the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means \n     of delivery is a high priority for my administration'', and \n     adding, ``North Korea has ignored its international \n     obligations, rejected unequivocal calls for restraint, and \n     further isolated itself from the community of nations''.\n       (3) On April 15, 2009, the Government of North Korea \n     announced it was expelling international inspectors from its \n     Yongbyon nuclear facility and ending its participation in the \n     Six Party Talks for the Denuclearization of the Korean \n     Peninsula.\n       (4) On May 25, 2009, the Government of North Korea \n     conducted a second nuclear test, in disregard of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, which was issued in \n     2006 following the first such test and which demanded that \n     North Korea not conduct any further nuclear tests or launches \n     of a ballistic missile.\n       (5) The State Department's 2008 Human Rights Report on \n     North Korea, issued on February 25, 2009, found that human \n     rights conditions inside North Korea remained poor, prison \n     conditions are harsh and life-threatening, and citizens were \n     denied basic freedoms such as freedom of speech, press, \n     assembly, religion, and association.\n       (6) Pursuant to section 102(b)(2)(E) of the Arms Export \n     Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2799aa-1(b)(2)(E)), President George \n     W. Bush, on February 7, 2007, notified Congress that the \n     United States Government would oppose the extension of any \n     loan or financial or technical assistance to North Korea by \n     any international financial institution and the prohibition \n     on support for the extension of such loans or assistance \n     remains in effect.\n       (7) On June 12, 2009, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Resolution 1874, condemning North Korea's nuclear \n     test, imposing a sweeping embargo on all arms trade with \n     North Korea, and requiring member states not to provide \n     financial support or other financial services that could \n     contribute to North Korea's nuclear-related or missile-\n     related activities or other activities related to weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n\n[[Page S7842]]\n\n       (8) On July 15, 2009, the Sanctions Committee of the United \n     Nations Security Council, pursuant to United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1874, imposed a travel ban on five North \n     Korean individuals and asset freezes on five more North \n     Korean entities for their involvement in nuclear weapons and \n     ballistic missile development programs, marking the first \n     time the United Nations has imposed a travel ban on North \n     Koreans.\n       (9) On June 10, 2008, the Government of North Korea issued \n     a statement, subsequently conveyed directly to the United \n     States Government, affirming that North Korea, ``will firmly \n     maintain its consistent stand of opposing all forms of \n     terrorism and any support to it and will fulfill its \n     responsibility and duty in the struggle against terrorism.''.\n       (10) The June 10, 2008, statement by the Government of \n     North Korea also pledged that North Korea would take ``active \n     part in the international efforts to prevent substance, \n     equipment and technology to be used for the production of \n     nukes and biochemical and radioactive weapons from finding \n     their ways to the terrorists and the organizations that \n     support them''.\n       (11) On June 26, 2008, President George W. Bush certified \n     that--\n       (A) the Government of North Korea had not provided any \n     support for international terrorism during the preceding 6-\n     month period; and\n       (B) the Government of North Korea had provided assurances \n     that it will not support acts of international terrorism in \n     the future.\n       (12) The President's June 26 certification concluded, based \n     on all available information, that there was ``no credible \n     evidence at this time of ongoing support by the DPRK for \n     international terrorism'' and that ``there is no credible or \n     sustained reporting at this time that supports allegations \n     (including as cited in recent reports by the Congressional \n     Research Service) that the DPRK has provided direct or \n     witting support for Hezbollah, Tamil Tigers, or the Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guard''.\n       (13) The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism \n     2008, in a section on North Korea, state, ``The Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was not known to have \n     sponsored any terrorist acts since the bombing of a Korean \n     Airlines flight in 1987.''.\n       (14) The Country Reports on Terrorism 2008 also state, ``A \n     state that directs WMD resources to terrorists, or one from \n     which enabling resources are clandestinely diverted, poses a \n     grave WMD terrorism threat. Although terrorist organizations \n     will continue to seek a WMD capability independent of state \n     programs, the sophisticated WMD knowledge and resources of a \n     state could enable a terrorist capability. State sponsors of \n     terrorism and all nations that fail to live up to their \n     international counterterrorism and nonproliferation \n     obligations deserve greater scrutiny as potential \n     facilitators of WMD terrorism.''.\n       (15) On October 11, 2008, the Secretary of State, pursuant \n     to the President's certification, removed North Korea from \n     its list of state sponsors of terrorism, on which North Korea \n     had been placed in 1988.\n       (b) Report on Conduct of North Korea.--Not later than 30 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall submit to Congress a detailed report \n     examining the conduct of the Government of North Korea since \n     June 26, 2008, based on all available information, to \n     determine whether North Korea meets the statutory criteria \n     for listing as a state sponsor of terrorism. The report \n     shall--\n       (1) present any credible evidence of support by the \n     Government of North Korea for acts of terrorism, terrorists, \n     or terrorist organizations;\n       (2) examine what steps the Government of North Korea has \n     taken to fulfill its June 10, 2008, pledge to prevent weapons \n     of mass destruction from falling into the hands of \n     terrorists; and\n       (3) assess the effectiveness of re-listing North Korea as a \n     state sponsor of terrorism as a tool to accomplish the \n     objectives of the United States with respect to North Korea, \n     including completely eliminating North Korea's nuclear \n     weapons programs, preventing North Korean proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction, and encouraging North Korea to \n     abide by international norms with respect to human rights.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should--\n       (A) vigorously enforce United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009) and other sanctions \n     in place with respect to North Korea under United States law;\n       (B) urge all member states of the United Nations to fully \n     implement the sanctions imposed by United Nations Security \n     Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874; and\n       (C) explore the imposition of additional unilateral and \n     multilateral sanctions against North Korea in furtherance of \n     United States national security;\n       (2) the conduct of North Korea constitutes a threat to the \n     northeast Asian region and to international peace and \n     security;\n       (3) if the United States determines that the Government of \n     North Korea has provided assistance to terrorists or engaged \n     in state sponsored acts of terrorism, the Secretary of State \n     should immediately list North Korea as a state sponsor of \n     terrorism; and\n       (4) if the United States determines that the Government of \n     North Korea has failed to fulfill its June 10, 2008, pledges, \n     the Secretary of State should immediately list North Korea as \n     a state sponsor of terrorism.\n       (d) State Sponsor of Terrorism Defined.--For purposes of \n     this section, the term ``state sponsor of terrorism'' means a \n     country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism for purposes of--\n       (1) section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 \n     (50 U.S.C. App. 2405(j)) (as continued in effect pursuant to \n     the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. \n     1701 et seq.));\n       (2) section 40 of the Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. \n     2780); or\n       (3) section 620A of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 \n     U.S.C. 2371).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that amendment Nos. 1761 and 1597 \nbe debated concurrently for up to 30 minutes, with the time equally \ndivided and controlled between Senators Kerry and Brownback or their \ndesignees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, the Senate \nproceed to vote in relation to amendment No. 1761, to be followed by a \nvote in relation to No. 1597; that no amendment be in order to either \namendment; that prior to the second vote there be 2 minutes of debate \ndivided as provided above.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, in addition to Senator Lugar and Senator \nLevin, I believe Senator Webb is also an original cosponsor of this \namendment. I believe this amendment is a responsible alternative to the \namendment offered by Senator Brownback. This amendment appropriately \ntakes note of and condemns North Korea's recent behavior as a threat to \nthe northeast Asian region and to international peace and security. But \nin contrast to the Brownback amendment, which expresses the sense of \nthe Senate that North Korea should immediately be relisted as a state \nsponsor of terrorism, the Kerry-Lugar-Levin-Webb amendment requires \nsomething to happen, not just a sense of the Senate that there might be \na relisting. It mandates a report, a formal report, to be completed \nwithin 30 days, examining North Korea's conduct since it was removed \nfrom the terrorism list last June, including the evaluation of any \nevidence that North Korea has engaged in acts of terrorism or provided \nsupport for acts of terrorism or terrorist organizations.\n  One of the reasons for requiring that is that in the Brownback \namendment on page 3, section 9, line 21, it says:\n\n       There have been recent credible reports that North Korea \n     has provided support to the terrorist group Hezbollah, \n     including providing ballistic missile components and \n     personnel to train members of Hezbollah . . .\n\n  Let me state unequivocally to my colleagues in the Senate: The most \nrecent intelligence assessments of our intelligence community simply do \nnot sustain this charge. In fact, President Bush specifically refuted \nthat charge because it was an old one, and he refuted it last year. It \nwould be the height of irresponsibility for the Senate to pass an \namendment based on a finding that is false. It is important to have a \nreport to the Senate that requires us to evaluate, that would have the \nadministration submit to us precisely what the situation is.\n  The report will also assess the effectiveness of relisting North \nKorea as a state sponsor of terrorism for achieving our national \nsecurity objectives; namely, completely eliminating North Korea's \nnuclear weapons programs, preventing North Korean proliferation of \nweapons of mass destruction, and encouraging North Korea to abide by \ninternational norms with respect to human rights.\n  Our amendment then expresses the sense of the Senate that if the \nUnited States finds that North Korea has, in fact--that we would know \nthis within these 30 days--provided support for terrorism, then the \nSecretary of State should immediately relist North Korea as a state \nsponsor of terrorism.\n  It also expresses the sense of the Senate that the United States \nshould vigorously enforce all existing unilateral and multilateral \nsanctions and consider the imposition of additional sanctions if \nnecessary to achieve the policy goals with respect to North Korea.\n  I believe it is an important, realistic amendment. I think it is \ntougher because it mandates some things specific, and it rightly \ncondemns North Korea, as we have.\n\n[[Page S7843]]\n\n  Let me emphasize, the United States, this administration, has fully \nand rightly condemned North Korea's launch of ballistic missiles and \nits test of a nuclear weapon on May 25, 2009. We have led a strong \ninternational response to those provocations, and we succeeded in \nwinning unanimous support from the United Nations for U.N. Security \nCouncil Resolution 1874, imposing sweeping new sanctions against North \nKorea. The sanctions mandated under the U.N. Security Council \nResolution 1874 include not only a comprehensive arms embargo but also \nrobust new financial sanctions on North Korean trading companies, and \nvisa restrictions on North Korean officials engaged in the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n  These sanctions have teeth. They are multilateral. And they are \nhaving an impact. A North Korean cargo ship suspected of carrying arms \nto Burma turned around after it was denied bunkering services in \nSingapore. The Government of Burma joined with us, and the government \nitself warned that the ship would have to be inspected on arrival in \norder to ensure that it did not have munitions onboard. The sanctions \nhave had a bite. They are working.\n  As strong as those measures have been, additional measures may be \nnecessary, and this report will help us to evaluate that. But \nadditional steps, including the relisting of North Korea as a state \nsponsor of terrorism, ought to be based on a careful examination of the \nfacts--that is how we ought to do things in the Senate--and an \nassessment of whether those sanctions are going to advance our \ninterests. That is precisely what the Kerry-Lugar-Levin-Webb amendment \nmandates, and that is why it is actually a better sanctions policy than \nthe alternative Brownback amendment.\n  Let me add one last word. We are currently deeply concerned about the \nfate of two American journalists currently under detention in North \nKorea. The administration is engaged right now in sensitive discussions \nwith the North Korean Government attempting to secure the immediate \nrelease of these two American citizens. For the Senate to suggest--on \nsomething we already know is factually incorrect but out of emotion and \notherwise--that North Korea ought to be returned to the list of state \nsponsors of terrorism without regard to whether they have, in fact, \nengaged in acts of terrorism or provided support to terrorist \norganizations would be irresponsible with respect to those particular \nefforts and otherwise at this time.\n  We ought to proceed according to facts. We ought to proceed in ways \nthat best advance the interests of our country.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, thank you very much. I appreciate the \nchance to debate this issue with my colleague, the distinguished \nSenator from Massachusetts.\n  I find it very interesting to hear the statement that the sanctions \nare working. I am trying to think of how they are working at all. They \nare working to prevent North Korea from detonating another nuclear \nweapon? That did not quite work. We got another one of those. They are \nworking to prevent them from launching more missiles? Well, that one \ndid not quite work. They are working to prevent North Korea from taking \nAmericans hostage? Well, that one did not quite work.\n  I am trying to think how these sanctions are working. And if they are \nso great on an international basis, why aren't we doing them on a \ndomestic basis, for us toward North Korea? I am having difficulty. \nMaybe they are working for us to prevent North Korea from associating \nwith the military junta in Myanmar. Wait a minute, that was in the news \nyesterday, that North Korea is working to provide the military junta in \nMyanmar with weapons and possibly nuclear weapons that the Secretary of \nState, Secretary Clinton, is talking about now happening. Well, maybe \nit prevented--well, I guess it did not quite prevent that.\n  I am trying to figure out how the sanctions have worked at all. I \nthought it was a mistake when the Bush administration delisted them \nfrom the terrorist list in a negotiation of the six-party talks and \nsaid: OK, we will do this, and they do that, and then ended up doing \nnothing and, indeed, stepped up what they are doing more and more.\n  It seems to me very strange to suggest that the sanctions are \nworking. I respect my colleague from Massachusetts. He is a strong \nchairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. I do not see where they \nhave worked at all. I would ask my colleagues to examine: Do they \nbelieve that the sanctions to date have worked toward North Korea from \nthe United States? And when you examine the factual setting here, you \nhave to go: I don't think so. I don't think these have happened.\n  Plus, I am very concerned that the administration now is taking the \ntack of discussing an additional set of incentives to the North Korean \nregime to try to get them from proliferating further. This is an \ninteresting, hot-off-the-press article from yesterday: ``Obama \nAdministration Preparing Incentives Package for North Korea.''\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in \nthe Record after my full statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Reading from this article:\n\n       The Obama administration is consulting with allies on a new \n     ``comprehensive package'' of incentives--\n\n  Not sanctions; incentives--\n\n     aimed at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear \n     programs, senior U.S. officials confirmed Tuesday.\n       The officials, who were traveling with Secretary of State \n     Hillary Clinton in Thailand, told reporters that the package \n     is only in its early stages and will not be offered to North \n     Korea unless and until the allies sign off on it. Pyongyang \n     would also have to first take specific, concrete and \n     ``irreversible'' steps to begin destroying its arsenal of \n     nuclear weapons.\n\n  This is the third round of us giving incentives to North Korea not to \ndevelop nuclear weapons. It has not worked in the past. It is not going \nto work now. Why on Earth would we do something like this?\n  The Kerry amendment calls for a study. Studies are fine. But it \nactually delays the study that the State Department has already \npromised to me: that by the end of this month they will have a study \nout as to whether they are proliferating further weapons, that they \nshould be listed as a terrorist state.\n  The Kerry amendment says: 30 days after the enactment of this bill. \nEven if the bill gets through the floor this week, it has to go to \nconference, and it has to come back in front of this body. You are \nlooking, probably, at October, maybe early November, that this actually \ncomes back--this law--and then 30 days after that the report has to be \nissued. So we are looking at somewhere, maybe November, December, for \nthe report taking place, when the State Department has already told me \nthey will have their report out by the end of July. So this is actually \nslowing down the process, if we adopt this amendment.\n  And it calls for a report. I am sure Pyongyang is very concerned \nabout this report. But I do not think it is going to change any of the \nbehavior that is taking place. If we do not have a strong answer, as a \nmatter of fact, it is probably going to urge them to do something even \nfurther.\n  My colleagues are saying: Well, OK, you are being irresponsible in \nthis statement on this narrow category of whether they are doing \nanything with Hezbollah. It is a bipartisan amendment that I put \nforward with Senator Bayh, who wanted that provision in it.\n  There is a current CRS report that talks about North Korea supporting \nHezbollah, building bunkers, and supporting and helping that out. That \nis a current factual setting, and my colleague on the other side of the \naisle, Senator Bayh, has asked and pushed that this be in the overall \nbill.\n  I would ask my colleagues to look at this interesting definition of \n``international terrorism,'' as shown on this chart. This is a \ndefinition that is in U.S. statute on international terrorism. It \nappears to be written for North Korea and North Korea in mind.\n  It defines the term under (1)(A), and then under (B)--these are in \nthe alternative--(B) ``appear to be intended''--the actions of \n``international terrorism'' ``appear to be intended to intimidate or \ncoerce a civilian population''--that is what North Korea does and Kim \nJong Il's regime does--``to influence the policy of a government by\n\n[[Page S7844]]\n\nintimidation or coercion''--that is the flying of missiles over Japan, \nthat is the intimidation toward South Korea or the United States--``to \naffect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination, \nor kidnapping''--they have done kidnappings of Japanese citizens--``to \naffect the conduct of a government''--clearly trying to affect our \nconduct--(C) ``occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of \nthe United States.'' This is what North Korea is doing.\n  I would further point out to my colleagues that this is a sense of \nthe Senate. As to the Kerry amendment, with all due respect toward \nSenator Kerry, this is asking the administration to do a report and \nasking and directing the administration to take some steps. Ours is a \nsense of the Senate as to what the Senate thinks, and it is saying that \nthe Senate believes North Korea should be relisted as a state sponsor \nof terrorism.\n  I would ask my colleagues, in a commonsense review of what North \nKorea has done recently: Don't you think they qualify or, if they do \nnot, what country in the world would qualify as a state sponsor of \nterrorism if North Korea does not, with what it has done, what it has \ndone personally, what it has conducted with other countries, with \nSyria, with Myanmar, with these other rogue groups?\n  It is a sense of the Senate to state we believe North Korea is a \nstate sponsor of terrorism. It is bipartisan with Senator Bayh and \nmyself. It has a number of cosponsors on it. It actually would be \nproductive for us to say to North Korea, in a public way, we believe \nthey are acting like state sponsors of terrorism. I believe it would be \nactually counterproductive if this body were to say we think it should \nbe studied and a report issued. That is not going to be the sort of \nstrong action that would be understood at all by the government in \nPyongyang at this point in time.\n  With that, I would urge my colleagues to look at the Brownback-Bayh \namendment, to support it on its very sensible grounds--it is a sense of \nthe Senate--and to vote for the amendment.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder \nof our time.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                   [From FOXNews.com, July 21, 2009]\n\n   Obama Administration Preparing Incentives Package for North Korea\n\n                            (By James Rosen)\n\n       Bangkok.--The Obama administration is consulting with \n     allies on a new ``comprehensive package'' of incentives aimed \n     at persuading North Korea to abandon its nuclear programs, \n     senior U.S. officials confirmed Tuesday.\n       The officials, who are traveling with Secretary of State \n     Hillary Clinton in Thailand, told reporters that the package \n     is only in its early stages and will not be offered to North \n     Korea unless and until the allies sign off on it. Pyongyang \n     would also have to first take specific, concrete and \n     ``irreversible'' steps to begin destroying its arsenal of \n     nuclear weapons.\n       The aides said that the administration needs to see \n     concrete action. Mere assurances from North Korea that it \n     will take action in the future would not be enough to trigger \n     the presentation of the incentives package, they said.\n       The United States, though, has not yet conveyed to the \n     North Koreans what the ``irreversible'' steps might entail, \n     as Washington continues discussions with its allies in the \n     so-called Six Party Talks.\n       The aides, who work on North Korea policy for three \n     separate agencies in the U.S. government, portrayed the \n     development of the new package as the second track of a two-\n     track approach.\n       The first track consists of continued aggressive \n     enforcement, also in conjunction with other nations across \n     the globe, of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874--which \n     gives U.N. member states increased authority to interdict the \n     flow of weapons and possible nuclear material in and out of \n     North Korea.\n       The aides made clear they expect the two-track approach to \n     remain in place for the foreseeable future.\n       ``This is not going to be resolved in a couple of weeks,'' \n     one official said. ``This could be a sustained, substantial \n     effort that could go on quite a long time.''\n       The package of incentives would include some elements that \n     are ``familiar'' from the Six-Party talks, the officials \n     said, as well as new ones and some that differ in their \n     ``dimensions.''\n       The United States, China, Japan, South Korea and Russia are \n     the other participants in the long-running--and long-\n     stalled--Six-Party Talks aimed at persuading North Korea to \n     abandon its nuclear programs.\n       The emphasis on consultation with these other countries \n     derives, the officials said, from the perception among some \n     of them that the Bush administration did not adequately \n     confer with them prior to the removal of North Korea from \n     Washington's list of state sponsors of terrorism last year.\n       ``The Japanese do have anxieties about engagement of North \n     Korea,'' one official said.\n       The officials also echoed the ``growing concerns'' about \n     reports of a military relationship between North Korea and \n     Burma that Clinton voiced earlier Tuesday in a news \n     conference with Thailand's deputy prime minister.\n       ``It would be destabilizing for the region'' if such \n     reports were true, Clinton said, adding, ``It would pose a \n     direct threat to Burma's neighbors. And it is something, as a \n     treaty ally of Thailand, that we are taking very seriously.''\n       Briefing reporters after Clinton's news conference, the \n     senior officials said their concerns range from suspicions \n     that North Korea is supplying small arms to Burma to reports \n     of possible nuclear collaboration between the two countries. \n     Pressed on the nuclear question, the officials refused to \n     discuss classified intelligence data but noted North Korea's \n     history of proliferation with Syria. One aide said the \n     possibility of nuclear collaboration between Pyongyang and \n     Burma is ``one of those areas that we would like to know more \n     about.''\n       To that end, U.S. intelligence agencies are studying \n     recently published photographs purporting to show an \n     elaborate set of underground tunnels that North Korea has \n     built along Burma's border with Thailand. The officials said \n     they see ``some similarities'' between the tunnels in the \n     photographs and a network of underground tunnels in North \n     Korea, the existence of which the United States learned about \n     in the 1990s.\n       Both North Korea and Burma, a repressive military \n     dictatorship whose leaders have renamed the country Myanmar, \n     have been the target of broad sanctions by successive U.S. \n     administrations over the last decade.\n       Clinton said Tuesday she would like to see Washington \n     develop a ``more productive'' relationship with Burma, \n     starting with steps by the government to release political \n     prisoners and dissidents jailed there.\n       ``We are very much engaged with partners such as Thailand \n     and others in assessing and determining not only what is \n     going inside of Burma but also what we can do effectively to \n     change the direction and behavior of the Burmese \n     leadership,'' Clinton said.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I yield myself such time as I will use, and \nI will be very brief.\n  The Senator from Kansas just cited the Congressional Research Service \nreport in his statement about Hezbollah. I am reading from a memorandum \nfrom the President of the United States. This is the Presidential \nreport, certification, when he lifted the designation of North Korea. \nAnd he wrote--this is from the President--\n\n       Our review of intelligence community assessments indicates \n     there is no credible or sustained reporting at this time that \n     supports allegations (including as cited in recent reports by \n     the Congressional Research Service) that the DPRK has \n     provided direct or witting support for Hezbollah, Tamil \n     Tigers, or the Iranian Revolutionary Guard. Should we obtain \n     credible evidence of current DPRK support for international \n     terrorism at any time in the future, the Secretary could \n     again designate the DPRK a state sponsor of terrorism.\n\n  We have not received that evidence. We specifically request it. And \ncontrary to what the Senator just said, this does not delay the report. \nIt says: not later than 30 days after the passage. The report can come \nnext week. The report can come in answer to the Senator's request. We \nwould ask for that.\n  Let's be accurate in this designation. The President of the United \nStates said there is no credible evidence. And there is none to this \ndate. Our report asks for whether any currently exists. That is the way \nthe Senate ought to behave with respect to serious matters such as \nthis.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of the time to the distinguished \nchairman of the committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the language in the Kerry amendment does \none other thing relative to this report. It says if the United States \ndetermines that the Government of North Korea has indeed engaged in \nterrorist activities, then the Secretary of State shall ``immediately \nlist North Korea as a state sponsor of terrorism.'' So it requires a \nreport in not more than 30 days. That could come at any time. But it \nalso requires action if the Secretary of State makes the finding.\n  The last administration, the Bush administration, delisted North \nKorea. They found there was no credible evidence of state-supported \nterrorism. We are a government of laws. Our laws\n\n[[Page S7845]]\n\nprovide for a listing of countries that engage in terrorist activities \nor support terrorist activities. It does not provide for a listing of \ncountries that, no matter all of the other things they do which are so \nwrong, so bad, so objectionable to the international community, so \njustifiably producing sanctions and other kinds of diplomatic actions \nagainst them--regardless of those activities, unless they are a \nsupporter of terrorist acts, our laws do not provide that they be put \non the terrorist list. That is our law. That is what the Bush \nadministration was applying when they delisted North Korea.\n\n  North Korea is a country which engages in horrendous activities. That \nis not the issue. I don't know of anybody in this Senate who does not \nbelieve North Korea engages in repressive, authoritarian activities. I \ndon't know of anybody in this Senate who does not believe the North \nKorean leadership is reprehensible in the way it treats its citizens. \nThere is a long list of actions on the part of North Korea in terms of \nits pursuit of ballistic missiles, provocative actions it has taken of \nthe testing of nuclear devices, firing a series of missiles. It has \nclearly solidified its status as a pariah of the region and of the \ninternational community at large.\n  So the question isn't whether strong action should be taken. We \nshould take strong action which will be effective against the \ngovernment--not the people but the government--of North Korea. The \nKerry amendment lays out a course of action, exploring additional \nsanctions so that we can put additional power and leverage against the \nGovernment of North Korea, as well as requiring our administration to \nconsider whether the Government of North Korea should be listed again. \nAnd if so, if they find that under our law there is reason to put it \nback on the terrorist list, then they must, under the Kerry amendment, \ntake that step.\n  What the Kerry amendment avoids doing is what the Brownback amendment \ndoes in one part of the Brownback amendment, which is saying that the \nGovernment of North Korea should be on a list of terrorist states when \nthe last thing we have heard from an American administration was from \nthe Bush administration taking the North Korean Government off the list \nbecause they could not find credible evidence that the government took \nactions which would require it being placed on the list of terrorist \nstates.\n  So again, it seems to me that clearly our goals here are similar. I \nhad hoped we might be able to reach a consensus on common language, but \nso long as this body expresses itself very strongly, as the Kerry and \nLugar amendment does, it seems to me we will then have made an \nimportant statement to the Government of North Korea and at the same \ntime avoided taking a step which our laws do not provide for.\n  One of our arguments with North Korea is that they are lawless, they \nare a totalitarian government. Our government is a government of laws. \nWe have a law that provides for the listing of countries that support \nterrorist acts. The administration, after a long assessment, concluded \nthere was no credible evidence that North Korea engaged in the \nactivities which appropriately required it or appropriately permitted \nit to be listed on the terrorist state list and therefore removed it \nfrom that list. That is the last action by the administration.\n  By the way, being on that terrorist list did not change the actions \nor the activities of the Government of North Korea, in any event. I \nvery much support that terrorist list. I very much support it being \nkept up to date and being used appropriately. But I don't think we \nshould in any way kid ourselves as to whether being on that list is \ngoing to change the activities of North Korea.\n  We need other countries to support us in putting maximum pressure on \nNorth Korea. When we act lawfully--when we put sanctions on North \nKorea, working with other countries, we are acting lawfully. If we do \nnot abide by our own law which defines when a country will go on a \nterrorist list, we are setting the wrong example for the world, and it \nmakes it more difficult for us to obtain the kind of support from other \ncountries which we deserve in going after the abominable activities of \nthe Government of North Korea.\n  I don't know whether our side has any time left, but if we do, I \nreserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to ask several \nquestions of the Senator from Kansas.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, has the Senator from Kansas detected any \nchange in North Korean behavior since the imposition of sanctions by \nthe United Nations?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Yes. They have taken more provocative actions rather \nthan less provocative actions since the imposition of the U.S. \nsanctions, if not more.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Including launching missiles on the Fourth of July.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. It is a strange day they would pick, the Fourth of \nJuly, but they did.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it true that there is evidence that North Koreans \nwere involved in the construction of a nuclear facility in Syria which \nthe Israelis felt was enough of a threat to their national security \nthat they destroyed it?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Absolutely, abundant evidence, and it was amazing how \nquiet the world community was for a long period of time, because I \nguess they didn't want it known that the North Koreans did built that \nfacility or that it was in Syria.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Isn't it true that there is a published news report that \nNorth Korea and Iran have worked together in the development of nuclear \nweapons and nuclear technology, and if Iran acquires that capability, \nit certainly ratchets up the tensions between Iran and Israel?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Published reports, and the missile technology the \nIranians use is built off of the No-dong system of the North Koreans.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The latest information in the last few days is that there \nis cooperation between North Korea and Myanmar, better known to some of \nus as Burma, one of the real rogue nations of the world.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. There is.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So if that North Korean ship, which was shadowed for a \nperiod of time by the U.S. Navy, had gone into port in Myanmar, do you \nthink there is any likelihood the Government of Myanmar would have \ncomplied with the U.N. resolution that required that ship to be \ninspected by ``port authorities''?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Myanmar has not cooperated with anything the United \nNations has directed to date. I don't know why they would cooperate \nwith anything such as that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. Of course, maybe North Korea, when \nwe look at it with a very fine definition of terrorism--from the recent \nWashington Post article about 200,000 people in the most horrible \nprison conditions in the world perhaps would argue that we should do \nwhatever we can--short, obviously, of any military action--to try to \nsee that the North Korean regime acts at least in some civilized \nfashion.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I think they should.\n  Mr. President, I would point out, if I could, to my colleagues as \nwell--if I could have the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am frustrated on this topic. I would presume the \nchairman--I know the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee is \nfrustrated, along with the chairman of the Armed Services Committee. I \nhave worked too long with the refugees and the people in the gulag and \npeople trying to get out of North Korea for us to now back up and say: \nOK, we want a report. These folks are dying. They are in a gulag the \nlikes of which was in the Soviet era. This has been published and it is \nall available to us and we want a report. I understand people don't \nwant to go this far, but this is very frustrating. If you were in one \nof those situations--and people track what comes out of the Senate, \njust as in the Soviet gulag they tracked what came out of here then--it \nwould be like saying to them: Well, we are not that concerned about \nyou; whereas, if we take strong action such as what I am saying, it \ndoes give them hope. That is what I am\n\n[[Page S7846]]\n\nasking us to do. I think it is very responsible, and it is a sense of \nthe Senate, what we are asking them to do. That is what is at the root \nof this.\n\n  The chairman of the Armed Services Committee says: Well, they were \ndelisted by the last administration. And they certainly were, but they \nwere not removed from that list because they stopped sponsoring \nterrorism. The regime was delisted in order to entice them to dismantle \ntheir weapons of mass destruction program. It was a six-party talk \nnegotiation, and that didn't work, just as the prior negotiations on \nweapons of mass destruction didn't work. Why should we continue the \nproblem if that is the case?\n  Mr. KERRY. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I am happy to yield for a question.\n  Mr. KERRY. Is the Senator suggesting that the President of the United \nStates in his letter of certification misinformed the American people \nand the Senate?\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. What I am suggesting is that this was part of a \nnegotiation and that they have wide latitude. In fact, if I may \ncontinue my answer for my colleague who has asked a very pertinent \nquestion on this issue and who is very familiar with the six-party \ntalks, as I am partially, somewhat familiar with the six-party talks, \nthese have been talks going on for a long period of time. The North \nKoreans hate being listed as a state sponsor of terrorism. Their big \npush was to be delisted. The administration has broad authority. It has \nbroad abilities to be able to interpret this, and they said: OK, we are \ngoing to be able to do this, and we will find some room in here to \ninterpret it this way, in exchange for you guys stopping your weapons \nof mass destruction, which did not happen.\n  I am saying that what we should do now is not continue with that \nmistake. What I am saying we should do now is, let's call a spade a \nspade in this situation. This is a terrorist nation. The Senator from \nMassachusetts knows that. He knows what is taking place and what they \nare doing. They are one of the lead sponsors of terrorist activities in \narming, bad, rogue regimes around the world, and the Senator knows \nthat. What we should do is call that what it is in this Senate and not \ncall for just a report.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, if the Senator will further yield, does the \nSenator from Kansas believe this language:\n\n       Our review of intelligence community assessments indicates \n     there is no credible or sustained reporting at this time that \n     supports allegations they have provided direct support--\n\n  Et cetera--\n\n     and should we have credible evidence of international \n     terrorism at any time in the future--\n\n  The President clearly----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  All time has expired.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on amendment \nNo. 1761.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I have a parliamentary inquiry, if I \ncould. Have the yeas and nays been ordered on both amendments?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been ordered on \namendment No. 1761.\n  The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on both \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered on both amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1761.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nByrd), the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy), and the Senator \nfrom Maryland (Ms. Mikulski) are necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 66, nays 31, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 238 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--66\n\n     Akaka\n     Alexander\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Collins\n     Conrad\n     Corker\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Lugar\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Voinovich\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--31\n\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--3\n\n     Byrd\n     Kennedy\n     Mikulski\n  The amendment (No. 1761) was agreed to.\n  Mr. KERRY. I move to reconsider the vote, and I move to lay that \nmotion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1597\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 1597, offered by the Senator from Kansas. Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask for an ``aye'' vote on this \namendment even if people voted for the Kerry amendment. It was \ncritically important during the Soviet gulag days that the people in \nthe gulags knew we cared and that we were focused on them. If we vote \nto say we are going to issue a report, that is fine. But it doesn't say \nmuch to people in a gulag. If we vote to say it is the sense of the \nSenate that North Korea is a state sponsor of terrorism, it is a strong \nmessage. It gives hope to people who don't have hope today.\n  Who in this body doubts that North Korea is a state sponsor of \nterrorism? With nuclear weapons, missiles being launched, a connection \nwith Myanmar--with all these things taking place today, who can doubt \nthat they are a terrorist country?\n  I urge my colleagues, even those who supported the Kerry amendment, \nto also vote for this one to send the message that North Korea is a \nstate sponsor of terrorism and to send a message of hope to those in \nthe North Korean gulags.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it would be both inconsistent and \ninappropriate to vote aye on both amendments for a couple of reasons. \nFirst of all, the amendment we just passed with 66 votes mandates that \nno later than 30 days after this is passed--it could happen next week, \nin 3 weeks--we are mandating the report from the administration with \nrespect to whether there is evidence at this time of North Korea \nactually aiding or abetting or being a terrorist state.\n  The most recent finding of the intelligence community says no. The \nPresident of the United States, George Bush, certified to us when he \ndecertified them as a terrorist state that they were not engaged in any \nactivities of aiding and abetting terrorism at that time in the world. \nThere is no evidence within the intelligence community at this moment \nin time that says so.\n  The Brownback amendment states that there is. So it is wrong, and it \nwould be inappropriate for the Senate to base designating North Korea \nas a terrorist state on findings that do not exist, as well as doing so \nat a time when we are negotiating to get the release of two young \njournalists. This would be a completely inappropriate measure by the \nSenate at this time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to amendment No. \n1597. The yeas and nays have been ordered. The clerk will call the \nroll.\n\n[[Page S7847]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Parliamentary inquiry.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, after the conclusion of this vote, is there \nany pending amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will not be.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, to let folks know, I intend to ask for a \nquorum call immediately following this vote to try to work out an \norderly way to proceed on amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that, first, there \nbe a period of morning business of 5 minutes, so Senator Brown can \nspeak as in morning business. Then we proceed to consideration of the \namendment of Senator Cardin, amendment No. 1763. After the disposition \nof that amendment, that the Senator Kyl amendment, No. 1760, be in \norder. There may or may not be a second-degree amendment to that of \nSenator Kyl--that it be in order if there is a second-degree amendment. \nAfter the disposition of the amendment of Senator Kyl and the second-\ndegree amendment thereto, we then proceed--presumably it would be in \nthe morning--to an amendment by Senator Lieberman, No. 1744, with a 1-\nhour time agreement and a side-by-side amendment or a second-degree \namendment of Senator Bayh relative to the--relevant to the Lieberman \namendment, which would also have a 1-hour time agreement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object and I will \nnot object, I say in the case of the amendment of Senator Cardin, there \nis no objection on this side. We would be glad to agree to a 15-minute \ntime agreement, if that is agreeable.\n  Mr. LEVIN. That presumably might be adopted without a rollcall as \nwell.\n  Mr. President, let me revise my unanimous consent request for Senator \nCardin's amendment having a 15-minute time agreement, that there not be \na time agreement set yet on the Lieberman amendment No. 1744 and the \nBayh second-degree amendment or side-by-side amendment to it because \napparently we could not get that, for some reason I don't understand or \nknow. I don't understand the reason or the objection.\n  One other correction. The Cardin amendment is No. 1475, not No. 1763.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I wonder, I know the bill managers have many \nchallenges, but I wonder if they contemplate that I would have the \nopportunity to call up Sessions amendments Nos. 1657 and 1533 before we \ngo too far in this process.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There are a number of people who have asked to be put in \nline at this point. We have been unable to go beyond where we are. That \ntook enough time. We thought, if we went any further, it would be \nimpossible to get this unanimous consent done because there are many \npeople who are in the same position as our friend from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I am not delaying, of course. We want to see this bill \nmove forward. But I do have two amendments I care about. Maybe I can \ntalk to the chairman in a little bit. I thank him for his courtesy. I \nwill not object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. In response to the Senator from Alabama, I will do \neverything I can to get his amendment in order. Senator Isakson and \nSenator Burr and Senator Bond and others have all come up and said they \nwant their amendments in line. I think we have to have some kind of \nconsultation on our side to establish a priority.\n  I also would like to point out, the amendment of Senator Sessions, I \nbelieve, is on missile defense, a very important amendment.\n  I also think, in full disclosure, the majority leader, I am told, \nwill file cloture tonight, which will then, at some point, rule out \nnongermane amendments. But I will do everything I can to get Senator \nSessions' amendment up, in order. But we have been following a process, \nas I am sure the Senator from Alabama knows, of one side's amendment \nand then the other side's amendment, going back and forth.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. The missile defense amendment is one that is a sense-\nof-the-Senate amendment that Senator Lieberman is offering now. That \nwas not the two I referred to. I agree with Senator McCain that sense \nof the Senate definitely needs a vote. It is an important issue.\n  The other two amendments I have I hope also can be considered. I will \nbe pleased to talk with the Senator and his staff about it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to the request? Without \nobjection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer and thank Senator Sessions \nas well. As I understand it, the amendments Senator Sessions was \nreferring to were amendments relating to al-Qaida; am I correct?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. That is correct.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, the progress of this country does not and \nhas not come easily. Passage of the Civil Rights Act was not easy. \nPassage of the Voting Rights Act was not easy. Passage of the Social \nSecurity Act was not easy. The Fair Housing Act, that was not easy. \nPassage of Medicare and Medicaid was not easy.\n  This year, passage of health care reform will not be easy. Time and \ntime again, decade after decade, special interests--the drug companies, \nthe insurance companies, medical interests--have delayed and denied and \ndestroyed meaningful health care reform.\n  In recent weeks and months, opponents have ramped up their efforts to \nderail health care reform, saying you have to slow down but, as with \nother historic legislative victories, we must find a path forward.\n\n[[Page S7848]]\n\n  Last week, the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee found a path forward that works for American families and \nbusinesses.\n  The HELP health reform legislation is designed to lower costs, \nprovide more coverage choices, and ensure that Americans have insurance \nthey can count on.\n  This legislation would give every American access to quality, \naffordable, and flexible health insurance.\n  This legislation would reduce costs by decreasing fraud, abuse, and \nmedical errors while promoting best practices and prevention and \nwellness initiatives.\n  It would provide insurance security for people who lose their job, \ntheir coverage, or maybe their patience with an insurer who has let \nthem down.\n  And, this legislation gives Americans more health care choices.\n  The public option in our legislation--the Community Health Insurance \nOption--is a national insurance program modeled after coverage offered \nto Members of Congress.\n  A strong public option would ensure Americans in every State have \ninsurance choices they can trust.\n  It would increase price competition in the health insurance market to \ndrive premiums down.\n  And a strong public option would set a standard for quality coverage \nthat gives private insurers a benchmark and Americans new options.\n  Let's face it. There is nothing like good old fashioned competition \nto keep insurers honest.\n  Under our bill, no longer would insurers be able to hide behind \npreexisting conditions, health history, age, gender, or race to deny \ncoverage and delay care for patients.\n  Done right, health reform represents a real opportunity to expand \naccess to quality, affordable coverage for all Americans, like Robert \nand Carol of Bryan, OH, in Williams County, northwest Ohio.\n  Carol is a social worker who works for a nonprofit drug, alcohol, and \nmental health agency. Her husband Robert, a self employed barber, had \nhis first bout with cancer in 2003 and is facing, just days from now, \nanother cancer surgery.\n  Robert and Carol wrote to me that they depleted their life savings to \ncover cancer treatments and maintain coverage to monitor cancer \nremission.\n  Carol wants Members in this Body to let her husband fight for his \nlife, not fight with insurance companies.\n  Joseph, in Summit County, operates a small land surveying business \nthat is struggling to pay health insurance premiums.\n  After being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 2004, Joseph wrote \nto me that it is impossible for his business to shop around for more \naffordable health coverage because of his preexisting condition.\n  The HELP Committee's Affordable Health Choices Act represents a \nvictory for the millions of American families and business owners, like \nJoseph, whose health care costs have soared out of control.\n  It is a victory for the 46 million uninsured Americans and millions \nmore underinsured, those whose financial security is at risk day in and \nday out because of health care costs.\n  And it is a victory for U.S. taxpayers.\n  If we are going to get a grip on health spending, we have got to \nsqueeze out waste, needless redtape, and costly medical errors.\n  We have to give private insurers a reason to charge reasonable \npremiums, not grossly inflated ones.\n  I am proud that the President is touring the Cleveland Clinic \ntomorrow.\n  Cutting edge health systems like the Cleveland Clinic University \nHospitals, and the Metro Health System all in Cleveland, have helped to \ngive Ohio its reputation as a leader in high quality health care.\n  Our work will not be done until Ohioans like 73-year-old Bert from \nAllen County can afford the retirement he deserves.\n  Bert wrote to me that he cannot afford to retire, despite suffering a \nheart attack last year.\n  He described how exorbitant prescription drug costs leave the \nunacceptable choice between his medication or his wife's medication. \nBut not both.\n  Bert wrote to me, ``God help us should anything happen to my wife \nmedically. We will, no doubt, lose everything we have worked all of our \nlives for.''\n  Our work cannot be done until Bert, Joseph, Robert, and Carol, and \nevery American live in a Nation with an affordable, effective, and \ninclusive health care system.\n  Our work will not be done until crucial national priorities are no \nlonger crowded out by health care spending.\n  Our work will not be done until exploding health care costs no longer \ncut into family budgets, no longer weigh down businesses, and no longer \ndrain tax dollars from local, State, and Federal budgets.\n  It will not be easy, but as history demonstrates the important \nchanges rarely are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, the unanimous consent request indicated \nthat there would be 15 minutes on the Cardin amendment, No. 1475. I am \nwondering if my friend from Arizona might listen to this as well. On \nSenator Cardin's amendment, we did not say ``equally divided.'' We are \nnot sure whether there is opposition to it. If there is, we should now \nsay ``equally divided.'' If not, Senator Cardin only needs about 5 to \n10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am not sure anyone wants to challenge Senator Cardin's \neloquence.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In that case, I ask unanimous consent we say ``equally \ndivided'' in case anyone changes their mind.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1475\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I call up amendment No. 1475 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1475.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To require the Secretary of Defense to report on the numbers \n and percentages of troops that have served or are serving in Iraq and \nAfghanistan who have been prescribed antidepressants or drugs to treat \n                                anxiety)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title VII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 724. PRESCRIPTION OF ANTIDEPRESSANTS FOR TROOPS SERVING \n                   IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       (a) Report.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than June 30, 2010, and annually \n     thereafter until June 30, 2015, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the prescription of \n     antidepressants and drugs to treat anxiety for troops serving \n     in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n       (2) Content.--The report required under paragraph (1) shall \n     include--\n       (A) the numbers and percentages of troops that have served \n     or are serving in Iraq and Afghanistan since January 1, 2005, \n     who have been prescribed antidepressants or drugs to treat \n     anxiety, including psychotropic drugs such as Selective \n     Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs); and\n       (B) the policies and patient management practices of the \n     Department of Defense with respect to the prescription of \n     such drugs.\n       (b) National Institute of Mental Health Study.--\n       (1) Study.--The National Institute of Mental Health shall \n     conduct a study on the potential relationship between the \n     increased number of suicides and attempted suicides by \n     members of the Armed Forces and the increased number of \n     antidepressants, drugs to treat anxiety, other psychotropics, \n     and other behavior modifying prescription medications being \n     prescribed, including any combination or interactions of such \n     prescriptions. The Department of Defense shall immediately \n     make available to the National Institute of Mental Health all \n     data necessary to complete the study.\n       (2) Report on findings.--Not later than two years after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense \n     shall submit to Congress a report on the findings of the \n     study conducted pursuant to paragraph (1).\n  Mr. CARDIN. I want to thank Senators Levin and McCain for their help \nin allowing me to bring forward this amendment. This amendment is an \nimportant amendment which deals with the increasing numbers of suicides \nand attempted suicides by the young men and women serving in the U.S. \nmilitary.\n  We have not only seen each month an increased number of suicides and \nattempted suicides, but recently we saw\n\n[[Page S7849]]\n\nthe killing of five of our servicemembers when a fellow soldier \nallegedly opened fire inside a mental health clinic at Camp Liberty in \nIraq.\n  The purpose of this amendment is for the Department of Defense to \ngive us information on the type of medications that are being \nprescribed so we can get a better handle on whether there is more that \nwe can do in order to protect our young men and women who are serving \nour Nation.\n  Yesterday, we did something to help in approving the Lieberman \namendment. The Lieberman amendment increased our force levels, our \nauthorized force levels. One of the suspected reasons suicides and \nattempted suicides are increasing is the number of deployments, the \nlength of deployments, and the fact that we do not have enough \npersonnel in order to do the normal military responsibilities so that \nwe have to continue to call up again our young people for renewed \ndeployments. That will certainly help.\n  This Congress has passed significant increases in funds for mental \nhealth services for our service personnel. That will clearly help. But \none thing we should all be concerned about is that there are more and \nmore of our soldiers who are using prescription antidepressant drugs, \nSSRIs, and we are not clear as to whether they are under appropriate \nmedical supervision. I say that because these SSRIs take several weeks \nbefore they reach their full potential as far as blocking depression or \ndealing with the causes of depression. During that period of time, \nparticularly if they are in the age group of 18 to 24--many are in that \nage group--they are susceptible to increased thoughts of suicide.\n  Many of our service people are changing from location to location. \nThey may very well be in the theater of battle. They may not be able to \nget the proper type of supervision. So we are concerned about whether \nthe use of these drugs is being appropriately administered, but we do \nnot have the facts; we do not have the information. We need to get that \ninformation.\n  There have been surveys which have shown that as many as 12 percent \nof those who are serving in Iraq and 17 percent of those who are \nserving in Afghanistan are using some form of prescribed antidepressant \nor sleeping pills in order to deal with their needs. That would equal \n20,000 of our service personnel using prescription medicines or \nantidepressants or sleep medicines. We need to get the information.\n  My amendment is simple. My amendment says starting in June of 2010 \nand through 2015, the Department of Defense will make available to \nCongress the information on the number of personnel receiving these \nantidepressant drugs. It is done in a generic sense; therefore, there \nis no individual information about any service personnel. We protect \ntheir individual privacy as we have under HIPAA. This is absolutely \nprotected. There is no stigma attached at all to this survey.\n  I think we have tried to deal with the legitimate concerns that have \nbeen raised. I hope my colleagues would agree that this is an important \nmatter that should be included in our DOD authorization. I talked about \nit yesterday. I am glad now that I had the opportunity to, in fact, \noffer this amendment.\n  With that, if there is no one interested in speaking in opposition, I \nam prepared to yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I move to lay that motion upon the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1760\n\n  Mr. KYL. What I am going to do now is seek to get an amendment which \nis filed pending. The other side will want to offer a side-by-side \namendment. I understand there may be an opportunity to debate some of \nthis tonight. Some of the other debate may have to be tomorrow, and \nthat is fine. But at this point, is there an amendment pending?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is not an amendment pending.\n  Mr. KYL. I call up amendment No. 1760 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     McConnell, Mr. McCain, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Sessions, Mr. Graham, \n     Mr. Vitter, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Risch, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Barrasso, \n     Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Wicker, proposes an amendment numbered \n     1760.\n\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To pursue United States objectives in bilateral arms control \n                      with the Russian Federation)\n\n       At the end of title XII, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1232. LIMITATION ON FUNDS TO IMPLEMENT REDUCTIONS IN THE \n                   STRATEGIC NUCLEAR FORCES OF THE UNITED STATES \n                   PURSUANT TO ANY TREATY OR OTHER AGREEMENT WITH \n                   THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the Joint Statement by President Dmitriy Medvedev of \n     the Russian Federation and President Barack Obama of the \n     United States of America after their meeting in London, \n     England on April 1, 2009, the two Presidents agreed ``to \n     pursue new and verifiable reductions in our strategic \n     offensive arsenals in a step-by-step process, beginning by \n     replacing the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new, \n     legally-binding treaty''.\n       (2) At that meeting, the two Presidents instructed their \n     negotiators to reach an agreement that ``will mutually \n     enhance the security of the Parties and predictability and \n     stability in strategic offensive forces, and will include \n     effective verification measures drawn from the experience of \n     the Parties in implementing the START Treaty''.\n       (3) Subsequently, on April 5, 2009, in a speech in Prague, \n     the Czech Republic, President Obama proclaimed, ``Iran's \n     nuclear and ballistic missile activity poses a real threat, \n     not just to the United States, but to Iran's neighbors and \n     our allies. The Czech Republic and Poland have been \n     courageous in agreeing to host a defense against these \n     missiles. As long as the threat from Iran persists, we will \n     go forward with a missile defense system that is cost-\n     effective and proven.''\n       (4) President Obama also said, ``As long as these [nuclear] \n     weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure \n     and effective arsenal to deter any adversary, and guarantee \n     that defense to our allies, including the Czech Republic. But \n     we will begin the work of reducing our arsenal.''\n       (b) Limitation.--Funds authorized to be appropriated by \n     this Act or otherwise made available to the Department of \n     Defense for fiscal year 2010 may not be obligated or expended \n     to implement reductions in the strategic nuclear forces of \n     the United States pursuant to any treaty or other agreement \n     entered into between the United States and the Russian \n     Federation on strategic nuclear forces after the date of \n     enactment of this Act unless the President certifies to \n     Congress that--\n       (1) the treaty or other agreement provides for sufficient \n     mechanisms to verify compliance with the treaty or agreement;\n       (2) the treaty or other agreement does not place \n     limitations on the ballistic missile defense systems, space \n     capabilities, or advanced conventional weapons of the United \n     States; and\n       (3) the fiscal year 2011 budget request for programs of the \n     Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security \n     Administration will be sufficiently funded--\n       (A) to maintain the reliability, safety, and security of \n     the remaining strategic nuclear forces of the United States; \n     and\n       (B) to modernize and refurbish the nuclear weapons complex.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report on the \n     stockpiles of strategic and nonstrategic weapons of the \n     United States and the Russian Federation.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Advanced conventional weapons.--The term ``advanced \n     conventional weapons'' means any advanced weapons system that \n     has been specifically designed not to carry a nuclear \n     payload.\n       (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the following \n     committees:\n       (A) The Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.\n       (B) The Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate.\n\n[[Page S7850]]\n\n  Mr. KYL. If there are others who wish the floor, I would be happy to \naccede to their wishes so that I can come back tomorrow and discuss it \nfurther.\n  This is identical to an amendment that was unanimously adopted by the \nHouse of Representatives in their version of the Defense authorization \nbill. So I would hope that on both sides of the aisle this should not \nbe particularly controversial.\n  It has to do with the START negotiations, the negotiation the \nadministration is engaged in with the Russians right now on the number \nof warheads and delivery vehicles that both Russia and the United \nStates will field in the next many years.\n  Whatever those numbers are, whatever the agreement is, that treaty \nwill be presented to the Senate later this year. Presumably we will act \non it either late this year or early next year.\n  All this amendment does is say that during the 7 years when the START \nTreaty is implemented, the United States needs to do certain things. We \nwant to make sure the treaty is verifiable. That is something we all \nagree with. We need to ensure that our missile defenses are protected; \nthat our conventional strike capability is protected, that is, our \nsubmarines and bombers that deliver conventional weapons, for example, \nand, very importantly, we want to make sure the modernization program \nfor our nuclear weapons complex and the weapons themselves, the \nmodernization program that was recommended by the bipartisan Perry-\nSchlesinger Commission begins to be implemented.\n  In fact, this amendment does not identify exactly what that program \nis. It does not say it has to be a particular amount of money or \ndescribe the details of it. But it does say we need to get a \nmodernization program underway.\n  The point of this is to simply acknowledge the obvious; which is, as \nwe begin to reduce the number of warheads and delivery vehicles in our \nstrategic nuclear deterrent, we need to make more and more sure what we \nhave works and works well.\n  It is an aging stockpile. The Perry-Schlesinger Commission noted that \nthere is a lot of work that needs to be done to bring these weapons up \nto modern conditions to maintain them appropriately to ensure they are \nsafe and reliable. The work that has to be done on that is going to \ntake some time and cost some money.\n  So it makes sense to put Congress on record with the administration \nas insisting that we begin this process right away. The amendment does \nnot say this, but my strong recommendation to the administration is, \nsince they are going to begin putting the budget for fiscal year 2011 \ntogether starting in another month or two, that they need to be working \nnow on what their budget recommendations for 2011 are for the \nmodernization of our nuclear complex and stockpile.\n  So what this amendment would do is to say, as the START Treaty is \nimplemented, whatever that treaty is, it does not bind the \nadministration in terms of what it negotiates, whatever it is, that \nthat money cannot be spent on that until these other conditions are met \nas well.\n  I hope that since this received a unanimous endorsement in the House, \nit would not be particularly controversial on this side. I would just \nreiterate one final time, this does not bind our negotiators at all. It \ndoes not tell the negotiators what they can and cannot negotiate with \nthe Russians.\n  What it says is, once they have negotiated whatever they have, then \nwe need to start a process of modernizing our nuclear weapons program \nand stockpile. I think that is something, since it was the unanimous \nrecommendation of the Perry-Schlesinger Commission, that we ought to be \nable to agree upon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, under the existing unanimous consent \nagreement, the Lieberman amendment that would be in order after the \ndisposition of the Kyl amendment was listed as being amendment 1744. \nThe correct number is 1627. I ask unanimous consent that the consent \nagreement be so modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I rise to make a few remarks in support \nof the Kyl amendment. This amendment relates to the possible follow-on \nagreement to the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, so-called START. \nThe Joint Understanding issued at the recent Moscow summit suggests the \nUnited States and Russian Federation are well on their way toward \ncompleting a new agreement, perhaps even before the end of this year. \nRather than wait until the agreement is signed and submitted to the \nSenate for the Senate's consent, this amendment provides an opportunity \nfor the Senate to give its advice before the treaty's provisions are \nagreed to. It reflects this Senator's desire to see a follow-on treaty \nthat does not weaken our nuclear deterrent or place in doubt our \nnuclear guarantee to our allies and partners who depend on it.\n  It also reflects a caveat that any future agreement should not limit \nU.S. missile defense capabilities or U.S. capabilities for long-range \nconventional strike. Finally, this amendment makes clear that any \nreductions in our nuclear stockpile should be supported by long-range \nplans to modernize our aging nuclear deterrent and supporting \ninfrastructure. This is important. We have had testimony in the Armed \nServices Committee on a number of occasions from our top military \ncommanders who deal with this issue. They say continued reductions of \nnuclear weapons must be accompanied by a modernization of the limited \nnumber we have left. When we do that, we can make them safer and far \nmore difficult for anyone who were to nefariously obtain them to \nutilize and protect them and make them more reliable.\n  Most, if not all, would agree that it is important to ensure that the \nverification and monitoring provisions of the START Treaty of 1991 not \nbe allowed to lapse come December 6.\n  While there are a number of ways to handle this, either by extending \nthe current agreement or drafting a new agreement dealing specifically \nwith these matters, the United States and Russia have chosen the more \nambitious goal of a new treaty that would make further reductions in \nthe current nuclear stockpiles which are today at the lowest levels \nsince the Cold War. We have about 2,200 warheads today. We had 6,000 \nnot too many years ago. We have reduced those numbers. I support that.\n  The rush to complete an agreement before START expires in December \nhas led the United States to agree to provisions in the Joint \nUnderstanding that potentially may not be in our best interest. It is \nnot a critical thing that we reach a firm agreement by the end of \nDecember. We should not allow the Russians to put us in a position \nwhere we are so desperate to reach an agreement by the end of the year \nthat we would reach a bad agreement. At the very least, it can be said \nthat these matters have not sufficiently been analyzed to know whether \nthey are in our interest.\n  First, with respect to the central limits to be enshrined in a new \nagreement, the two sides agreed to warhead limits of between 1,500 and \n1,675 warheads, and limits on the number of strategic nuclear delivery \nvehicles to somewhere between 500 and 1,100. That is quite a wide \nrange. The final number is to be negotiated by the parties. The Senate \nhas yet to see the analytical basis for the levels agreed to in the \nJoint Understanding which means we are not off to a good start in the \nadvice and consent process.\n  Today the United States deploys approximately 2,200 operational \nnuclear warheads on some 900 delivery vehicles.\n\n[[Page S7851]]\n\nThese are our ICBM missiles, our SLBMs, and bombers. Whether it is \nprudent to go below these numbers depends on some important \nconsiderations. To take that down to 500 would be a dramatic reduction \nof our delivery systems. Whether it is prudent to go below these \nnumbers that we currently have depends on some important \nconsiderations, not the least of which is the impact on the size and \nshape of the U.S. nuclear TRIAD, the ICBMs, the submarine-launched \nmissiles, and our bomber fleet; our ability to extend credible nuclear \nguarantees to our allies; and whether lower levels provide an incentive \nto other nuclear powers to build up their forces so they can be a peer \ncompetitor with the United States and Russia.\n  I will have more to say on this in the future. Suffice it to say that \nI have yet to hear a convincing strategic rationale that would justify \ngoing this low. Indeed, I believe the burden of proof will be on those \nwho think it is necessary to continue to reduce U.S. nuclear force \nlevels that are today but a fraction of what they used to be. My major \nconcern, however, is language in the Joint Understanding which seems to \nsuggest the two sides may establish limitations on U.S. missile defense \nand long-range conventional strategic strike capabilities. In other \nwords, an agreement could well involve a limitation, either in part of \nthe treaty or a corollary agreement, to limit our national missile \ndefense capabilities. That is a dangerous and unwise linkage.\n  For example, the Joint Understanding states there will be a provision \n``on the interrelationship of strategic offensive and strategic \ndefensive arms.'' I find this troubling because we have made it clear \nto the Russians that our missile defense capabilities are not directed \nat, nor are they capable of being an effective defense against, massive \nRussian capabilities. We only have a plan to put in 44 missiles in the \nUnited States and 10 in Europe. That is a fraction of the capacity that \nthe Russians have today. Instead we build missile defenses to address a \nthreat to the United States and its allies posed by rogue nations such \nas North Korea and Iran. That is what 40 missiles in Alaska and \nCalifornia can do. That is what 10 in Europe could do. It can't defend \nagainst massive Russian delivery systems. It has no capability of doing \nthat. They know it. So why do they object?\n  What do we mean, as we carry out this discussion, by the term \n``strategic defensive arms''? How does one distinguish between a \nstrategic and nonstrategic missile defense system? Is the United States \nSM-3 missile, which has some capability against long-range North Korean \nmissiles, considered a strategic missile defense system? It is best not \nto get into negotiations that could eventually constrain our ability to \nbuild missile defenses against countries such as Iran and North Korea. \nTo be sure, any such limitations would make a START follow-on agreement \ndead on arrival in the Senate. I don't believe the Senate would pass \nsuch an agreement.\n  The Joint Understanding also contains--between the Obama \nadministration and Russia--a provision addressing the impact on \nstrategic stability of strategic missiles in a nonnuclear \nconfiguration. This apparently is an attempt by Russia to constrain the \nability of the United States to field long-range strike systems armed \nwith conventional warheads, nonnuclear warheads.\n  Conventionally armed long-range strike systems, also known as \n``prompt global strike,'' are consistent with a move by both countries \nto place less reliance on nuclear weapons for deterrence. Prompt global \nstrike would allow the United States to launch a missile without a \nnuclear weapon that could take out a dangerous threat anywhere around \nthe world in a very prompt fashion. We have debated that over the years \nin the Senate.\n  Finally, the amendment by Senator Kyl would send a strong message to \nthe administration that a START follow-on agreement must be supported \nat the same time it is submitted to the Senate for ratification by a \nlong-term program to modernize the remaining nuclear forces of the \nUnited States, including warheads, delivery systems, and infrastructure \nneeded to support both. Such a modernization is called for by the \nCongressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United States \nand by the Secretary of Defense, Secretary Gates, who last October \nsaid:\n\n       There is absolutely no way we can maintain a credible \n     deterrent and reduce the number of weapons in our stockpile \n     without resorting to testing our stockpile or pursuing a \n     modernization program.\n\n  Our colleagues don't want us to test. They think this would be a bad \nexample to Iran and North Korea. If we did that, somehow they might be \nmore likely to want to test. I don't think it will have any impact on \nthose rogue nations. The Secretary of Defense is saying that if we \ndon't continue testing, we need to modernize the weapons system we \nhave. If we continue to draw down the number, these 40, 50-year-old \nweapons need to be modernized. They need to be reliable. This Senator \nwill condition his support for a START follow-on agreement upon a \nserious commitment by the administration to modernize our nuclear \ndeterrent which remains necessary to protect the United States and our \nallies against threats to our vital interests.\n  I wish to note a similar version of this amendment was adopted \nunanimously by the House on their version of the national Defense \nauthorization bill. I commend Senator Kyl for offering it and note the \nimportance of sending a clear message to the administration and to our \nallies and to Russia regarding our views on the ongoing START follow-up \nnegotiations.\n  I wish to say what is obvious to all of us who have been here a long \ntime. Senator Kyl is a real patriot who has maintained a deep interest \nin these issues throughout his career. This is a well-thought-out, \nwell-conceived amendment that is wise for our Senate to pass. I believe \nwe will. I think if my colleagues will find the time to review it and \nthink it through, they will be convinced this is a wise step for us to \ntake at this time so we don't end up with misunderstanding later on \nwhen a treaty plops down in the Senate that has a lot of problems for a \nhost of Senators.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON AIRFARES FOR MEMBERS OF THE \n                   ARMED FORCES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The Armed Forces is comprised of over 1,450,000 active-\n     duty members from every State and territory of the United \n     States who are assigned to thousands of installations, \n     stations, and ships worldwide and who oftentimes must travel \n     long distances by air at their own expense to enjoy the \n     benefits of leave and liberty.\n       (2) The United States is indebted to the members of the all \n     volunteer Armed Forces\n\n[[Page S7858]]\n\n     and their families who protect our Nation, often experiencing \n     long separations due to the demands of military service and \n     in life threatening circumstances.\n       (3) Military service often precludes long range planning \n     for leave and liberty to provide opportunities for reunions \n     and recreation with loved ones and requires changes in \n     planning due to military necessity which results in last \n     minute changes in planning.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) all United States commercial carriers should seek to \n     lend their support with flexible, generous policies \n     applicable to members of the Armed Forces who are traveling \n     on leave or liberty at their own expense; and\n       (2) each United States air carrier, for all members of the \n     Armed Forces who have been granted leave or liberty and who \n     are traveling by air at their own expense, should--\n       (A) seek to provide reduced air fares that are comparable \n     to the lowest airfare for ticketed flights and that eliminate \n     to the maximum extent possible advance purchase requirements;\n       (B) seek to eliminate change fees or charges and any \n     penalties for military personnel;\n       (C) seek to eliminate or reduce baggage and excess weight \n     fees;\n       (D) offer flexible terms that allow members of the Armed \n     Forces on active duty to purchase, modify, or cancel tickets \n     without time restrictions, and to waive fees (including \n     baggage fees), ancillary costs, or penalties; and\n       (E) seek to take proactive measures to ensure that all \n     airline employees, particularly those who issue tickets and \n     respond to members of the Armed Forces and their family \n     members are trained in the policies of the airline aimed at \n     benefitting members of the Armed Forces who are on leave.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1676\n\n (Purpose: To require the Comptroller General of the United States to \n review the assessment and plan for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense \n            element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System)\n\n       On page 66, between lines 19 and 20, insert the following:\n       (e) Comptroller General Review.--The Comptroller General of \n     the United States shall--\n       (1) review the assessment required by subsection (b) and \n     the plan required by subsection (c); and\n       (2) not later than 120 days after receiving the assessment \n     and the plan, provide to the congressional defense committees \n     the results of the review.\n\n\n                           amendment no. 1677\n\n     (Purpose: To avoid a break in production of the Ground-based \n   Interceptor missile until the Department of Defense completes the \n   Ballistic Missile Defense Review and to ensure there is no gap in \n   homeland defense by ensuring that Missile Field 1 at Fort Greely, \n Alaska, does not complete decommissioning until seven silos have been \n              emplaced at Missile Field 2 at Fort Greely)\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title II, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 245.

Now, Mr. President, I would ask unanimous consent that \nSenator Udall be recognized as in morning business for 10 minutes; then \nthat Senator Akaka be recognized to speak on an amendment, which he \nintends to offer, and which we will do everything we can to make in \norder tomorrow; and then that Senator Murray be recognized for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, it is also my understanding then that at the beginning of \nbusiness tomorrow we will be taking up the Kyl amendment and the Bayh \neither second degree or side-by-side, with 2 hours equally divided.\n  Mr. LEVIN. No. The UC, I believe, as it reads, is that we will take \nup the Kyl amendment tomorrow, with a possible second degree or side-\nby-side; and then after they are disposed of, then we would go to the \nLieberman amendment and a second degree or a side-by-side amendment of \nSenator Bayh.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. On the alternate engine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. On the alternate engine.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So we would be taking up the Kyl amendment first, and \nthen----\n  Mr. LEVIN. Then a possible second degree or side-by-side to Kyl. \nThen, after the disposition of Kyl and any side-by-side or second \ndegree, we would move to the Lieberman amendment on alternate engines, \nwith a Bayh second degree or side-by-side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And there are time agreements on both amendments?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We do not have a time agreement yet on any of the \namendments. We hope in the morning to have time agreements. But we did \nnot have the language available for any--we did not have either the \nsecond-degree amendment language or the side-by-side available, so your \nside was unable, understandably, to agree to a time agreement.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Once the other sides of these amendments are aware of the \nside-by-side, then it is our intention to have an hour or two equally \ndivided, and then move on to pending amendments.\n  Mr. LEVIN. If it is not already agreed to, I think there was an \nunderstanding on the Lieberman and on the Bayh amendments there would \nbe an hour for each.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. That is fine.\n  Mr. LEVIN. We need the language before that can be agreed to. But \nthat is the understanding or intent.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the chairman. I think that clears up what our \nplans are for a good part of tomorrow.\n  Mr. LEVIN. There will be no more votes tonight.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there any objection to the speaker order?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Sotomayor Nomination\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, 28 years ago my father, former \nCongressman from Arizona, Morris Udall, took the long walk from the \nHouse of Representatives to come to the Senate. The divide that \nseparates the two great Chambers of Congress sometimes struck my father \nas deeper and wider than the Grand Canyon of Arizona, but he crossed \nover that day because he had a mission. He came to testify before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee on behalf of a fellow Arizonan Sandra Day \nO'Connor--the first woman to serve as a U.S. Supreme Court Justice.\n  My father, who was often at odds with ideologues of every stripe, \nnoted she was ``clearly conservative,'' but he also spoke of her \n``great judicial temperament'' and her disposition to always put \njustice ahead of partisanship.\n  Justice O'Connor proved to be an outstanding member of the Court, and \nmy father never regretted his decision to support her nomination.\n  A generation later, I am honored to stand here today to voice my \nstrong support for the first Hispanic woman nominated for the U.S. \nSupreme Court--Sonia Sotomayor.\n  Judge Sotomayor's story is truly the quintessential example of the \nAmerican dream. The daughter of Puerto Rican parents who moved to New \nYork City at a time when racial and ethnic prejudice was widespread, \nshe lost her father at age 9. Her extraordinary mother worked hard to \nprovide an example of striving in the best sense of that word. Sonia \nSotomayor took that example to Princeton, Yale Law School, the \nManhattan District Attorney's Office, and as a Federal judge.\n  It is no wonder the Hispanic community is proud of this nomination \nand has shown an outpouring of support for Judge Sotomayor. I was moved \npersonally to learn that Hispanic citizens from across the country \ntraveled to Washington, DC, and stood in line for hours in order to be \nin the audience for her confirmation hearings.\n\n[[Page S7859]]\n\n  Former Colorado State Senator Polly Baca was one of those who \ntraveled from Colorado. As a friend of the Sotomayor family, Polly's \nreaction mirrored many others when she said that the judge is ``just \nbrilliant.'' ``Some people viewed her as a bit of a nerd,'' Senator \nBaca said, ``because she worked so hard, studied so hard. And she's led \nher life that way. . . .'' ``She is who she is,'' Senator Baca \nconcluded. This historic nomination is not only a source of pride for \nHispanic Americans, but for all of us. That is because we all take \nheart and experience pride when we hear of a fellow American who \novercomes great obstacles and does good through hard work and \nperseverance.\n  Let me quote the Greeley Tribune out on our eastern plains in my home \nState of Colorado. The Tribune wrote:\n\n       This is, instead, a celebration of the growth of our \n     democracy . . . it is important that we recognize her \n     nomination for what it is: a signpost on the unending road \n     toward a more perfect union.\n\n  The Framers of the Constitution specifically outlined the advise and \nconsent role of the Senate regarding nominations. This is one of our \nmost solemn duties as Senators, the importance of which cannot be \noverstated. I take this responsibility very seriously. The Supreme \nCourt is the highest Court in our land. Once it rules on a case, that \nholding and rule become the law of the land. The Presiding Officer, as \nthe former attorney general of Illinois, knows that to be the case. The \nmen and women we send to serve there make decisions and render \njudgments that can chart our destiny, literally, as a people.\n  So an inspiring life story is not the only or even the most \ncompelling reason to confirm Judge Sotomayor. What matters most? Her \nqualifications for the job, her record, and her approach to the \nConstitution.\n  Last week my colleagues on the Senate Judiciary Committee began the \nconfirmation proceedings for Judge Sotomayor and examined her record. \nDuring those hearings, the judge handled herself with grace and poise. \nShe answered tough questions and clearly demonstrated her commitment to \nthe law and the Constitution.\n  Out on the west slope of our great State of Colorado, we have the \ncity of Grand Junction. The Daily Sentinel, that city's newspaper, \nstated last week: ``Sotomayor is unquestionably qualified.'' And I \nagree.\n  There is no doubt that she is superbly qualified to be our next \nSupreme Court Justice. As a Federal trial judge, in addition to her \nmore recent experience on the court of appeals, Judge Sotomayor brings \nmore experience as a judge to the job of serving on the Supreme Court \nthan anyone currently serving on the Court.\n  In addition, the judge received a ``well-qualified'' rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association. This is the highest rating from the ABA, \nnotable because it is given by Judge Sotomayor's peers.\n  Judge Sotomayor has received endorsements from a variety of \norganizations, ranging from law enforcement and sportsmen and hunters, \nto legal and higher education professionals.\n  The Framers of the Constitution anticipated the importance of having \nan independent and duty-bound judiciary. Alexander Hamilton, in the \nFederalist Papers, noted that:\n\n       To avoid an arbitrary discretion in the courts, it is \n     indispensable that they should be bound down by strict rules \n     and precedents, which serve to define and point out their \n     duty in every particular case that comes before them. . . .\n\n  From her record, it is unmistakable that Judge Sotomayor has \ndemonstrated a commitment to precedent and the rule of law, as Mr. \nHamilton described it. During her confirmation hearings, she said:\n\n       As a judge, I do not make the law . . . judges must apply \n     the law.\n\n  Some have raised the question whether Judge Sotomayor is a ``liberal \nactivist'' because of her involvement on the board of the Puerto Rican \nLegal Defense and Education Fund. But Judge Sotomayor's role and \ninvolvement has not been in directing legal opinions from this \norganization, but it has been directed instead at encouraging Puerto \nRican youth to pursue careers in the legal profession.\n  According to her record, she has participated in 434 published panel \ndecisions where there was at least one judge appointed by a Republican \nPresident. Despite notions to the contrary, she has agreed with the \nresult favored by the Republican appointee 95 percent of the time. What \ndoes that demonstrate? Well, it demonstrates that Judge Sotomayor does \nnot have an ideological bias but that she is a moderate jurist.\n  I also wish to acknowledge another alleged controversy Judge \nSotomayor's critics have seized upon as a reason to oppose her \nconfirmation; that is, her so-called ``wise Latina'' remarks in which \nthe judge waxed not so eloquently on her hopes that she might draw \nspecial wisdom and insight from her personal experience. Judge \nSotomayor herself has acknowledged the clumsiness of her language. If \nanything in her record suggested a special bias or prejudice, these \nwords might be evidence of a larger problem, but that is simply not \nborne out in a review of her record on the bench. Nor did her decision \non the Ricci case strike me as evidence of activist bias so much as it \nwas a case of deference for judicial precedent. It strikes me as \nparticularly unfair for Judge Sotomayor's critics to assail her for \nsocial activism when there is little, if any, evidence of that in her \nrecord, and they also used the Ricci case as an example. Frankly, I \nthink the judge's opinions consistently show judicial restraint, \nrespect for established legal precedent, and deference to the \npolicymaking role of the elected branches--even when it leads to a \nresult that may be unpopular or different from her personal opinion.\n  After I had a chance to meet with Judge Sotomayor, I came away with \nthe opinion that she possesses the temperament, the qualifications, and \nthe experience to meet the challenges of serving at the highest level \non the Supreme Court.\n  I also appreciated that she acknowledged one of the most important \nissues to the livelihood of westerners: water. She surprised me when \nshe said that all of the questions surrounding water may be among the \nmost challenging legal controversies we face in the next 25 to 50 \nyears. We did not have a conversation about the specific legal issues \nthat might emerge around water, energy, or public lands in the West, \nbut what I saw was a reassuring appreciation for the unique problems of \nour region and an intellectual curiosity to match it.\n  So as I conclude, I have reviewed Judge Sotomayor's impressive \njudicial record. I have watched and listened carefully to her answers \nduring her confirmation hearing and met with her in person. Like \nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor, I believe she is poised to make history. I \nam proud to support her nomination, and I would encourage my colleagues \nin the Senate to do likewise.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after the \nremarks of the Senator from Hawaii, the Senate go into a period of \nmorning business, with Senator Murray to be recognized first for 10 \nminutes and other Members of the body permitted to speak for up to 10 \nminutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1522\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 1522 to S. \n1390. I understand there is not yet an agreement to consider the \namendment, but I am hopeful there will be one soon.\n  Amendment No. 1522 would enhance the retirement security of Federal \nemployees and address inequities in the system. As chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Oversight of Government Management, the Federal \nWorkforce, and the District of Columbia, I am proud to join with \nSenators Collins, Lieberman, Voinovich, Murkowski, Begich, Kohl, \nMikulski, Cardin, Inouye, Webb, and Warner in this bipartisan \namendment.\n  Each of these revisions is much needed and has been thoroughly \ndebated by the appropriate committees in the House and Senate. Many of \nthe changes were requested by the administrators of the retirement \nplans and are strongly supported by many organizations. The list of \nsupporters is too long to read here, but it includes every major \nFederal employee union; postal unions, supervisors, and postmasters; \nthe Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, and several \ngovernment managers groups.\n\n[[Page S7860]]\n\n  Most important to my home State of Hawaii, the amendment provides \nretirement equity to Federal employees in Hawaii, Alaska, and the \nterritories. More than 23,000 Federal employees in Hawaii, including \nmore than 17,000 Defense Department employees and another 30,000 \nFederal employees in Alaska and the territories, currently receive a \ncost-of-living allowance which is not taxed and does not count for \nretirement. Because of this, workers in the nonforeign areas retire \nwith significantly lower annuities than their counterparts in the 48 \nStates and DC. COLA rates are scheduled to go down later this year, \nalong with the pay of nearly 50,000 Federal employees if we do not \nprovide this fix.\n  In 2007, I introduced the Non-Foreign Area Retirement Equity \nAssurance Act. The bill passed the Senate by unanimous consent in \nOctober 2008. Unfortunately, the House did not have time to consider \nthe bill before adjournment.\n  I reintroduced S. 507, which is included in the amendment, with \nSenators Murkowski, Inouye, and Begich. It is nearly identical to the \nbill that passed the Senate last year. It is a bipartisan effort to \ntransition employees in Hawaii, Alaska, and the territories to the same \nlocality pay system used in the rest of the United States while \nprotecting employees' take-home pay. The measure passed unanimously \nthrough the committee on April 1, 2009.\n  The second provision I wish to highlight corrects how employees' \nannuities are calculated for part-time service under the Civil Service \nRetirement System. This provision removes a disincentive that now \ndiscourages Federal employees near retirement from working on a part-\ntime basis while phasing into retirement. It would treat Federal \nemployees under CSRS the same way they are treated under the newer \nFederal Employee Retirement System.\n  The third provision I wish to discuss would allow FERS participants \nto apply their unused sick leave to their length of service for \ncomputing their retirement annuities as is done for CSRS employees. The \nCongressional Research Service found that FERS employees within 2 years \nof retirement eligibility used 25 percent more sick leave than \nsimilarly situated CSRS employees. OPM also found that the disparity in \nsick leave usage costs the Federal Government approximately $68 million \nin productivity each year. This solution was proposed by Federal \nmanagers who wanted additional tools to build a more efficient and \nproductive workplace and to provide employees with an incentive not to \nuse sick leave unnecessarily near retirement.\n  Finally, I wish to add that this amendment will make good on the \nrecruitment promise made to a small group of Secret Service agents. \nApproximately 180 Secret Service agents and officers hired from 1984 \nthrough 1986 were promised access to the DC Police and Firefighter \nRetirement and Disability System. This amendment is meant to provide \nnarrow and specific relief only to this small group of agents and \nofficers by allowing them to access the retirement system they were \npromised at the time they were hired.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, the \nFederal retirement reform provisions, and the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, if you look at the front cover of \nnewspapers across the country this week or watch cable news each day, \nit is pretty clear that the rhetoric on health care reform is really \nheating up. Whether it is threats from the other side of the aisle to \n``break'' a President who has made health care reform a priority or \nwhether it is the million-dollar ad buys from interest groups we are \nseeing or whether it is political pundits, health care rhetoric is \nreaching a fever pitch. In fact, the discourse here in Washington, DC, \nhas gotten so loud that the voice of American families is being drowned \nout.\n  These days, those who need reform the most are the ones being heard \nfrom the least. That is why 3 weeks ago I sent an e-mail to many of my \nconstituents asking them to share with me their personal stories of \ndealing with our health care system and asking them for their ideas for \nreform. So far, I have received in just a few short weeks over 5,000 e-\nmails into my office with deeply personal and often very painful \nstories from every corner of my State. Yesterday, I came to the floor \nto share several of those stories. They were the stories of women who \nhad lost their insurance, and due to an inability to get care when they \nneeded it most, they lost their lives. Many of the letters I have \nreceived, such as those I spoke about yesterday, tug at the heart \nstrings. But today, this evening, I wish to talk about what so many \nAmericans are concerned about right now: their purse strings.\n  I understand many Americans are satisfied with the level of care \ntheir insurance provides. These are the Americans who can get in to see \na doctor when they need one, and they receive good, quality care. These \nare the Americans who want to know what is in it for them: What will I \nget out of reform? And with all of their other problems, why should we \npay for it right now? These are good questions to which the American \npeople deserve a good answer.\n  It is not just the uninsured who are impacted by not being able to \naccess preventive medicine or having to seek costly care in the \nemergency room. These costs get passed on to those with insurance in \nthe form of higher insurance premiums. In fact, it is estimated that a \nfamily of four today here in this country is paying an added $1,000 in \npremiums a year to help pay for those who don't have any coverage. \nEssentially, families with health insurance today are paying a hidden \ntax. That tax is hurting our families who are insured, it is hurting \nour businesses, and it has to end.\n  Health care reform will do that. By creating a competitive pool of \ninsurance options, including a public option, we can bring down the \ncosts and the premiums to families in the long run. We are going to be \nmoving to a system that rewards innovation and healthy outcomes, and \nbecause Americans will have a choice of insurance plans, insurance \nproviders will be forced to lower costs so they can be competitive.\n  The existence of a pool of insurers to choose from means that if you \nlose your job, you don't lose your insurance. If you want to change \njobs or maybe even start a business, there is a health care option for \nyou. And we make it easier for small businesses to provide coverage for \ntheir employees by having them pay for up to half the cost of health \ninsurance for businesses with 50 or fewer workers. Accordingly, we also \nprohibit insurance companies from charging higher premiums for women or \nfor the elderly, and we end the practice of denying coverage to those \npeople with preexisting conditions. And for the first time, we put a \npriority on prevention and wellness. If we invest in community-based \nprograms to improve nutrition or prevent smoking or increase fitness, \nwe are going to save taxpayers nearly $16 billion a year within 5 \nyears.\n  So health care reform, when we talk about it here, will make health \ncare coverage more affordable, portable, and undeniable.\n  Let me give a real-life example of someone who has health insurance \ntoday but would benefit greatly from the health care reform we are \ntalking about. One of the letters I recently received is from Patricia \nJackson, who lives in Woodinville, WA. I suspect her story will sound \npretty familiar to most Americans.\n  Patricia and her family have private insurance that is paid for each \nmonth through premiums that come directly out of Patricia's paycheck. \nBut as is the case with many middle-class families, the burden of those \npremium payments is rapidly rising. To provide care for her family of \nfour, Patricia paid $840 a month in 2007. Then last year her payments \njumped to $900 a month. Today she is paying $1,186 in premiums to \nprovide care for her family every month.\n  Unfortunately, for too many families, Patricia's story isn't the \nexception, it is the rule. It is exactly what they are seeing in their \nhomes with their premiums.\n  Health insurance premiums for working families in Washington State \nhave\n\n[[Page S7861]]\n\nskyrocketed in recent years. In fact, according to a study by Families \nUSA, from 2000 to 2007, premiums increased by 86.6 percent.\n  Let me say that again. Over an 8-year period, premiums in my home \nState of Washington increased by 86.6 percent. But over that same \nperiod of time, wages in my State only grew by 16 percent.\n  Health care premiums are taking a bigger and bigger chunk out of \nfamilies' paychecks. Health insurance premiums rose over five times \nfaster than median earnings, and that problem is not going away.\n  For a lot of our average middle-class families who are struggling to \nmake mortgage payments or to send their kids to college today, this is \na situation that cannot continue. They can't afford it. If we don't \nhave meaningful health care reform, it is a trend that is going to \ncontinue indefinitely.\n  This reform can't come a moment too soon. Two weeks ago, Patricia's--\nwho I just talked about--insurance company, which is the largest \nprivate insurance company in my home State, announced another dramatic \nincrease in premium. They told Patricia, and a lot of other families in \nmy State, that starting on August 1, this company is going to raise \npremiums for 135,000 enrollees by an average of 17 percent more--17 \npercent more from what I just told you.\n  A front-page story in the Seattle Times, the day after that hike was \nannounced, quoted Gail Petersen, who lives in north Seattle, who says \nthat news means her premiums are going to rise by $300. She said:\n\n       I would love to see insurance companies have a little \n     competition.\n\n  So would Patricia Jackson. In fact, Patricia recently contacted my \noffice again to let me know that, starting on August 1, her new \npremiums will be over $1,400 a month. That is unaffordable. It is \nunsustainable for Patricia, for America's families, for our businesses, \nand for America's future economic strength.\n  Health care reform isn't just for the uninsured, it is for people \nsuch as Patricia and Gail and the millions of others who have health \ninsurance right now, who have played by the rules, but whose paychecks \nand futures are being gouged by a system that lacks accountability, \nlacks competition, and lacks reason.\n  Unfortunately, we are hearing from some of our friends on the other \nside who want to prevent meaningful, comprehensive reform from ever \nmoving forward.\n  Just as unfortunate are their motives. We heard a Member of our \nSenate say he wants to protect the status quo. He said:\n\n       If we are able to stop Obama on this, it will be his \n     Waterloo, it will break him.\n\n  Mr. President, that type of posturing is playing games with real \nlives and real people in order to score cheap political points. \nBlocking health care reform won't break the President of the United \nStates of America, but it will break American families, it will break \nAmerican businesses; it will break the bank.\n  America deserves better. Congress knows that most Americans like \ntheir doctors, their providers, and their coverage. On the days they \nneed to see a doctor, they are glad they can provide their families \nwith coverage for booster shots, checkups, preventive, and even \nemergency care. But on payday, it is a very different story.\n  For those of our colleagues who ask how we can afford to pay for \nthis, I want to tell them to ask Patricia Jackson--or any of their \nconstituents--because the real question is: How can we afford not to? \nEspecially at a time when the economy is struggling and the costs of \ncare are rising, we need to do everything we can to rein in those \ncosts, prevent people from losing their coverage and having to seek \nmore expensive care in our emergency rooms.\n  Tonight we will hear from our President. He knows that doing nothing \nis not an option. The time is right, the time is now. Patricia, her \nfamily, and the millions of hard-working, taxpaying Americans across \nthe country simply cannot wait any longer.\n  I urge our Senate colleagues to set aside the rhetoric and begin to \nlook at the issues and help us solve this problem so we can move this \nforward.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the mandatory \nquorum call be waived.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this week, we are considering important \nlegislation to authorize spending for the Department of Defense. Among \nthe many activities supported by this funding are our efforts to fight \nal-Qaida, the Taliban, and other terrorist groups around the world and \nprevent another terrorist attack on our country.\n  The bill includes funding for a number of key priorities relating to \nour fight against terrorists. It provides $130 billion to fund our \nefforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. Afghanistan remains the front line in \nthe battle against terrorism, as it provides a haven for thousands of \nTaliban and al-Qaida fighters. And, as U.S. troops pull back from Iraqi \ncities, our mission in that country will increasingly focus on counter-\nterrorism. It funds a number of key initiatives to enhance the safety \nof our troops and our citizens from terrorist threats, including \nfunding for detecting and defeating improvised explosive devices, or \nIEDs. It funds some of our most important efforts to prevent unsecured \nnuclear material from falling into the hands of terrorists. It expands \nthe size of our Special Operations Forces--the elite commando units \nlike Navy SEALs and Army Green Berets--who lead this Nation's global \nground fight against terrorism.\n  While the Special Operations Forces provide us a unique and \nunsurpassed capability, they are hardly the only group of Americans on \nthe front lines of this fight. The Special Operations Forces are part \nof one of three key groups of people in our government who play a \ncritical role in this fight. Military service members, who are fighting \nhouse-to-house, street-to-street, and village to village in Iraq and \nAfghanistan to identify and eliminate terrorists and insurgents. \nMembers of the Foreign Service and USAID who, in addition to carrying \nout our Nation's diplomacy, are working with local leaders to build \ngoverning capacity, improve essential services, and foster economic \ngrowth. And members of our Nation's intelligence agencies, who provide \nthe vital information we need both to keep these other public servants \nout of harm's way and to take the fight to the terrorists.\n  I want to pause for a moment to recognize and commend their \ntremendous service to our Nation. The courage, endurance, and sacrifice \nthey exhibit on a\n\n[[Page S7862]]\n\ndaily basis exemplify the highest values of our great Nation. And while \nour country has made great strides in honoring the contribution of our \nmilitary service members, many of our diplomats and intelligence \npersonnel consistently demonstrate their patriotism and commitment with \nhardly any public recognition.\n  I would like to especially honor the men and women of our Nation's \nintelligence services. The U.S. intelligence community has been under \nfire in recent weeks. The recent controversy is not over whether the \nCIA has done enough to go after bin Laden, or about whether it has done \nits job effectively. It is about whether senior leaders in the Bush \nadministration mismanaged and misrepresented a particular program. That \nis an important question that our Intelligence Committee will seek to \nanswer, but it should not call into question the distinguished service \nof the officers who continue to do a remarkable job for our country.\n  I have seen first hand some of the military and intelligence officers \nwho are hunting Osama bin Laden and other terrorists. CIA and Air Force \npersonnel are working around the clock, 24 hours a day, supporting the \nmissions of Predator and Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles. Their work is \na clear example of military and intelligence personnel making a \nsignificant difference in protecting the safety of American citizens on \na daily basis.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S7863, July 22, 2009, the Record reads: I have seen \nfirst hand some of the military and intelligence officers who are \nhunting Osama bin Laden and other terrorists. CIA and Air Force \npersonnel stationed at Creech Air Force Base outside of Las Vegas \nare working around the clock, 24 hours a day, supporting the \nmissions of Predator and Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles. CIA \nofficers and members of the Air Force's 432nd Air Expeditionary \nWing control these UAVs from Creech, remotely identifying and \nstriking terrorist targets. Their work is a clear example of \nmilitary and intelligence personnel making a significant \ndifference in protecting the safety of American citizens on a \ndaily basis.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: I have seen first \nhand some of the military and intelligence officers who are \nhunting Osama bin Laden and other terrorists. CIA and Air Force \npersonnel are working around the clock, 24 hours a day, supporting \nthe missions of Predator and Reaper unmanned aerial vehicles. \nTheir work is a clear example of military and intelligence \npersonnel making a significant difference in protecting the safety \nof American citizens on a daily basis.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  According to press reports, since January 1, 2008, UAVs have carried \nout more than 50 separate strikes against terrorists and insurgents in \nthe Afghanistan-Pakistan border region, killing more than 300 \nterrorists and insurgents, including over 15 top leaders of the Taliban \nand al-Qaida. In addition, press reports indicate UAVs have also \nconducted surveillance and reconnaissance missions that have been \ncritical in identifying and tracking targets for strikes by other \nmilitary assets. In Nevada and around the world, members of our Armed \nForces, intelligence services, and foreign services are on the front \nlines of our fight against terrorism. It is a fight we will win thanks \nto their dedication and sacrifice. As we continue debate on the Fiscal \nYear 2010 Defense Authorization Act, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing and commending their tremendous service to our Nation.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I rise in support of an amendment to be \noffered by my good friend, the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Lieberman.\n  The purpose of this amendment is straightforward: it seeks to make \nsure that the missile defense system deployed in Europe is as cost-\neffective and as capable of protecting the United States as the \ninstallation of ground-based midcourse defense missile defense \ninterceptors and early warning radars proposed by the last \nadministration; that proposal was endorsed by the NATO alliance and \nembraced by the governments of Poland and the Czech Republic.\n  This system is important not just because it provides the U.S. with a \nmuch needed defense against the long-range ballistic missile threat of \nIran, but also because of what it says about the alliance between the \nUnited States and these two countries. It is significant that Poland \nand the Czech Republic, which spent the better part of the 20th century \nas oppressed satellites of the Soviet Union have so earnestly sought to \nalign themselves with the United States to confront the threats of the \n21st century.\n  This deployment is clearly in U.S. interests. The Congressional \nBudget Office, CBO, recently concluded a study of the options--current \nand future--to protect the U.S. and its allies from the Iranian threat. \nThe results of that study were clear: only the Polish and Czech \ndeployments can protect the United States and Europe; any other option \ncosts more and defends the U.S. less, if at all.''\\1\\\n  Let me quote from this CBO study, ``Options for Deploying Missile \nDefenses in Europe'':\n\n       Of the modeled options, MDA's proposed European system \n     would provide the most extensive defense of the United \n     States, covering the entire continental United States against \n     liquid-fuel ICBMs and covering all of the threatened portion \n     of the continental United States plus part of Alaska against \n     solid-fuel ICBMs.\\2\\\n\n  The reason for this deployment is plain: the STRATCOM and EUCOM \nCommanders said to Congress in a July 24, 2008 letter:\n\n       We are in complete agreement that Europe requires a layered \n     defense enabled by a robust network of sensors in and a \n     credible interceptor capability. Iran's actions last week \n     illustrate the imperative for credible global missile \n     defenses. We cannot wait to counter a long-range, WMD-\n     capable, Iranian missile threat. Deploying missile defenses \n     in Europe would demonstrate our resolve to deter this threat \n     and protect our nation and allies by providing a critical \n     capability to the warfighter.\n       As Combatant Commanders responsible for both United States \n     military operations in the European theater (EUCOM) and \n     global missile defense plans, operations, and capability \n     (STRATCOM), our best military advice leads us to strongly \n     endorse the President's funding request for European missile \n     defense sites. These capabilities remain critical to \n     defending America and our allies in Europe and for deterring \n     our adversaries today and in the future.\\3\\\n\n  That is why I am a cosponsor and supporter of the Lieberman \namendment.\n\n\n                                endnotes\n\n       \\1\\ CBO study, ``Options for Deploying Missile Defenses in \n     Europe.'' Pg. xv. (February 2009). (Quoting CBO: ``Overall, \n     CBO estimates, Option 1 would cost between $9 billion and $13 \n     billion; Option 2, between $18 billion and $22 billion; \n     Option 3, between $9 billion and $13 billion; and Option 4, \n     between $10 billion and $14 billion. (Those and other cost \n     estimates in this report are in 2009 dollars.)'')\n       \\2\\ CBO, pg. 37. (Quoting the CBO study: ``Option 4, with \n     its Kinetic Energy Interceptors, would also provide \n     substantial added coverage of the United States, particularly \n     against solid-fuel ICBMs. The systems using SM-3 Block IIA \n     interceptors (Options 2 and 3) offer the least additional \n     defense of the United States: almost none against solid-fuel \n     ICBMs and coverage of only parts of the northeastern (and, in \n     the case of Option 2, central) United States against liquid \n     fuel ICBMs.'')\n       \\3\\ General Kevin P. Chilton and General Bantz J. Craddock. \n     Letter to Senator Robert C. Byrd. 14 July 2008.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in \nthe Record the following documents: (1) an open letter to the Obama \nadministration from leading Europeans, including Lech Walesa and Vaclav \nHavel, who warn in strong terms that the so-called U.S.-Russia reset \nmust not come at the expense of mutual interests between the U.S. and \nthe nations of central and eastern Europe; (2) a recent New York Times \narticle, ``Eastern Europe Is Uneasy Over U.S. Ties with Russia''; and \n(3) an op-ed from yesterday's Washington Post, ``A Letter From Europe: \nU.S. leadership in the post-Soviet age is needed to face new \nchallenges.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                            [July 15, 2009]\n\n  An Open Letter to the Obama Administration From Central and Eastern \n                                 Europe\n\n (By Valdas Adamkus, Martin Butora, Emil Constantinescu, Pavol Demes, \nLubos Dobrovsky, Matyas Eorsi, Istvan Gyarmati, Vaclav Havel, Rastislav \n    Kacer, Sandra Kalniete, Karel Schwarzenberg, Michal Kovac, Ivan \nKrastev, Alexander Kwasniewski, Mart Laar, Kadri Liik, Janos Martonyi. \n   Janusz Onyszkiewicz, Adam Rotfeld, Vaira Vike-Freiberga, Alexandr \n                         Vondra, Lech Walesa.)\n\n       We have written this letter because, as Central and Eastern \n     European (CEE) intellectuals and former policymakers, we care \n     deeply about the future of the transatlantic relationship as \n     well as the future quality of relations between the United \n     States and the countries of our region. We write in our \n     personal capacity as individuals who are friends and allies \n     of the United States as well as committed Europeans.\n       Our nations are deeply indebted to the United States. Many \n     of us know firsthand how important your support for our \n     freedom and independence was during the dark Cold War years. \n     U.S. engagement and support was essential for the success of \n     our democratic transitions after the Iron Curtain fell twenty \n     years ago. Without Washington's vision and leadership, it is \n     doubtful that we would be in NATO and even the EU today.\n       We have worked to reciprocate and make this relationship a \n     two-way street. We are Atlanticist voices within NATO and the \n     EU. Our nations have been engaged alongside the United States \n     in the Balkans, Iraq, and today in Afghanistan. While our \n     contribution may at times seem modest compared to your own, \n     it is significant when measured as a percentage of our \n     population and GDP. Having benefited from your support for \n     liberal democracy and liberal values in the past, we have \n     been among your strongest supporters when it comes to \n     promoting democracy and human rights around the world.\n\n[[Page S7863]]\n\n       Twenty years after the end of the Cold War, however, we see \n     that Central and Eastern European countries are no longer at \n     the heart of American foreign policy. As the new Obama \n     Administration sets its foreign-policy priorities, our region \n     is one part of the world that Americans have largely stopped \n     worrying about. Indeed, at times we have the impression that \n     U.S. policy was so successful that many American officials \n     have now concluded that our region is fixed once and for all \n     and that they could ``check the box'' and move on to other \n     more pressing strategic issues. Relations have been so close \n     that many on both sides assume that the region's \n     transatlantic orientation, as well as its stability and \n     prosperity, would last forever.\n       That view is premature. All is not well either in our \n     region or in the transatlantic relationship. Central and \n     Eastern Europe is at a political crossroads and today there \n     is a growing sense of nervousness in the region. The global \n     economic crisis is impacting on our region and, as elsewhere, \n     runs the risk that our societies will look inward and be less \n     engaged with the outside world. At the same time, storm \n     clouds are starting to gather on the foreign policy horizon. \n     Like you, we await the results of the EU Commission's \n     investigation on the origins of the Russo-Georgian war. But \n     the political impact of that war on the region has already \n     been felt. Many countries were deeply disturbed to see the \n     Atlantic alliance stand by as Russia violated the core \n     principles of the Helsinki Final Act, the Charter of Paris, \n     and the territorial integrity of a country that was a member \n     of NATO's Partnership for Peace and the Euroatlantic \n     Partnership Council--all in the name of defending a sphere of \n     influence on its borders.\n       Despite the efforts and significant contribution of the new \n     members, NATO today seems weaker than when we joined. In many \n     of our countries it is perceived as less and less relevant--\n     and we feel it. Although we are full members, people question \n     whether NATO would be willing and able to come to our defense \n     in some future crises. Europe's dependence on Russian energy \n     also creates concern about the cohesion of the Alliance. \n     President Obama's remark at the recent NATO summit on the \n     need to provide credible defense plans for all Alliance \n     members was welcome, but not sufficient to allay fears about \n     the Alliance's defense readiness. Our ability to continue to \n     sustain public support at home for our contributions to \n     Alliance missions abroad also depends on us being able to \n     show that our own security concerns are being addressed in \n     NATO and close cooperation with the United States\n       We must also recognize that America's popularity and \n     influence have fallen in many of our countries as well. \n     Public opinions polls, including the German Marshall Fund's \n     own Transatlantic Trends survey, show that our region has not \n     been immune to the wave of criticism and anti-Americanism \n     that has swept Europe in recent years and which led to a \n     collapse in sympathy and support for the United States during \n     the Bush years. Some leaders in the region have paid a \n     political price for their support of the unpopular war in \n     Iraq. In the future they may be more careful in taking \n     political risks to support the United States. We believe that \n     the onset of a new Administration has created a new opening \n     to reverse this trend but it will take time and work on both \n     sides to make up for what we have lost.\n       In many ways the EU has become the major factor and \n     institution in our lives. To many people it seems more \n     relevant and important today than the link to the United \n     States. To some degree it is a logical outcome of the \n     integration of Central and Eastern Europe into the EU. Our \n     leaders and officials spend much more time in EU meetings \n     than in consultations with Washington, where they often \n     struggle to attract attention or make our voices heard. The \n     region's deeper integration in the EU is of course welcome \n     and should not necessarily lead to a weakening of the \n     transatlantic relationship. The hope was that integration of \n     Central and Eastern Europe into the EU would actually \n     strengthen the strategic cooperation between Europe and \n     America.\n       However, there is a danger that instead of being a pro-\n     Atlantic voice in the EU, support for a more global \n     partnership with Washington in the region might wane over \n     time. The region does not have the tradition of assuming a \n     more global role. Some items on the transatlantic agenda, \n     such as climate change, do not resonate in the Central and \n     Eastern European publics to the same extent as they do in \n     Western Europe.\n       Leadership change is also coming in Central and Eastern \n     Europe. Next to those, there are fewer and fewer leaders who \n     emerged from the revolutions of 1989 who experienced \n     Washington's key role in securing our democratic transition \n     and anchoring our countries in NATO and EU. A new generation \n     of leaders is emerging who do not have these memories and \n     follow a more ``realistic'' policy. At the same time, the \n     former Communist elites, whose insistence on political and \n     economic power significantly contributed to the crises in \n     many CEE countries, gradually disappear from the political \n     scene. The current political and economic turmoil and the \n     fallout from the global economic crisis provide additional \n     opportunities for the forces of nationalism, extremism, \n     populism, and anti-Semitism across the continent but also in \n     some other countries.\n       This means that the United States is likely to lose many of \n     its traditional interlocutors in the region. The new elites \n     replacing them may not share the idealism--or have the same \n     relationship to the United States--as the generation who led \n     the democratic transition. They may be more calculating in \n     their support of the United States as well as more parochial \n     in their world view. And in Washington a similar transition \n     is taking place as many of the leaders and personalities we \n     have worked with and relied on are also leaving politics.\n       And then there is the issue of how to deal with Russia. Our \n     hopes that relations with Russia would improve and that \n     Moscow would finally fully accept our complete sovereignty \n     and independence after joining NATO and the EU have not been \n     fulfilled. Instead, Russia is back as a revisionist power \n     pursuing a 19th-century agenda with 21st-century tactics and \n     methods. At a global level, Russia has become, on most \n     issues, a status-quo power. But at a regional level and vis-\n     a-vis our nations, it increasingly acts as a revisionist one. \n     It challenges our claims to our own historical experiences. \n     It asserts a privileged position in determining our security \n     choices. It uses overt and covert means of economic warfare, \n     ranging from energy blockades and politically motivated \n     investments to bribery and media manipulation in order to \n     advance its interests and to challenge the transatlantic \n     orientation of Central and Eastern Europe.\n       We welcome the ``reset'' of the American-Russian relations. \n     As the countries living closest to Russia, obviously nobody \n     has a greater interest in the development of the democracy in \n     Russia and better relations between Moscow and the West than \n     we do. But there is also nervousness in our capitals. We want \n     to ensure that too narrow an understanding of Western \n     interests does not lead to the wrong concessions to Russia. \n     Today the concern is, for example, that the United States and \n     the major European powers might embrace the Medvedev plan for \n     a ``Concert of Powers'' to replace the continent's existing, \n     value-based security structure. The danger is that Russia's \n     creeping intimidation and influence-peddling in the region \n     could over time lead to a de facto neutralization of the \n     region. There are differing views within the region when it \n     comes to Moscow's new policies. But there is a shared view \n     that the full engagement of the United States is needed.\n       Many in the region are looking with hope to the Obama \n     Administration to restore the Atlantic relationship as a \n     moral compass for their domestic as well as foreign policies. \n     A strong commitment to common liberal democratic values is \n     essential to our countries. We know from our own historical \n     experience the difference between when the United States \n     stood up for its liberal democratic values and when it did \n     not. Our region suffered when the United States succumbed to \n     ``realism'' at Yalta. And it benefited when the United States \n     used its power to fight for principle. That was critical \n     during the Cold War and in opening the doors of NATO. Had a \n     ``realist'' view prevailed in the early 1990s, we would not \n     be in NATO today and the idea of a Europe whole, free, and at \n     peace would be a distant dream.\n       We understand the heavy demands on your Administration and \n     on U.S. foreign policy. It is not our intent to add to the \n     list of problems you face. Rather, we want to help by being \n     strong Atlanticist allies in a U.S.-European partnership that \n     is a powerful force for good around the world. But we are not \n     certain where our region will be in five or ten years time \n     given the domestic and foreign policy uncertainties we face. \n     We need to take the right steps now to ensure the strong \n     relationship between the United States and Central and \n     Eastern Europe over the past twenty years will endure.\n       We believe this is a time both the United States and Europe \n     need to reinvest in the transatlantic relationship. We also \n     believe this is a time when the United States and Central and \n     Eastern Europe must reconnect around a new and forward-\n     looking agenda. While recognizing what has been achieved in \n     the twenty years since the fall of the Iron Curtain, it is \n     time to set a new agenda for close cooperation for the \n     next twenty years across the Atlantic.\n       Therefore, we propose the following steps:\n       First, we are convinced that America needs Europe and that \n     Europe needs the United States as much today as in the past. \n     The United States should reaffirm its vocation as a European \n     power and make clear that it plans to stay fully engaged on \n     the continent even while it faces the pressing challenges in \n     Afghanistan and Pakistan, the wider Middle East, and Asia. \n     For our part we must work at home in our own countries and in \n     Europe more generally to convince our leaders and societies \n     to adopt a more global perspective and be prepared to \n     shoulder more responsibility in partnership with the United \n     States.\n       Second, we need a renaissance of NATO as the most important \n     security link between the United States and Europe. It is the \n     only credible hard power security guarantee we have. NATO \n     must reconfirm its core function of collective defense even \n     while we adapt to the new threats of the 21st century. A key \n     factor in our ability to participate in NATO's expeditionary \n     missions overseas is the belief that we are secure at home. \n     We must therefore correct some self-inflicted wounds from the \n     past. It was a mistake not to commence with proper Article 5 \n     defense planning for new members after NATO was enlarged. \n     NATO needs to make the Alliance's commitments credible and \n     provide strategic reassurance to all members. This should \n     include contingency planning, prepositioning of forces, \n     equipment, and supplies for reinforcement in our region in \n     case of crisis as\n\n[[Page S7864]]\n\n     originally envisioned in the NATO-Russia Founding Act.\n       We should also re-think the working of the NATO-Russia \n     Council and return to the practice where NATO member \n     countries enter into dialogue with Moscow with a coordinated \n     position. When it comes to Russia, our experience has been \n     that a more determined and principled policy toward Moscow \n     will not only strengthen the West's security but will \n     ultimately lead Moscow to follow a more cooperative policy as \n     well. Furthermore, the more secure we feel inside NATO, the \n     easier it will also be for our countries to reach out to \n     engage Moscow on issues of common interest. That is the dual \n     track approach we need and which should be reflected in the \n     new NATO strategic concept.\n       Third, the thorniest issue may well be America's planned \n     missile-defense installations. Here too, there are different \n     views in the region, including among our publics which are \n     divided. Regardless of the military merits of this scheme and \n     what Washington eventually decides to do, the issue has \n     nevertheless also become--at least in some countries--a \n     symbol of America's credibility and commitment to the region. \n     How it is handled could have a significant impact on their \n     future transatlantic orientation. The small number of \n     missiles involved cannot be a threat to Russia's strategic \n     capabilities, and the Kremlin knows this. We should decide \n     the future of the program as allies and based on the \n     strategic plusses and minuses of the different technical and \n     political configurations. The Alliance should not allow the \n     issue to be determined by unfounded Russian opposition. \n     Abandoning the program entirely or involving Russia too \n     deeply in it without consulting Poland or the Czech Republic \n     can undermine the credibility of the United States across the \n     whole region.\n       Fourth, we know that NATO alone is not enough. We also want \n     and need more Europe and a better and more strategic U.S.-EU \n     relationship as well. Increasingly our foreign policies are \n     carried out through the European Union--and we support that. \n     We also want a common European foreign and defense policy \n     that is open to close cooperation with the United States. We \n     are the advocates of such a line in the EU. But we need the \n     United States to rethink its attitude toward the EU and \n     engage it much more seriously as a strategic partner. We need \n     to bring NATO and the EU closer together and make them work \n     in tandem. We need common NATO and EU strategies not only \n     toward Russia but on a range of other new strategic \n     challenges.\n       Fifth is energy security. The threat to energy supplies can \n     exert an immediate influence on our nations' political \n     sovereignty also as allies contributing to common decisions \n     in NATO. That is why it must also become a transatlantic \n     priority. Although most of the responsibility for energy \n     security lies within the realm of the EU, the United States \n     also has a role to play. Absent American support, the Baku-\n     Tbilisi-Ceyhan pipeline would never have been built. Energy \n     security must become an integral part of U.S.-European \n     strategic cooperation. Central and Eastern European countries \n     should lobby harder (and with more unity) inside Europe for \n     diversification of the energy mix, suppliers, and transit \n     routes, as well as for tough legal scrutiny of Russia's abuse \n     of its monopoly and cartel-like power inside the EU. But \n     American political support on this will play a crucial role. \n     Similarly, the United States can play an important role in \n     solidifying further its support for the Nabucco pipeline, \n     particularly in using its security relationship with the main \n     transit country, Turkey, as well as the North-South \n     interconnector of Central Europe and LNG terminals in our \n     region.\n       Sixth, we must not neglect the human factor. Our next \n     generations need to get to know each other, too. We have to \n     cherish and protect the multitude of educational, \n     professional, and other networks and friendships that \n     underpin our friendship and alliance. The U.S. visa regime \n     remains an obstacle in this regard. It is absurd that Poland \n     and Romania--arguably the two biggest and most pro-American \n     states in the CEE region, which are making substantial \n     contributions in Iraq and Afghanistan--have not yet been \n     brought into the visa waiver program. It is incomprehensible \n     that a critic like the French anti-globalization activist \n     Jose Bove does not require a visa for the United States but \n     former Solidarity activist and Nobel Peace prizewinner Lech \n     Walesa does. This issue will be resolved only if it is made a \n     political priority by the President of the United States.\n       The steps we made together since 1989 are not minor in \n     history. The common successes are the proper foundation for \n     the transatlantic renaissance we need today. This is why we \n     believe that we should also consider the creation of a Legacy \n     Fellowship for young leaders. Twenty years have passed since \n     the revolutions of 1989. That is a whole generation. We need \n     a new generation to renew the transatlantic partnership. A \n     new program should be launched to identify those young \n     leaders on both sides of the Atlantic who can carry forward \n     the transatlantic project we have spent the last two decades \n     building in Central and Eastern Europe.\n       In conclusion, the onset of a new Administration in the \n     United States has raised great hopes in our countries for a \n     transatlantic renewal. It is an opportunity we dare not miss. \n     We, the authors of this letter, know firsthand how important \n     the relationship with the United States has been. In the \n     1990s, a large part of getting Europe right was about getting \n     Central and Eastern Europe right. The engagement of the \n     United States was critical to locking in peace and stability \n     from the Baltics to the Black Sea. Today the goal must be to \n     keep Central and Eastern Europe right as a stable, activist, \n     and Atlanticist part of our broader community.\n       That is the key to our success in bringing about the \n     renaissance in the Alliance the Obama Administration has \n     committed itself to work for and which we support. That will \n     require both sides recommitting to and investing in this \n     relationship. But if we do it right, the pay off down the \n     road can be very real. By taking the right steps now, we can \n     put it on new and solid footing for the future.\n\n                [From the New York Times, July 17, 2009]\n\n          Eastern Europe Is Uneasy Over U.S. Ties With Russia\n\n                          (By Nicholas Kulish)\n\n       Berlin.--The deep concern among America's Eastern European \n     allies over improved relations between Russia and the United \n     States spilled into the open on Thursday when 22 prominent \n     figures, including Poland's Lech Walesa and the Czech \n     Republic's Vaclav Havel, published an open letter to the \n     Obama administration begging not to be forgotten.\n       In the letter, the leaders urged President Obama and his \n     top policy makers to remember their interests as they \n     negotiate with Russia and review plans for missile defense \n     bases in Poland and the Czech Republic. Abandoning the \n     missile defense plan or giving Russia too big a role in it \n     could ``undermine the credibility of the United States across \n     the whole region,'' the letter said.\n       The letter was published on the Web site of the Polish \n     newspaper Gazeta Wyborcza and was signed by former \n     presidents, like Mr. Walesa and Mr. Havel, as well as other \n     former heads of state, top diplomats and intellectuals from a \n     broad range of countries, including Hungary, Bulgaria and \n     Estonia.\n       ``Our region is one part of the world that Americans have \n     largely stopped worrying about,'' the letter said, even \n     though ``all is not well either in our region or in the \n     trans-Atlantic relationship.''\n       While the letter covered a range of issues, including the \n     dangers presented to the young democracies in the region by \n     the economic crisis, Russia was clearly central to the \n     worries expressed by the drafters.\n       ``There is the fear among Central and Eastern Europeans \n     that our interest in keeping the trans-Atlantic bond could be \n     somehow sold out to the relationship with Russia,'' Alexandr \n     Vondra, a former minister of foreign affairs for the Czech \n     Republic, said in a telephone interview from Washington.\n       Expressing concerns about the growing weakness of NATO, the \n     leaders said that Mr. Obama's call at the recent NATO summit \n     for ``credible defense plans for all Alliance members was \n     welcome, but not sufficient to allay fears about the \n     Alliance's defense readiness.''\n       As geostrategic interests from Afghanistan to Iran to North \n     Korea have demanded Russian logistical or diplomatic \n     assistance, anxiety has risen among the states known \n     collectively as New Europe. Russia's invasion of Georgia last \n     August only intensified those fears, as much through the \n     American response as through Russia's own actions.\n       ``The Georgia war exposed that there is a limit to what the \n     United States will or can do to respond to military conflict \n     in the neighborhood,'' said Angela E. Stent, who served as \n     the top Russia officer at the United States government's \n     National Intelligence Council until 2oo6 and now directs \n     Russian studies at Georgetown University.\n       She added that the intentions of the administration toward \n     its allies were not yet completely clear. ``Until now, we've \n     heard a Russian policy but not a policy for Russia's \n     neighborhood,'' Ms. Stent said.\n       The economic crisis masked these tensions for a while, but \n     the problems never really went away in these countries, where \n     Russia is seen as ``a revisionist power pursuing a 19th-\n     century agenda with 21st-century tactics and methods,'' \n     according to the letter, and where any warming of relations \n     between Washington and Moscow raises hackles. Mr. Obama's \n     trip to Moscow last week did nothing to reassure nervous \n     allies in Eastern Europe.\n       ``We all understand that a deal must come with Russia, but \n     we do not believe that a deal can be made at the expense of \n     the security interests of the countries of our region or of \n     Georgia and Ukraine,'' said Eugeniusz Smolar, senior fellow \n     at the Center for International Relations, a nonprofit, \n     nonpartisan research group in Warsaw.\n       There is also a sense among many analysts and politicians \n     in the region that the new administration does not understand \n     Russia's true nature that friendly words from the Russian \n     leadership when Mr. Obama is in Moscow are just words, while \n     events like the murder of a Russian human rights campaigner \n     on Wednesday showed the true state of Russia's civil society.\n       The former leaders also warned about threats within their \n     own countries and across Europe, driven by the economic \n     crisis, which had provided ``opportunities for the forces of \n     nationalism, extremism, populism and anti-Semitism,'' \n     according to the letter.\n       ``Domestically these countries used to be led by idealistic \n     leaders. That's still the case in some of these countries, \n     but not all,'' said Kadri Liik, director of the International \n     Center for Defense Studies in Tallinn, Estonia, who was among \n     the drafters of the letter.\n\n[[Page S7865]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n               [From the Washington Post, July 19, 2009]\n\nA Letter From Europe--U.S. Leadership in the Post-Soviet Age Is Needed \n                         To Face New Challenges\n\n       Twenty years have passed since the revolutions that \n     restored freedom to what had been the captive nations of \n     Central and Eastern Europe. That many Americans no longer \n     give much thought to that part of the world testifies, in \n     part, to the region's success. The eastward expansion of NATO \n     and the European Union helped bring security, stability and \n     growing prosperity; more important, the countries themselves \n     have nurtured democratic and free-market institutions that in \n     1989 would have seemed unreachable.\n       Yet an impressive collection of former presidents and \n     ministers from the first two decades of post-communism warn, \n     in a letter released last week, that long-lasting success \n     should not be assumed. ``All is not well either in our region \n     or in the transatlantic relationship,'' they caution. Since \n     the signatories are staunch allies of the United States and \n     of democracy--ranging from Vaclav Havel and Alexandr Vondra \n     of the Czech Republic to Lech Walesa and Alexander \n     Kwasniewski of Poland to Vaira Vike-Freiberga of Latvia and \n     Valdas Adamkus of Lithuania--they merit a hearing.\n       The global recession has given room to ``nationalism, \n     extremism, populism, and anti-Semitism'' in some of their \n     countries, the former leaders acknowledge. At the same time, \n     they say, ``NATO today seems weaker than when we joined'' \n     while ``Russia is back as a revisionist power pursuing a \n     19th-century agenda with 21st-century tactics and methods. . \n     . . The danger is that Russia's creeping intimidation and \n     influence-peddling in the region could over time lead to a de \n     facto neutralization of the region.''\n       In response, they say, the Obama administration should \n     recommit to NATO as a defense alliance, not just an \n     expeditionary force with duties in Afghanistan and beyond. It \n     should support pipelines that will diminish the region's \n     dependence on Russian oil and gas. It should take care, as it \n     evaluates planned missile-defense installations in Poland and \n     the Czech Republic that Russia opposes, to consult closely \n     with the governments that have the most at stake. It should \n     invest in relationships with younger generations that do not \n     remember communism or the struggle against it.\n       None of this will come as news to President Obama, who has \n     made clear, in Moscow and elsewhere, that the United States \n     will not recognize a privileged Russian sphere of influence \n     in the former Soviet Union or Warsaw Pact. Vice President \n     Biden, who first delivered that message for the \n     administration in a speech in Munich in February, presumably \n     will reiterate it during his upcoming visit to Ukraine and \n     Georgia. The administration nonetheless should take the \n     letter to heart, not as a rebuke but as encouragement. \n     Nations clamoring for a stronger U.S relationship, built on \n     the ideals of freedom and alliance, are not so numerous that \n     Washington can afford to take them for granted.\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I voted against Senator Lieberman's \namendment to immediately authorize a significant increase in the size \nof the Army because I did not believe it was in the best interest of \nour troops or our national security. There is an incredible strain on \nthe force right now, including multiple deployments and insufficient \ndwell time, due to our failure to promptly and fully redeploy from \nIraq. Rather than spending billions of dollars to increase the size of \nthe Army, we should promptly redeploy from Iraq so that we can focus on \nthe global threat posed by al-Qaida and so that we can reduce the \nstrain on our troops. Indeed, the Iraqi Government has asked us to \nremove our troops from Iraqi cities, and as a result many U.S. \nservicemembers, including Wisconsin soldiers, are sitting on their \nbases with no mission.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, today I am honored to recognize an \nexceptional group of women who served in World War II. When their \ncountry needed them, they answered the call and chartered a bold new \ncourse for women in the military. Sixty-seven years ago, over 1,000 \ncourageous women became the first in United States history trained to \nfly an American military aircraft. These women are known as the Women \nAirforce Service Pilots, the WASPs. Today we offer them our sincere \nadmiration and deepest thanks.\n  These women came to be known as the ``Fly Girls.'' They were \npatriots, they were pioneers, but above all they were pilots. They flew \nthe same planes as their male counterparts, learned the same skills, \nand served the same country. They were among the first to fly the B-26 \nMartin Marauder and the B-29 Super Fortress. The Fly Girls, however, \nserved as civilians rather than as members of the Armed Forces. \nCivilian status prevented the Fly Girls from being recognized with \ntheir military counterparts. And the 38 brave women who died during \ntheir service were not honored with flag-draped caskets, nor could \ntheir families hang gold stars in their windows.\n  Today we pause to recognize these women and their families with an \nhonor that is long overdue and much deserved. I am proud to have been a \ncosponsor of S. 614, which authorized the awarding of the Congressional \nGold Medal to the Women Airforce Service Pilots of World War II. This \nbill sailed through Congress in 3 months and on July 1, 2009, President \nBarack Obama signed Public Law 111-40, granting the highest civilian \naward to this deserving group of women.\n  I am particularly proud of the Kansas women who served in this unique \nmilitary force. Today we honor all those Kansas WASPs who have gone \nbefore us and recognize the two surviving Kansas WASPs, Meriem Anderson \nof Eureka, KS, and Marjorie Rees of Prairie Village, KS.\n  The WASPs have never asked for our praise. When Rees was asked how \nshe felt about being overlooked for so many years she simply responded, \n``We didn't resent that we were ignored so long. We've thought for \nyears how very lucky we were to fly those wonderful airplanes.'' Her \nwords express a quiet heroism, and remind us that the noblest act of \nsacrifice is the one that expects nothing in return. The \naccomplishments of these women, and the manner in which they have \ncontinued to conduct their lives, is a testament to their remarkable \ncharacter. The thanks and recognition we offer them today pales in \ncomparison to the gift they have given us--freedom.\n  Their strength has inspired many other women to also look to the \nskies. MAJ Gina Sabric, an F-16 fighter pilot, voiced her appreciation \nto the WASPs when she said, ``Women in aviation has definitely been a \nstepping-\n\n[[Page S7866]]\n\nstone progression, one that the WASPs started. Without them, it would \nhave been a longer, tougher road. They set the stage for the rest of us \nto be able to continue what they started.''\n  On behalf of myself, the State of Kansas, and the people of this \ngreat country, I wish to express my sincerest thanks to all of the \nWASPs for their brave and patriotic service in World War II. We are \ntruly a grateful Nation.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I recognize Ola Mildred ``Millie'' \nRexroat and the six other women from South Dakota who served honorably \nduring World War II as members of the Women Airforce Service Pilots, \nWASPs.\n  More than 1,000 women answered the call and served as pilots during \nWorld War II. Because WASPs records were classified and archived for \nover 30 years, WASPs have been left out of much of the documented \nhistory of World War II.\n  On July 1, 2009, legislation was signed into law that honors the \nservice of these women with the Congressional Gold Medal, which is \ngiven in honor of outstanding service to the United States and is one \nof the nation's highest civilian awards. This Congressional Gold Medal \nfinally gives these women the honor they deserve.\n  Between 1942 and 1944, the 1,102 women of WASP were trained in Texas, \nand then went on to fly noncombat domestic military missions so all \ntheir male counterparts could be deployed to combat. WASPs were \nrequired to complete the same primary, basic, and advanced training \ncourses as male Army Air Corps pilots, and many went on to specialized \nflight training. By the conclusion of the war, WASPs logged 60 million \nmiles of flying in every kind of military aircraft.\n  Following the war, the WASPs were disbanded and the women pilots paid \ntheir own way home without pomp or circumstance. Even during the war, \nthe families of the 38 women who died in the line of duty were \nresponsible for the costs to transport their bodies and arrange \nburials. It was not until 1977 that the WASPs were granted veterans' \nstatus.\n  Ms. Rexroat is the last surviving member of the WASPs living in South \nDakota, and she is believed to be the only female Native American to \nserve as a member of the WASPs in World War II.\n  Ms. Rexroat spent part of her childhood living with her grandmother \nat Vetal, SD. She graduated from St. Mary's Indian High School for \nGirls in Springfield, SD. After college, she graduated from WASPs \ntraining in the ``1944-7'' class on September 8, 1944, at Sweetwater, \nTX. She then spent 4 months towing targets for students behind a T6 \nplane at Eagle Pass Army Airfield, TX.\n  Ms. Rexroat is 91 years old and still lives independently in \nEdgemont, SD. Her vivid memories of her service are inspiring, and I am \nproud to have cosponsored the bill to provide these women the \nCongressional Gold Medal and recognize their service here on the floor \nof the Senate today.\n  While five of the other women are no longer with us, I would like to \nposthumously recognize the other women who joined from South Dakota: \nHelen (Anderson) Severson of Summit, SD, who was killed in service \nduring a flight training accident in 1943; Marjorie (Redding) \nChristiansen of Mystic, SD; Loes (Monk) MacKenzie of Salem, SD; Laurine \nNielsen of Deadwood, SD; and Maxine (Nolt) Wright DeHaven of Sioux \nFalls, SD. I would also like to recognize Violet (Thurn) Cowden \nformerly of Bowdle, SD.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/22/senate-section/article/S7866-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7866]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           35TH YEAR OF THE DIVISION AND OCCUPATION OF CYPRUS\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in commemoration of a deeply tragic \nanniversary for the Cypriot-American community, their friends and \nrelatives in Cyprus, and for the respect of human rights and \ninternational law. Thirty-five years ago this week, the armed forces of \nTurkey violated the sovereignty and territory of the Republic of Cyprus \nby illegally invading and occupying the north of the island state.\n  The international community, speaking through resolution after \nresolution by the United Nations Security Council and General Assembly, \nhas since 1974 called for an end to the division of Cyprus and the \nreturn of refugees to their homes. Yet three and a half decades later, \nthe military occupation of one third of our close and consistent ally's \nterritory by Turkey remains an intolerable reality.\n  There are more than 43,000 Turkish troops on Cyprus--that is \napproximately one Turkish soldier for every two Turkish Cypriots. The \noccupation, expropriation, transfer and destruction of Greek Cypriot-\nowned property in the north of the island proceeds unabated. Indeed, an \nestimated 7,000 to 10,000 U.S. citizens of Cypriot descent have claims \nto such properties. So too continues the wanton desecration of Greek \nOrthodox churches and religious artifacts that are not only sacred to \nhundreds of millions of faithful believers, but beautiful and historic \nsites and objects of inherent cultural value to all of humanity.\n  Despite a generation of suffering such injustices, the Greek Cypriot \ncommunity continues to demonstrate remarkable magnanimity in seeking a \nfair solution to the division of the island. Like many Hellenic-\nAmericans, I applauded Cypriot President Demetris Cristofias' effort to \nrestart the process of reuniting the island by directly engaging the \nTurkish Cypriot leadership. Although little progress has been made \ntoward resolving the most significant issues--most notably the \ndisposition of Greek Cypriots' property and the presence of Turkish \ntroops--after 36 meetings in ten months of direct negotiations, \nPresident Cristofias remains committed to continuing his talks with \nTurkish Cypriot leader Mehmet Ali Talat.\n  An additional cause for hope came this past April, when the European \nCourt of Justice ruled that a judgment of a court in the Republic of \nCyprus must be recognized and enforced by the other EU member states \neven if it concerns land situated in the Turkish occupied areas of \nCyprus. This ruling confirms the international right of Greek Cypriots \nwho were forced from their property by the Turkish occupation to seek \nrelief against those who later made use of the property illegally, \nproviding not only a measure of justice to those able to pursue such a \nclaim, but providing valuable leverage to the Republic's government in \nresolving the overall property issue.\n  These developments should strengthen our commitment in Congress to \nensuring that the United States stands by its steadfast ally, the \nRepublic of Cyprus, to achieve a resolution to the tragic division of \nthe island that is fair to Greek Cypriots. As was conclusively \ndemonstrated by the wholly justified rejection of the Annan Plan by \nGreek Cypriots in 2004, the Cyprus question is one that can only be \nresolved through mutual agreement on a solution, not the imposition of \none. In the context of the current talks, that means the United States \nmust encourage Turkey to give the leader of the Turkish Cypriot \ncommunity the leeway and authority to negotiate a solution that is \ntruly in the interests of the communities on the island, rather than \nseeking to continue its military presence.\n  The vocal support of the United States for a fair, freely negotiated \noutcome between the communities is as much a moral as it is a \ngeopolitical necessity, given that it is not just the rights of the \nGreek Cypriot community that are at stake, but our solemn role as a \nnation that champions human rights and adherence to the rule of law. I \ntherefore urge my colleagues to join me today in bearing witness to the \n35 years of injustice wreaked upon the people of the Republic of \nCyprus, and in recommitting ourselves to the urgent task of fairly and \nfinally reuniting the island.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/22/senate-section/article/S7866-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S7866-S7867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      COMMENDING DUDLEY SPOONAMORE\n\n Mr. BUNNING.

Mr. President, today, Wednesday, July 22, Claude \n``T'' Moorman II is being put to rest at Arlington National Cemetery. \n``T'' was a remarkable scholar, athlete and physician who served his \nNation with honor during the Vietnam war.\n  Born August 21, 1939, in Roanoke, VA, ``T'' grew up in Miami, FL, \nwhere he excelled in football, receiving both All State and All \nAmerican honors while playing at Miami High School; ``T'' was a popular \nstudent who was elected student body president.\n  ``T'' attended Duke University on a football scholarship. He served \nas a class officer and played football for legendary coach Bill Murray. \n``T'' caught the much celebrated game winning touchdown in the 1961 \nCotton Bowl, and he was elected to the All American Team. ``T'' Moorman \nis a member of Duke University's Athletic Hall of Fame, and in addition \nhe was named one of Florida's All-Time Top 100 Football Players and \nDuke's Top 50 Athletes of the Century.\n  But athletic prowess is not why we honor Claude ``T'' Moorman II \ntoday at Arlington National Cemetery and here in the Senate. It is, of \ncourse, for his service to our Nation that ``T'' warrants our praise \nand respect.\n  After the cheers of Saturday college football games died down for \n``T,'' he continued his education at Duke University Medical School, \ncompleting his degree in 1966 and training under another Duke legend, \nDr. Lenox Baker, this time in the field of Orthopedics. In 1970, he \nvolunteered for medical service in Vietnam, caring for our wounded \nsoldiers. Those who called ``T'' a friend know it was this experience \nthat shaped the character of ``T'' Moorman, and it is this service that \nmakes ``T'' the true all- American that he was and that we honor today. \n``T'' Moorman continued to serve with our military for 28 years.\n  Upon his return from Vietnam, ``T'' finished anesthesiology training \nat Emory, followed by a law degree from William and Mary in 1979. He \nthen served with the Army Department of Legal Medicine Armed Forces \nInstitute of Pathology in Washington DC. Before retiring from the U.S. \nArmy Reserves in 1998, Colonel Moorman commanded multiple U.S. Army \nReserve units. Additionally, during this time he opened anesthesiology \ncenters in Leesburg, VA, Stuart, FL, and Port St. Lucie, FL.\n  During the last decade of ``T''s life he fulfilled a lifelong dream \nof farming in Washington County, NC.\n  By making the choice to serve in the military during a time of war, a \ndecision which demands and deserves our respect, those in the medical \nservice make a choice to help their fellow man in the most difficult of \nsituations--combat. ``T'' showed through action part of what comprised \nhis character, morality, and strong passion for helping fellow \nAmericans. Having been an All American Football player in college, \n``T'' could have played professional football had he chosen that route. \nInstead, ``T'' made the most of his college career to obtain not only \nhis undergraduate degree but additionally two medical degrees and a law \ndegree. I think that this is an exemplary model of what a college \nathlete might strive to become. America certainly benefitted from \n``T''s choices.\n  COL Claude ``T'' Moorman II will be remembered and missed by so many \nof the soldiers that he mended and friends and family that he humored. \nHe will be forever celebrated and his legacy will never be \nforgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/22/senate-section/article/S7867-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/22/senate-section/article/S7867-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/22/senate-section/article/S7867-4", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7867]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:23 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 1622.

Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 1490. A bill to prevent and mitigate identity theft, to ensure \nprivacy, to provide notice of security breaches, and to enhance \ncriminal penalties, law enforcement assistance, and other protections \nagainst security breaches, fraudulent access, and misuse of personally \nidentifiable information; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to reintroduce the \nPersonal Data Privacy and Security Act. The recent and troubling cyber \nattack on U.S. Government computers is clear evidence that developing a \ncomprehensive national strategy for data privacy and cybersecurity is \none of the most challenging and important issues facing our nation. The \nPersonal Data Privacy and Security Act will help to meet this \nchallenge, by better protecting Americans from the growing threats of \ndata breaches and identity theft.\n  When Senator Specter and I first introduced this bill 4 years ago, we \nhad high hopes of bringing urgently needed data privacy reforms to the \nAmerican people. Although the Judiciary Committee favorably reported \nthis bill twice, in 2005 and again in 2007, the legislation languished \non the Senate calendar and the Senate adjourned without passing \ncomprehensive data privacy legislation.\n  While the Congress has waited to act, the dangers to our privacy, \neconomic prosperity and national security posed by data breaches have \nnot gone away. Just this week, the Government Accountability Office \nreleased a report finding that almost all of our major federal agencies \nhave systemic weaknesses in the information security controls. \nAccording to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, more than 250 million \nrecords containing sensitive personal information have been involved in \ndata security breaches since 2005.\n  This loss of privacy is not just a grave concern for American \nconsumers; it is also a serious threat to the economic security of \nAmerican businesses. The President's recent report on Cyberspace Policy \nReview noted that industry estimates of losses from intellectual \nproperty to data theft in 2008 range as high as $1 trillion.\n  The FBI's Internet Fraud Complaint Center also recently reported that\n\n[[Page S7872]]\n\ncomplaints of Internet fraud increased by 33 percent in 2008. These \ntroubling reports are all compelling examples of why we need to \npromptly pass the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act.\n  Earlier this year, the Judiciary Committee held an important hearing \non the privacy risks associated with electronic health records as the \nNation moves towards a national health IT system. I am pleased that \nmany of the privacy principles developed during that hearing have been \nenacted as part of the President's economic recovery package.\n  The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act requires that data brokers \nlet consumers know what sensitive personal information they have about \nthem, and to allow individuals to correct inaccurate information. The \nbill also requires that companies that have databases with sensitive \npersonal information on Americans establish and implement data privacy \nand security programs.\n  In addition, the bill requires notice when sensitive personal \ninformation has been compromised. This bill also provides for tough \ncriminal penalties for anyone who would intentionally and willfully \nconceal the fact that a data breach has occurred when the breach causes \neconomic damage to consumers. Finally, the bill addresses the important \nissue of the government's use of personal data by requiring that \nfederal agencies notify affected individuals when government data \nbreaches occur, and placing privacy and security front and center when \nfederal agencies evaluate whether data brokers can be trusted with \ngovernment contracts that involve sensitive information about the \nAmerican people.\n  Of course, Senator Specter and I have no monopoly on good ideas to \nsolve the serious problems of identity theft and lax cybersecurity. \nBut, we have put forth some meaningful solutions to this problem in \nthis bill.\n  We have drafted this bill after long and thoughtful consultation with \nmany of the stakeholders on this issue, including the privacy, consumer \nprotection and business communities. We have also worked closely with \nother Senators, including Senators Feinstein, Feingold, and Schumer.\n  This is a comprehensive bill that not only deals with the need to \nprovide Americans with notice when they have been victims of a data \nbreach, but that also deals with the underlying problem of lax security \nand lack of accountability to help prevent data breaches from occurring \nin the first place. Passing this comprehensive data privacy legislation \nis one of my highest legislative priorities as Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, and I hope all Senators will support this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1490\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds that--\n       (1) databases of personally identifiable information are \n     increasingly prime targets of hackers, identity thieves, \n     rogue employees, and other criminals, including organized and \n     sophisticated criminal operations;\n       (2) identity theft is a serious threat to the Nation's \n     economic stability, homeland security, the development of e-\n     commerce, and the privacy rights of Americans;\n       (3) over 9,300,000 individuals were victims of identity \n     theft in America last year;\n       (4) security breaches are a serious threat to consumer \n     confidence, homeland security, e-commerce, and economic \n     stability;\n       (5) it is important for business entities that own, use, or \n     license personally identifiable information to adopt \n     reasonable procedures to ensure the security, privacy, and \n     confidentiality of that personally identifiable information;\n       (6) individuals whose personal information has been \n     compromised or who have been victims of identity theft should \n     receive the necessary information and assistance to mitigate \n     their damages and to restore the integrity of their personal \n     information and identities;\n       (7) data brokers have assumed a significant role in \n     providing identification, authentication, and screening \n     services, and related data collection and analyses for \n     commercial, nonprofit, and government operations;\n       (8) data misuse and use of inaccurate data have the \n     potential to cause serious or irreparable harm to an \n     individual's livelihood, privacy, and liberty and undermine \n     efficient and effective business and government operations;\n       (9) there is a need to insure that data brokers conduct \n     their operations in a manner that prioritizes fairness, \n     transparency, accuracy, and respect for the privacy of \n     consumers;\n       (10) government access to commercial data can potentially \n     improve safety, law enforcement, and national security; and\n       (11) because government use of commercial data containing \n     personal information potentially affects individual privacy, \n     and law enforcement and national security operations, there \n     is a need for Congress to exercise oversight over government \n     use of commercial data.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthat corporate tax benefits based upon stock option compensation \nexpenses be consistent with accounting expenses shown in corporate \nfinancial statements for such compensation; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, Senator McCain and I are introducing today \na bill to eliminate Federal corporate tax breaks that give special tax \ntreatment to corporations that pay their executives with stock options. \nIt is called the Ending excessive Corporate Deductions for Stock \nOptions Act, and it has been endorsed by OMB Watch, the Consumer \nFederation of America, the Tax Justice Network-USA, and the AFL-CIO.\n  We are in a financial crisis. We are spending hundreds of billions of \ntaxpayer dollars to try to stop the housing bust and prop up Wall \nStreet. Too many of the middle class are watching the American dream \nslip away, while executives are getting mutli-million dollar \ncompensation packages.\n  At the same time, mismatched stock option accounting and tax rules \nare shortchanging the Treasury to the tune of billions of dollars each \nyear, while fueling the growing chasm between executive pay and average \nworker pay. The mismatch is this: companies are allowed to report one \nset of stock option compensation expenses to investors and the public \nthrough their public financial statements, and a completely different \nset of expenses to the Internal Revenue Service, IRS, on their tax \nreturns. Put simply, our precious tax dollars are being wasted by an \noutdated and unfair corporate tax loophole that encourages corporations \nto hand out massive stock option grants to their executives. It is time \nto put an end to the excessive tax deductions being reaped by \ncorporations at taxpayers' expense.\n  J.P. Morgan once said that executive pay should not exceed 20 times \naverage worker pay. In the United States, in 1990, average pay for the \nchief executive officer of a large U.S. corporation was 100 times \naverage worker pay. Recently, CEO pay was nearly 400 times that of the \naverage worker.\n  The single biggest factor responsible for this massive pay gap is \nstock options. Stock options are a huge contributor to executive pay. A \nkey factor encouraging companies to pay their executives with stock \noptions is the misguided Federal tax system that favors stock options \nover other types of compensation. Stock options give employees the \nright to buy company stock at a set price for a specified period of \ntime, often 5 or 10 years. Virtually every CEO in America is paid with \nstock options, which are a major contributor to sky-high executive pay. \nAccording to Forbes magazine, in 2008, the CEOs at the 500 largest U.S. \ncompanies took home a combined $5.7 billion, averaging $11.4 million \neach.\n  For example, according to an Equilar Inc. analysis of 2008 filings \nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, SEC, Oracle Corporation's \nCEO was granted options estimated in value at more than $71 million \njust last year. That grant was on top of the pay he received from \nvested and exercised stock options given to him by his company in the \npast. In 2008 alone, those stock options amounted to a personal gain of \nmore than $543 million. That is $543 million in stock option gains in a \nsingle year. Stunningly, his company gets to deduct this outlandish \n``compensation'' from its taxes--even though the company never paid him \nthat amount, and even though the existing tax code generally limits \ncorporate deductions for executive pay to $1 million per executive.\n  Oracle's CEO was not alone. Equilar has identified dozens of U.S. \nexecutives who obtained tens of millions or even hundreds of millions \nof dollars from stock options in 2008. For example, the CEO of Qualcomm \nInc., had $209 million in stock options gains in 2008, while the CEO of \nOccidental Petroleum had gains of $184 million.\n\n  Between the repricing of some stock options and grants being made \nwhile stock prices are low, the recent stock market recovery will \nlikely mean that many executives will continue to reap astronomical \nstock option-related compensation, and their companies will continue to \nreap unwarranted tax deductions from stock options gains.\n  Why do corporate executives have so many stock options to cash in? A \nkey reason is that U.S. accounting rules allow companies to report \ntheir stock option expenses one way on the corporate books, while \nFederal tax rules require them to report the same stock options a \ncompletely different way on their tax returns. In most cases, the \nresulting book expense is far smaller than the resulting tax deduction. \nThat means, under current U.S. accounting and tax rules, stock option \ntax deductions taken by corporations often far exceed the recorded \nstock option expenses shown on the companies' books. The result is a \ntax windfall.\n  Stock options are the only type of compensation where the Federal tax \ncode permits companies to claim a bigger deduction on their tax returns \nthan the corresponding expense on their books. For all other types of \ncompensation--cash, stock, bonuses, and more--the tax return deduction \nequals the book expense. In fact, companies cannot deduct more than the \ncompensation expense shown on their books, because that would be tax \nfraud. The sole exception to this rule is stock options. In the case of \nstock options, the tax code allows companies to claim a tax deduction \nthat can be two, three, ten or one hundred times larger than the \nexpense shown on their books.\n  When a company's compensation committee learns that stock options can \nproduce a low compensation expense on the books, while generating a \ngenerous tax deduction that is multiple times larger, it creates a \ntemptation for the company to pay its executives with stock options \ninstead of cash or stock. It is a classic case of U.S. tax policy \ncreating an unintended incentive for corporations to act in a \nparticular way.\n  This bill is particularly timely given the new administration's \nstated goals to close unfair corporate tax loopholes, strengthen tax \nfairness, and reign in excessive executive compensation. Given the \ncurrent financial crisis, staggering health care costs, and ongoing \ndefense needs, now more than ever, we cannot afford this multi-billion \ndollar loss to the Treasury.\n  To understand why this bill is needed it helps to understand how \nstock option accounting and tax rules got so out of kilter with each \nother in the first place.\n  Calculating the cost of stock options may sound straightforward, but \nfor years, companies and their accountants engaged the Financial \nAccounting Standards Board (FASB) in an all-out, knock-down battle over \nhow companies should record stock option compensation expenses on their \nbooks.\n  U.S. publicly traded corporations are required by law to follow \nGenerally Accepted Accounting Principles, GAAP, issued by FASB, which \nis overseen by the SEC. For many years, GAAP allowed U.S. companies to \nissue stock options to employees and, unlike any other type of \ncompensation, report a zero compensation expense on their books, so \nlong as, on the grant date, the stock option's exercise price equaled \nthe market price at which the stock could be sold.\n  Assigning a zero value to stock options that routinely produce huge \namounts of executive pay provoked deep disagreements within the \naccounting community. In 1993, FASB proposed assigning a ``fair value'' \nto stock options on the date they are granted to an employee, using \nmathematical valuation tools. FASB proposed further that companies \ninclude that amount as a compensation expense on their financial \nstatements. A battle over stock option expensing followed, involving \nthe accounting profession, corporate executives, FASB, the SEC, and \nCongress.\n\n  In the end, after years of fighting and negotiation, FASB issued a \nnew accounting standard, Financial Accounting Standard, FAS, 123R, \nwhich was endorsed by the SEC and became mandatory for all publicly \ntraded corporations in 2005. In essence, FAS 123R requires all \ncompanies to record a compensation expense equal to the fair value on \ngrant date of all stock options provided to an employee in exchange for \nthe employee's services.\n  The details of this accounting rule are complex, because they reflect \nan effort to accommodate varying viewpoints on the true cost of stock \noptions. Companies are allowed to use a variety of mathematical models, \nfor\n\n[[Page S7881]]\n\nexample, to calculate a stock option's fair value. Option grants that \nvest over time are expensed over the specified period so that, for \nexample, a stock option which vests over four years results in 25 \npercent of the cost being expensed each year. If a stock option grant \nnever vests, the rule allows any previously booked expense to be \nrecovered. On the other hand, stock options that do vest are required \nto be fully expensed, even if never exercised, because the compensation \nwas actually awarded. These and other provisions of this hard-fought \naccounting rule reflect painstaking judgments on how to show a stock \noption's value.\n  Opponents of the new accounting rule had predicted that, if \nimplemented, it would severely damage U.S. capital markets. They warned \nthat stock option expensing would eliminate corporate profits, \ndiscourage investment, depress stock prices, and stifle innovation. \n2006 was the first year in which all U.S. publicly traded companies \nwere required to expense stock options. Instead of tumbling, both the \nNew York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq turned in strong performances, as \ndid initial public offerings by new companies. The dire predictions \nwere wrong. Stock option expensing has been fully implemented without \nany detrimental impact to the markets.\n  During the years the battle raged over stock option accounting, \nrelatively little attention was paid to the taxation of stock options. \nSection 83 of the tax code, first enacted in 1969 and still in place \nafter four decades, is the key statutory provision. It essentially \nprovides that, when an employee exercises compensatory stock options, \nthe employee must report as income the difference between what the \nemployee paid to exercise the options and the market value of the stock \nreceived. The corporation can then take a mirror deduction for whatever \namount of income the employee realized.\n  For example, suppose a company gave an executive options to buy 1 \nmillion shares of the company stock at $10 per share. Suppose, 5 years \nlater, the executive exercised the options when the stock was selling \nat $30 per share. The executive's income would be $20 per share for a \ntotal of $20 million. The executive would declare $20 million as \nordinary income, and in the same year, the company would take a \ncorresponding tax deduction for $20 million.\n  The two main problems with this approach are that: the deduction \namount is significantly greater than the value of what the company gave \naway, often years earlier, and the $20 million in income obtained by \nthe executive did not come out of the company's coffers. In most cases, \nthe $20 million was paid by unrelated parties on the stock market. Yet \nthe tax code allowed the corporation to declare the $20 million as a \nbusiness expense and take it as a tax deduction. The reasoning was that \nthe exercise date value was the only way to get a clear figure for \nstock option tax deduction purposes. That reasoning lost its persuasive \ncharacter, however, once consensus was reached on how to calculate \nstock option expenses when granted.\n\n  Stock option accounting and tax rules have evolved separately over \nthe years and are now at odds with each other. Accounting rules require \ncompanies to expense stock options on their books on the grant date. \nTax rules provide that companies deduct stock option expenses on the \nexercise date. Companies have to report the grant date expense to \ninvestors on their financial statements, and the exercise date expense \non their tax returns. The financial statements report on all stock \noptions granted during the year, while the tax returns report on all \nstock options exercised during the year. In short, company financial \nstatements and tax returns identify expenses for different groups of \nstock options, using different valuation methods, and resulting in \nwidely divergent stock option expenses for the same year.\n  To examine the nature and consequences of the stock option book-tax \ndifferences, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, which I \nchair, initiated an investigation and held a hearing 2 years ago, in \nJune 2007. Here is what we found.\n  To test just how far the book and tax figures for stock options \ndiverge, the Subcommittee contacted a number of companies to compare \nthe stock option expenses they reported for accounting and tax \npurposes. The Subcommittee asked each company to identify stock options \nthat had been exercised by one or more of its executives from 2002 to \n2006. The Subcommittee then asked each company to identify the \ncompensation expense they reported on their financial statements versus \nthe compensation expense on their tax returns. In addition, we asked \nthe companies' help in estimating what effect the new accounting rule \nwould have had on their book expense if it had been in place when their \nstock options were granted. At the hearing, we disclosed the resulting \nstock option data for 9 companies, including three companies that were \nasked to testify. The Subcommittee very much appreciated the \ncooperation and assistance provided by the nine companies we worked \nwith.\n  The data provided by the companies showed that, under then existing \nrules, the nine companies showed a zero expense on their books for that \nstock options that had been awarded to their executives, but claimed \nmillions of dollars in tax deductions for the same compensation. The \none exception was Occidential Petroleum which, in 2005, began \nvoluntarily expensing its stock options, but even this company reported \nsignificantly greater tax deductions than the stock option expenses \nshown on its books. When the Subcommittee asked the companies what \ntheir book expense would have been if the new FASB rule had been in \neffect, all nine calculated book expenses that remained dramatically \nlower than their tax deductions. Altogether the 9 companies calculated \nthat they would have claimed $1 billion more in stock option tax \ndeductions than they would have shown as book expenses, even using the \ntougher new accounting rule. Let me repeat that--just nine companies \nproduced a stock option book-tax difference of more than $1 billion.\n  KB Home, for example, is a company that builds residential homes. Its \nstock price had more than quadrupled over the past 10 years. Over the \nsame time period, it had repeatedly granted stock options to its then \nCEO. Company records show that, over five years, KB Home gave him 5.5 \nmillion stock options of which, by 2006, he had exercised more than 3 \nmillion.\n  With respect to those 3 million stock options, KB Home recorded a \nzero expense on its books. Had the new accounting rule been in effect, \nKB Home calculated that it would have reported on its books a \ncompensation expense of about $11.5 million. KB Home also disclosed \nthat the same 3 million stock options enabled it to claim compensation \nexpenses on its tax returns totaling about $143.7 million. In other \nwords, KB Home claimed a $143 million tax deduction for expenses that \non its books, under current accounting rules, would have totaled $11.5 \nmillion. That's a tax deduction 12 times bigger than the book expense.\n  Occidental Petroleum disclosed a similar book-tax discrepancy. This \ncompany's stock price had also skyrocketed, dramatically increasing the \nvalue of the 16 million stock options granted to its CEO since 1993. Of \nthe 12 million stock options the CEO actually exercised over a five-\nyear period, Occidental Petroleum claimed a $353 million tax deduction \nfor a book expense that, under current accounting rules, would have \ntotaled just $29 million. That's a book-tax difference of more than \n1200 percent.\n  Similar book-tax discrepancies applied to the other companies we \nexamined. Cisco System's CEO exercised nearly 19 million stock options \nover 5 years, and provided the company with a $169 million tax \ndeduction for a book expense which, under current accounting rules, \nwould have totaled about $21 million. UnitedHealth's former CEO \nexercised over 9 million stock options in 5 years, providing the \ncompany with a $318 million tax deduction for a book expense which \nwould have totaled about $46 million. Safeway's CEO exercised over 2 \nmillion stock options, providing the company with a $39 million tax \ndeduction for a book expense which would have totaled about $6.5 \nmillion.\n  Altogether, these nine companies took stock option tax deductions \ntotaling $1.2 billion, a figure 5 times larger than the $217 million \nthat their combined stock option book expenses would have been. The \nresulting $1 billion in excess tax deductions represents\n\n[[Page S7882]]\n\na tax windfall for these companies simply because they issued lots of \nstock options to their CEOs.\n  Tax rules that produce huge tax deductions that are many times larger \nthan the related stock option book expenses give companies an incentive \nto issue massive stock option grants, because they know the stock \noptions will produce a relatively small hit to the profits shown on \ntheir books, while also knowing that they are likely to get a much \nlarger tax deduction that can dramatically lower their taxes.\n  The data we gathered for nine companies alone disclosed stock option \ntax deductions that were five times larger than their book expenses, \ngenerating over $1 billion in excess tax deductions. To gauge whether \nthe same tax gap applied to stock options across the country as a \nwhole, the Subcommittee asked the IRS to perform an analysis of some \nnewly obtained stock option data.\n  For the first time in 2004, large corporations were required to file \na new tax Schedule M-3 with their tax returns. The M-3 Schedule asks \ncompanies to identify differences in how they report corporate income \nto investors versus what they report to Uncle Sam, so that the IRS can \ntrack and analyze significant book-tax differences.\n  This data shows that, for corporate tax returns filed form July 1, \n2005 to June 30, 2006, the first full year in which it was available, \ncompanies' stock option tax deductions totaled about $61 billion more \nthan their stock options expenses on their books. Similar data for July \n1, 2006 to June 30, 2007, showed that the excess stock option tax \ndeductions totaled about $48 billion. In addition, the IRS data shows \nthat nearly 60 percent of the excess tax deductions in 2007 were \nattributable to only 100 corporations; 75 percent were attributable to \nonly 250 corporations. The IRS also determined that stock options were \none of the most important factors why corporations reported different \nincome on their books compared to their tax returns.\n\n  Claiming these massive stock option tax deductions enabled U.S. \ncorporations, as a whole, to legally reduce payment of their taxes by \nbillions of dollars, perhaps as much as $10 billion, $15 billion, even \n$20 billion per year.\n  There were other surprises in the data as well. One set of issues \ndisclosed by the data involves what happens to unexercised stock \noptions. Under the current mismatched set of accounting and tax rules, \nstock options which are granted, vested, but never exercised by the \noption holder turn out to produce a corporate book expense but no tax \ndeduction.\n  Cisco Systems told the Subcommittee, for example, that in addition to \nthe 19 million exercised stock options previously mentioned, their CEO \nheld about 8 million options that, due to a stock price drop, would \nlikely expire without being exercised. Cisco calculated that, had FAS \n123R been in effect a the time those options were granted, the company \nwould have had to show a $139 million book expense, but would never be \nable to claim a tax deduction for this expense since the options would \nnever be exercised. Apple made a similar point. It told the \nSubcommittee that, in 2003, it allowed its CEO to trade 17.5 million in \nunderwater stock options for 5 million shares of restricted stock. That \ntrade meant the stock options would never be exercised and, under \ncurrent rules, would produce a book expense without ever producing a \ntax deduction.\n  In both of these cases, under FAS 123R, it is possible that the stock \noptions given to a corporate executive would have produced a reported \nbook expense greater than the company's tax deduction. While the M-3 \ndata indicates that, overall, accounting expenses lag far behind \nclaimed tax deductions, the possible financial impact on an individual \ncompany of a large number of unexercised stock options is additional \nevidence that existing stock option accounting and tax rules are out of \nkilter and should be brought into alignment. Under our bill, if a \ncompany incurred a stock option expense, it would always be able to \nclaim a tax deduction for that expense.\n  Another set of issues brought to light by theIRS data focuses on the \nfact that the current stock option tax deduction is typically claimed \nyears later than the initial book expense. Normally, a corporation \ndispenses compensation to an employee and takes a tax deduction in the \nsame year for the expense. The company controls the timing and amount \nof the compensation expense and the corresponding tax deduction. With \nrespect to stock options, however, corporations may have to wait years \nto see if, when, and how much of a deduction can be taken. That is \nbecause the corporate tax deduction is wholly dependent upon when an \nindividual corporate executive decides to exercise his or her stock \noptions.\n  Our bill would require that, when the company gives away something of \nvalue, it reflects that expense on its books and claims that same \nexpense on its tax return. The company, and the government, should not \nhave to wait to see whether the stock options given to executives later \nincreased in value and were exercised. As with any other form of \ncompensation, the company should determine the value of what it is \ngiving away, and take the appropriate tax deduction at that time.\n  UnitedHealth, for example, told the Subcommittee that it gave its \nformer CEO 8 million stock options in 1999, of which, by 2006, only \nabout 730,000 had been exercised. It did not know if or when its former \nCEO would exercise the remaining 7 million options, and so could not \ncalculate when or how much of a tax deduction it would be able to claim \nfor this compensation expense.\n\n  If the rules for stock option tax deductions were changed as \nsuggested in our bill, companies would typically be able to take the \ndeduction years earlier than they do now, without waiting to see if and \nwhen particular options are exercised. Companies would also be allowed \nto deduct stock options that are vested but never exercised. In \naddition, by requiring stock option expenses to be deducted in the same \nyear they appear on the company books, stock options would become \nconsistent with how other forms of compensation are treated in the tax \ncode.\n  Right now, U.S. stock option accounting and tax rules are mismatched, \nmisaligned, and out of kilter. They allow companies collectively to \ndeduct billions of dollars in stock option expenses in excess of the \nexpenses that actually appear on the company books. They disallow tax \ndeductions for stock options that are given as compensation but never \nexercised. They often force companies to wait years to claim a tax \ndeduction for a compensation expense that could and should be claimed \nin the same year it appears on the company books.\n  The Levin-McCain bill we are introducing today would cure these \nproblems. It would bring stock option accounting and tax rules into \nalignment, so that the two sets of rules would apply in a consistent \nmanner. It would accomplish that goal simply by requiring the corporate \nstock option tax deduction to be no greater than the stock option \nexpenses shown on the corporate books each year.\n  Specifically, the bill would end use of the current stock option \ndeduction under Section 83 of the tax code, which allows corporations \nto deduct stock option expenses when exercised in an amount equal to \nthe income declared by the individual exercising the option, replacing \nit with a new Section 162(q), which would require companies to deduct \nthe stock option expenses shown on their books each year.\n  The bill would apply only to corporate stock option deductions; it \nwould make no changes to the rules that apply to individuals who have \nbeen given stock options as part of their compensation. Individuals \nwould still report their compensation on the day they exercised their \nstock options. They would still report as income the difference between \nwhat they paid to exercise the options and the fair market value of the \nstock they received upon exercise. The gain would continue to be \ntreated as ordinary income rather than a capital gain, since the option \nholder did not invest any capital in the stock prior to exercising the \nstock option and the only reason the person obtained the stock was \nbecause of the services they performed for the corporation.\n  The amount of income declared by the individual after exercising a \nstock option will likely often be greater than the stock option expense \nbooked and deducted by the corporation who employed that individual. \nThat's in part because the individual's gain often comes years later \nthan the original\n\n[[Page S7883]]\n\nstock option grant, and the underlying stock will usually have gained \nin value. In addition, the individual's gain is typically provided, not \nby the corporation that supplied the stock options years earlier, but \nby third parties active in the stock market.\n  Consider the same example discussed earlier of an executive who \nexercises options to buy 1 million shares of stock at $10 per share, \nobtains the shares from the corporation, and then immediately sells \nthem on the open market for $30 per share, making a toal profit of $20 \nmillion. The individual's corporation didn't supply the $20 million. \nJust the opposite. Rather than paying cash to its executive, the \ncorporation received a $10 million payment from the executive in \nexchange for the 1 million shares. The $20 million profit from \nselling the shares was paid, not by the corporation, but by third \nparties in the marketplace who purchased the stock. That is why it \nmakes no sense for the company to declare as an expense the amount of \nprofit that an employee--or former employee--obtained from unrelated \nparties in the marketplace.\n\n  The bill we are introducing today would put an end to the current \napproach of using the stock option income declared by an individual as \nthe tax deduction claimed by the corporation that supplied the stock \noptions. It would break that old artificial symmetry and replace it \nwith a new symmetry--one in which the corporation's stock option tax \ndeduction would match its book expense.\n  I describe the current approach to corporate stock option deductions \nas artificial, because it uses a construct in the tax code that, when \nfirst implemented 40 years ago, enabled corporations to calculate their \nstock option expense on the exercise date, when there was no consensus \non how to calculate stock option expenses on the grant date. The \nartificiality of the approach is demonstrated by the fact that it \nallows companies to claim a deductible expense for money that comes not \nfrom company coffers, but from third parties in the stock market. Now \nthat U.S. accounting rules require the calculation of stock option \nexpenses on the grant date, however, there is no longer any need to \nrely on an artificial construct that calculated corporate stock option \nexpenses on the exercise date using third party funds.\n  It is also important to note that the bill would not affect in any \nway current tax provisions that provide favored tax treatment to so-\ncalled Incentive Stock Options under Sections 421 and 422 of the tax \ncode. Under those sections, in certain circumstances, corporations can \nsurrender their stock option deductions in favor of allowing their \nemployees with stock option gains to be taxed at a capital gains rate \ninstead of ordinary income tax rates. Many start-up companies use these \ntypes of stock options, because they don't yet have taxable profits and \ndon't need a stock option tax deduction. So they forfeit their stock \noption corporate deduction in favor of giving their employees more \nfavorable treatment of their stock option income. Incentive Stock \nOptions would not be affected by our legislation and would remain \navailable to any corporation providing stock options to its employees.\n  The bill would make one other important change to the tax code as it \nrelates to corporate stock option tax deductions. In 1993, Congress \nenacted a $1 million cap on the compensation that a corporation can \ndeduct from its taxes, so taxpayers would not be forced to subsidize \nexcessive executive pay. However, the cap was not applied to stock \noptions, allowing companies to deduct any amount of stock option \ncompensation, without limit.\n  By not applying the $1 million cap to stock option compensation, the \ntax code created a significant incentive for corporations to pay their \nexecutives with stock options. Indeed, it is very common for executives \nto have salaries of $1 million, while simultaneously receiving millions \nof dollars more in stock options. It is effectively meaningless to cap \ndeductions for executive salary compensation but not also for stock \noptions.\n  Further, while corporate directors may be comfortable diluting their \nshareholders' interests and doling out massive amounts of stock \noptions, that does not mean that the taxpayers should subsidize it. \nThis bill would eliminate this favored treatment of executive stock \noptions by making deductions for this type of compensation subject to \nthe same $1 million cap that applies to other forms of compensation \ncovered by Section 162(m).\n  The bill also contains several technical provisions. First, it would \nmake a conforming change to the research tax credit so that stock \noption expenses claimed under that credit would match the stock option \ndeductions taken under the new tax code section 162(q). Second, the \nbill would authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to adopt regulations \ngoverning how to calculate the deduction for stock options issued by a \nparent corporation to the employees of a subsidiary.\n\n  Finally, the bill contains a transition rule for applying the new \nSection 162(q) stock option tax deduction to existing and future stock \noption grants. This transition rule would make it clear that the new \ntax deduction would not apply to any stock option exercised prior to \nthe date of enactment of the bill.\n  The bill would also allow the old Section 83 deduction rules to apply \nto any option which was vested prior to the effective date of Financial \nAccounting Standard, FAS, 123R, and exercised after the date of \nenactment of the bill. The effective date of FAS 123R is June 15, 2005 \nfor most corporations, and December 31, 2005 for most small businesses. \nPrior to the effective date of FAS 123R, most corporations would have \nshown a zero expense on their books for the stock options issued to \ntheir executives and, thus, would be unable to claim a tax deduction \nunder the new Section 162(q). For that reason, the bill would allow \nthese corporations to continue to use Section 83 to claim stock option \ndeductions on their tax returns.\n  For stock options that vested after the effective date of FAS 123R \nand were exercised after the date of enactment, the bill takes another \ntack. Under FAS 123R, these corporations would have had to show the \nappropriate stock option expense on their books, but would have been \nunable to take a tax deduction until the executive actually exercised \nthe option. For these options, the bill would allow corporations to \ntake an immediate tax deduction--in the first year that the bill is in \neffect--for all of the expenses shown on their books with respect to \nthese options. This ``catch-up deduction'' in the first year after \nenactment would enable corporations, in the following years, to begin \nwith a clean slate so that their tax returns the next year would \nreflect their actual stock option book expenses for that same year.\n  After that catch-up year, all stock option expenses incurred by a \ncompany each year would be reflected in their annual tax deductions \nunder the new Section 162(q).\n  The current differences between accounting and tax rules for stock \noptions make no sense.\n  The current book-tax difference is the historical product of \naccounting and tax policies that have not been coordinated or \nintegrated. The resulting mismatch has allowed companies to take tax \ndeductions that are usually many times larger than the actual stock \noption expenses shown on their books, at the expense of the Treasury \n(i.e., other taxpayers). Companies are incentivized to dole out \nexcessive options packages, producing outsized executive pay, while \nbeing allowed to reflect much smaller ``expenses'' on their books. They \nget to avoid paying their fair share to Uncle Sam by simply giving \ntheir executives the rights to huge sums of money from the financial \nmarkets.\n  Right now, stock options are the only compensation expense where the \ntax code allows companies to deduct more than their book expenses. In \nthe last year for which the data is available, companies used the \nexisting book-tax disparity to claim $48 billion more in stock option \ntax deductions than the expenses shown on their books. In these times \nof financial crisis, we cannot afford this multi-billion dollar loss to \nthe Treasury, not only because of the need to finance the mounting \ncosts of rescuing the economy, but also because this stock option book-\ntax difference contributes to the anger and social disruption caused by \nthe ever deepening chasm between the pay of executives and the pay of \naverage workers.\n\n[[Page S7884]]\n\n  The Obama administration has pledged itself to closing unfair \ncorporate tax loopholes and to returning sanity to executive pay.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to fund \nbreakthroughs in Alzheimer's disease research while providing more help \nto caregivers and increasing public education about prevention; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today, I rise to introduce the \nAlzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2009. This critical bipartisan \nlegislation passed the HELP Committee in 2007, but it has yet to pass \nthe Senate. My hope is that we can finish the job this year and finally \nget this legislation signed into law.\n  Alzheimer's' disease is an alarming and mounting crisis that we must \naddress. Today there are over five million Americans living with \nAlzheimer's disease. That number is expected to triple by 2050 in a \nnation where ten million Americans care for a sick family member.\n  We know a lot about Alzheimer's disease but it's been 100 years since \nit was first diagnosed, and we still have no cure or proven ways to \nprevent the disease. Urgency is needed in developing better treatments \nand better assistance for families impacted by the disease as the baby \nboom generation ages. If nothing is done, Alzheimer's will cost \nMedicare and Medicaid $19.89 trillion between 2010 and 2050.\n  The Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2009 responds to this crisis in \nfour ways.\n  First, it doubles funding for Alzheimer's research at NIH to $2 \nbillion for fiscal year 2010, making Alzheimer's research a priority. \nThrough this commitment, the bill gives researchers adequate resources \nto make breakthroughs in diagnosis, prevention and intervention, \nbringing us closer to a cure.\n  Second, the bill creates the National Summit on Alzheimer's. This \nSummit will bring together the Nation's best researchers, policymakers \nand public health professionals to discuss the most promising \nbreakthroughs for saving lives and livelihood, and to generate \npriorities in moving forward in the fight against Alzheimer's.\n  Third, the act enhances public health activities related to \nAlzheimer's through the CDC's ``Roadmap to Maintaining Cognitive \nHealth.''\n\n[[Page S7885]]\n\n  Finally, the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act provides family and \ncaregiver support by expanding the Alzheimer's 24/7 call center, which \nprovides crisis assistance and referrals to local community programs. \nThe bill also expands the multilingual capacity of the call center.\n  America needs this legislation. Alzheimer's takes a toll on many \nvictims. The disease is awful for the person living with it, \nemotionally and financially draining for caregivers and it is now \ncosting the nation $175 billion annually, a number that could rise to \n$1 trillion annually by 2050.\n  We know the family of an Alzheimer's patient suffers gravely. The \nout-of-pocket cost of caring for an aging parent or spouse averages \nabout $5,500 a year for necessities like groceries, household goods and \ndrugs and medical copayments. If the care is long-distance, the cost \ncould be up to $8,700 a year. Caregivers spend ten percent of their \nhousehold income caring for a sick loved one who is suffering from this \nterrible disease.\n  Experts have told us ``we will lose opportunities if we don't move \nquickly'' and that ``we are at a crucial point where NIH funding can \nmake a difference.'' We know about the long goodbye. Alzheimer's is a \ndisease that affects millions of Americans including our All-American \nPresident Ronald Reagan and his beloved caregiver, First Lady Nancy \nReagan. Now we need a response supported by millions that will lead to \nbreakthroughs and ensure we are assisting patients and their families \ndealing with this disease on a daily basis.\n  Passage of the Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act of 2009 will help us \nadvance the study and treatment of Alzheimer's to make a difference in \nthe lives of millions of Americans and to equip caregivers with the \nresources and support services they need to care for their loved ones. \nThis legislation is critical to the American public and America's \nfuture. We must act now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1492\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Alzheimer's Breakthrough Act \n     of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Alzheimer's disease is a disorder that destroys cells \n     in the brain. The disease is the leading cause of dementia, a \n     condition that involves gradual memory loss, decline in the \n     ability to perform routine tasks, disorientation, difficulty \n     in learning, loss of language skills, impairment of judgment, \n     and personality changes. As the disease progresses, people \n     with Alzheimer's disease become unable to care for \n     themselves. The loss of brain cells eventually leads to the \n     failure of other systems in the body.\n       (2) An estimated 5,300,000 Americans have Alzheimer's \n     disease and 1 in 10 individuals has a family member with the \n     disease. By 2050, the number of individuals with the disease \n     could reach 16,000,000 unless science finds a way to prevent \n     or cure the disease.\n       (3) One in 8 people over the age of 65, and nearly half of \n     those over the age of 85 have Alzheimer's disease. Younger \n     people also get the disease.\n       (4) The Alzheimer's disease process may begin in the brain \n     as many as 20 years before the symptoms of Alzheimer's \n     disease appear. An individual will live an average of 4 to 6 \n     years, and as many as 20 years, once the symptoms of \n     Alzheimer's disease appear.\n       (5) In 2005, Medicare alone spent $91,000,000,000 for the \n     care of individuals with Alzheimer's disease and this amount \n     is projected to increase to $160,000,000,000 in 2010.\n       (6) Ninety-five percent of Medicare beneficiaries with \n     Alzheimer's disease have one or more other chronic conditions \n     that are common in the elderly, such as coronary heart \n     disease (26 percent), congestive heart failure (16 percent), \n     diabetes (23 percent), and chronic obstructive pulmonary \n     disease (15 percent).\n       (7) Seven in 10 individuals with Alzheimer's disease live \n     at home. Cost for care at home is higher for people with \n     Alzheimer's disease than other individuals. Almost all \n     families pay some out-of-pocket costs.\n       (8) Half of all nursing home residents have Alzheimer's \n     disease or a related disorder. The average annual cost of \n     Alzheimer's disease nursing home care is more than $77,000. \n     Medicaid pays half of the total nursing home bill and helps 2 \n     out of 3 residents pay for their care. Medicaid expenditures \n     for nursing home care for people with Alzheimer's disease are \n     estimated to increase from $21,000,000,000 in 2005 to \n     $24,000,000,000 in 2010.\n       (9) In fiscal year 2007, the Federal Government spent an \n     estimated $411,000,000 on Alzheimer's disease research. Over \n     the next 40 years, Alzheimer's disease-related costs to \n     Medicare and Medicaid alone are projected to total \n     $20,000,000,000,000 in constant dollars, rising to over \n     $1,000,000,000,000 per year by 2050. This amounts to less \n     than a penny spent on Alzheimer's disease research for each \n     dollar that the Federal Government spends on Alzheimer's \n     disease-related costs each year.\n       (10) It is estimated that the annual value of the informal \n     care system is $94,000,000,000. Family caregiving comes at \n     enormous physical, emotional, and financial sacrifice, \n     putting the whole system at risk.\n       (11) Almost 60 percent of caregivers of individuals with \n     Alzheimer's disease are women, and over one-fourth have \n     children or grandchildren under the age of 18 living at home. \n     Caregiving leaves them less time for other family members and \n     they are much more likely to report family conflicts because \n     of their caregiving role.\n       (12) Most Alzheimer's disease caregivers work outside the \n     home before beginning their caregiving careers, but \n     caregiving forces them to miss work, cut back to part-time, \n     take less demanding jobs, choose early retirement, or give up \n     work altogether. As a result, in 2002, Alzheimer's disease \n     cost American business an estimated $36,500,000,000 in lost \n     productivity, as well as an additional $24,600,000,000 in \n     business contributions to the total cost of care.\n\n   TITLE I--INCREASING THE FEDERAL COMMITMENT TO ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to designate the current and future Department of \nVeterans Affairs Medical Center in Louisville, Kentucky, as the \n``Robley Rex Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center''; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nto honor a Kentuckian who is a true American hero: Robley Henry Rex.\n  When Robley passed away in April of this year just a few days shy of \nhis 108th birthday, he was recognized across my State as Kentucky's \nlast World War I-era veteran and hailed as a champion of his fellow \nservice members.\n  Ninety years ago, Robley bravely put on his country's uniform and \nleft Christian County, KY, where he was born and raised, to patrol the \nhills of France in the immediate aftermath of what was then called The \nGreat War. After leaving the Army in 1922, he returned to the \nCommonwealth.\n  In the years following his Army service, Robley began volunteering at \nthe Louisville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, VAMC. He would go on to \ndevote over 14,000 hours of service, right up until the last years of \nhis long and productive life.\n  My legislation would name the current VA hospital in Louisville after \nRobley Rex. It also ensures that when a new VAMC is built, that future \nfacility will also bear his name.\n  The idea to name this facility after Kentucky's pre-eminent volunteer \non behalf of veterans came from a constituent of mine, himself also a \nveteran. Moreover, the Kentucky Department of Veterans of Foreign Wars \nhad the very same idea and endorsed the proposal during its recent \nstate convention. I'm just pleased that as a Kentucky Senator, I am in \na position to make it happen.\n  I can't think of a more appropriate person to name the facility after \nthan Robley Rex. And I can't think of a more appropriate source for the \nidea than the Kentucky veterans community.\n  The new VAMC will be vital to Kentucky's veterans, as well as to \nLouisville's economy. Once complete, the VA hospital will ensure that \nthe men and women who served our country will receive the quality \nhealth care they deserve.\n  That devotion to ensuring quality care to our veterans is exemplified \nin the life and service of Robley Rex. How fitting that his fellow \nveterans--so many of whom knew Robley personally from his countless \nhours of volunteer service--will see his name above the door.\n  Finally, I note that this is bipartisan legislation. It enjoys the \nsupport of Representatives John Yarmuth and Ben Chandler in the other \nchamber. I ask my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. DESIGNATION OF ROBLEY REX DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS MEDICAL CENTER.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Medical Center in Louisville, Kentucky, and any successor to \n     such medical center, shall after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act be known and designated as the ``Robley Rex \n     Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map, \n     document, record, or other paper of the United States to the \n     medical center referred to in subsection (a) shall be \n     considered to be a reference to the Robley Rex Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Medical Center.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself and Mrs. Murray):\n  S. 1497. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \ntax-exempt bond financing for fixed-wing emergency medical aircraft; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce legislation that \nwill remove an unintended obstacle in the tax-exempt bond rules so that \nstates can use these bonds to finance the purchase of fixed-wing air \nambulances in the same way they can now use them to finance the \npurchase of medical helicopters.\n  The difference between a medical helicopter and a fixed wing air \nambulance\n\n[[Page S7888]]\n\nmay seem minor to some, but if you live in a remote area the difference \ncan be as big as life or death.\n  Air medical services, AMS, are an essential component of the health \ncare system. When appropriately used, air critical care transport saves \nlives and reduces the cost of health care by minimizing the time the \ncritically injured and ill spend out of a hospital, by bringing more \nmedical capabilities to the patient than are normally provided by \nground emergency medical services, and by quickly getting the patient \nto the right specialty care. Dedicated medical helicopters and fixed \nwing aircraft are mobile flying emergency intensive care units deployed \nat a moment's notice to patients whose lives depend on rapid care and \ntransport.\n  In remote rural areas, the use of helicopters often is impractical \nand unsafe because of the long distances that patients must be \ntransported, sometimes during poor weather conditions. In these \nsituations, the better alternative is a fixed-wing aircraft.\n  Both helicopters and fixed wing aircraft cost millions of dollars to \npurchase or lease, operate, house and maintain. But under the way that \nthe tax-exempt bond rules currently work, states are prohibited from \nusing these bonds to finance air ambulance services in rural areas, \neven though they can use these bonds for helicopters. This result was \nnot what Congress intended, and our bill would make that clear.\n  Under current law, tax-exempt bonds can not be issued for the \npurchase of any ``airplane, skybox or other privacy luxury box, health \nclub facility, facility primarily used for gambling, or store the \nprincipal business of which is the sale of alcoholic beverages for \nconsumption off premises.'' The restrictions were enacted in order to \nprevent tax-exmpt bonds to be used for frivolous or extravagant \npurposes. Unfortunately, the law has been interpreted to exclude the \npurchase of new fixed-wing planes to provide air ambulance services, \nbut the purchase of helicopters--which are not airplanes--is permitted.\n  This result is not what was intended by the restrictions and our bill \nwould simply make it clear that the general restriction against the use \nof tax-exempt bonds for purchasing an airplane does not apply in the \ncase of planes that are equipped for and exclusively dedicated to \nemergency medical services.\n  There is supporting precedent in distinguishing planes for air \nambulance services different than other airplanes. The air \ntransportation excise tax provides an exemption for air transportation \nthat is used to provide ``emergency medical services . . . by a fixed-\nwing aircraft equipped for and exclusively dedicated on that flight to \nacute care emergency medical services.''\n  This issue hits close to home for me and my colleagues who are \njoining me on this legislation, but we are certainly not alone with \nrespect to the need to ensure that folks in our rural and remote areas \nhave access to needed medical services.\n  Inland Northwest Health Services, INHS, is a non-profit organization \nthat provides critical health care support services in the Inland \nNorthwest, including air ambulance services through Northwest MedStar. \nINHS is based in Spokane, Washington, and provides health care services \nin Eastern Washington, Eastern Oregon, Northern Idaho, and Western \nMontana. Unfortunately, this unintended restriction in the tax code is \npreventing INHS from asking the appropriate state authorities to issue \ntax-exempt bonds to finance the purchase of new fixed-wing planes for \nair ambulance service.\n  The legislation that I am introducing with Senator Murray is a \ncommon-sense fix to this problem, and I hope we can address it quickly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1497\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TAX-EXEMPT BOND FINANCING FOR FIXED-WING EMERGENCY \n                   MEDICAL AIRCRAFT.\n\n       (a) In General.--Subsection (e) of section 147 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (relating to no portion of \n     bonds may be issued for skyboxes, airplanes, gambling \n     establishments, etc.) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following new sentence: ``The preceding sentence shall not \n     apply to any fixed-wing aircraft equipped for, and \n     exclusively dedicated to providing, acute care emergency \n     medical services (within the meaning of 4261(g)(2)).''\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall apply to obligations issued after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Enzi):\n  S. 1502. A bill to establish a program to be managed by the \nDepartment of Energy to ensure prompt and orderly compensation for \npotential damages relating to the storage of carbon dioxide in \ngeological storage units; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today on behalf of myself and my \ncolleague Senator Enzi of Wyoming to introduce the Carbon Storage \nStewardship Trust Fund Act of 2009. This bill will encourage the \ncommercial deployment of technology that will allow for the continued \nuse of our Nation's vast coal resources to produce economical and \nreliable power while at the same time mitigating the impact of climate \nchange.\n  The capture and storage of carbon dioxide from power generation \nfacilities and large industrial sources is a critical component of both \nU.S. and international policy to reduce global emissions of greenhouse \ngases. The criticality of this technology has been driven home by the \nPew Center on Global Climate Change which has pointed out that ``carbon \ncapture and storage, CCS, is the key enabling technology for a future \nin which we can continue to use our vast coal resources and protect the \nclimate.'' And former British Prime Minister Tony Blair stated in \nNovember, 2008, that ``the vast majority of new power stations in China \nand India will be coal fired; not ``may be coal fired''- will be. So \ndeveloping carbon capture and storage technology is not optional, it is \nliterally the essence.''\n  The commercial deployment of CCS will require further large-scale \ndevelopment and demonstration of the technology. Just as important, \nhowever, it will also require a well thought out approach to address \nthe risk and liability of injecting large volumes of CO2 \ninto geological formations, such as saline aquifers, depleted oil and \ngas fields, and unminable coal seams, where it will be permanently \nstored.\n  The risk of geological CO2 storage, also commonly known as \ncarbon sequestration, is considered small. In fact, CO2 has \nbeen safely injected into oil and gas fields to enhance the recovery of \nthese hydrocarbons for decades without incident. While the potential \nfor CO2 to leak to the surface and cause human or ecological \nharm in a well designed and operated carbon sequestration project is \nminimal, the financial liability associated with this risk is uncertain \ngiven the huge disparity between the typical lifetime of a firm \noperating a storage facility and the need to ensure the safe storage of \nCO2 in perpetuity. This uncertainty can cause a chilling \neffect on private sector investment in CCS.\n  The purpose of this act is to create a program for managing the \nfinancial risk, or liability, of the long-term storage of \nCO2 . This program will offer the private sector with a \nframework for how legal and financial responsibilities for commercial \ncarbon storage operations will be addressed. Moreover, it will provide \na strong incentive to industry to manage and reduce risk by deploying \ncarbon sequestration in the safest possible manner.\n  Specifically, the act will require the owner or operator of a \ncommercial CO2 storage facility to self insure or obtain \nprivate insurance or other types of financial assurance to cover \nliability claims during the CO2 injection phase of the \nproject and for an extended period of time after injection has stopped. \nAfter the operator has received a site closure certificate from the \nappropriate regulatory agency, the act would then convey stewardship \nfor the long-term management of the site to the U.S. Department of \nEnergy. The State where the storage facility is located may request to \ntake on stewardship for the site from the Department of Energy. The act \nwill also create a trust fund from fees paid by storage facility \noperators on a per ton of CO2 injected basis that will be \nused to pay for\n\n[[Page S7889]]\n\nclaims for damages made after storage facility stewardship is \ntransferred to the Federal government.\n  In summary, this act will give the private sector the certainty they \nneed regarding the longterm stewardship of CO2 storage \nfacilities. Just as important, it will strongly encourage the safe and \nresponsible operation of these facilities while ensuring the prompt and \norderly compensation for damages or harm to humans, to the environment, \nand to natural resources, should they occur, from the injection and \nstorage of CO2 in geological formations.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join Senator Enzi and me in support of \nthis act so that a clear signal is given about our commitment to the \ndevelopment, demonstration, and ultimately, the widespread commercial \ndeployment of CCS technology as a key component of the Nation's \nstrategy to reduce emissions of CO2.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1502\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Carbon Storage Stewardship \n     Trust Fund Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PURPOSES.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to promote the commercial deployment of carbon capture \n     and storage as an essential component of a national climate \n     mitigation strategy;\n       (2) to require private liability assurance during the \n     active project period of a carbon dioxide storage facility;\n       (3) to establish a Federal trust fund consisting of amounts \n     received as fees from operators of carbon dioxide storage \n     facilities;\n       (4) to establish a limit on liability for damages caused by \n     injection of carbon dioxide by carbon dioxide storage \n     facilities subject to certificates of closure;\n       (5) to establish a program--\n       (A) to certify the closure of commercial carbon dioxide \n     storage facilities; and\n       (B) to provide for the transfer of long-term stewardship to \n     the Federal Government for carbon dioxide storage facilities \n     on the issuance of certificates of closure for the \n     facilities;\n       (6) to provide for the prompt and orderly compensation for \n     damages relating to the storage of carbon dioxide; and\n       (7) to protect the environment and public by providing \n     long-term stewardship of geological storage units.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, we need clean energy. We need cheap energy. \nWe need abundant energy from right here at home. Why not concentrate \nsome of our efforts on hitting a triple play?\n  Coal is our Nation's most abundant energy source. It provides more \nthan 50 percent of our Nation's electricity today and makes electricity \nmore affordable for millions of Americans. It provides for thousands of \nwell paying American jobs and is an essential part of my home State's \neconomy.\n  Unfortunately, in the discussions surrounding climate change, some \nhave suggested that we should end our Nation's use of coal. Because of \nthe abundant, cost-effective nature of this resource, that doesn't make \nsense. Instead of talking about eliminating one of our country's most \nimportant energy sources, we should be talking about how we can make \ncoal cleaner.\n  An essential element of the effort to make coal cleaner will be the \ndevelopment of carbon capture and storage, CCS, technology. There are \nmany pieces to that effort, and today, Senator Casey and I have \nintroduced The Carbon Storage Stewardship Trust Fund Act of 2009 to \naddress one issue with CCS liability for the stored CO2.\n  Our legislation sets up a framework that answers the question of who \nis responsible for the CO2 once it is placed underground. \nThe Carbon Storage Stewardship Trust Fund Act of 2009 requires \ncompanies injecting CO2 into the ground to obtain private \nliability insurance for a period of time. After the CO2 is \ninjected and the injection site is certified as closed by the Federal \nGovernment, liability for the CO2 is transferred to the \nFederal Government.\n  To cover any claims that may arise from damages caused by the \ninjected CO2, the bill sets up a Federal trust fund that is \npaid for through a small fee charged for each ton of CO2 \nthat is injected. Additionally, it provides a method for compensation \nfor those damages.\n  While this legislation is far from everything we need to make \ncommercial CCS a reality, it is an important step and answers an \nimportant question about long-term liability of CO2. I \nappreciate Senator Casey's leadership on this issue and look forward to \nworking with him and other Members of the Senate to move this \nlegislation forward.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 1504. A bill to provide that Federal courts shall not dismiss \ncomplaints under rule 12(b)(6) or (e) of the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure, except under the standards set forth by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States in Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41 (1957); to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak on \nlegislation I am introducing that will restore the system of notice \npleading that has served our Federal judicial system well since 1938, \nthe year the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure were adopted.\n  Civil litigation in our Federal system is commenced by the filing a \ncomplaint that puts the defendant on notice of the plaintiffs claims. \nRule 8(a)(2) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a \ncomplaint need only contain a ``short and plain statement of the claim \nshowing the pleader'', usually the plaintiff, ``is entitled to \nrelief.'' This is not a demanding standard. An appendix to the Rules \nincludes a form complaint for negligence that the drafters of Rule 8 \nobviously thought would satisfy Rule 8's standard. That complaint, in \nrelevant part, alleges only that ``[o]n June 1, 1936, in a public \nhighway called Boylston Street in Boston Massachusetts, defendant \nnegligently drove a motor vehicle against plaintiff who was crossing \nthe highway.''\n  The Federal Rules require the court to await the submission of the \nplaintiff's evidence--first at the summary-judgment stage and, if \nsummary judgment is not granted, then at trial--before evaluating or \npassing on the truth of the complaint's allegations. It's only sensible \nthat courts do so: Not until a plaintiff has had access to relevant \ninformation in the defendant's possession during the discovery process \nthat follows the filing of a complaint as a matter of right can the \nplaintiff normally offer evidence to support the complaint's \nallegations.\n\n[[Page S7891]]\n\n  For over 70 years following the adoption of the Federal Rules, the \nSupreme Court of the U.S. consistently and faithfully implemented Rule \n8's notice-pleading language. Its leading decision on the subject, \nConley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 1957, prohibited federal courts from \ndismissing a complaint ``for failure to state a claim unless it appears \nbeyond doubt that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts in support of \nhis claim that would entitle him to relief.''\n  Two years ago in Bell Atlantic Corporation v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544, \n2007, the Court jettisoned the standard set forth in Conley and \nannounced that henceforth it would require not only factual specificity \nin complaints not previously required of plaintiffs, but also that a \ncomplaint's allegation of wrongdoing appear ``plausible'' to the court. \nThis year in Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 129 S. Ct. 1937, 2009, the Supreme \nCourt significantly expanded upon Twombly by, to quote Professor \nStephen Burbank of the University of Pennsylvania Law School, \neffectively authorizing federal judges to indulge their ``subject \njudgments'' in evaluating an allegation's plausibility. According to an \narticle that just appeared in The York Times, Justice Ruth Bader \nGinsburg recently told a group of Federal judges that, as a result of \nthese two cases, the Supreme Court has ``messed up the federal rules'' \ngoverning pleading.\n  When it passed the Rules Enabling Act, Congress established a \ncarefully designed process for amending the Federal Rules of Civil \nProcedure. The process ends with the Supreme Court's presentation of a \nproposed rule change to Congress for approval. In Twombly and Ashcroft \nthe Court effectively end ran that process.\n  The effect of the Court's actions will no doubt be to deny many \nplaintiffs with meritorious claims access to the Federal courts and, \nwith it, any legal redress for their injuries. I think that is an \nespecially unwelcome development at a time when, with the litigating \nresources of our executive-branch and administrative agencies stretched \nthin, the enforcement of Federal antitrust, consumer protection, civil \nrights and other laws that benefit the public will fall increasingly to \nprivate litigants.\n  The Notice Pleading Restoration Act will require the Federal courts \nto test the sufficiency of a complaint's allegations under the well-\nestablished standards that prevailed in the Federal courts until \nTwombly. I urge its passage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/22/senate-section/article/S7891-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 220--SUPPORTING THE DESIGNATION OF SEPTEMBER AND \n   ``NATIONAL ATRIAL FIBRILLATION AWARENESS MONTH'' AND ENCOURAGING \n        EFFORTS TO EDUCATE THE PUBLIC ABOUT ATRIAL FIBRILLATION\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Dorgan, and Mr. Crapo) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S. Res. 220\n\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is a cardiac condition in which \n     electrical pulses disrupt the regular beating of the atria in \n     the heart, hampering the ability of the atria to fill the \n     ventricles with blood, and subsequently causing blood to pool \n     in the atria and form clots;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac \n     malfunction and affects at least 2,200,000 people in the \n     United States, with increased prevalence anticipated as the \n     population of the United States ages;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is associated with an \n     increased, long-term risk of stroke, heart failure, and \n     mortality from all causes, especially among women;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation accounts for approximately \\1/\n     3\\ of hospitalizations for cardiac rhythm disturbances;\n       Whereas, according to the American Heart Association, 3 to \n     5 percent of people in the United States aged 65 and older \n     are estimated to have atrial fibrillation;\n       Whereas atrial fibrillation is recognized as a major \n     contributor to strokes, with an estimated 15 to 20 percent of \n     strokes occurring in people afflicted with atrial \n     fibrillation;\n       Whereas it is estimated that treating atrial fibrillation \n     costs approximately $3,600 per patient annually for a total \n     cost burden in the United States of approximately \n     $15,700,000,000;\n       Whereas obesity is a significant risk factor for atrial \n     fibrillation;\n       Whereas better education for patients and health care \n     providers is needed in order to ensure timely recognition of \n     atrial fibrillation symptoms;\n       Whereas more research into effective treatments for atrial \n     fibrillation is needed; and\n       Whereas September is an appropriate month to observe as \n     National Atrial Fibrillation Awareness Month: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of September as ``National \n     Atrial Fibrillation Awareness Month'';\n       (2) supports efforts to educate people about atrial \n     fibrillation;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into \n     treatment for atrial fibrillation; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups to observe and support National Atrial \n     Fibrillation Awareness Month through appropriate programs and \n     activities that promote public awareness of atrial \n     fibrillation and potential treatments for atrial \n     fibrillation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/22/senate-section/article/S7891-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 221--EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF \n  THE FIRST ANNUAL NATIONAL WILD HORSE AND BURRO ADOPTION DAY TAKING \n                      PLACE ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2009\n\n  Mr. REID (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Ensign) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources:\n\n                              S.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This subtitle may be cited as the ``Military and Overseas \n     Voter Empowerment Act''.\n\n     SEC. 582. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The right to vote is a fundamental right.\n       (2) Due to logistical, geographical, operational and \n     environmental barriers, military and overseas voters are \n     burdened by many obstacles that impact their right to vote \n     and register to vote, the most critical of which include \n     problems transmitting balloting materials and not being given \n     enough time to vote.\n       (3) States play an essential role in facilitating the \n     ability of military and overseas voters to register to vote \n     and have their ballots cast and counted, especially with \n     respect to timing and improvement of absentee voter \n     registration and absentee ballot procedures.\n       (4) The Department of Defense educates military and \n     overseas voters of their rights under the Uniformed and \n     Overseas Citizens Absentee Voting Act and plays an \n     indispensable role in facilitating the procedural channels \n     that allow military and overseas voters to have their votes \n     count.\n       (5) The local, State, and Federal Government entities \n     involved with getting ballots to military and overseas voters \n     must work in conjunction to provide voter registration \n     services and balloting materials in a secure and expeditious \n     manner.\n\n     SEC. 583.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE NAVAL AFRICA PARTNERSHIP \n                   STATION.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The United States recognized the need for improving \n     maritime safety and security in West and Central Africa and \n     the Gulf of Guinea by implementing the Naval Africa \n     Partnership Station.\n       (2) According to the International Maritime Bureau, piracy \n     around the world doubled in the first 6 months of 2009 as \n     compared to the first 6 months of 2008, to 114 from 240 \n     incidents.\n       (3) The rise in attacks is mainly due to piracy off the \n     coast of the Horn of Africa, specifically in the Gulf of \n     Aden, with attacks originating from Somalia doubling since \n     2007.\n       (4) With more than 30,000 vessels transiting the Gulf of \n     Aden each year, these attacks are taking place in a vast area \n     of more than 1,000,000 square nautical miles.\n       (5) Instability and piracy from Somalia affects not only \n     neighboring African countries such as Ethiopia, Djibouti, and \n     Kenya, but also affects the international community due to \n     the increased insecurity of the region and terrorizing ships \n     in the highly transited Gulf of Aden.\n       (6) African countries have become more vulnerable as Al \n     Qaeda has infiltrated into the Horn of Africa threatening the \n     stability in the region and fueling international terrorist \n     growth and activities. It has been reported that terrorists' \n     networks in Somalia, Eritrea, and the Ogaden region of \n     Ethiopia are working together and increasing their \n     capability.\n       (7) The Naval Africa Partnership Station is working \n     collaboratively with agencies and organizations from Africa, \n     the United States, and Europe to provide naval security for \n     coastal nations in West and Central Africa and in the Gulf of \n     Guinea.\n       (8) The Naval Africa Partnership Station launched its first \n     mission in November 2007. Since that time, the Station has \n     trained thousands of military personnel in security \n     operation, search and rescue operations, law enforcement, \n     medical skills, and maritime maintenance.\n       (9) These programs have proved to be vital resources in \n     aiding developing countries in the professionalization of \n     their militaries, fighting terrorism, and providing resources \n     for emergency situations.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the United States should continue to develop and support the \n     Naval Africa Partnership Station by ensuring adequate funding \n     and resources to promote national security interests of the \n     United States and maritime safety and security in Africa.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1744.

SENSE OF SENATE ON AND RESERVATION OF FUNDS FOR \n                   DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF MISSILE DEFENSE \n                   SYSTEMS IN EUROPE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) In the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) \n     Bucharest Summit Declaration of April 3, 2008, the Heads of \n     State and Government participating in the meeting of the \n     North Atlantic Council declared that ``[b]allistic missile \n     proliferation poses an increasing threat to Allies' forces, \n     territory and populations. Missile defence forms part of a \n     broader response to counter this threat. We therefore \n     recognize the substantial contribution to the protection of \n     Allies from long-range ballistic missiles to be provided by \n     the planned deployment of European-based United States \n     missile defence assets''.\n       (2) The Bucharest Summit Declaration also stated that \n     ``[b]earing in mind the principle of the indivisibility of \n     Allied security as well as NATO solidarity, we task the \n     Council in Permanent Session to develop options for a \n     comprehensive missile defence architecture to extend coverage \n     to all Allied territory and populations not otherwise covered \n     by the United States system for review at our 2009 Summit, to \n     inform any future political decision''.\n       (3) In the Bucharest Summit Declaration, the North Atlantic \n     Council also reaffirmed to Russia that ``current, as well as \n     any future, NATO Missile Defence efforts are intended to \n     better address the security challenges we all face, and \n     reiterate that, far from posing a threat to our relationship, \n     they offer opportunities to deepen levels of cooperation and \n     stability''.\n       (4) In the Strasbourg/Kehl Summit Declaration of April 4, \n     2009, the heads of state and government participating in the \n     meeting of the North Atlantic Council reaffirmed ``the \n     conclusions of the Bucharest Summit about missile defense,'' \n     and declared that ``we judge that missile threats should be \n     addressed in a prioritized manner that includes consideration \n     of the level of imminence of the threat and the level of \n     acceptable risk''.\n       (5) Iran is rapidly developing its ballistic missile \n     capabilities, including its inventory of short-range and \n     medium-range ballistic missiles that can strike portions of \n     Eastern and Southern North Atlantic Treaty Organization \n     European territory, as well as the pursuit of long-range \n     ballistic missiles that could reach Europe or the United \n     States.\n       (6) On July 8, 2008, the Government of the United States \n     and the Government of the Czech Republic signed an agreement \n     to base a radar facility in the Czech Republic that is part \n     of a proposed missile defense system to protect Europe and \n     the United States against a potential future Iranian long-\n     range ballistic missile threat.\n       (7) On August 20, 2008, the United States and the Republic \n     of Poland signed an agreement concerning the deployment of \n     ground-based ballistic missile defense interceptors in the \n     territory of the Republic of Poland.\n       (8) Section 233 of the Duncan Hunter National Defense \n     Authorization Act for Fiscal\n\n[[Page S7926]]\n\n     Year 2009 (Public Law 110-417; 122 Stat. 4393; 10 U.S.C. 2431 \n     note) establishes conditions for the availability of funds \n     for procurement, construction, and deployment of the planned \n     missile defense system in Europe, including that the host \n     nations must ratify any missile defense agreements with the \n     United States and that the Secretary of Defense must certify \n     that the system has demonstrated the ability to accomplish \n     the mission.\n       (9) On April 5, 2009, President Barack Obama, speaking in \n     Prague, Czech Republic, stated, ``As long as the threat from \n     Iran persists, we will go forward with a missile defense \n     system that is cost-effective and proven. If the Iranian \n     threat is eliminated, we will have a stronger basis for \n     security, and the driving force for missile defense \n     construction in Europe will be removed.''.\n       (10) On June 16, 2009, Deputy Secretary of Defense William \n     Lynn testified before the Committee on Armed Services of the \n     Senate that the United States Government is reviewing its \n     options for developing and deploying operationally effective, \n     cost-effective missile defense capabilities to Europe against \n     potential future Iranian missile threats, in addition to the \n     proposed deployment of a missile defense system in Poland and \n     the Czech Republic.\n       (11) On July 9, 2009, General James Cartwright, the Vice \n     Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, testified before the \n     Committee on Armed Services of the Senate that the Department \n     of Defense was considering some 40 different missile defense \n     architecture options for Europe that could provide a \n     ``regional defense capability to protect the nations'' of \n     Europe, and a ``redundant capability that would assist in \n     protecting the United States,'' and that the Department was \n     considering ``what kind of an architecture best suits the \n     defense of the region, the defense of the homeland, and the \n     regional stability''.\n       (b) Sense of Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States Government should continue developing \n     and planning for the proposed deployment of elements of a \n     Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system, including a \n     midcourse radar in the Czech Republic and Ground-Based \n     Interceptors in Poland, consistent with section 233 of the \n     Duncan Hunter National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal \n     Year 2009;\n       (2) in conjunction with the continued development of the \n     planned Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, the United \n     States should work with its North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization allies to explore a range of options and \n     architectures to provide missile defenses for Europe and the \n     United States against current and future Iranian ballistic \n     missile capabilities;\n       (3) any alternative system that the United States \n     Government considers deploying in Europe to provide for the \n     defense of Europe and a redundant defense of the United \n     States against future long-range Iranian missile threats \n     should be at least as capable and cost-effective as the \n     proposed European deployment of the Ground-based Midcourse \n     Defense system; and\n       (4) any missile defense capabilities deployed in Europe \n     should, to the extent practical, be interoperable with United \n     States and North Atlantic Treaty Organization missile defense \n     systems.\n       (c) Reservation of Funds for Missile Defense Systems.--\n       (1) In general.--Of the funds authorized to be appropriated \n     or otherwise made available for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 \n     for the Missile Defense Agency for the purpose of developing \n     missile defenses in Europe, $353,100,000 shall be available \n     only for the purposes described in paragraph (2).\n       (2) Use of funds.--The purposes described in this paragraph \n     are the following:\n       (A) Research, development, test, and evaluation of--\n       (i) the proposed midcourse radar element of the Ground-\n     based Midcourse Defense system in the Czech Republic; and\n       (ii) the proposed long-range missile defense interceptor \n     site element of such defense system in Poland.\n       (B) Research, development, test, and evaluation, \n     procurement, construction, or deployment of other missile \n     defense systems designed to protect Europe, and the United \n     States in the case of long-range missile threats, from the \n     threats posed by current and future Iranian ballistic \n     missiles of all ranges, if the Secretary of Defense submits \n     to the congressional defense committees a report certifying \n     that such systems are expected to be--\n       (i) consistent with the direction from the North Atlantic \n     Council to address ballistic missile threats to Europe and \n     the United States in a prioritized manner that includes \n     consideration of the imminence of the threat and the level of \n     acceptable risk;\n       (ii) operationally effective and cost-effective in \n     providing protection for Europe, and the United States in the \n     case of long-range missile threats, against current and \n     future Iranian ballistic missile threats; and\n       (iii) interoperable, to the extent practical, with other \n     components of missile defense and complementary to the \n     missile defense strategy of the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization.\n       (d) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed as limiting or preventing the Department of Defense \n     from pursuing the development or deployment of operationally \n     effective and cost-effective ballistic missile defense \n     systems in Europe.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1745.

Bush, on February 7, 2007, notified Congress that the \n     United States Government would oppose the extension of any \n     loan or financial or technical assistance to North Korea by \n     any international financial institution and the prohibition \n     on support for the extension of such loans or assistance \n     remains in effect.\n       (7) On June 12, 2009, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Resolution 1874, condemning North Korea's nuclear \n     test, imposing a sweeping embargo on all arms trade with \n     North Korea, and requiring member states not to provide \n     financial support or other financial services that could \n     contribute to North Korea's nuclear-related or missile-\n     related activities or other activities related to weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       (8) On July 15, 2009, the Sanctions Committee of the United \n     Nations Security Council, pursuant to United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1874, imposed a travel ban on five North \n     Korean individuals and asset freezes on five more North \n     Korean entities for their involvement in nuclear weapons and \n     ballistic missile development programs, marking the first \n     time the United Nations has imposed a travel ban on North \n     Koreans.\n       (9) On June 10, 2008, the Government of North Korea issued \n     a statement, subsequently conveyed directly to the United \n     States Government, affirming that North Korea, ``will firmly \n     maintain its consistent stand of opposing all forms of \n     terrorism and any support to it and will fulfill its \n     responsibility and duty in the struggle against terrorism.''.\n       (10) The June 10, 2008, statement by the Government of \n     North Korea also pledged that North Korea would take ``active \n     part in the international efforts to prevent substance, \n     equipment and technology to be used for the production of \n     nukes and biochemical and radioactive weapons from finding \n     their ways to the terrorists and the organizations that \n     support them''.\n       (11) On June 26, 2008, President George W. Bush certified \n     that--\n       (A) the Government of North Korea had not provided any \n     support for international terrorism during the preceding 6-\n     month period; and\n       (B) the Government of North Korea had provided assurances \n     that it will not support acts of international terrorism in \n     the future.\n       (12) The President's June 26 certification concluded, based \n     on all available information, that there was ``no credible \n     evidence at this time of ongoing support by the DPRK for \n     international terrorism'' and that ``there is no credible or \n     sustained reporting at this time that supports allegations \n     (including as cited in recent reports by the Congressional \n     Research Service) that the DPRK has provided direct or \n     witting support for Hezbollah, Tamil Tigers, or the Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guard''.\n       (13) The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism \n     2008, in a section on North Korea, state, ``The Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was not known to have \n     sponsored any terrorist acts since the bombing of a Korean \n     Airlines flight in 1987.''.\n       (14) The Country Reports on Terrorism 2008 also state, ``A \n     state that directs WMD resources to terrorists, or one from \n     which enabling resources are clandestinely diverted, poses a \n     grave WMD terrorism threat. Although terrorist organizations \n     will continue to seek a WMD capability independent of state \n     programs, the sophisticated WMD knowledge and resources of a \n     state could enable a terrorist capability.

The Czech Republic and Poland have been \n     courageous in agreeing to host a defense against these \n     missiles. As long as the threat from Iran persists, we will \n     go forward with a missile defense system that is cost-\n     effective and proven.''\n       (4) President Obama also said, ``As long as these [nuclear] \n     weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure \n     and effective arsenal to deter any adversary, and guarantee \n     that defense to our allies, including the Czech Republic. But \n     we will begin the work of reducing our arsenal.''\n       (b) Limitation.--Funds authorized to be appropriated by \n     this Act or otherwise made available to the Department of \n     Defense for fiscal year 2010 may not be obligated or expended \n     to implement reductions in the strategic nuclear forces of \n     the United States pursuant to any treaty or other agreement \n     entered into between the United States and the Russian \n     Federation on strategic nuclear forces after the date of \n     enactment of this Act unless the President certifies to \n     Congress that--\n\n[[Page S7931]]\n\n       (1) the treaty or other agreement provides for sufficient \n     mechanisms to verify compliance with the treaty or agreement;\n       (2) the treaty or other agreement does not place \n     limitations on the ballistic missile defense systems, space \n     capabilities, or advanced conventional weapons of the United \n     States; and\n       (3) the fiscal year 2011 budget request for programs of the \n     Department of Energy's National Nuclear Security \n     Administration will be sufficiently funded--\n       (A) to maintain the reliability, safety, and security of \n     the remaining strategic nuclear forces of the United States; \n     and\n       (B) to modernize and refurbish the nuclear weapons complex.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report on the \n     stockpiles of strategic and nonstrategic weapons of the \n     United States and the Russian Federation.\n       (d) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Advanced conventional weapons.--The term ``advanced \n     conventional weapons'' means any advanced weapons system that \n     has been specifically designed not to carry a nuclear \n     payload.\n       (2) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the following \n     committees:\n       (A) The Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives.\n       (B) The Committee on Armed Services and the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations of the Senate.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1761.

SENSE OF THE SENATE ON ENFORCEMENT AND IMPOSITION \n                   OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO NORTH KOREA; \n                   REVIEW TO DETERMINE WHETHER NORTH KOREA SHOULD \n                   BE RE-LISTED AS A STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate makes the following findings:\n       (1) On April 5, 2009, the Government of North Korea tested \n     an intermediate range ballistic missile in violation of \n     United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1695 (2006) and \n     1718 (2006).\n       (2) On April 5, 2009, President Barack Obama issued a \n     statement on North Korea, stating that ``Preventing the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and their means \n     of delivery is a high priority for my administration'', and \n     adding, ``North Korea has ignored its international \n     obligations, rejected unequivocal calls for restraint, and \n     further isolated itself from the community of nations''.\n       (3) On April 15, 2009, the Government of North Korea \n     announced it was expelling international inspectors from its \n     Yongbyon nuclear facility and ending its participation in the \n     Six Party Talks for the Denuclearization of the Korean \n     Peninsula.\n       (4) On May 25, 2009, the Government of North Korea \n     conducted a second nuclear test, in disregard of United \n     Nations Security Council Resolution 1718, which was issued in \n     2006 following the first such test and which demanded that \n     North Korea not conduct any further nuclear tests or launches \n     of a ballistic missile.\n       (5) The State Department's 2008 Human Rights Report on \n     North Korea, issued on February 25, 2009, found that human \n     rights conditions inside North Korea remained poor, prison \n     conditions are harsh and life-threatening, and citizens were \n     denied basic freedoms such as freedom of speech, press, \n     assembly, religion, and association.\n       (6) Pursuant to section 102(b)(2)(E) of the Arms Export \n     Control Act (22 U.S.C. 2799aa-1(b)(2)(E)), President George \n     W. Bush, on February 7, 2007, notified Congress that the \n     United States Government would oppose the extension of any \n     loan or financial or technical assistance to North Korea by \n     any international financial institution and the prohibition \n     on support for the extension of such loans or assistance \n     remains in effect.\n       (7) On June 12, 2009, the United Nations Security Council \n     passed Resolution 1874, condemning North Korea's nuclear \n     test, imposing a sweeping embargo on all arms trade with \n     North Korea, and requiring member states not to provide \n     financial support or other financial services that could \n     contribute to North Korea's nuclear-related or missile-\n     related activities or other activities related to weapons of \n     mass destruction.\n       (8) On July 15, 2009, the Sanctions Committee of the United \n     Nations Security Council, pursuant to United Nations Security \n     Council Resolution 1874, imposed a travel ban on five North \n     Korean individuals and asset freezes on five more North \n     Korean entities for their involvement in nuclear weapons and \n     ballistic missile development programs, marking the first \n     time the United Nations has imposed a travel ban on North \n     Koreans.\n       (9) On June 10, 2008, the Government of North Korea issued \n     a statement, subsequently conveyed directly to the United \n     States Government, affirming that North Korea, ``will firmly \n     maintain its consistent stand of opposing all forms of \n     terrorism and any support to it and will fulfill its \n     responsibility and duty in the struggle against terrorism.''.\n       (10) The June 10, 2008, statement by the Government of \n     North Korea also pledged that North Korea would take ``active \n     part in the international efforts to prevent substance, \n     equipment and technology to be used for the production of \n     nukes and biochemical and radioactive weapons from finding \n     their ways to the terrorists and the organizations that \n     support them''.\n       (11) On June 26, 2008, President George W. Bush certified \n     that--\n       (A) the Government of North Korea had not provided any \n     support for international terrorism during the preceding 6-\n     month period; and\n       (B) the Government of North Korea had provided assurances \n     that it will not support acts of international terrorism in \n     the future.\n       (12) The President's June 26 certification concluded, based \n     on all available information, that there was ``no credible \n     evidence at this time of ongoing support by the DPRK for \n     international terrorism'' and that ``there is no credible or \n     sustained reporting at this time that supports allegations \n     (including as cited in recent reports by the Congressional \n     Research Service) that the DPRK has provided direct or \n     witting support for Hezbollah, Tamil Tigers, or the Iranian \n     Revolutionary Guard''.\n       (13) The State Department's Country Reports on Terrorism \n     2008, in a section on North Korea, state, ``The Democratic \n     People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) was not known to have \n     sponsored any terrorist acts since the bombing of a Korean \n     Airlines flight in 1987.''.\n       (14) The Country Reports on Terrorism 2008 also state, ``A \n     state that directs WMD resources to terrorists, or one from \n     which enabling resources are clandestinely diverted, poses a \n     grave WMD terrorism threat. Although terrorist organizations \n     will continue to seek a WMD capability independent of state \n     programs, the sophisticated WMD knowledge and resources of a \n     state could enable a terrorist capability. State sponsors of \n     terrorism and all nations that fail to live up to their \n     international counterterrorism and nonproliferation \n     obligations deserve greater scrutiny as potential \n     facilitators of WMD terrorism.''.\n       (15) On October 11, 2008, the Secretary of State, pursuant \n     to the President's certification, removed North Korea from \n     its list of state sponsors of terrorism, on which North Korea \n     had been placed in 1988.\n       (b) Report on Conduct of North Korea.--Not later than 30 \n     days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     President shall submit to Congress a detailed report \n     examining the conduct of the Government of North Korea since \n     June 26, 2008, based on all available information, to \n     determine whether North Korea meets the statutory criteria \n     for listing as a state sponsor of terrorism. The report \n     shall--\n       (1) present any credible evidence of support by the \n     Government of North Korea for acts of terrorism, terrorists, \n     or terrorist organizations;\n       (2) examine what steps the Government of North Korea has \n     taken to fulfill its June 10, 2008, pledge to prevent weapons \n     of mass destruction from falling into the hands of \n     terrorists; and\n       (3) assess the effectiveness of re-listing North Korea as a \n     state sponsor of terrorism as a tool to accomplish the \n     objectives of the United States with respect to North Korea, \n     including completely eliminating North Korea's nuclear \n     weapons programs, preventing North Korean proliferation of \n     weapons of mass destruction, and encouraging North Korea to \n     abide by international norms with respect to human rights.\n       (c) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that--\n       (1) the United States should--\n       (A) vigorously enforce United Nations Security Council \n     Resolutions 1718 (2006) and 1874 (2009) and other sanctions \n     in place with respect to North Korea under United States law;\n       (B) urge all member states of the United Nations to fully \n     implement the sanctions imposed by United Nations Security \n     Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874; and\n       (C) explore the imposition of additional unilateral and \n     multilateral sanctions against North Korea in furtherance of \n     United States national security;\n       (2) the conduct of North Korea constitutes a threat to the \n     northeast Asian region and to international peace and \n     security;\n       (3) if the United States determines that the Government of \n     North Korea has provided assistance to terrorists or engaged \n     in state sponsored acts of terrorism, the Secretary of State \n     should immediately list North Korea as a state sponsor of \n     terrorism; and\n       (4) if the United States determines that the Government of \n     North Korea has failed to fulfill its June 10, 2008, pledges, \n     the Secretary of State should immediately list North Korea as \n     a state sponsor of terrorism.\n       (d) State Sponsor of Terrorism Defined.--For purposes of \n     this section, the term ``state sponsor of terrorism'' means a \n     country that has repeatedly provided support for acts of \n     international terrorism for purposes of--\n\n[[Page S7932]]\n\n       (1) section 6(j) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 \n     (50 U.S.C.

Mr. President, I rise on this early evening in July to \nspend a few minutes to talk about health care. I know it has obviously \nbeen a subject of great interest over the last number of days, having \nbeen asked to fill in for my dear friend, Senator Ted Kennedy, the \nchairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, who \nas we all know is struggling with his own health issues.\n  I was asked to fill in for him to mark up the HELP Committee's \nlegislation on health care, and I was fortunate to have as my allies in \nthat effort some remarkable Members of this body--both Democrats and \nRepublicans--who, we are told, spent as long a time, maybe longer than \nfor any other markup in the history of that committee and one of the \nlongest in the history of this body. There were some 23 sessions over \n13 days, covering nearly 300 amendments that were offered on behalf of \nthe 23 Members of the Senate--almost a quarter of this body--serving on \nthat committee.\n  After that lengthy period of time, we drafted a bipartisan bill. It \ndid not end up being a bipartisan vote. It was a partisan vote coming \nout of committee, regrettably. But that doesn't mean it will end up \nthat way. I have often been involved in legislative efforts where the \ncommittee action would have a partisan conclusion, only to find that \nafter further work, those efforts can attract a broad base of support \nand develop the kind of broad-based backing that is, I think, an \nimportant feature of good legislation.\n  So while I regret we didn't have any Republican votes in that \ncommittee, I am deeply grateful to my Democratic colleagues for their \nefforts--and also to my Republican colleagues for their efforts--which \nI will talk about. I intend, in the coming days, to talk about this \nissue through the remaining weeks we are in session--and possibly even \nbeyond that, if we stay in session in August to work on this issue.\n  This is not any ordinary issue or ordinary time. I have been around \nlong enough now to have witnessed the debates on this issue going back \n30 years. Every single Congress and every single administration \npredating my arrival here has grappled with this issue--Republicans and \nDemocrats alike. Since the days of Harry Truman in the 1940s, literally \nevery administration has tried to come up with an idea to reform our \nhealth care system.\n  In years past, those efforts were talked about in terms of describing \nthe present condition of health care as being an unacceptable \nsituation; that it was wrong, unethical, immoral that we weren't \nserving people who should be served. The debate has now changed because \nit is no longer just unacceptable--which has always been the case--but \nwe are now in a situation where the present conditions are \nunsustainable. Yesterday and again this morning the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve Board, Ben Bernanke, testifying on monetary policy, was \nasked the question in both the other body as well as in the Banking \nCommittee, which I chair, how important health care was as a matter of \neconomic recovery. In both forums, in different language, the Chairman \nof the Federal Reserve--while not getting into the details of\n\n[[Page S7940]]\n\nthe various plans--pointed out, once again, if there was any doubt \nabout this, that unless we resolve the health care issue, the economic \nissues we are grappling with today will be unresolved and only grow in \ntheir complexity and in their depth.\n  So this issue of health care is obviously one that affects real \npeople every day. As we conclude the work day here on the east coast, \nand will do so in a few hours across America, remember this: Today, and \nevery day, as we grapple with this issue, 14,000 of our fellow citizens \nwill lose their health care. That is 14,000 today, 14,000 tomorrow and \nthe next day and the next day and the next day. Every day we wait and \ndelay on this issue, that many more of our fellow citizens and their \nfamilies can fall into that abyss, that free-fall of wondering whether \nsome accident, some injury, some diagnosis will tell them and their \nfamilies they are in deep trouble, from a health care perspective.\n  If they lack the kind of coverage and insurance or lack the kind of \npersonal wealth, that family will not only face the hardship of \nconfronting a health care crisis without the adequate quality of care \nto provide for them and their families, but they may very well find \nthemselves in economic ruin as a result of the situation that persists \ntoday.\n  I am not talking about the uninsured alone. I am talking about the 25 \nor 30 million who are underinsured in this country. They struggle every \nsingle day, wondering whether those deductibles are going to be low \nenough to pay when crisis strikes and, even if they have a policy, \nwhether there are going to be an adequate number of doctor visits, \nprescriptions covered, and the like that provide them with the \nnecessary protection to recover from their health care situation and \navoid the economic crisis that can befall them.\n  To put it in perspective for you, Mr. President, consider this: Of \nall the bankruptcies that occur in the country, and there are many in \neconomic times such as this, 62 percent of those bankruptcies are \ndirectly related to a health care crisis in that family; that they \nwould not be in that situation except for the fact that they are \nsuffering through a health care crisis that has forced them into \nfinancial bankruptcy. Consider this, if you will: 50 percent of all \nhome foreclosures--and there are 10,000 of those every day, today \n10,000 families got a foreclosure notice--50 percent, one out of every \ntwo foreclosures that occurred in this country occurred because of \nhealth care costs for that family.\n  Eighty-seven million of our fellow citizens every year find \nthemselves in some period when they lack health insurance. Yet, as I \nsay all of that from this Chamber, all 100 of us here have a great \nhealth care system, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. All of \nthe Federal employees in the Capitol and across this country have a \ngood health care program, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan. \nMaybe if we were in the same situation as our fellow citizens, being \nuninsured or underinsured, maybe there would be a heightened sense of \nurgency about this issue. But as long as we are OK and have nothing to \nworry about because of the jobs we hold, the titles we have, because of \nthe good health care at relatively low cost that we have, none of us \nhave to worry about that. We hope nothing happens, we hope we do not \nget sick, we hope a child of ours or a grandchild doesn't face a health \ncare crisis, but if they do, Lord forbid, we have the resources to \nprotect our family. That is not the case for millions of our fellow \ncitizens.\n  So this issue demands our attention. It is an issue that cries out \nfor solution. It is one that we must address. This is not one we can \ndelay on, it is not one we can postpone for some future Congress. In \nfact, the American President, Barack Obama, who will address the \ncountry about 55 minutes from now on this subject, has made the case \npublicly: There is no other issue more important to him than this one. \nHe has announced he is willing to expend whatever political capital he \nhas in order to resolve the health care issue. He has made it the \ncentral issue of his Presidency, and we in this body, regardless of \nwhat political label we wear, bear a similar responsibility and should \nbe sharing a similar cause--and that is to address this issue in a way \nthat will increase access, will reduce cost, and create the kind of \nquality health care all Americans ought to have.\n  Every American ought to have at least as good health care coverage as \ntheir Member of Congress. Every American ought to be able to go to bed \nat night with the security that if their spouse or their children or a \nloved one in their family were to face a health care crisis, they would \nnot be facing economic ruin, that they would not be wiped out because \nof it. Every American ought to have that sense of security, that \nsomething in this great Nation of ours ought not to be depending upon \nthe wealth you have in your family or the job you hold. It ought to be \na basic right to be able to have access to affordable quality health \ncare in America. That is the charge. That is the obligation. That is \nwhat stands before us as the issue of, not only the day or the hour, \nbut I think of our time here in this Congress.\n  President Obama has said he is willing to expend every bit of his \npolitical capital. That is an extraordinary statement made by an \nextraordinary President at an extraordinary moment in our Nation's \nhistory. In my 35 years in Congress serving with seven Presidents, I \nhave never heard another President on any issue make a similar \nstatement of their willingness to expend their capital on a single \nissue. This President has made that statement. That ought to inspire \nall of us to join him in that effort.\n  The President recognizes, as I hope my colleagues recognize, that we \nhave been given a mandate by the American people to deliver on health \ncare reform. I hope my colleagues will join in this effort.\n  Already we have made significant progress toward legislation that \ncuts costs, protects consumer choice, and guarantees access to \naffordable quality care for every one of our citizens.\n  The American Medical Association, the American Nurses Association, \nthe organizations representing America's hospitals and pharmaceutical \ncompanies, have all come to the table and agreed to support strong \nhealth care reform. Three of five congressional committees responsible \nfor health care have already approved strong legislation. I was here in \n1994. Those organizations which I just mentioned, believe me, were not \nat the table urging that this Congress pass major health care reform. \nThey are today. That is a fundamental change that has occurred in the \nlast decade and a half.\n  Even the notorious Harry and Louise, those actors who once were used \nin commercials to kill health care reform, stood with me last week in a \ngroup of our colleagues when we announced the first piece of health \ncare legislation to emerge from the Senate. They stand strong for \nhealth care reform and change and intend to do everything they can to \nassist in that effort.\n  This bill, the one that passed the HELP Committee, the Affordable \nHealth Care Choices Act, is a strong and sensible piece of legislation. \nIt forbids insurance companies from cherry-picking applicants based on \ntheir gender, based on their health care status, or any preexisting \nconditions. Never, ever again, under our legislation, if adopted, would \nan American citizen be denied coverage of health care because he or she \nis a cancer survivor or the victim of domestic violence. Never, ever \nagain under our bill would an American citizen who thought they had \ninsurance find their coverage cut or taken away just at the moment they \nneed it the most because our bill, if it is passed, not only eliminates \ncaps on benefits, it bans insurance companies from cutting or taking \naway coverage after a policy has been signed.\n  Our bill, if adopted into law, cracks down on waste and fraud, \nfocuses on preventive care, reduces the crushing burden of \nadministrative costs, and has been scored by the Congressional Budget \nOffice at $611 billion over 10 years. That is a savings of more than \n$400 billion from the original estimate by the Congressional Budget \nOffice.\n  I am very proud we came in on time and under budget in the HELP \nCommittee. We are not being talked about much these days because we got \nour job done a week ago today, but I am even more proud that with real \ncontributions from each of the 22 of my colleagues who serve on that \ncommittee--a quarter of the Senate--we\n\n[[Page S7941]]\n\nwere able to craft a uniquely American bill for the American people.\n  In the United States of America, we already find much we like in our \nhealth care system. We like our family doctors and compassionate \nnurses. We like our world-class hospitals and technology--and we \nshould. They are remarkable. We like having the freedom of choice as \nAmericans of our own health care and the ability to get it fast, if we \ncan. Our bill will not touch these things that work in our health care \nsystem in the United States today.\n  In the United States, we hold the relationship between a doctor and \nhis or her patient to be sacrosanct, and our bill, if signed into law, \nguarantees nothing can ever come between you and the doctor of your \nchoice--not the Federal Government, not an insurance company, not a \nbureaucrat from the private or the public sector. In the United States \nof America, we believe in shared risk and shared responsibility. Our \nbill, if signed into law, lowers costs for everyone by ensuring that \neveryone is insured. The bigger the pool, obviously the broader the \nrisk and the lower the cost.\n  In return, our bill asks individuals, employers, the Federal \nGovernment, all of us to share responsibility, not just for treating \npeople when they get sick but hopefully for preventing them from \ngetting sick in the first place.\n\n  In the United States of America, we know in our committee, as we \ndrafted the bill, that good companies are not afraid of competition. \nOur bill includes a public insurance option that is just that--it is an \noption, purely voluntary, for consumers and providers to decide whether \nthey want to participate, nothing mandatory, just a voluntary option, a \nlittle healthy American competition to give consumers and providers \nsome choices in the health care system of our Nation. That is an \noutrageous and radical thought to some, I know. In my communities, it \nis pretty basic, pretty common sense, pretty traditional, and it is a \nred-blooded American idea--a little competition. It doesn't hurt \nanybody. In fact, we suspect it actually helps most.\n  In the United States of America, we have the best treatment and \nresearch facilities in the world, facilities that regularly produce \nremarkable advances. Our bill, if signed into law, ensures that those \nadvances translate directly and efficiently into better outcomes and \nlower costs for our fellow citizens.\n  Most of all, in our United States of America, we have learned the \nhard way that we need health care reform. For nearly 70 years now, \nDemocrats and Republicans, Presidents and Congresses alike, have all \ntried this. Every one of them has made a Herculean effort to deal with \nthis issue. Here we are, close to a century later, still in the same \nditch, unable to dig ourselves out of it as it gets deeper and deeper.\n  So this is the moment. This is why we are here. This is our \nopportunity now to step up or to step back, and history will judge \nwhich of the two directions we took at this moment; whether we have the \nintestinal fortitude and determination to sit down for the long, hard \nhours and hammer out something, to deliver not because it is good for \nus but because it is good for the people we seek to represent. That is \nwhy we are here.\n  We talk about these debates as if no one else existed. Who is working \non this, who is bipartisan, who is not, what coalition or group, who is \na Blue Dog or Red Dog. It must drive the American people nuts watching \nus acting as if we were the only people on the face this planet \nwrestling with this issue. We don't have to worry, none of us. Tonight \nyou can sleep soundly, as a U.S. Congressman or Senator, because if you \nwake up in the morning with a health care crisis, there is nothing to \nworry about financially. We are well protected and taken care of. \nUnfortunately for millions of our fellow citizens all across this \ncountry, they cannot sleep as soundly as we do. They are the ones we \nought to be thinking about in this debate--not whether we have some \ncoalition that is going to produce some magical result. Keep our eye on \nthe ball. The American people are expecting nothing less from us.\n  For far too often, of course, we have failed in these efforts that \nhave been defeated by nothing more than cheap politics in too many \ninstances. The well-being of our citizens is left to drown in today's \npolitical current, all the while we have paid, of course, a deep, deep \nprice for that ditch we are in, a ditch that is growing.\n  American families pay an average of $1,100 extra. If you bought \ninsurance and you have an insurance policy, by and large you are paying \n$1,100 more every year in premiums to cover the costs associated with \nthe health care for the 47 million of our fellow citizens who are \nuninsured. It is not that they don't get health care. They show up. \nWhere do they show up? They show up in emergency rooms. The most \nexpensive health care in the country is in emergency rooms. So when you \nare paying tonight, as many Americans will be, that quarterly or \nmonthly premium, or whatever the timeframe is for the premiums you pay, \nlook at a percentage of what you are paying. On average, you are paying \n$1,100 more every year to cover the uninsured, whose health care gets \npaid for. You are paying for it. When people say we cannot afford any \nmore cost on all of this, you are already paying an exorbitant amount.\n  One of the efforts in this bill, in our bill along with the efforts \nbeing made by others, is to see to it that the 47 million, a number \nthat expands to 87 million at one point or another during the year, of \nour fellow citizens who are without insurance at all, is reduced.\n  But that is the pricetag, $1,100 on average for our covering the \nuninsured among our fellow citizens.\n  Three out of every five bankruptcies, as I mentioned already, in the \nUnited States of America are caused by high medical bills. More than 75 \npercent of those forced into bankruptcy because of medical bills had \ninsurance, by the way. That number is not the uninsured, 75 percent of \npeople who fall into bankruptcy are insured.\n  Of the 62 percent of the bankruptcies that are created by this health \ncare crisis, 75 percent of those people had a health insurance policy. \nSo do not assume this only happens to those people who have no health \ninsurance. If you are insured tonight, and you run into a major health \ncare crisis, then you can very well find yourselves in the same \nposition millions of our fellow citizens have who fall into bankruptcy. \nIt is not the destitute, it is average American families.\n  In many cases, half our Nation's foreclosures are a direct result of \nour broken health care system, as we now know. But it is not just \nfamilies and businesses being bankrupted, health care costs have come \nto consume a simply unsustainable portion of our budget. The other day \nthe Congressional Budget Office answered the question in the Budget \nCommittee: Are we bending the curves up or down for these various \nhealth care plans. I have a lot of respect for the people who work at \nthe Congressional Budget Office. I know they work very hard.\n  But I will do a little wager that no one on that committee, the \nBudget Committee, nor did the CBO in their calculations of cost, ask \nthe question of whether bankruptcies or foreclosures were calculated \ninto the costs, one way or another, that were part of their \nconclusions.\n  But why are they not? If 62 percent of all bankruptcies occur in the \ncountry because people who are insured could not afford the health care \nneeds they had for their families, why is that not a cost to be \ncalculated in bending curves? What about those foreclosures, 50 percent \nof which occur because of a health care crisis in that family.\n  Did the CBO write that number into its computer models to figure out \ncosts? Why not? Is that not a cost to our country? If a family goes \ninto bankruptcy or loses their home because of a health care crisis \nthat is created by the present situation in this country, where are the \ncalculations and computer models that will tell us the impact of those \ncrises on families?\n  So we talk about this issue, and we are told now in these \nmacroeconomic terms by actuaries and accountants and the ``green visor \ncrowd'' that 16 percent of our gross domestic product is spent on \nhealth care and that number could quickly climb to 35 percent.\n  What does that mean? It means, we are told, in the next 8 or 10 \nyears, if we do not act, if we listen to those who do not think the \nlast 70 years or the last number of Congresses that we wrestled with \nthese issues is somehow wasted time, that we can end up with the \naverage family paying 50 percent of its\n\n[[Page S7942]]\n\ngross income on health care premiums. That is not an exaggeration, that \nis not a phony projection. The very same economists who are telling you \nabout the 16 percent of our gross domestic product consumed today are \nthe ones who predict, based on the present trajectories, unchanged, \nthat 35 percent of our GDP can be consumed by health care costs.\n  You might be curious to know the next nation that is closest to us as \na percentage of its gross domestic product is Switzerland, and \nSwitzerland spends a little over 10 percent of its GDP on health care. \nThen the next country is us, around 16 percent and growing.\n  To give you some idea around the world how we rate and compare on a \nper-capita basis, pretty staggering numbers. By the way, you might say: \nWell, look, I am sorry, Senator. I know it is a lot of money, but you \nknow what? We have great outcomes. We have remarkable outcomes. So we \nare paying more than Switzerland. But, by golly, our people here get \ngreat outcomes.\n  Well, I wish I could tell you that is the case. The fact is we rank \n37th in the world in outcomes. What a great statistic, the United \nStates of America, the wealthiest nation on the face of this Earth, we \nspend more, $2.5 trillion a year, than anybody, a larger percentage by \nalmost double, with the closest of any other nation in the world, and \nwe rank 37th in the world in medical outcomes.\n  There is something staggeringly wrong with that number--with that \namount of money being spent and those outcomes coming in. If you wonder \nwhy people are frustrated by the subject matter, and they may not know \nthese numbers, all they know is what they are going through and their \nfamily.\n  If we continue on this path, it only gets worse. By the way, to add \nadditional shame to that number, we rank at the bottom of all \nindustrialized nations when it comes to infant mortality, the bottom of \nindustrialized nations, when it comes to infant mortality in the United \nStates of America. I find that shameful, those numbers.\n  We like to think of ourselves as doing so many things so well as a \ncountry because of who we are and how we govern ourselves and the \nopportunities we create in the United States of America. We like to \nbelieve that this is not some Third World country, that we would take \ngood care of our newborns. To rank at the bottom of the list in infant \nmortality is shameful, to come in 37th in medical outcomes is shameful, \nto spend almost double the percentage of our gross domestic product as \nour nearest competitor nation is also shameful.\n  We have reached a point where no Senator can, with a straight face, \ncome on the floor of this body and argue for the status quo. That \nstatus quo is not only unacceptable, as I have said, it is \nunsustainable.\n  Of course, some will stand on this floor and argue that the best \nthing we can do when confronted with a house on fire is to walk around \nit a few more times and argue about how high the flames have grown. \nWell, when we began writing this legislation out of the HELP Committee, \nwe did not forget that each of us were born with one mouth and two \nears.\n  We started with a blank page. Long before I was asked to pinch-hit \nfor Ted Kennedy, Senator Kennedy and his staff and others invited the \nminority, early on, to share their ideas. You are going to hear \notherwise, that we got drawn into this, we were not informed. That is \nnot the case. They were not drawn in. They were invited. They had no \nidea what they wanted to offer, only that they got nervous about this \nplan going forward.\n  That started, I am told, at the end of last year, not when the \nPresident was inaugurated after January 20. So we began by listening. \nWe listened to stakeholders, providers, hospitals, pharmaceutical \ncompanies. Anyone we could gather who had an interest in the subject \nmatter was invited to come and talk about what they thought a Federal \nhealth care reform package ought to look like. The culmination of that \neffort was to draft a bill. Why did we draft a bill? Well, because the \nrules of the Senate require it. You cannot begin a markup in the HELP \nCommittee unless you have a product on the table. There has to be \nlegislation written. The rules require it. So we wrote a bill and put \nit on the table and invited our colleagues on the committee to come and \ncomment on it, talk about it, amend it, change it, do whatever they \nthought might improve it.\n  That is what took us to 54 hours, over 13 days and 23 sessions and \nnearly 300 amendments; a rather long and elaborate process. It was good \nwork. Frankly, the bill got a lot better because of the effort. It got \nbetter because my Republican colleagues offered terrific ideas.\n  Contrary to what some may think, they did not come and just shove \ntheir hands in their pockets, put their heads in the sand and refuse to \nparticipate or walk away and not show up. Mike Enzi, Judd Gregg, Lamar \nAlexander, I can go down a long list of the Republican members who were \nthere day after day, sat in that committee room and contributed \nmightily to our effort.\n  I was blessed to have Tom Harkin and Barbara Mikulski and Jeff \nBingaman and Patty Murray, who were asked by Senator Ted Kennedy months \nago if they would each take on a separate piece of the bill.\n  Tom Harkin grappled with prevention issues; developed a staff with \nexpertise and knowledge. Barbara Mikulski worked on quality issues; did \nthe same as Tom Harkin. Patty Murray did it on workforce. Jeff Bingaman \ndid it on coverage. They had 12 hearings themselves on this subject \nmatter even before a word was written on the bill, to bring people \ntogether, to listen to ideas and how we could shape those ideas as part \nof the structure of reform for the health care system.\n  Then that culminated with us sitting down in the beginning, back 5 or \n6 weeks ago now, to actually mark up this bill, as we are expected to \ndo. True, the Republicans on the committees did not vote for the bill, \nI have said that, regrettably. That was pretty clear to me that was \nprobably going to happen no matter what we did. But they contributed \nand they made significant contributions. Of the 161 amendments that we \naccepted were offered by the Republican side--of the nearly 300 \namendments that we considered, 161 amendments offered by the minority \nare very much a part of the bill that I have been talking about this \nevening. Some were technical amendments, clearly. But many were very \nsubstantive.\n\n  They do not want to admit it maybe because they voted against it in \nthe end. You can define bipartisan any way you want. But I define it by \ncontributions made to the product. They made a bipartisan contribution \nto the product and a better bill, not a perfect bill, was the result. \nIt obviously needs more work. But we think it is a good, sensible bill \nthat ought to enjoy the support of our colleagues.\n  Senator Gregg, for instance, and a number of his fellow Republicans \nwere concerned about the long-term fiscal impact of our provisions on \nlong-term care. So Judd Gregg offered an amendment that would require \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to set and adjust premiums \nbased on a 75-year outlook of the program's solvency.\n  We had a robust debate for an hour on this issue. The committee \nrecognized the tremendous value, frankly, of what Judd Gregg was \nproposing. So his amendment was accepted unanimously, and the bill is a \nbetter bill for it. Johnny Isakson, my very good friend from Georgia, \nbrought to the table the issue of end-of-life care, drawing on his own \nfamily's experiences. He gave very moving remarks in our committee \nabout the importance of end-of-life care issues. He was able to talk \nabout the importance of planning for the last days of one's life, how \ndifficult that can be.\n  I just went through that with my sister who was diagnosed on May 22 \nwith lung cancer, and she was gone in 6 weeks. She died on July 6, the \nfirst of my siblings to be lost. She was 68 years of age, with 5 \nchildren and 17 grandchildren. She knew in the last 9 days of her life \nwhat the outcome was going to be.\n  So she insisted upon each of us spending an hour or so alone, every \none of her 17 grandchildren, every one of her children and their \nspouses, every one of her siblings, every one of her close friends. Her \nbest friend in the world was a woman she met on the first day of \ncollege when she was 18 years of age. Her name is Nancy\n\n[[Page S7943]]\n\nPelosi, Speaker of the House. She was there for the funeral.\n  Joe Biden came up. Joe and my sister were great friends, and he came \nup for the wake the night before. So I knew she was thinking, my \nsister, in planning what she wanted to have happen those last nine days \nof her life. A lot of families go through that. Senator Isakson made a \nvery substantial contribution, nothing technical about what he was \ntalking about. Our bill is a better bill because Johnny Isakson's ideas \nwere incorporated in it.\n  Mike Enzi and Judd Gregg and Lamar Alexander wanted to increase \nemployer's flexibility to offer work-based wellness programs with \nincentives for employees. Some of my fellow Democrats had reservations \nabout their proposal. But Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa and myself and \nseveral others on the committee worked with our colleagues on the \nRepublican side to craft a compromise, a version we were able to pass \non a bipartisan basis unanimously.\n  As a result, today, employers at some point can offer as much as a \n50-percent reduction in premiums to employees who have engaged in \nlifestyle behaviors that will reduce their threat of illness and thus \nbring down the cost to those people. It was a great idea. We attributed \na lot of it to Steven Burd, the CEO of Safeway, who brought the ideas \nto the table.\n  But our fellow Democrats, working again with Mike Enzi and Judd Gregg \nand Lamar Alexander came up with those ideas in that compromise. That \nis not technical. The bill is a better bill because of their efforts. I \ncan go on and talk of the rest of the members who made contributions--\nbut I will not tonight. Every one of them have contributions in this \nbill. But let me be clear: If we deem bipartisanship more important \nthan timely and effective health care reform, the only thing that will \nbe bipartisan will be our collective failure as an institution. I have \nintroduced a lot of bills over the years, and passed a lot of \nlegislation. On every major bill I have written in this place, I have \nhad a Republican partner, going back to the earliest days when I \narrived here and offered the first child care legislation since World \nWar II.\n  My ally on that was a guy named Orrin Hatch from Utah, who stood with \nme and we passed it. I offered the Family and Medical Leave Act. That \ntook 7 years, two vetoes. Today there are some 50 million Americans who \ntake leave without pay without losing their jobs. My partner on that \nwas Dan Coates of Indiana, and Arlen Specter at the time was a \nRepublican, obviously, along with people not here who were involved. \nKit Bond played a very important role in developing the Family and \nMedical Leave Act.\n  I could go on with a list of bills, and on every single one of them I \nhad bipartisan support. So I understand the value of it. It is a very \nimportant means by which to get a job done. But let me suggest to you \nat this hour, while bipartisanship is a means to get to an end, what \nreally is missing right now is leadership in all of this--leadership \nfrom each one of us.\n  The President is leading as strongly as he can, and is deeply \ninvolved in this issue. Members of various committees are also leading. \nBut in this institution everybody can be a leader, if they want to be.\n  Right now, I think what the country is looking for is leadership on \nthis issue. Yes, bipartisanship is a nice quality, an important \nelement, to pass bills. But leadership is what is most missing in all \nof this--the willingness to understand the moment, the unique \nopportunity to address a crippling issue that faces our country.\n  Every single one of our citizens will be adversely affected if we \nfail to act. There are very few bills that can ever make that claim, \nand yet health care issues affect 100 percent of the Nation. Most bills \nwe deal with deal with percentages. Family and medical leave--50 \nmillion benefited by it, far short of the 300-plus million in our \ncountry. Health care affects every single one of our citizens and is \nwhy, again, it demands our attention and our resolution.\n  So to those who are not ready to join in this effort, we invite your \nsuggestions, your improvements, your thoughts to come to that table. \nListening to some of our colleagues say this is all about defeating the \nPresident or making sure no one has a political victory, I have to ask \nwhat planet are they living on to believe this debate ought to be about \nwho wins and who loses a political contest on this issue?\n  Again, it is not about us. It is about people across this country who \nare expecting a lot more from us who do not wake up and wonder what \npolitical party they belong to or what section of the country they live \nin. If their child gets sick, if their spouse is sick and struggling \nand needing help, the last thing they want to hear about is whether you \nare a Democrat or a Republican or an Independent or live in a blue \nState, a red State, or whatever other color you want to attribute to \nthem. They want to know if we have the sense to deal with this issue.\n  The truth is, we have waited too long. We have waited far too long. \nWe have waited decades now. And the American people have been waiting \neven longer. Their wait is much more painful than ours. There is no \ncause for delay.\n  Yes, you have to examine the bill. We have to look at it, consider \nsuggestions, but that only happens when you sit down and work together.\n  We spent those 60 hours in the HELP Committee, and it was not easy \nand it was not comfortable, and people got tired and frustrated at \nvarious moments, and there were times I thought it was going to fall \napart. But I knew if we ever stopped and walked away, then those who \nwanted no result, no answer to this, would win. So day after day I \nasked my colleagues to come back and sit at that table and work.\n  What I said earlier I mean deeply: There were those who, frankly, \nmight have decided not to show up, and that might have had a political \nconclusion; but they did show up. My Republican colleagues, as well as \nmy Democratic colleagues, showed up every single day and worked to make \nthat a better bill, even though there were those who voted against it. \nSo there is no cause for delay. There is no cause for obstruction. And \nthere is no excuse for inaction, in my view.\n  In a few weeks, we will return to our various States for the so-\ncalled August break, although, frankly, I am prepared to stay here and \nwork. That may not be a popular idea, but I cannot think of anything \nmore important than this issue, including whether we take some time off \nin August to go to the beach and go to the mountains or go to the lakes \nor wherever we go to visit with our constituents. Remember that every \nday we are on our break, another 14,000--every day in that August break \nwe will take--will be without health care at the end of that day--every \nday; 14,000 a day--while we are drifting off instead of engaging in \nwhat we ought to be doing, in my view, and coming to terms with this \nissue.\n  Some will be among the ranks of the uninsured. Some are struggling \nand scared, bearing the emotional and physical scars that come with \ndelaying the foregoing needed care, worrying that one car accident, one \ndiagnosis could mean bankruptcy, foreclosure, or, in fact, the \ninability to get any care at all. Some will have insurance, but they \nwill share the same worries because their insurance costs are much too \nhigh and covers far too little. They will be thinking about the jobs \nthey wish they could leave to maybe start a small business but cannot \nbecause they would lose their insurance lifeline. They will be \nwondering whether their plan will decide to cover cancer screening when \nthey are told by their doctor they actually need it. They will be \nwondering how many visits to the doctor, how many visits to the \nhospital will be adequate. Some will not be worried about their \ninsurance today, but they will be among the millions who will lose \ntheir insurance if they do not step up to the plate and take some \naction.\n  But everyone we see when we go home will be watching us over the next \n3 weeks. You better believe they are going to ask us about health care. \nThey are going to ask us whether we are up to the job of passing a bill \nthis year. They are going to ask us why we have not made more progress. \nThey are going to ask us fundamental questions, ones we will have to \nanswer for ourselves based on what we do in these coming days and \nweeks.\n  At this very moment, we stand at the cusp of history--one of those \nunique moments. It does not happen very often around here, but every \nnow and\n\n[[Page S7944]]\n\nthen it happens, and we are in one. And it is not going to last long. \nIt is only going to last a few more weeks, maybe a couple of months, as \nto whether, in this moment, we have the ability to rise up and do what \nwe should be doing--even though it does not meet our ideals; it is not \nthe bill each one of us would write on our own--but that moment when we \nrecognize our failure to act at all is a moment missed and not likely \nto be recaptured during our tenure.\n  I know for newer Members here that may seem like an exaggeration, but \nto those of us who have been here a while, we will tell you, these \nmoments do not come very often. Most of the time we go through the \nroutine of reauthorizing bills, reappropriating money, and that \nconsumes about 95 percent of our time--not unimportant business, I will \nbe the first to admit, but fairly routine.\n  And every now and then--every now and then--in our Nation's history, \nthere have been moments of critical importance: in the early 1960s, the \nCivil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, Medicare; going back in the \ndepression years; the Eisenhower years, with the Federal Highway System \nin our country. You can point to various times through the 20th century \nwhen Congress, contrary to what everyone else thought--this \ninstitution--decided to take on an issue that made a difference in our \ncountry.\n  I suspect Barack Obama, in part, had a chance to be elected President \nof the United States because people he never knew and who never knew \nhim sat here day after day, week after week, and engaged in the debate \non civil rights--back long before any of us were ever here, except for \nBob Byrd, who was here, and Ted Kennedy, who was here. Those two \nMembers actually were in this Chamber in those days in the early 1960s, \nand today we are a lot better country. We are a lot better country \nbecause of it.\n  And that was one heck of a fight, let me tell you. I was a young page \nsitting on the floor here in the summer of 1961 and 1962, when Lyndon \nJohnson was sitting where the Presiding Officer is, watching the all-\nnight debates on civil rights. And they were raucous, and they were \nwild, and they were tough. There was no bipartisanship on that, I can \ntell you. It was down right tough and nasty. Those memories fade. What \nremains is the fact that this institution had leaders who stood up and \nsaid: We are going to get this done. And they achieved those results. \nAnd today we celebrate those moments.\n  We have forgotten about the bitterness that occurred in the debates. \nNo one is asking whether it was bipartisan or whether coalitions got \nwhat they wanted. The response was: the United States got closer to \nthat more perfect union that our Founders described more than two \ncenturies ago.\n  Well, we are in that moment again. And in many ways this is a civil \nrights debate about health care, because too many of our fellow \ncitizens are denied that right of health care based on economic \ncircumstances beyond their control. The issue is very simply this: Will \nwe come together and decide, at a moment like this, to get a job done \nor will we take the easier path and step back because it is a little \ntoo tough?\n  Others have failed at it. It means I might lose some votes back home. \nBut there are certain issues that are worth losing an election over. \nThat is not the worst thing that ever happened to someone. Watching \nyour family go bankrupt, losing your home, watching a child or a spouse \nsuffer because you do not have enough money to buy health care, that is \na problem. That is a real problem.\n  So the issues here are complicated. I know that. I know they are \ndifficult. I know if they were easy, they would have been solved a long \ntime ago. But I have a lot of confidence. I listened to 22 of my \ncolleagues over 5 weeks in a markup become educated and grapple with \nthese issues. We did not resolve all of them, but we educated ourselves \nand made a difference and produced a bill--a bill that is now the only \none in this Chamber that is before us. We hope our colleagues will \nexamine it, take a look at it, make whatever recommendations they could \nas we move forward. I know the Finance Committee is wrestling with \nthis. Senator Baucus and I arrived on the same day in Congress in 1975. \nWe have been friends for 35 years. I know he is struggling to get the \nright kind of bill to come out of that committee. I wish him the very \nbest and have offered whatever help we can to assist in that effort. I \nhope we can get a product that moves forward, that we can embrace and \nbe proud of, and that will make a difference.\n\n  So for the coming days, I won't take as much time as I have this \nevening, but I want to talk about this bill in detail. I want to engage \nin the debate. I want to get away from the cheap politics, the bumper \nsticker slogans about things that don't exist, the fear that is so easy \nto arouse in people--the easiest emotion to appeal to is people's fears \nand hates--and talk constructively and positively about what we can do \ntogether to overcome this issue that is a scourge on our society and \nworthy of this Chamber's efforts.\n  I thank my colleagues for their the patience this evening and for \nlistening to all of this, and I thank the Chair for his patience. I \nlook forward to the hour when we will come together as a body here--not \nas Democrats and as Republicans, but as United States Senators--at this \nmoment and pass a major health care reform bill that moves our country \nto accessibility, to affordability, and equality of health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/22/senate-section/article/S7944-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S7944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRATULATING SENATOR BEGICH\n\n  Mr. DODD.
