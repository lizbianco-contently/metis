Mr. President, following leader remarks, if any, the Senate \nwill turn to a period of morning business for 2 hours, with Senators \nduring that period of time allowed to speak for up to 10 minutes. \nFollowing morning business, the Senate will proceed to executive \nsession and will debate the nomination of GEN David Petraeus. There \nwill be up to 20 minutes for debate prior to a vote on confirmation of \nthe nomination. Senators should expect that vote to occur around noon \ntoday.\n  As a reminder to all Senators, last evening I filed cloture on \nunemployment insurance and the home buyer tax credit extension. That \nvote would occur tomorrow unless we arrange, by unanimous consent, \nsometime today to do this. I will work with the Republican leader on an \nagreement that would let us vote on that issue today if the minority is \nso determined.\n  We will also be able to resume consideration of the small business \njobs bill this afternoon. We will consider amendments. Rollcall votes \nare expected to occur throughout the afternoon and into the evening.\n  I say to Democratic Senators, we were looking yesterday for an \namendment, but none was available. So I agreed to have something happen \nin the interim and let the Republicans offer amendments if we have none \nready or offered. I hope we will also be able to resume consideration \nof this matter and make headway. It is extremely important that we do \nthat.\n  On unemployment compensation, we really need to do this. I have had a \nnumber of conversations with Senators from individual States about how \ndifficult it is for them to have these long-term unemployed no longer \nhaving anyplace to go for help, and there are newspaper articles about \npeople who are desperate throughout America. So I hope we can do \nsomething on that.\n  We have here, and I will call for it in a little bit, the reading of \nthe bill we got from the House of Representatives dealing with \nextending the first-time home buyer tax credit. That will allow the \npaperwork to be completed. There is significant support on the other \nside for this, and I would hope we could do this by consent. If not, it \nwill be part of the vote we have on unemployment compensation. There is \nno effort to do anything other than to get these two matters passed. So \nI would hope my friends on the other side of the aisle would consider \njust letting us do the home buyers assistance, the thing that passed \nthe House. It is paid for. It has been agreed to by Democrats and \nRepublicans. It passed the House last night with 400 votes--400 votes. \nSo I would hope we could get that done by consent. It is the end of the \nmonth today, and we should get this done. I hope we can do that.\n  As many people are aware, Senator Byrd will lay in repose in the \nSenate Chamber from 10 a.m. until 4 p.m. tomorrow. The family will be \nin the Chamber from 10 a.m. until 12 noon.

Mr. President, yesterday, President Obama invited a \ngroup of Senators down to the White House to talk about the kind of \nenergy bill he would like Congress to pass sometime this summer.\n  The first thing we heard about this meeting is that the President \nsaid it was not a meeting about the oilspill. Let me say that again. \nThe President said the purpose of this meeting was not to discuss the \nongoing crisis in the Gulf of Mexico, where up to 60,000 barrels of oil \nare spewing into the gulf waters each and every day, and which have \nbeen for 72 days now.\n  Senator Alexander had to raise the issue himself, only to be \ndismissed by the President. Well, I am sure that will be of great \ncomfort to the people of the gulf coast. When the President called \nSenators to the White House to talk about energy, I am sure most people \nin the gulf thought the crisis down there would at least be a topic of \ndiscussion. Evidently, they were wrong.\n  The second thing we heard about the meeting is that the President \nmade what was described as a ``very passionate'' argument in favor of \n``putting a price on carbon.'' This, of course, is code for the new \nnational energy tax commonly referred to around here as cap and trade.\n  This is what the meeting was really about. And those of us who said \nthat this is also what the President was talking about in his Oval \nOffice speech a couple weeks ago were right: when the President urged \nAmericans to view the gulf oilspill as a reason to embrace his vision \nof energy consumption in this country, he was talking about giving \ngovernment vast new powers over industry and over the everyday lives of \nAmericans through a new national energy tax.\n  In other words, at a moment when the American people were hoping to \nhear about what the White House was doing to fix the oil leak in the \ngulf, the President was using that moment to prepare the ground for yet \nanother piece of legislation that would expand the reach of government, \nand which would do absolutely nothing to solve the crisis at hand.\n  The leak still is not fixed. For more than 2 months, this pipe has \ngushed oil into the gulf, polluting our waters and our beaches, \nwreaking havoc on the lives and livelihoods of millions along the gulf. \nI think it is most people's view that the left-wing wish-list can wait. \nFixing this immediate problem should be the top priority right now.\n  One of the President's senior advisers said the other day that when \nthe President was elected, he had to deal with problems that had been \nput off for too long. But the administration needs to solve the most \nurgent problems first, and the most urgent problem is not a new \nnational energy tax, it is the crisis in the gulf.\n  Former President Clinton had it right the other day. He said the \nFederal Government's position on this issue ought to be very \nstraightforward. The most important thing, he said, is to fix the leak. \nThe second most important thing is to keep oil away from the shores. \nThe third most important thing is to minimize the damage from the oil \nthat reaches the shores. And the fourth most important thing is to find \nout who did what wrong, at BP and in the Federal Government, and to \nhold them accountable.\n  But the first thing is to fix the leak.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5638-4", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5638]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

In response to the Republican leader's speech, I have \nthree words: Drill, baby, drill. That was the chant we heard across the \nUnited States from the Republican side of the aisle during the last \nPresidential campaign. The notion was that if we just started drilling \nin every direction, we could solve America's energy problems. It was an \nirresponsible chant, failing to address the most fundamental issue of \nour time: the future of America's national energy picture.\n  What you heard this morning from the Republican leader is a return to \nthe subject but ignoring the past. What we know is this: We know we \nhave become more and more dependent on foreign oil. It costs us, as a \nNation, $1 billion a day that we are sending overseas to other \ncountries to buy their oil to sustain our economy. This dependence, \nunfortunately, leads to commitments we have to make--military \ncommitments, political commitments, economic commitments--because of \nthis dependence on foreign oil.\n  The second reality is this: We understand there is a new, emerging \nenergy technology in the 21st century. It is an energy technology based \non efficiency, economy, and the reduction of costs. There are other \ncountries in the world that are taking the lead in this area, not the \nleast of which is the nation of China.\n  I recently heard from Michael Bennet of Colorado, who spoke to us at \na Democratic Senate luncheon. He came up with a statistic which in many \nways is hard to believe but equally scary, and here is what it is: The \nlargest export of the United States of America of any product is in the \naircraft industry. Look at Boeing. Look at all of the aircraft we are \nexporting around the world. It is our major export. Yet if you compare \nour major export to the export by China--by China--of energy technology \nto the world, they are now at 50 percent of the value of our annual \naircraft exports. China has decided that the future of the world is \nbased on new, clean energy technology, and they are doing something \nabout it. They don't come to their leadership and squabble, at least \nnot in a public fashion; they get focused--focused on creating \nbusinesses and jobs and being ready to compete in the 21st century.\n  The third premise of our energy policy goes to something on which the \nSenator from Kentucky may or may not agree with me. I happen to believe \nthe activities of humans on this Earth make a difference when it comes \nto the planet. I happen to believe when we look at glacial melt around \nthe world, it reflects the fact that the world is changing. Ever so \ngradually, it is getting warmer. As the Earth increases its \ntemperature, it changes weather patterns, the currents of the oceans, \nthe land we live on, the crops we grow, and our future. Some people \ndon't accept that. Some don't see a connection. They don't believe any \nof the carbon released into the atmosphere creates a problem. I have \nmet many of them. Some are people who in good faith don't come to the \nsame conclusion I reach. I respect them, but I respectfully think they \nare wrong.\n\n[[Page S5639]]\n\n  What have we learned from the gulf crisis? We have learned a lot. \nYesterday I had one of the vice presidents of BP America in my office. \nI talked to him about how we have reached this point. I said: When we \nhave reached the point where we are drilling deep, going after the \ntough, deep oil to fuel our economy and its needs, we are engendering \nmore problems and more challenges than before. Had there been a spill \nof oil in downstate Illinois or in Alaska or Texas, it would have been \nterrible, but it could have been contained much more quickly than this \ngusher of oil coming from the floor of the Gulf of Mexico. As we \nexplore in new areas, tougher, more challenging areas, we run greater \nrisk. That is a reality.\n  I take exception to the remarks of the Senator from Kentucky who \nsuggested this administration is not doing everything in its power to \ndeal with this spill in the gulf. Let's look at what we have done. This \nPresident called in BP and made it clear that the cost of this damage \nwill be borne by that oil company, not by the taxpayers. I was \npleasantly surprised when the Governor of Mississippi, Haley Barbour, a \nman who in the past was as passionate in his beliefs as I am in my \nDemocratic beliefs, came out and praised President Obama for sitting \ndown with BP and getting a commitment of $20 billion in a fund to deal \nwith the economic losses associated with this spill. BP has bought \ncommercials that most of us have seen saying: We will pay for this, all \nof it. I don't know if the Senator from Kentucky thinks that is \nunimportant. I believe it is important.\n  Secondly, I am as troubled by the continuing spill as anyone. I know \nthe President feels that has to end and end immediately. But as the \nSenator from Kentucky knows, we don't have a U.S. department of deep \nsea drilling. It doesn't exist. What we are relying on is the private \nsector's capacity, technology, equipment, and expertise to find a way \nto cope with this problem. I am as frustrated as any American that on \nday 75 of this spill, it has not come to an end. But it continues. The \nPresident focuses on this every day, as does his Cabinet.\n  Yesterday we had a meeting with Interior Secretary Ken Salazar. The \nman has spent day after weary day devoting himself completely to this. \nCarol Browner, an environmental assistant in the White House, was there \ntalking about the massive commitment which we have made. She was asked \npointblank: Are you providing the booms, the things they spread out in \nthe water to stop the flow and spread of this oil, are you supplying \nall of the booms requested by all of the States in the Gulf of Mexico?\n  She said: We are supplying not only 100 percent of their requests but \nover 100 percent of their requests, and we are going to continue to \nmanufacture and secure this boom to protect our shoreline. She said: Of \ncourse, we haven't done everything right, but when we see a problem, we \nmove on it quickly to try to solve it.\n  We are talking about the commitment of thousands of vessels to skim \nthe surface of the gulf and to try to salvage as much of this oil as \npossible. It is a massive national commitment by our government, by the \nprivate sector. The suggestion of the Senator from Kentucky that the \nPresident is not focused on it is not accurate nor fair.\n  I believe we need to focus on energy. We need to be honest about the \nfuture when it comes to energy. If we accept the premise that we will \ncontinue to be dependent on foreign oil indefinitely, that we will \nspend a billion dollars a day, sending it to many countries which not \nonly disagree with us in terms of our values but turn around and spend \nour dollars against us to foster and to be patrons to terrorism, if we \naccept that, then we will do nothing about a national energy policy. If \nwe accept the premise that we should do nothing about clean energy \ntechnology and all the potential for business and jobs it creates, that \nAmerica is going to take a back seat to China and other countries, then \nwe will do nothing about the national energy policy. If we accept the \npremise that there is no global warming and we should not lose a \nmoment's sleep worrying about it, then we will do nothing about a \nnational energy policy.\n  That is what we hear from the other side of the aisle, do nothing, \nsay no. Over and over throughout this congressional session, the \nresponse of Senate Republicans has been say no. When we tackled the \ntough and controversial issue of containing health care costs, runaway \ncosts that are affecting every business, every family and every level \nof government, Republicans said: No, we will not engage. We will not be \npart of that conversation.\n  When we went after Wall Street reform and said: After this recession, \nwe have learned lessons; we will not allow these titans on Wall Street \nto repeat their mistakes and kill more jobs in the future, all but four \nRepublicans said: No, we are not interested in that conversation. We \ndon't want to be part of that effort.\n  Now we find again, in one of the most telling and important issues of \nthe moment, unemployment compensation for the hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans out of work, Republicans have said, no, we will not lend a \nhelping hand to the people of America out of work.\n  I look at the numbers of those who are unemployed across the country, \nwho will lose their benefits because Republicans continue to say no. I \nlook at States such as Kentucky, the home State of the Republican \nleader, where 22,600 Kentucky families had their unemployment cut off \nbecause Senator McConnell and his colleagues voted no when it came to \nextending unemployment benefits. In my State of Illinois, 80,000 \nfamilies had their unemployment cut off this month because Republicans \nsaid no. One of my friends who is a woman out of work, with a family, \ncalled me over the weekend at home. We keep in touch. She said: Let me \ntell you, Senator, what it means. They are cutting off the utilities. I \ndon't know what to do. Three kids in the house and a grandson, and they \nare cutting off my utilities.\n  That is the real world of the real votes cast by the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  This morning the New York Times had an editorial which I want to make \nreference to. I ask unanimous consent that this editorial be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 30, 2010]\n\n                   Who Will Fight for the Unemployed?\n\n       Without doubt, the two biggest threats to the economy are \n     unemployment and the dire financial condition of the states, \n     yet lawmakers have failed to deal intelligently with either \n     one.\n       Federal unemployment benefits began to expire nearly a \n     month ago. Since then, 1.2 million jobless workers have been \n     cut off. The House passed a six-month extension as part of a \n     broader spending bill in May, but the Senate, despite three \n     attempts, has not been able to pass a similar bill. The \n     majority leader, Harry Reid, said he was ready to give up \n     after the third try last week when all of the Senate's \n     Republicans and a lone Democrat, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, \n     blocked the bill.\n       Meanwhile, the states face a collective budget hole of some \n     $112 billion, but neither the House nor the Senate has a plan \n     to help. The House stripped a provision for $24 billion in \n     state fiscal aid from its earlier spending bill. The Senate \n     included state aid in its ill-fated bill to extend \n     unemployment benefits; when that bill failed, the promise of \n     aid vanished as well.\n       As a result, 30 states that had counted on the money to \n     help balance their budgets will be forced to raise taxes even \n     higher and to cut spending even deeper in the budget year \n     that begins on July 1. That will only worsen unemployment, \n     both among government workers and the states' private \n     contractors. Worsening unemployment means slower growth, or \n     worse, renewed recession.\n       So if lawmakers are wondering why consumer confidence and \n     the stock market are tanking (the Standard & Poor's 500-stock \n     index hit a new low for the year on Tuesday), they need look \n     no further than a mirror.\n       The situation cries out for policies to support economic \n     growth--specifically jobless benefits and fiscal aid to \n     states. But instead of delivering, Congressional Republicans \n     and many Democrats have been asserting that the nation must \n     act instead to cut the deficit. The debate has little to do \n     with economic reality and everything to do with political \n     posturing. A lot of lawmakers have concluded that the best \n     way to keep their jobs is to pander to the nation's new \n     populist mood and play off the fears of the very Americans \n     whose economic well-being Congress is threatening.\n       Deficits matter, but not more than economic recovery, and \n     not more urgently than the economic survival of millions of \n     Americans. A sane approach would couple near-term federal \n     spending with a credible plan for deficit reduction--a mix of \n     tax increases\n\n[[Page S5640]]\n\n     and spending cuts--as the economic recovery takes hold.\n       But today's deficit hawks--many of whom eagerly \n     participated in digging the deficit ever deeper during the \n     George W. Bush years--are not interested in the sane \n     approach. In the Senate, even as they blocked the extension \n     of unemployment benefits, they succeeded in preserving a tax \n     loophole that benefits wealthy money managers at private \n     equity firms and other investment partnerships. They also \n     derailed an effort to end widespread tax avoidance by owners \n     of small businesses organized as S-corporations. If they are \n     really so worried about the deficit, why balk at these \n     evidently sensible ways to close tax loopholes and end tax \n     avoidance?\n       House lawmakers made an effort on Tuesday to extend jobless \n     benefits but failed to get the necessary votes, and it \n     remains uncertain if an extension can pass both the House and \n     Senate before Congress leaves town on Friday for a weeklong \n     break. What's needed, and what's lacking, is leadership, both \n     in Congress and from the White House, to set the terms of the \n     debate--jobs before deficit reduction--and to fight for those \n     terms, with failure not an option.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. The New York Times editorial today reads: ``Who Will \nFight for the Unemployed?''\n  I want to quote a few sentences from it:\n\n       Without doubt, the two biggest threats to the economy are \n     unemployment and the dire financial condition of the states, \n     yet lawmakers have failed to deal intelligently with either \n     one.\n       Federal unemployment benefits began to expire nearly a \n     month ago. Since then, 1.2 million jobless workers have been \n     cut off. The House passed a six-month extension as part of a \n     broader spending bill in May, but the Senate, despite three \n     attempts, has not been able to pass a similar bill. The \n     majority leader, Harry Reid, said he was ready to give up \n     after the third try last week when all of the Senate's \n     Republicans and a lone Democrat, Ben Nelson of Nebraska, \n     blocked the bill.\n       Meanwhile, the states face a collective budget hole of some \n     $112 billion, but neither the House nor the Senate has a plan \n     to help. The House stripped a provision for $24 billion in \n     state fiscal aid from its earlier spending bill. The Senate \n     included state aid in its ill-fated bill to extend \n     unemployment benefits; when that bill failed, the promise of \n     aid vanished as well.\n       As a result, 30 states that had counted on the money to \n     help balance their budgets will be forced to raise taxes even \n     higher and to cut spending even deeper in the budget year \n     that begins on July 1. That will only worsen unemployment, \n     both among government workers and the states' private \n     contractors. Worsening unemployment means slower growth, or \n     worse, renewed recession.\n\n  I might add a comment here. This morning's newspapers, the Washington \nPost and the New York Times, at least the ones I have seen, and the \nChicago papers as well, question what the reaction of our economy is \ngoing to be. They looked at the stock market yesterday. One day does \nnot make a trend, but there is a growing concern that we are sliding \nback into a recession because of the failure of Republicans to support \nnot only the President's stimulus package but also to send unemployment \nbenefits to those needy people across America. This is a repeat, \nunfortunately, of a chapter in American history when after the Great \nDepression, President Roosevelt initiated the New Deal and injected \ninto our economy massive amounts of money to create jobs so people \nwould go to work, earn a paycheck, and spend it for goods and services, \nbreathing life back into a dying economy, trying to turn it around. \nAfter 4 years of that effort, President Roosevelt, at the urging of \nmore conservative political leaders, said: We better start focusing now \non the deficit. They started tapping the breaks on spending, and the \nunemployment rate shot up again, creating a follow-on to the Great \nDepression which was not relieved until the beginning of World War II.\n  Sadly, it appears we are about to repeat that historical mistake. We \nknow Republicans continue to argue that because of our deficit, we \nshould not worry about the recession or spending money to stimulate the \ncreation of jobs. The money we send out to unemployed people is turned \naround immediately into the economy. These people are living hand to \nmouth. Every dollar they receive is spent. As it is spent at a \nbusiness, it creates business profits and small business jobs. One \nthing leads to another as the multiplier takes that dollar, respends it \nmany times in our economy and breathes life back into an economy which \nhas been fraught with a recession. That is the reality of the need \ntoday. The failure to meet that need will guarantee the deficit \ncontinues and gets worse. It will be a self-fulfilling prophecy as \nRepublicans turn down unemployment benefits, arguing that we can't \nafford it as a nation because of the deficit and, as a result, drive up \nunemployment in the country, driving up the very deficits they say they \nwant to end. It is a lesson of history. Those who ignore history are \nlikely and condemned to repeat it.\n  Returning to this New York Times editorial:\n\n       So if lawmakers are wondering why consumer confidence and \n     the stock market are tanking (the Standard & Poor's 500-stock \n     index hit a new low for the year on Tuesday), they need look \n     no further than a mirror.\n       The situation cries out for policies to support economic \n     growth--specifically jobless benefits and fiscal aid to \n     states. But instead of delivering, Congressional Republicans \n     and many Democrats have been asserting that the nation must \n     act instead to cut the deficit. The debate has little to do \n     with economic reality and everything to do with political \n     posturing. A lot of lawmakers have concluded that the best \n     way to keep their jobs is to pander to the nation's new \n     populist mood and play off the fears of the very Americans \n     whose economic well-being Congress is threatening.\n       Deficits matter, but not more than economic recovery, and \n     not more urgently than the economic survival of millions of \n     Americans. A sane approach would couple near-term federal \n     spending with a credible plan for deficit reduction--a mix of \n     tax increases and spending cuts--as the economic recovery \n     takes hold.\n\n  This New York City editorial summarizes what I consider the \nsituation. In a short period of time, after the memorial to our fallen \ncolleague Senator Byrd, who served this Nation and West Virginia so \nwell, we will probably have one vote tomorrow evening and then head \nback to our homes. For many people it will be a time of relaxation with \nfamily. For many Senators it is a rest that is needed after a lot of \ndays spent in session in the Senate. As we return, in my home State, \n80,000 families won't be celebrating the Fourth of July. They will be \nwondering how they are going to pay their utility bills and feed their \nfamilies. For the rest of us who live in comfort, full-time employment, \nit may be a world removed. But for them, it is the world of reality \nthey face every single day. Their life has become more complicated, and \ntheir burden is heavier because this Senate has failed to extend \nunemployment benefits.\n  Mr. President, 1.2 million Americans in the month of June will lose \ntheir unemployment benefits because not one single Republican would \nvote to help Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own. Where they would find permission to spend money on so many \nother things, when it comes to investing in American families who have \nfallen on hard times, they turn a deaf ear. That, to me, is sad and \nunfortunate. We need to address many issues in this Congress. It \ntroubles me that we would consider going home for anything near a \nholiday or a relief from our Senate duties and ignore the burdens \nfacing Americans who are in unemployed status or who have trouble in \ntheir families because of this weak economy.\n  I sincerely hope a handful--three or four Republicans--will consider \nvoting for unemployment benefits for those across America who are out \nof work. We come to the aid of the American family when people are in \nneed. When there is a natural disaster, we are there. This is an \neconomic disaster. It requires an emergency response. We should not \nleave Washington without dealing with it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nAlaska is recognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Illinois, I was \npresiding for about a half hour. I was not planning on speaking. I know \nmy staff right now is getting very nervous that I am speaking on the \nfloor of the Senate without their knowledge, but I do want to say a \ncouple things.\n  I say to the Senator, one, he is absolutely right on unemployment \nbenefits and what we need to do in the next day or so. But I want to go \nback to his first comment. I was at the meeting yesterday with the \nPresident, and I sat next to Senator Alexander and heard the question \non the oilspill issue. The comment from the Republican leader was that \nthe President just brushed it aside. I am not here to defend the \nPresident. He can do his own job defending himself. But the point was, \nwe\n\n[[Page S5641]]\n\nwere doing everything in a very bipartisan way on the oilspill.\n  Tomorrow we have another briefing with the Coast Guard. We had a \nbriefing yesterday. There is a committee meeting I am supposed to be at \nright now on some liability issues around the Deepwater and what is \ngoing on with offshore. There are meetings all over this place.\n  I know the Republican leader was not at the meeting, so I am sure he \ngot the information secondhand. But I was. It was not brushed off. I \nthink all of us, I do not care what State we are from--I am from an oil \nand gas State--believe in the development of oil and gas, but we are \nall concerned about the problems down in the gulf and the tragedy and \nthe 11 lives that were lost there. So we are 100 percent committed in \nthis body in a bipartisan way.\n  What I found amazing--and the Senator's point was we can do more than \none thing in this body. I believe I can. I know everyone around me and \naround my caucus believes that. So we are going to work on the \noilspill. Absolutely we want to cap it. But that is going on now. They \nare 16,000 feet down on a second drill, a relief drill. They are about \n1,000 feet away. We know that is being worked on.\n  But the reality is, we have to have a comprehensive energy plan in \nthis country. The fact is, if we want to talk about jobs and job \ncreation in the future, that is a huge potential for us.\n  This debate, when we get to it--I know some want to make it cap and \ntax, cap and trade, cap and cap, cap and something. But the reality is, \nthis is about a comprehensive energy plan. This is about creating a \nplan that gets us more secure for our national security. I say to the \nSenator, he talked about the amount of money we spend overseas going to \ncountries that do not like us. They spend that money against us. It is \nin our best interests to develop a comprehensive plan, not using the \nexcuses that have gone around this place for the last 40 years. We need \nto get busy and do it for the consumer, do it for our national \nsecurity, do it for our economic security, and do it for the future of \njob creation in this economy.\n  So if we want to talk about the oilspill, absolutely. We will work \ndouble-time on that. We are doing it from every end of the Capitol and \nall across this country. As a matter of fact, today another report came \nout. A multinational effort, a multicountry effort from around the \nworld has come to our assistance in the gulf. But we also need to be \ndealing with a comprehensive energy plan.\n  In Alaska, we are doing it. By 2025 we intend to have 50 percent of \nour energy produced by renewable energy. Even though we are dependent \non oil and gas for the economic viability of our State, we recognize \nthe diversity that has to happen: In Kodiak, AK, 10 years ago, zero; \ntoday, almost 85 percent renewable energy. The largest Coast Guard \nstation in this country is in Kodiak, AK, which will be run by \nrenewable energy: biofuels, hydro, wind energy.\n  We have to be real about this issue. I understand the politics of \nNovember is coming. Everyone wants to be for something, against \nsomething so they can figure out what constituencies they win or lose \nin an election. The people who will lose if we do not get a \ncomprehensive energy plan is the public. It does not matter if we are \nDemocrat or Republican, Green Party, Independent. You name it. We are \ngoing to be affected because we will continue to import from foreign \nsources that do not like us. We will continue to put our country at \nrisk from a national security perspective, and we will not recognize \nthat we are now No. 2, No. 3 when it comes to energy technology and \nChina is beating us.\n  That is unacceptable for this country to be No. 2 or No. 3 on this \nissue. We should be No. 1. For people to come down wanting to pigeon-\nhole this and claim we do not have the capacity in the Senate to do \nmore than one thing is unbelievable. We will work double-time on the \noilspill. But we must work double-time on developing an energy policy \nthat moves us to better security for our country, our economic \nsecurity, and to make sure we see the future. The future is a new \nenergy economy that creates new jobs in this country.\n  So I was not planning to speak, I say to the Senator from Illinois, \nbut he sparked me. I get agitated sometimes when this body--not the \nSenator, obviously, but the Republican leader--when they want to just \ndo one thing. It is like when a person gets a meal on a plate, and one \nperson just likes to eat the corn first, complete it all, and then they \nmove to the next thing. We have the capacity to do many things in this \nSenate. We have spent 40 years--from the last major embargo in 1974--\ntwiddling our thumbs and doing small, little, special interest \nlegislation for energy. Now let's do the right legislation for the \nAmerican people and do it right for our national security.\n  So I will stop on my rant. My staff is probably sweating bullets \nright now. They had no idea I was going to be down here doing this. I \nam off to a committee hearing.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield briefly for a \nquestion, 21 years ago, I went up to Prince William Sound to see the \nExxon Valdez spill. I say to the Senator, I know he knows, as a native \nof Alaska, firsthand how terrible these spills can be, the impact they \ncan have in the short and long term. But I commend the Senator for his \nstatement because we can do more than one thing if we are working \ntogether. If we are divided and at war politically, we do not \naccomplish much.\n  What the President wants us to do is deal with the gulf oilspill but \nalso not ignore the need for a national energy policy that is going to \nmake us stronger, create more jobs, and make us less dependent on \nforeign oil.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska for his comments.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank the Senator for sparking me for the day.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  While I will be speaking on the subject of Senator Byrd, I, too, want \nto join my colleague from Illinois in commending our Senator from \nAlaska on this issue and so many others. The Senator's staff does not \nhave to worry. He speaks fluidly, eloquently, and without flaw. But, \nsecond, I think his courage on this issue has helped inspire our caucus \nto move forward.\n  We come from different States. For some States it is easier; for some \nStates it is harder to take on this issue. Probably for Alaska it is \none of the two or three hardest States to do it, and the Senator has \ndone it with courage, with intelligence, with drive, and I think \nultimately with success.\n  So I thank the Senator.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5641-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5641-S5645]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, it is with deep sadness that I rise to \nhonor my colleague and friend, Senator Robert C. Byrd. I look at the \nsimple eloquence of the roses and the black felt on his desk, and, sort \nof, he rises above that and hovers above us in just about everything we \ndo.\n  The admiration that all of us in this body have for Senator Byrd is \ngenuine and palpable. We miss him dearly, and I know I speak for the \nentire Senate when I say our thoughts and prayers are with Senator \nByrd's family as they mourn his passing.\n  Mr. President, no one loved the Senate more than Robert Byrd. He \ndevoted his life to this august institution and, in doing so, became an \ninstitution himself. He is a legend--a man who embodied the best ideals \nof this body. It is fitting that on this day we remember Senator Byrd \nthe Senate is undertaking one of its most important constitutionally \nmandated responsibilities: the confirmation hearings for a Supreme \nCourt Associate Justice.\n  Senator Byrd would remind us that we are in a process where the first \nbranch of government is giving its advice and consent to a selection \nfrom the second branch of government in choosing someone to sit on the \nhighest part of the third branch of government.\n  He loved the Constitution, he loved the Senate, he loved America, and \nhe came from the bosom of America.\n  I am struck by the history of this moment. We read about the great \nSenators who served in this body--the Websters and the Clays, the \nLaFollettes and the Wagners. Well, I cannot help but feel privileged to \nhave served, in my brief time--certainly compared to the Senators \nhere--with a legend, with a man whose name will go down in history \nbeside those men as\n\n[[Page S5642]]\n\none of the great men in this body and one of the great men in history.\n  On Thursday, Mr. President, Senator Byrd will make one final visit to \nthis Senate Chamber that he so loved. There could be no more \nappropriate way for us to say good-bye to him and honor him than to \nyield the Senate floor to him for one last time.\n  People asked, why not the Rotunda? It was not that he did not deserve \ntribute in the Rotunda, and, for sure, tens of thousands would have \nlined up. But this is the body he loved, and this is the body where his \nfinal day here should be.\n  I would like to share a few brief thoughts and reflect on Senator \nByrd's service to the people of West Virginia and the Nation.\n  The most important thing we should all remember about Robert Byrd is \nhis life story, for it embodies America, the best of America. It \nembodies the American dream. Because of his intelligence, his \nindefatigable energy, and up-by-the-bootstraps determination, he rose \nfrom a childhood marred by abject poverty to being three heartbeats \naway from the Presidency.\n  He made mistakes in his earlier career, which he freely admitted \nlater. Who has not? But he just grew and grew and grew. That is what \ngreat men do: they grow larger and stronger and better as they go \nthrough life. That could certainly be said of Senator Byrd.\n  Unlike many of the great men who preceded him, Senator Byrd did not \ngrow up as a member of a privileged class. He was an orphan, raised in \nthe Appalachian coal towns of West Virginia. He graduated from high \nschool at 16 as the valedictorian, but like so many Americans of his \nday, he was too poor and could not afford college.\n  So as a young Member of Congress, he worked his way through law \nschool, and, at age 46, he earned the diploma--with honors--that had \neluded him in his youth.\n  I remember his love of West Virginia. When I was new in this body, \njust learning it--and part of the way I learned it was by going to \nSenator Byrd's class on the rules of the Senate; legendary to each \nfreshman class of his time--but one day I was just seated at my desk, \nand Senator Byrd rose to speak. It was a Friday afternoon. I believe it \nwas in the springtime. Business was finished and everyone was rushing \nhome. As you know, Mr. President, I usually rush home. I love to be in \nNew York. But as I was getting ready to leave, Senator Byrd rose, and \nhis speech captivated me.\n  For 45 minutes he gave a speech on the beauty of West Virginia in the \nspringtime. The theme of the speech was to urge visitors from other \nStates to come experience it. It was an amazing speech. It was almost \nlike poetry. I am sure Senator Byrd probably did not have to sit and \nspend days preparing it. It just flowed off his lips, his love of West \nVirginia, combined with his eloquence. It is one of the speeches I will \nalways remember in the Senate, and I am just lucky and glad I was here \nfor that moment.\n  Then, speaking of my State of New York, Senator Byrd did not just \ntouch West Virginia, he touched every State. Because he was here for so \nlong, of course, he had such power but cared about each of the Members \nand their States.\n  The most striking moment I had with Senator Byrd occurred in the wake \nof 9/11. It was the day after that Senator Clinton and I went up to New \nYork, and we saw the devastation. We could smell death in the air, see \nthe anguished looks of people holding signs: Have you seen my husband? \nHave you seen my wife? The towers were gone, but people did not know \nwho had survived and who had not. Most did not, of course.\n  Then the next call we got, as we came back, was from Senator Byrd. \nSenator Byrd said: Please come to my office. We went to his office on \nthe first floor of the Capitol. He came to Senator Clinton and I and \nsaid: Chuck, Hillary, I want you to consider me the third Senator from \nthe great State of New York.\n  We knew we needed help, and we needed it fast. Even before we went to \nvisit President Bush and asked him for the help that New York needed, \nSenator Byrd, on his own, invited us over and pledged his help. Like \nalways, he lived up to his word, not just in the next days or weeks or \nmonths but years. I would go to him 3, 4 years later and say there is \nstill this part of the promise made to New York that hasn't been \nfulfilled. There he was, and he did it. Without a doubt, the dear city \nI love, New York City, would not have been able to recover as quickly \nor as well without that man from the coal fields of West Virginia, \nSenator Robert C. Byrd, helping us. He showed a level of selflessness \nthat is rarely seen, and I think I can speak on behalf of Secretary \nClinton and the people of New York in telling Senator Byrd how grateful \nwe are to him.\n\n  We all have so many memories of Senator Byrd, so many things. We only \nserved together a little less than 12 years, 11\\1/2\\ years, but he was \nlike a jewel. He had so many different facets that every one of us was \ntouched by him in many ways.\n  So I relate my last strong memory of Senator Byrd. The Presiding \nOfficer remembers as well because it was at a hearing of the Rules \nCommittee where we are now having a series of hearings under the \nsuggestion of the Presiding Officer and leadership to decide whether we \nshould reform the filibuster rule and what we should do about it. \nSenator Byrd, frail at that point, about a month ago, came to our \nhearing room. He sat next to me and then gave one of the best orations \nI have heard in a committee. He was 92. He turned the pages of his \nspeech himself. That wasn't so easy for him. It was clearly--knowing \nthe way he thought and his way of speaking--written completely by him. \nIt was an amazing statement. It was impassioned, erudite, balanced, \nand, as the Presiding Officer remembers, it electrified the room. It \nwas an amazing tour de force. The man cared so much about the Senate. \nDespite the fact he was ailing, there he was because he loved the \nSenate. His remarks, if my colleagues read them, were balanced. He \nunderstood the problems, but he understood the traditions, and he \ntried, as usual, to weave the two together.\n  There are few Senators who could do that, in the more than 200-year \nhistory of this body, the way he could. There are also few Senators in \nthis body who fought as hard for their States as Senator Byrd did. I \ncertainly admire the people who are here who become national leaders \nbut never forget where they came from. There is a tendency among some \nwho come to Washington to sort of forget where they came from. Not \nSenator Byrd. All across West Virginia, men and women are able to \nrealize the American dream because he fought for them. He was \nunrelenting and unapologetic in his desire to improve the lives of West \nVirginians by making generous investments in infrastructure and \nresearch. He brought that State into the future and afforded \ngenerations of West Virginians good-paying jobs, allowing them to \nprovide for their families and have the dignity all Americans deserve.\n  Some of the more elite parts of the media would make fun of what he \ndid, but I thought our colleague, Senator Rockefeller, said it best. I \nam paraphrasing; I read this in the newspaper. He said Senator Byrd \nrealized that until you get a road and a water system to these isolated \ntowns, you couldn't open the door of the future for them, and he knew \nthat. Senator Byrd relentlessly, in town after town after town, did \nthat. He fought to increase access to health care and ensure the people \nhad the right to vote, and he made sure every child in West Virginia \nhad the right to live up to his God-given potential through a quality \neducation.\n  Every one of us could go on and on about Senator Byrd's \naccomplishments, but I think what is even more important than \naccomplishments is who he was as a person. He was someone who knew \nwhere he stood but showed a profound willingness to evolve, and that is \na sign of extraordinary character. It is all too easy for an elected \nofficial to plug his ears and say: Sorry, that is my position; that is \nthe way it has always been, and that is the way it will always be. Not \nSenator Byrd. He was unafraid to take new arguments into consideration \nand expand his world view accordingly.\n  What also struck me about him was his fundamental humility, the best \nexample of which is probably his relationship with my dear friend and \nmentor, Ted Kennedy, another legend in\n\n[[Page S5643]]\n\nthis body who is so sorely missed. Ted somewhat unexpectedly ran \nagainst Senator Byrd to be the Democratic whip in 1969. Senator Kennedy \nwon. Two years later there was a rematch and Senator Byrd became the \nwhip. One would think after this kind of animus that the two of them \nwould never come together, but in their lives in the Senate they \nestablished a deep meaningful bond, a tribute to both of them.\n  Senator Kennedy would tell me stories about Senator Byrd and some of \nthe things he had done, serious and humorous. To me it is so profound \nthat within a year we have lost the two giants among whom I was proud \nand lucky to serve.\n  I will never forget when Senator Byrd, sick as he was, was outside \nthe steps of the Capitol to salute Ted Kennedy after he passed earlier \nthis year. It was Senator Byrd who provided the crucial vote to fulfill \nTed Kennedy's lifelong passion: Comprehensive health care reform. As \nevery Senator sat at their desk for the final passage vote, the clerk \ncalled the roll. When Senator Byrd's name was called, he raised his \nvoice as loud as he could and declared: ``Madam President, this is for \nmy friend Ted Kennedy. Aye!''\n  Those two friends, those two legends today are together again in \nheaven, and I would love to be able to hear the conversations and \nreminiscences between them.\n  Robert Byrd will be remembered forever. He will be remembered as a \nman who loved this institution and guarded its history. He will be \nremembered as a man who always stood up for his State. He is a man who \nwill be remembered as someone who lived the American dream and fought \nto make that dream a reality for countless others. Perhaps most of all, \nhe will be remembered as a loving father, grandfather, and husband.\n  Today the Senate mourns, the people of West Virginia mourn, the \nNation mourns.\n  I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I rise to speak about Senator Byrd, as \nmany of my colleagues have, and make a few comments about an \nextraordinary individual. Just the sheer numbers are very impressive. \nHe was married for 68 years, elected to 9 terms, had more than 20,000 \ndays of service in the Senate, approaching 19,000 rollcall votes cast, \nand had a 97-percent attendance record.\n  Senator Byrd was the majority leader from 1977 to 1981, and again \nfrom 1987 to 1989. He was President pro tempore four different times \nwhen his party was in the majority. The Senator from West Virginia was \nknown for his defense of the Constitution and the institutional \nprerogatives of the Senate. He was the author of five books, and he was \nan avid fiddler. The first place I ever saw Senator Byrd was playing \nthe fiddle on television. Boy, he could play. It was impressive to see \nsomebody of his stature playing an instrument so brilliantly.\n  In his biographical statement on his Web site, I found a statement \nthat I want to expand and build off of. It says:\n\n       In every corner of West Virginia, the people of the \n     Mountain State know that there is one man on whom they can \n     always depend: U.S. Senator Robert C. Byrd. He has always \n     remained true to his faith and his family, while working to \n     build a better future for his state and his country.\n\n  His remaining true to his faith and family was at the core of Senator \nByrd and his longevity, and at the core of his service.\n  While he spoke often and wrote well about the institutional \nprerogatives of the Senate better than anybody in the history of this \nbody, it is that his life centered around his core, remaining true to \nhis faith and his family. He was married for 68 years to his spouse, \nErma, who stayed by his side constantly, and of whom he would speak \noften.\n  Senator Byrd and I would speak about his faith on the floor \nfrequently. He was a man of deep faith and a man of strong convictions, \nand that was his centerpiece. He would often speak on this floor about \nhis faith.\n  I think what you saw in Senator Byrd in that statement about his \nfaith and his family is a cultural requirement for the United States. \nThis is a nation of strong faith, a nation that values family. At the \ncore of this country is that cultural need and necessity, and the \nleaders of the country need to have at their core a strong bearing \nwithin them, and that is a part of their service. That was a big part \nof Senator Byrd's service. His comments reflected the way he lived. \nOften people say that the way you live speaks louder than any words you \nsay. That is what I found with Senator Byrd. The way he lived was \nspeaking louder than any words.\n  It was the Senator's commitment within his family and his willingness \nto live that and his faith that spoke louder than any of his words. \nWhen we would talk about these things, you could see that they were at \nthe depth of his soul and being. Whether we agreed or disagreed on a \nnumber of things--and there were many disagreements I had with him on \npolicy issues, no question about that--you could never challenge his \ncore convictions. His faith and commitment to his family were things \nthat were obvious by the way he lived. You could have this sort of \ngentlemanly debate about topics that would come up, but you could never \nquestion or challenge the character and heart and soul of that.\n  What I found most endearing was Senator Byrd's commitment to faith \nand family. He will be greatly missed in this body. His treatise on the \nSenate that he gave to all new Members--and to me as a new Member \ncoming into the Senate--I started it and got through a portion, not all \nof it, but it was excellently written, well presented, and certainly a \ngood education as to what we should do in preserving the constitutional \nintegrity that the Founders intended for this body to be. He, of \ncourse, was the greatest defender of it.\n  Others have spoken more eloquently about Senator Byrd, but I don't \nthink any eloquence could match the eloquence with which he lived his \nlife--particularly toward his faith and his family. That is what we \nshould recognize the most.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, with the passing of our colleague, Robert \nByrd, a mighty oak in the forest of Senate history has fallen. There \nare flowers on his desk, but there is a tremendous void in our midst.\n  As we all know, Senator Byrd was the longest serving Senator in the \nhistory of this body. But what was most remarkable about Robert C. Byrd \nwas not his longevity but his unique stature and accomplishment in the \nSenate. No individual in our long history has been a more tenacious \nchampion of the traditions, prerogatives, and rules of this body.\n  Senator Byrd was very fond of noting how many Presidents he had \nserved under. He always answered, ``None.'' As he explained it, he had \nnever served under any President but he had served with 11 Presidents \nas a proud member of a separate and coequal branch of government.\n  Likewise, no individual has had greater reverence for the \nConstitution and for our Founders' vision for an assertive, independent \nlegislative branch. As the ``Almanac of American Politics'' says in its \nprofile of Senator Byrd:\n\n       He may come closer to the kind of Senator the Founding \n     Fathers had in mind than any other.\n\n  For so many years, if anyone on the Senate floor needed to look up \nsomething in the Constitution, we knew where to turn. Senator Byrd \nalways carried a copy in his left breast pocket, directly over his \nheart.\n  It was Senator Byrd's reverence for the Constitution that led to what \nI consider to be arguably his finest hour in the Senate--his outspoken \nopposition to the rush to war in Iraq in 2002\n\n[[Page S5644]]\n\nand his fierce warning to his fellow Senators that we would regret \nsurrendering our power on this war to the President. Senator Byrd's \nspeeches at that time opposing the invasion became a sensation around \nthis country and on the Internet. A white-haired Senator, well into his \neighties, became an icon and a folk hero to young people in \nuniversities all across America. Why? Because when President Bush was \nat the peak of his popularity and power, Senator Byrd dared to say that \nthe emperor--any President--has no clothes when it comes to declaring \nwar. Senator Byrd said the reason given for the invasion--Iraq's \nalleged weapons of mass destruction--was trumped up, and he predicted \nthe war would be a colossal mistake.\n  I remember those impassioned speeches he gave at that time. If only \nwe had taken the advice of the wise Senator from West Virginia, how \nmany young American lives--over 3,000--would not have been lost, \nperhaps 10 times that many injured, carrying the wounds and scars of \nthat war for the remainder of their lives, not to mention the nearly $1 \ntrillion spent out of our Treasury for that war in Iraq.\n  Later, in his outstanding book, ``Losing America''--I recommend this \nbook to every young person. I see our pages sitting here. Pick up that \nbook by Robert C. Byrd. It is called ``Losing America.'' He just wrote \nit about 5 or 6 years ago. It became an instant bestseller. It is a \ngreat book. In that book, ``Losing America,'' Senator Byrd decried the \nSenate's willingness to cave in to the President. He did not care about \nwhether the President was a Democrat or Republican. He said cave in to \nany President--it is readiness, as he put it, ``to salute the \nemperor.'' He referred back to his earlier book he had written on the \nRoman Senate, noting that it was ``the progressive decline of the \nalready supine [Roman] Senate'' that led to the decline of the Roman \nRepublic, and he warned that the same could happen in America.\n  I have always had a special affinity for Senator Byrd because we were \nboth the sons of coal miners, both raised in humble circumstances. I \nwill miss seeing Robert Byrd at his desk or in the well and going up to \nexpress my best wishes and converse with him. He would always grab my \nhand; he would look at me and say: We have coal miners' blood running \nin our veins. We were the only two sons of coal miners to serve in the \nSenate, at least at this time. He always said that to me. I am going to \nmiss that.\n  In reading about the Senator's early years--lifting himself out of \npoverty before running for the West Virginia Legislature in 1946--I was \nreminded of Thomas Edison's remark that ``opportunity is missed by most \npeople because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.'' In his \nearly days, Robert Byrd was dressed in overalls, and he worked. But he \nmade his opportunities. He made his own opportunities with that \nrelentless work, his self-education, and striving always.\n  I will always appreciate the way he tutored me in the ways of the \nSenate when I arrived in this body in 1985. I was assigned to the \nAppropriations Committee, one of the few freshman Senators to ever get \nthat assignment. I will not go into how all that happened, but I can \nremember going to visit Senator Byrd--who then, of course, was the \nranking minority member, when I first came to the Senate, on the \nAppropriations Committee--to ask for his guidance and his willingness \nto work with me and to instruct me on how to be a good member of the \nAppropriations Committee. For the next 25 years, he was either the \nchair of the committee or the ranking member. So I was privileged to \nlearn at the elbow of a master appropriator and legislator.\n  During his more than 58 years in Congress, Senator Byrd witnessed \nastonishing changes, when you think about it. Our population during his \nservice grew by more than 125 million. He served for 25 percent of the \ntime we have been a republic. There has been an explosion of new \ntechnologies. America grew more prosperous, more diverse, more \npowerful. But across those nearly six decades of rapid change, there \nwas one constant: Senator Byrd's tireless service to his country; his \npassion for bringing new opportunities to the people of West Virginia; \nhis dedication to this branch of government, the U.S. Congress, and to \nthis House of Congress, the U.S. Senate.\n  Robert Byrd was a person of many accomplishments with a rich legacy. \nIn my brief time today, I wish to speak of one area of his advocacy \nwhich I have had ample opportunity to observe in my capacity both as \nthe longtime chair or ranking member of the Appropriations subcommittee \nfor education and as a longtime member and now chair of the Committee \non Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  During all these years, Senator Byrd was passionately committed to \nimproving public education in the United States and expanding access to \nhigher education, especially for those of modest means.\n  As we all know, as I said, he was raised in the hardscrabble \ncoalfields of southern West Virginia. His family was poor, but they \nwere rich in faith and values. His adoptive parents nurtured in Robert \nByrd a lifelong passion for education and learning. He was \nvaledictorian of his high school class but too poor, too \nunderprivileged to go to college right away. Again, keep in mind, those \nwere the days before Pell grants and guaranteed loans or even Byrd \nscholarships. He worked as a shipyard welder, later as a butcher in a \ncoal company town. It took him 12 years to save up enough money to \nstart college. As we all know, he was a U.S. Senator when he earned his \nlaw degree. No other Member before or since has ever started and \nfinished law school while a Member of Congress.\n  But degrees do not begin to tell the story of the education of Robert \nC. Byrd. He was the ultimate lifetime learner. As I told him once, it \nwas as though he had been enrolled during the last seven decades in the \nRobert C. Byrd school of continuing education. That always brought a \nsmile on that one. I guarantee no one could ever get a better, more \nthorough education at any one of our universities.\n  Senator Byrd's erudition bore fruit in no less than nine books that \nhe wrote and published over the last two decades. We know he wrote the \nbook on the Senate, a masterful, four-volume history of this \ninstitution that has become a classic. What my colleagues may not know \nis he also authored a highly respected history of the Roman Senate.\n  There are some who joked--and I am sure he would not mind me saying \nthis because we said it to him many times in the past--there are some \nwho think Robert C. Byrd served in the Roman Senate. I can tell you, \nthat part of the Byrd legacy and legend just is not so. We always said \nthat. It always brought a smile, and he always chuckled when we talked \nabout that. He was an expert on the Roman Senate. He knew it, and he \nknew who served in the Roman Senate and how it worked to bring down the \nRoman Empire.\n  I have talked at length about Senator Byrd's education because this \nexplains why he was so passionate about ensuring every American has \naccess to a quality public education, both K-12 and higher education. \nComing from a poor background, Senator Byrd believed that a cardinal \nresponsibility of government is to provide a ladder of opportunity so \nthat everyone, no matter how humble a background, has a shot at the \nAmerican dream. Obviously, the most important rungs on that ladder of \nopportunity involve education, beginning with quality public schools, \nincluding access to college and other forms of higher education.\n  During my quarter century now in this body, no one has fought harder \nfor public education than Senator Robert Byrd. As long-time chairman, \nranking member and, most recently, the senior member of the \nAppropriations Committee, he was the champion of education at every \nturn--fighting to reduce class sizes, improve teacher training, \nbringing new technologies into the classroom, boosting access to higher \neducation.\n\n  In 1985, my first year here in the Senate, he created the only \nnational merit-based college scholarship program funded through the \nU.S. Department of Education. Congress later named it in his honor. The \nRobert C. Byrd Honors Scholars Program is a federally funded, State-\nadministered scholarship program that rewards high school seniors who \nhave exhibited exceptional academic excellence. Currently, there are \nmore than 25,000 Byrd Scholars across the United States eligible for a \n$6,000 grant during 4 years in college.\n\n[[Page S5645]]\n\n  I can remember speaking with him about this and the funding of it, \nand he reminisced more than once with me about how he was valedictorian \nof his class, and that he so wanted to go on to higher education but, \nbecause of his economic circumstances and where he lived, it wasn't \navailable. So he wanted to make sure that young men and women today who \nexhibit that great excellence in academic performance were not denied \nthe opportunity to go to college simply because of the circumstances of \ntheir birth.\n  Senator Byrd has something in common with Winston Churchill. Both \nwere prolific writers, and both were major players in the events they \nchronicled in their writings.\n  Senator Byrd was also a great student of literature, and he loved to \nrecite long poems from memory. I could never understand how he could \nremember all of the poetry he would recite here on the floor, in a \ncommittee meeting, or sometimes in a meeting when a subject would come \nup and he would remember a poem that perfectly fit the temper of what \npeople were talking about.\n  I am sure Senator Byrd knew ``The Canterbury Tales,'' a lot of it \nprobably by heart. In ``The Canterbury Tales,'' describing the Clerk of \nOxford, Chaucer might just as well have been describing Robert C. Byrd. \nChaucer wrote:\n\n       Filled with moral virtue was his speech; And gladly would \n     he learn and gladly teach.\n\n  ``Filled with moral virtue was his speech; And gladly would he learn \nand gladly teach.'' Senator Byrd's speeches were a wonder to behold, \nfull of eloquence and erudition and moral virtue. Senator Byrd never \nstopped learning and he never stopped teaching. Americans for \ngenerations to come will continue to learn from his writings and his \nexample.\n  Senator Robert C. Byrd was a great Senator, a great American, a \nloving and wonderful family man. He has both written our Nation's \nhistory and has left his mark on it. The United States of America has \nlost a patriotic son. We have lost a wonderful friend and a mentor. \nTomorrow, here in the hallowed Chamber of the U.S. Senate, which he so \nloved and served for so many years, Robert C. Byrd will lie in state. \nWe would do well to honor his memory by making a renewed commitment to \nmaking the U.S. Senate work and to work for all of the people of this \ncountry. May he rest in peace with his beloved Erma, and may the Senate \nalways remember and honor his lifetime of service.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that after I \nspeak, Senator Feinstein be permitted to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5645-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5645-S5646]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SCIENCE EDUCATION IN DELAWARE\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I spoke about Senator Byrd yesterday. One \nof the ways you measure anyone is by their friends. The manner in which \nSenator Harkin just spoke about Senator Byrd shows what a great man \nSenator Byrd was, to have a friend as thoughtful and as caring as \nSenator Harkin. They are both a credit to the Senate.\n  As we continue another school year, I wanted to take an opportunity \nto commend the excellent science instruction taking place in my State \nof Delaware. The science educators and leaders in the State have been \nworking for 15 years to create a world-class science program \nencompassing standards and curriculum, professional development, and \nscience material kits. I am honored to say that I believe world class \nis exactly the way to describe the science instruction Delaware \nstudents receive.\n  This is not something that happened overnight. It is a process that \nbegan in 1995, when a statewide survey was sent out to gather data on \nthe status of science teaching and learning in Delaware. The results, \nunfortunately, showed that not much science was taught or being learned \nin Delaware schools. Consequently, several school districts banded \ntogether to form the Delaware Science Coalition. The coalition received \nextraordinary support from the DuPont Company in the form of time, \nmoney, and volunteer services. The group wrote and received a National \nScience Foundation grant, which allowed the districts to have an out-\nof-classroom science specialist provide science professional \ndevelopment for all teachers, assemble science materials, develop \nassessments, and meet as a group. Within 3 years, all school districts \nexcept one had joined the Delaware Science Coalition.\n  Today, the science coalition has come a long way. They have a \nstatewide kindergarten through grade 11 science curriculum in place and \nhave plans for a grade 12 curriculum. They have professional \ndevelopment for all science teachers in grades K through 11. They have \ncost-effective, kit-based science materials. They have assessments that \nare modeled after international science tests. They also have a \nsystematic and comprehensive approach to reform that includes \nleadership from the State, district, and classroom, as well as \ncorporate, community, and university-based partners.\n  Beyond all these coordinated measures, perhaps the most impressive \nexample of how far the coalition has come is seen in the warehouse at \nthe John W. Collette Education Resource Center in Dover. It is truly \nimpressive. To get an idea of what it looks like, you have to think \nabout what it is like to be inside a Home Depot or a Lowes--a warehouse \nwith rows and rows of supplies and forklifts running about. This is \nwhat the science materials center looks like at the Collette Center, \nexcept the industrial shelving and forklifts are transporting boxes \nfilled with science materials to use in classrooms across the State. \nScience curricula and materials kits for grades K through 8 include \nresources developed by the National Science Resource Center, University \nof California-Berkeley, and homegrown and hybrid units developed with \nthe aid of Delaware's very own teachers. These units are coordinated to \nintroduce life, physical, and Earth science concepts each year and \ngradually increase in complexity from one level to the next.\n  All districts share materials, and kits rotate through two or three \nteachers per year. In order to obtain the materials, a teacher must \nattend professional development coordinated by the Collette Center. \nThen the warehouse sends out the kit, teachers and students use it, it \nis picked up weeks later, it is refurbished, and then sent out to \nanother teacher. By sharing materials, costs are kept to an absolute \nminimum.\n  The Collette Center is a remarkable resource for the teachers and \nstudents in Delaware. It is unique in that it is the only science \nprogram in the country that provides a curriculum aligned to standards, \nan intensive professional development effort, and a materials support \nservice for public school districts and charter schools throughout the \nentire State. To create this all-encompassing system, the Science \nCoalition has at times worked closely with the National Science \nResource Center or NSRC. The NSRC is a joint operation of the \nSmithsonian Institution and the National Academies. I think Sally Goetz \nShuler, the executive director of the NSRC, summed up Delaware's \naccomplishments best when she said:\n\n       During the past decade, the NSRC has showcased Delaware as \n     a model to dozens of other U.S. States, countries, and \n     national organizations, including the National Governors \n     Association, the Council of Chief State School Officers, and \n     the James B. Hunt Institute for Educational Leadership and \n     Policy. Hundreds of leaders have visited the John W. \n     Collette Education Resource Center in Dover, as well as \n     many of [Delaware's] classrooms. While small, your State \n     has been and will continue to be instrumental in \n     catalyzing other states and countries to transform their \n     science programs.\n\n  That is from Sally Goetz Shuler, the executive director of the NSRC. \nThat is a powerful statement, and one with which I wholeheartedly \nagree.\n  By the way, my colleague, Senator Carper, who has just come on the \nfloor, has also visited the Collette Resource Center in Dover.\n  Delaware's science program is very impressive and the work is paying \noff for Delaware's students. When the new science standards and \nassessments were first implemented in 2001, only 42 percent of eighth \ngrade students met or exceeded the standards. By 2009, 60 percent of \nthe eighth graders met or exceeded the standards. Similar achievement \ngains have been illustrated at the\n\n[[Page S5646]]\n\nfourth, sixth, and eleventh grades as well. This is an incredible \nachievement and I am confident Delaware's science teachers and leaders \nwill continue to build on this accomplishment.\n  Congratulations to Delaware for continuing to lead the way in science \neducation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from California.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5646-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5646-S5647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING SENATOR ROBERT C. BYRD\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to join my colleagues in \nmourning the loss of one of the Senate's legendary Members--Robert C. \nByrd, the honorable senior Senator from the great State of West \nVirginia.\n  It wasn't too long ago that I looked right over there and I saw a \ndesk draped in black with roses and it was one titan of the Senate--\nSenator Ted Kennedy. Today, I look down here and I see a desk draped in \nblack with white roses and it is a second titan of the Senate.\n  I had the privilege of serving with Senator Byrd on the \nAppropriations Committee for some 16 years. I have had occasion to \nwatch him. He could be very tough, he could be very caring, and he \ncould have that twinkle in his eye. He could depart from the present \ntext into Greek tragedy; into old Roman speaking. He had an incredibly \ncurious mind. I think he is going to be greatly missed from this body.\n  I think of him representing the State of West Virginia for 51 years \nand serving 6 years in the House of Representatives. During all those \n57 years, he served with the kind of devotion and passion that he \nshowed in his last year here in the Senate, when he was very troubled \nby declining health. He has truly left an indelible imprint on the \nState of West Virginia and on this body. No one has ever shown more \ndetermination or greater love for the United States Senate than Robert \nC. Byrd. His tenure has been legendary.\n  He held a number of key leadership positions, including secretary of \nthe Senate Democratic Caucus, Senate majority whip, twice as Senate \nmajority leader, the Senate's minority leader, and three times as \nchairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee.\n  During the period of 1989 to 2010, Senator Byrd was President pro \ntempore of the Senate--the most senior Democrat and third in the line \nof Presidential succession; also as President pro tempore emeritus when \nthe Democrats were in the minority.\n  Senator Byrd cast more rollcall votes than any other Member of this \ninstitution--18,689 in total. That is truly remarkable. Just think \nabout how many of this Nation's laws he helped shape.\n  He was a veritable expert on the inner workings of the Senate. There \nwas no one who was more well versed in this institution's intricate \nrules, protocols, and customs than Robert Byrd. He literally wrote one \nof the most comprehensive books on the Senate. He knew Riddick's \n``Rules of Procedure,'' virtually all 1,600 pages.\n\n  Many of us in the Senate have also spoken of his ardent devotion and \nconsummate knowledge of the Constitution of the United States. His \nwell-worn, treasured copy of this document was kept in his vest pocket, \nand year after year I would see him pull it out. The only thing that \nwould change is that his hand, as the years went on, shook a little bit \nmore. But his devotion to that document did not.\n  He was a staunch defender of the prerogatives of the three equal \nbranches of government, and he was very quick to note that he served \nalongside, not under, 11 Presidents.\n  When he first joined the House of Representatives in 1952, Dwight \nEisenhower was President. His tenure in Congress then followed \nalongside the Presidencies of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, \nRichard M. Nixon, Gerald A. Ford, James Carter, Ronald Reagan, George \nH.W. Bush, William J. Clinton, George W. Bush, and finally Barack \nObama. That is an amazing list of people to have served with.\n  Bob Byrd was not only one of the Senate's famous power brokers, but I \nthink his fondness for classical history, music, and poetry has \nimpacted every one of us. As I said, he frequently interspersed his \nSenate remarks with passages from ancient Roman history, philosophy, \nand often poetic verse. It used to amaze me how, late at night, he \ncould move from his set text and repeat some poem, word for word, verse \nafter verse.\n  The nine decades of Robert Byrd's lifetime witnessed great change \nboth at the personal level and at the national level. He lived to see \nand strongly support the inauguration of our country's first African-\nAmerican President--something I know meant a great deal to him. He was \nnot always on the right side of the civil rights issue at every stage \nof his life, but he became a champion for equality, a lion for \nprogress. His transformation was truly inspirational.\n  Senator Byrd was born into very humble beginnings in 1917. He grew up \nduring the Great Depression. He was the adopted son of a coal mining \nfamily in a small town in southern West Virginia. He was the \nvaledictorian of his high school class but was not able to afford \ncollege at the time. This impoverished childhood might have hindered \nothers, might have stopped a weaker person, but not the indomitable \nRobert Byrd. His inner thirst for knowledge propelled him throughout \nhis epic career. In fact, he managed to find time during his tenure in \nthe Senate to finally fulfill his bachelor's degree from Marshall \nUniversity in 1994, at the tender age of 77. That shows something, I \nthink. He previously received a law degree from American University's \nWashington College of Law in 1963.\n  The loss of his beloved wife Erma Byrd in 2006, I think, was a \ndramatic blow to him. I had occasion to talk with him during that time, \nand there was no question that this was a great love, that it was an \nenduring love, and that it was a lifetime commitment. I discussed with \nhim how he provided, day after day, week after week, and month after \nmonth, the personal care to his wife as she became more infirm and came \ntoward the end of her life. This truly was a major gift of love.\n  One thing I have learned in my lifetime, there are so many people \nwho, in the end-of-life crises, are not able to give with love to their \nspouse. This was a man who could do that. I think that develops his \nimportance as you look at life and people in general.\n  Once again, I offer my sincerest condolences to his two daughters \nMona Faterni and Marjorie Moore, his grandchildren and great-\ngrandchildren, and to the people of West Virginia.\n  This Nation--not only West Virginia, but all of us--owe Senator \nRobert Byrd a great debt of gratitude for his service.\n  I know I will very much miss that indomitable spirit, that insightful \nguidance, and the intense commitment to the Senate.\n  This man will be missed.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I am pleased to follow my colleague, \nSenator Feinstein, in tribute to Robert Byrd, whom I always called \nLeader and who always called me Governor. He was our leader. He was a \nleader for a long time and will always be that in a very real sense to \nmany of us.\n  I was born in Beckley, WV, just about a dozen miles or so from a \ncommunity called Sophia, which is where Robert and Erma Byrd once ran a \nlittle mom-and-pop supermarket back in the late 1930s, early 1940s. I \nthink he was the butcher. He ran that supermarket and later on, I \nthink, in World War II, he was a welder during the war. As we know, in \nthe late 1940s he had the opportunity to run for the West Virginia \nLegislature and ran. He was a great fiddler and went around his \ncommunity, his district, playing the fiddle. He always called himself a \nhillbilly.\n  Ironically, I was down in the central part of our State just about a \nmonth ago and had a chance to attend a picnic for senior citizens, a \ncookout. A lot of people were there. I was sitting at different tables \nand walking around. I was sitting at this one table, and I learned this \nlady sitting to my left was from West Virginia.\n  I said: Where are you from?\n  She said: Sophia.\n  I said: That's right outside of Beckley, where I was born.\n  She said: Yes, I knew Robert and Erma Byrd when they ran that mom-\nand-pop supermarket.\n  I said: You're kidding.\n  She said: No, I did.\n\n[[Page S5647]]\n\n  I asked her to share some thoughts with me about it, and she did.\n  Two weeks later I was back in the Senate and Senator Byrd was coming \nin in a wheelchair. In the last part of his life he lost the ability to \nwalk. He never lost his voice, never lost his mind either. But he came \nin, and I stopped to say hello to him, see how he was doing, and I \nsaid: Leader, I just met a woman over in Delaware the other day who \nknew you from your little supermarket in Sophia, WV.\n  I told him about it, and he smiled. He said: Do you remember her \nname? Do you remember her name?\n  Ironically, I could not remember it. But if I had, he would have. He \nwas amazing.\n  Some people think the reason he got elected to office so many times, \nin the legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives and in the \nSenate, was because he was so good at, frankly, looking out for West \nVirginia economically, making sure they were not left behind. He was \nalso a pretty good politician. He was good at names.\n  I remember once, when we had a funeral for my mom who died about 4 \nyears ago, and we had a celebration of her life just outside of \nBeckley. We had it in the home, a very large home of a family who had \n19 kids. One of them married my cousin, Dan Patton. Some people have a \ndining room; they had like a banquet hall for their meals. We were all \ngathered in this banquet hall, paying tribute to my mom, reflecting on \nher memory, and I was walking around the house afterwards, and I came \nacross a Congressional Record tribute on the wall of this house. It was \na tribute from Robert Byrd honoring this family. I was just blown away. \nI couldn't wait to get back to the Senate the next week and say to \nSenator Byrd: You will never guess whose house I was in.\n  I told him the name of the house, the family, and he said: I remember \nthat guy. He is a barber. They have 19 kids.\n  This guy was just amazing. I used to call him on his birthday. I used \nto call him not just on his birthday but when he and Erma had an \nanniversary. I would call him on Christmas and other special occasions \njust to see how he was doing and let him know I was thinking about him.\n  I think it was his 90th birthday, and I called him and I said: \nLeader, I think it is your birthday today.\n  He said: Yes, it is.\n  I said: How old are you, anyway?\n  I knew.\n  He said: Well, I'm 90.\n  I said: I just hope when I am 90 I can just sit up and take \nnourishment.\n  Mr. President, he said: I hope you can, too.\n  He was amazing.\n  He and Joe Biden share the same birthday. Sometimes I would call \nSenator Byrd on his birthday and say: Leader? He said: Governor, is \nthat you?\n  I said: That's me. I always get this confused, who is older, you or \nBiden?\n  He said: I still got him by a couple of years, but he is catching up \non me.\n  I guess now he will really have a chance to catch up.\n  I came here as a freshman Senator. I had been in the House, and a \nGovernor before. I came in as a freshman in 2001. I was about the age \nof the pages down here. I remember Senator Byrd really took a bunch of \nus under his wing. He became sort of my mentor. I think the fact we had \nthis West Virginia connection made it even more special for me, and I \nthink maybe for him.\n\n  He taught us how to preside. He explained to us the rules of the \nSenate. He knew the rules better than anybody else and he was able to \nwork the rules, use the rules to get things done--or not, to keep \nthings from getting done. Boy, he was good. He taught us how to behave \nin the Senate, and he did that--not just for us but for people who had \nbeen here for 20, 30, 40 years. If they were acting up, making too much \nnoise on the Senate floor, he would stop them dead in their tracks.\n  He once said to me the most important role for the Presiding Officer, \nMr. President--he said the most important role of the Presiding Officer \nis to keep order. That is what he said. He said: If you can keep order, \nthe rest is pretty easy. I always remembered that.\n  He presented to me my Golden Gavel. The Presiding Officer has a \nGolden Gavel. You get it after presiding so many hours in the Senate. \nBut I was very honored to receive mine from Senator Byrd.\n  When I got here in 2001 I think he was 83, an age when most people \nare ready to sit back and take it easy. He was just picking up speed. \nAs Senator Feinstein said, he could take to the Senate floor without a \nnote, give a speech on just about any subject, throw in all kinds of \nanecdotes with respect to ancient Rome and Greek mythology, recite \npoems and stuff.\n  I once said to him: How do you remember all those poems?\n  He would say: I just make them up.\n  He was just kidding. He actually was able to remember them. I \nsometimes have a hard time remembering where I am supposed be for my \nnext meeting.\n  He was from West Virginia, the southern part of West Virginia. As \nothers have said, his views on race as a younger man and as a new \nperson in the Senate were not the same views that he left with. He \nmatured, grew up.\n  He once said to me: The worst vote I ever cast, I actually voted \nagainst and spoke against the Civil Rights Act of 1964.\n  I think he sort of went to his grave regretting that. But I think he \nwent to his grave having atoned, if you will, for that sin. He changed \nhis views with respect to race. In part it was a matter of conscience--\nhe was a person of deep faith--but I think also probably he changed, in \npart, because of the prodding and cajoling of, among others, one of his \nbest friends, Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  As I said earlier, I loved to call him on special days. I would \nalmost always call him when I was back in West Virginia, call him on my \ncell phone, call him at his home in McLean. It wasn't his birthday or \nanything and I would call him.\n  I would say: Leader?\n  He would say: Is that you, Governor?\n  I would say: Yes, I am driving down to West Virginia on the Virginia \nTurnpike heading toward Beckley.\n  He would say: No kidding.\n  I said: I am trying to remember which exit to get off of. The first \none is Harper Road, then there is another one. The third one, I can't \nremember that. What is that?\n  He would say: That's my road, the Robert C. Byrd Drive exit.\n  I would always have a good time with him for that. Others have spoken \nabout all the leadership roles he played here, all the votes he cast, \nall that he did. He did so much for West Virginia. I love to go back to \nWest Virginia. I think the friendliest people I have ever met in my \nlife are from West Virginia. It is kind of a hardscrabble place. They \nhave come a long ways, in no small part because of his enormous help. \nHe has been accused of trying to hijack Washington and move it to West \nVirginia and bring in all kinds of Federal agencies and jobs.\n  He was really trying to make sure West Virginia did not get left out, \nand I think thanks to his intervention, they did not.\n  He made life a lot better for the folks who live in West Virginia \ntoday, and who lived there for the last 58 years. He also made life \nbetter for a generation of Americans, maybe a couple of generations of \nAmericans, in looking back, and maybe even looking forward as well. He \nis going to make their life better, looking forward, for the people in \nthis country who need health care, the people in this country who need \na decent place to live, a chance to buy a home, a chance to get an \neducation, the opportunity to improve their station in life.\n  More than anybody I know, for a guy who was born, orphaned in North \nCarolina as an infant, who was traded off by his mom in her last will \nand testament--she wanted him to be raised by her sister who lived in \nWest Virginia, and her sister took this young man in. His name was not \nRobert Byrd. But she took in her nephew. She and her husband raised \nRobert Byrd in tough situations, hardscrabble situations, and he sort \nof raised himself by the bootstraps and worked hard all of his life to \nmake something of his life and to serve as a model for us in the end, \nand a model for our country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to voice my strong \nsupport\n\n[[Page S5648]]\n\nfor GEN David Petraeus to be confirmed as our Nation's top military \ncommander in Afghanistan. I want to say I have had a great experience \nwith General Petraeus and also watching him from afar. When he \nintroduced the concept of the counterinsurgency in Iraq, and embedding \nour troops with Iraqi troops to try to train the Iraqi troops to do the \nsecurity for Iraq as we were leaving, I had grave concerns about \nembedding our troops and the counterinsurgency, because I feared for \nthe safety of our troops and troop protection. I did not want to \npublicly ask questions of his judgment or disagree with him, but I did \nask him to come see me and explain this to me so I would feel more \ncomfortable, which he did. He came to my office. He walked me through \nit. He gave me confidence that it could work.\n  Then later, when he was in Iraq, and I was taking one of the trips I \nhave made to Iraq, the first place that General Petraeus sent me to see \nwas the Iraqi police station with our embedded troops. He never said a \nword to me about my questioning of how it would work, but he sent me \nin.\n  Later that night I was able to have dinner with him and Ambassador \nCrocker. I said: I know why you sent me to the police station, because \nI had questioned how you were going to protect our troops. I became a \ncomplete believer in General Petraeus and certainly how they do protect \nour troops as we are also teaching the foreign forces to take on their \nown security.\n  So I do have complete confidence in this man. What I do not have \nconfidence in is the mission he is being given, because I sense a mixed \nmessage. I sense a mixed message from the President, and a division in \nwhat our Members of the Senate are saying, even as they questioned \nGeneral Petraeus yesterday.\n  Here is my concern. We know you cannot set a hard and fast deadline \nand say, our troops are leaving no matter what the conditions are, and \ngain the confidence of the people on the ground that you are going to \nsee the mission through.\n  It seems our mission should be clear, that we are going to prepare \nthe Afghans for the security of their country, and also assure that the \nTaliban and al-Qaida cannot get a stronghold that would allow the \nexport of terrorism to America and other freedom-loving countries in \nthe world. That should be the clear mission.\n  I believe that is the mission General Petraeus understands, and I \nthink that is what President Obama is saying. But my concern is this \nquestioning of General Petraeus by members of the Armed Services \nCommittee about the withdrawal date.\n  The President has said firmly the withdrawal is going to be July of \nnext year. General Petraeus is very careful in every answer that he \nmakes to say, conditions on the ground will dictate when we withdraw. \nJuly is the date. We acknowledge that, he says. But it will also depend \non conditions on the ground.\n  I hope we will have a united view in the Senate, a united view in the \nHouse of Representatives, and the President acknowledging that we must \nhave the confidence of the people on the ground in Afghanistan and also \nthe confidence of the enemy, the Taliban, and al-Qaida, that we are not \ngoing to leave in July if there are not conditions on the ground for \nthe Afghans to repel the evil forces of the Taliban and al-Qaida.\n  As we vote today on the confirmation of General Petraeus, I am voting \nfor this general because I believe in him. I believe in his creativity. \nI believe in his judgment. I want to make sure he has everything he \nneeds to do the job we are asking him to do. He has proven he can do \nthe tough jobs.\n  He changed the atmosphere in Iraq and he did it the right way. He \nprotected our forces as he was doing it. So we must assure that we give \nhim the same level of confidence and support in Afghanistan to do the \njob there, because it is clear that the place where al-Qaida and the \nTaliban are operating from is that area of Pakistan and Afghanistan, \nand we cannot allow them to strengthen their efforts to be able to \nexport terrorism to our country again.\n  At the same time, we have got to make sure there is not a bull's-eye \non the back of our troops in Afghanistan because the enemy thinks we \nare leaving no matter what. Conditions on the ground are the \nprerequisite. I hope the President has given General Petraeus the level \nof confidence that I feel in him, and that I think our Senate will show \nto him today to do the job as he sees fit, because he is going to have \nthe boots on the ground in Afghanistan.\n  I have been to Afghanistan, as have most of my colleagues. I know how \ntough it is, the terrain, the type of government they have had \nthroughout their centuries, and it is not adaptable easily to our \nconcept of governance. So we have to work within a framework that is \nvery difficult both geographically as well as in the governance \nstructure.\n  I am voting for General Petraeus today because I know this man can do \nthe job. I hope the President will give him the free rein to do the job \nwe are asking him to do, and, in the process, protect our troops and \nprotect him as they are doing this very tough job with everything he \nasks us to provide to him to finish this job and make the Afghan people \nsay--give them the ability to create their governance in a way that \nworks for them and to protect the people of the United States from any \nfurther terrorist attack.\n  That is when we will be able to say ``mission accomplished.'' And \nGeneral Petraeus can do this job. We must give him the backup so he can \nbe successful.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

PETRAEUS TO BE GENERAL\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of David H. \nPetraeus, Department of the Army, to be General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 20 \nminutes for debate with respect to the nomination, with the time \nequally divided and controlled between the Senator from Michigan, Mr. \nLevin, and the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, or their designees.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I yield myself 8 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Senate will soon vote on the nomination of GEN David \nPetraeus, who is once again stepping forward to render invaluable \nservice to our Nation, as he has so often in the past. Certainly the \nevents that bring General Petraeus to this moment were unforeseen. But \nwe can be certain that when confirmed, he will bring highly experienced \nleadership and a profound understanding of the President's strategy in \nAfghanistan which he helped shape as Commander of the U.S. Central \nCommand.\n  General Petraeus confirmed yesterday before the Armed Services \nCommittee that he fully supports the President's strategy. That \nstrategy includes a surge of U.S. combat troops who will be in place \nlater this year.\n  That strategy includes a counterinsurgency campaign focused on \nsecuring the safety of Afghanistan's population and pursuing the \ninsurgents who threaten that safety. The President's strategy, which \nGeneral Petraeus supports, includes the setting of a July 2011 date to \nbegin reductions of U.S. combat troops as a way of focusing the \nattention of the Afghan Government and military on preparing Afghan \nforces to take greater responsibility for the security of their own \npeople. I have long believed that focusing on building the capacity of \nthe Afghan security forces to secure their nation's future is\n\n[[Page S5649]]\n\ncritical to the success of our mission in Afghanistan. General Petraeus \nagrees. He told our committee yesterday:\n\n       We want Afghan ownership of Afghan problems, whether it's \n     security problems, political problems, economic problems, you \n     name it.\n\n  That is what the Afghans want as well. That is what we were told. A \nnumber of us were there a year ago in Afghanistan when 100 or so elders \ngathered at a shura in southern Afghanistan. When we asked them what \nthey wanted the United States to do, they told us we should train and \nequip the Afghan Army to provide for their country's security and then \ndepart. And the 1,600 delegates to Afghanistan's Consultative Peace \nJirga, which occurred at the beginning of June, adopted a resolution \ncalling on the international community to ``expedite'' the training and \nequipping of the Afghan security forces so they can gain the capacity \n``to provide security for their own country and people.''\n  The Afghan Army fields about 120,000 troops, including 70,000 combat \ntroops. They should, wherever possible, be leading the fight against \nthe insurgents. The Afghan Army enjoys the support of the Afghan \npeople. That means that Afghan troops leading the fight would be the \nTaliban's worst nightmare. It would demonstrate that insurgent \npropaganda, which portrays us as out for domination and for our own \nends, is a lie. If the Afghan people are to see this as their fight, it \nshould be a fight led by their own soldiers with our support and not \nthe other way around.\n  I wish to read an exchange from yesterday's hearing on this issue. I \nasked General Petraeus the following question:\n\n       The urgent increase in the size and capability of the \n     Afghan army and having Afghan forces leading operations more \n     and more is bad news for the Taliban. Now, I've described \n     that as the Taliban's worst nightmare, because their \n     propaganda that they are fighting against foreign forces who \n     want to control Afghanistan will ring more and more hollow \n     with the Afghan population [if] the Afghan army, which has \n     the support of the Afghan people, [is] leading the effort to \n     defeat the insurgents.\n\n  Then I asked General Petraeus: Is that something you would generally \nagree with? His answer was that he agreed with that statement.\n  I am also encouraged that General Petraeus committed at our hearing \nto a review of deployments by the Afghan Army to see how more Afghan \ntroops might be deployed to the south where operations are the most \nintense and to ensure that Afghan leaders are leading operations in the \nsouth wherever possible.\n  General Petraeus also reiterated to the committee his support for the \nJuly 2011 date to begin reductions of U.S. combat troops. As he put it:\n\n       I saw [setting that date] most importantly as the message \n     of urgency to complement the message of enormous additional \n     commitment.\n\n  As the Presiding Officer well knows because he is an esteemed member \nof our committee, General Petraeus literally wrote the book on \ncounterinsurgency. He led the effort to write our military's manual on \ncounterinsurgency. As commander of U.S. forces in Iraq and the U.S. \nCentral Command, he has served his country with great distinction at a \ntime of great need. We are fortunate that once again he has answered \nhis Nation's call, and we are grateful for the sacrifices he, his wife \nHolly, and his family are willing to once again accept.\n  I strongly support his nomination. His nomination was unanimously \nsupported by the Armed Services Committee yesterday. I hope our \ncolleagues will give General Petraeus an overwhelming vote of support.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 10 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of the nomination of GEN \nDavid Petraeus to be Commander of the International Security Assistance \nForce in Afghanistan, and Commander of U.S. Forces-Afghanistan. General \nPetraeus is quite simply one of the finest military leaders our country \nhas ever produced. And we are all grateful for his willingness to \nanswer the call of service in yet another critical mission--a mission \nthat will once again take him far away from his family, especially his \nbeloved wife Holly, whose support and sacrifice over many decades, both \nfor General Petraeus and for our men and women in uniform, can never be \noverstated. General Petraeus is an American hero, and I urge my \ncolleagues to confirm his nomination.\n  Before I go further, let me say a word of praise for another American \nhero: GEN Stanley McChrystal. He is a man of unrivaled integrity, and \nwhat is most impressive about his long record of military excellence is \nhow much of it remains cloaked in silence. Few understand fully how \nGeneral McChrystal systematically dismantled al-Qaida in Iraq, or how \nhe began to turn around our failing war in Afghanistan. These \nachievements, and others like them, are the true measure of Stanley \nMcChrystal, and they will earn him an honored place in our history.\n  We are calling on General Petraeus at a critical moment for the war \nin Afghanistan. I agree with the President that success in Afghanistan \nis ``a vital national interest,'' and I support his decision to adopt a \ncounterinsurgency strategy, backed by more troops and civilian \nresources. This is the only viable path to true success--which I would \ndefine as an Afghanistan that is increasingly capable of governing \nitself, securing its people, sustaining its own development, and never \nagain serving as a base for attacks against America and our allies. In \nshort, the same results we are slowly seeing emerge today in Iraq, \nthanks in large part to the work of General Petraeus and the forces he \ncommanded.\n  Before heading out to Iraq 3 years ago, General Petraeus told the \nArmed Services Committee that the mission was ``hard but not \nhopeless.'' I would characterize our mission in Afghanistan the same \nway. Afghanistan is not a lost cause. Afghans do not want the Taliban \nback. They are good fighters, and they want a government that works for \nthem, and works well. And for those who think the Karzai government is \nnot an adequate partner, I would remind them that, in 2007, the Maliki \ngovernment in Iraq was not only corrupt; it was collapsed and complicit \nin sectarian violence. A weak and compromised local partner is to be \nexpected in counterinsurgency. That is why there is an insurgency. The \nchallenge is to support and push our partners to perform better. That \nis what we are doing in Iraq, and that is what we can do in \nAfghanistan. But we need to make it clear that, as long as success in \nAfghanistan is possible, we will stay there to achieve it.\n  I appreciate the President's statement last week that July 2011 is \nsimply a date to ``begin a transition phase'' to greater Afghan \nresponsibility. And for those who doubt the President's desire and \ncommitment to succeed in Afghanistan, his nomination of General \nPetraeus to run this war should cause them to think twice. I know that \nGeneral Petraeus will do everything in his power to help us succeed in \nAfghanistan. I know that if he believes he needs something he does not \nhave, or if he thinks that changes should be made to our war effort, he \nwill not hesitate to offer his best professional military advice to the \nPresident and to Congress. I am encouraged that this is the man the \nPresident has given his confidence. And I believe this should be an \nopportunity for the Senate to join together, on a broad bipartisan \nbasis, not just to support the nomination of General Petraeus, but to \ndemonstrate to the Americans we represent, as well as to our friends \nand allies abroad, that we are fully committed to the success of our \nmission in Afghanistan.\n  We must give General Petraeus every opportunity to succeed in his new \ncommand. And I believe that means stating clearly that the withdrawal \nof U.S. forces from Afghanistan must be determined solely by conditions \non the ground. What we are trying to do in Afghanistan, as in any \ncounterinsurgency, is win the loyalty of the population--to convince \npeople who may dislike the insurgency, but who may also distrust their \ngovernment, that they should line up with us against the Taliban and \nal-Qaida. We are asking them to take a huge risk, and they will be far \nless willing to take that risk if they think we will begin leaving in a \nyear. In a news report yesterday, one U.S. marine described the effect \nof the\n\n[[Page S5650]]\n\nJuly 2011 date on the Afghans she encounters: ``That's why they won't \nwork with us,'' she said. ``They say you'll leave in 2011, and the \nTaliban will chop their heads off.''\n  In addition to being harmful, the July 2011 withdrawal date \nincreasingly looks unrealistic. That date was based on assumptions made \nback in December about how much progress we could achieve in \nAfghanistan, and how quickly we could achieve it. But war never works \nout the way we assume. Secretary Gates said last week, ``I believe we \nare making some progress. [But] it is slower and harder than we \nanticipated.'' I agree. Marjah is largely cleared of the Taliban, but \nthe holding and building is not going as well as planned. Our operation \nin Kandahar is getting off to a slower and more difficult start than \nexpected. The performance of the Afghan government over the past 7 \nmonths is not as even or as rapid as we had hoped. Some of our key \nallies plan to withdraw their forces soon, and it looks increasingly \nunlikely that NATO will meet its pledge of 10,000 troops.\n  None of this is to say that we are failing, or that we will fail, in \nAfghanistan. It just means that we need to give our strategy the \nnecessary time to succeed. This is all the more essential now with \nGeneral Petraeus assuming command, pending his confirmation. He has \nproved that he can lead our forces to success. He has proved that he \ncan work effectively with local partners in counterinsurgency. He has \nproved that he is an ideal partner for our many allies and friends, who \nare so critical to success in Afghanistan. In short, David Petraeus has \nproved that he is a winner, and we need to give him every opportunity \nand remove every obstacle so that he can help the United States and our \nallies to win in Afghanistan.\n  General Petraeus has my full support, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote to confirm his nomination so he can take up his new mission as \nsoon as possible.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD Mr. President, it is my general policy to defer to \nPresidents on executive branch nominations. General Petraeus is clearly \nqualified for this position and, accordingly, I will vote in favor of \nhis confirmation. But regardless of who is in command, the President's \ncurrent strategy in Afghanistan is counterproductive. We should set a \nflexible timetable for responsibly drawing down U.S. troops, not just a \nstart date, so that we can pursue a sustainable, global campaign \nagainst al-Qaida and its affiliates.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, with 100,000 troops fighting on the front \nlines of our battle against terrorists in Afghanistan, the stakes could \nnot be higher. That's why I was pleased that President Obama chose a \nproven leader for our forces in Afghanistan in GEN David Petraeus.\n  General Petraeus is the right choice to lead this mission in \nAfghanistan. He has demonstrated that he can effectively carry out a \ncounterinsurgency strategy and prepare local forces to take over the \nU.S. combat mission.\n  The resounding bipartisan support that General Petraeus received in \nthe Armed Services Committee and on the Senate floor sends the right \nmessage to our forces on the ground in Afghanistan, our allies who \nshare our mission of defeating terrorism and the enemies who seek to \nharm us.\n  It says that we are committed to success in Afghanistan and we will \ncontinue to take the fight to the Taliban. And it also says that we \nwill continue to work to transfer responsibility to Afghan forces--with \nthe recognition that our commitment in Afghanistan is not open-ended.\n  As our Commander in Chief, President Obama must have a military and \ncivilian team that has his full confidence, and with General Petraeus' \nconfirmation, he now has that team in place.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, is there any time remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 3 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, first of all, let me say I very much join \nSenator McCain's comment about General McChrystal. I spoke about his \nheroics yesterday, his integrity yesterday at the Armed Services \nCommittee in my statement, and I reiterate them today. General \nMcChrystal is someone who has the deep respect of all who know him. And \nwhile fate took a strange bounce in his life, he has the strength and \nintegrity of character that he is going to be able to deal with it very \nwell.\n  We all want success in Afghanistan, and setting a date, as the \nPresident has done and General Petraeus supports, to begin reductions \nof our forces is critical to that success, because it is the Afghans \nwho must succeed, with our support. It is the Afghan Army that must \ngrow and get stronger because it is that way where the people will be \nsupportive of this effort, where they will take the risks if they know \nthe Afghan Army is large. They know already it is on their side. They \nwill take the risks to tell that army where the bad guys are, where the \ninsurgents are, and not be afraid.\n  General Petraeus was asked yesterday whether he backs the President's \napproach with respect to a deadline, and his answer was clear: ``Not \nonly did I say that I supported it, I said that I agree with it.''\n  President Obama has made a decision. General Petraeus is very much a \npart of that decision. He agrees with that decision that we need to \nbegin reductions in July of 2011 of our troops as a way of sending a \npowerful message to the Afghan leadership about their responsibility to \nprovide security for their own country. And when they do take the \nlead--whether it is in operations in Kandahar or elsewhere--that is the \nway the people will rally behind the government, will rally against the \nhated Taliban.\n  The Taliban has no love among the people of Afghanistan. The Afghan \nArmy does, and it is that army which must take the lead for the sake of \nsuccess in Afghanistan. That is what setting this date is all about. \nThat is why General Petraeus supports setting that date, not for \nwithdrawal of all of our troops but for the beginning of reductions of \nour troops, as that powerful signal about what is at stake here and \nwhat the Government of Afghanistan must do to achieve success for them \nand for us.\n  A few final words about the July 2011 date set by the President for \nthe beginning of reductions in our combat presence in Afghanistan. That \ndecision also made clear that the pace of those reductions would be \ndependent on circumstances at the time, and that the United States \nwould continue a strong strategic commitment to Afghanistan.\n  That July 2011 date imparts a necessary sense of urgency to Afghan \nleaders about the need to take on principal responsibility for their \ncountry's security. We saw in Iraq the importance of setting dates as a \nway of spurring action. President Bush in November 2008 decided to move \nall U.S. forces out of Iraqi cities and towns by June 2009 and to \nwithdraw all U.S. forces from Iraq by the end of December 2011. That \ndecision helped focus the Iraqi Government and military on the need to \ntake principal responsibility for the security of their country. The \nAfghans' success, and ours, depends on that happening in Afghanistan as \nwell.\n  We have already seen a positive effect of setting the July 2011 date \nto begin reductions of our troops. Lieutenant General Caldwell, who \ncommands our training efforts in Afghanistan, told us that when \nPresident Obama announced the date, the Afghan leadership made a \ngreater effort to reach out to the local leaders and elders, resulting \nin a surge in recruits for the Afghan army.\n  General Petraeus has said he agrees with the President's policy \nsetting that July 2011 date, and told me that if he ceases to agree he \nwill so advise his Commander in Chief, which he, of course, has a \nresponsibility to do as a military commander.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, this is not the time for debate over \nstrategy. I would point out that no one follows an uncertain trumpet, \nand for us to assume the Afghan people will now rally to the side of \ndemocracy and freedom, when they think we are leaving and unable to \nsustain a counterinsurgency on their own, is the same kind of thinking \nthat opposed the surge in Iraq, the\n\n[[Page S5651]]\n\nsame kind of thinking that would have doomed us to failure, the same \nkind of rhetoric that was voiced during our debate on Iraq 3 years ago. \nThey were wrong then; they are wrong now.\n  I would hope they would have learned the lesson of our success in \nIraq: that we must show our friends and allies alike that we will be \nthere to complete the mission; not as a young soldier said the other \nday: that they fear the Americans are leaving and the Taliban will cut \ntheir heads off.\n  It is a fundamental of warfare that you have to see the mission \nthrough to completion or failure. To announce a date of withdrawal is \nto announce a date for defeat.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would also now reclaim the remainder of \nmy time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 30 seconds to \nrespond.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof GEN David H. Petraeus to be General?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n\n            Congratulating the University of South Carolina\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate the \nUniversity of South Carolina men's baseball team for making history by \nwinning the NCAA College World Series last night.\n  Whit Merrifield's clutch hit in the 11th inning brought home the \nwinning run and gave USC its first ever national championship for any \nmen's team at the university.\n  In spite of losing their first game in Omaha, the team persevered \nthrough multiple elimination games. They were motivated by the \ncourageous spirit of one young fan, Bayler Teal, who at age 7 may have \nbeen the biggest Gamecock fan in America. He suffered from a rare form \nof cancer and died last Thursday during the Gamecock's come-from-behind \nvictory over Oklahoma. He wore his Gamecock ball cap the day he died.\n  Fortunately, Bayler's parents and 5-year-old brother were able to be \nin Omaha last night to see the Gamecocks win the final game of the \nCollege World Series.\n  So today I join all South Carolinians and Gamcocks fans everywhere to \ncongratulate the players, Coach Ray Tanner, and his staff for an \noutstanding victory.\n  Now all America knows that USC means the University of South \nCarolina. Go Gamecocks.\n\n\n                    First-time Home Buyer Tax Credit\n\n  Mr. President, I want to speak in objection to the majority's latest \nattempt to secretly push through another extension of the first-time \nhome buyer tax credit--the third time the Senate has modified or \nextended this credit since July of 2008, when it was originally \nincluded in the majority's Housing and Economic Recovery Act.\n  Home buyer tax credits have several flaws, and I opposed them in the \npast because I believe they are a temporary infusion of capital into \nthe marketplace and simply increase the government's grip on our \nNation's economic growth.\n  As often happens when the government becomes involved in attempting \nto grow a portion of the Nation's economy, we only create a bubble that \nwill eventually burst. As the National Association of Realtors said in \nlate April, shortly before the expiring of the tax credit on April 30:\n\n       It is time for the housing market to stand on its own feet.\n\n  It is time for the government to stop picking winners and losers in \nthe housing market based on arbitrary dates and arbitrary \nqualifications. For the people who haven't closed on their homes by \ntoday, it is not that they won't get their house; it is only that they \nwon't get a taxpayer subsidy for having bought a house now rather than \nlater. This taxpayer subsidy has been funded by their neighbor, who may \nnot have had the opportunity to buy on the government time line.\n  We have watched this majority push through big spending bills and \ntargeted government credits. What we have learned is that government \nspending does not grow economic prosperity; rather, government spending \ngrows deficits. It creates economic bubbles. Without a doubt, it \nincreases taxes.\n  For 18 months, this majority has created a false sense of hope for \nconsumers and markets while increasing taxes on small businesses and \nthe most productive and hard-working Americans. Rather than creating \ntax equality and predictability for all Americans, this Congress has \ntried to force taxpayers to subsidize the purchasing of cars, homes, \nand even appliances.\n  We know what works. When American businesses have the predictability \nof low tax rates, they in turn invest in job creation and create real \neconomic growth.\n  The enormous amount of spending this Congress has taken on is \nunsustainable and will eventually lead to the highest tax increases in \nour Nation's history.\n  This bill is no different. I ask my colleagues, how many times do we \nneed to extend this home buyer tax credit? What do we tell the people \nwho bought their homes just before it started, and the ones who bought \ntheir homes right after it expired? Do we say their mortgage rates will \nbe higher for the whole time they own their home, and their\n\n[[Page S5652]]\n\ntaxes will be paying for their neighbor's home, who happened to buy in \nthe government's window of opportunity?\n  The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has called the home buyer credit \n``Washington's worst tax policy idea.'' They have estimated that the \n$12.6 billion already spent on this program through February created \n``close to zero'' jobs and that at least 85 percent of these buyers \nwould have likely purchased a home anyway.\n  Also, the Treasury Department's inspector general found the home \nbuyer credit has been riddled with fraud and chronicled over 14,000 \ninstances of false claims. This is typical of government programs. The \nreport ``found as many as 67 taxpayers using the same home to claim the \ncredit''--the same home. It also found that over 1,000 prisoners \nreceived credit for homes they claimed to buy while in jail.\n  How is it fair to subsidize Americans who purchased their first home \nonly because they purchased it on the government's timetable?\n  With this latest extension of the credit, the majority is not only \ncutting defense spending to fund the credits, but now it is admitting \nthat taxing Americans at the highest rates in history isn't enough. Now \nthey are going to tax foreign visitors to pay for buying our homes in \nAmerica.\n  My hope is that my colleagues will use the recess next week to \nfinally listen to the millions of Americans who are tired of this \nCongress choosing winners and losers. They are tired of the excessive \nspending, and they are fearful of tax increases yet to come. They are \ntelling us very clearly: Stop spending, stop borrowing, stop adding to \nthe debt, and stop the government takeovers.\n  Most of all, they agree on one thing: This Congress needs to get out \nof the way and let America get back to work.\n\n\n                  Unanimous-Consent Request--H.R. 3371\n\n  Mr. President, I will now speak on the status of the Federal Aviation \nAdministration legislation and, hopefully, move the process along a \ngreat deal. At the end of this, I will offer a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  As many Senators will remember, early last year a small commuter \nplane crashed just outside Buffalo, NY. The accident killed all 49 \npeople onboard and one person on the ground.\n  In the months following the crash, the Senate Commerce Committee and \nits aviation subcommittee held a number of hearings to get a better \nunderstanding of what exactly went wrong during Flight 3407 and what \nCongress could do to help fix it.\n  I thank Senator Dorgan in particular for his leadership on this \nissue. From those lessons we have learned and during the drafting of \nthe FAA reauthorization, our colleagues in the House worked with us, \nand we were able to craft a number of important reforms that formed the \nsafety section of both the House and the Senate reauthorization bills.\n  Let me take a moment to outline some of them: an FAA pilots records \ndatabase. Had we had a database like the one we have in this bill, it \nwould be very likely that the pilot of Flight 3407 would not have been \nallowed to fly that day.\n  Increased hourly requirements for copilots: If we had these \nrequirements, the copilot on Flight 3407 would have had more \nexperience, and we may have averted a disaster.\n  There are a number of improvements in the House bill, including \nenhanced mentoring for pilots, increased utilization of safety \nmanagement programs, better crew management initiatives, as well as \nclearer responses to NTSB safety recommendations. All of these reforms \nwill go a long way to improving aviation safety.\n\n  Sadly, we have yet to get this legislation across the finish line \nthat would implement these reforms. Parochial politics, political \npayoffs, and backroom deals are keeping these important safety measures \nfrom passing.\n  Some Members are trying to cut special deals for special flights to \ntheir States. Numerous Members are looking to impose new taxes on \ntravelers already burdened by too much taxation. Some Congressmen are \ntrying to cut a special deal for their buddies in the labor unions. All \nof these things are beside the point and are exactly what aviation \npolicy should not be about.\n  Since last October, the Senate has had a bill sitting before us that \nwill immediately implement the reforms that the families of Flight 3407 \nhave been calling for. They have waited too long. The fights over \nFedEx, taxes, and special flights aren't going to go away anytime soon. \nIf we let them, these controversial issues will continue to hold up the \nsafety provisions on which we all agree.\n  Let's say that enough is enough; it is time to pass the safety \nimprovements and let the rest of the FAA stand on its own.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on \nCommerce be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3371 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be read \nthe third time and passed and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The Senator from North \nDakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, might I inquire of the Senator, we have \nbeen trying to move a 30-day extension of existing authorities for the \nFAA, which is essential and very necessary. Is the Senator holding that \nup? We have had objection from his side, and my information is that the \nobjection was the Senator's. Is that accurate?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I very much support the extension, but I \nhave asked that this safety provision be moved along with it so that we \ncan get this done instead of continuing to allow it to be held hostage \nto political interests on the bill.\n  I would be supportive of a unanimous consent request that would \nextend the FAA authorization 30 days if it included my request for the \nsafety provisions of the bill.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I think this will be extended 30 days. \nFailure to extend the current authority for the FAA for the next 30 \ndays while we finish the conference report will mean that 4,000 people \nat FAA will be furloughed, laid off. Don't tell me that promotes \naviation safety. That is the worst possible thing we can do--to decide \nthat we are not going to extend current authorities, and after July 4, \n4,000 people will be furloughed at FAA.\n  With respect to what my colleague has just done, without consultation \nwith anybody else, he decided to come to the floor of the Senate and \ntalk about ``special deals'' and ``new taxes'' and so on.\n  Let me describe where we are. We have tried to keep the Senator's \nstaff and him involved so that he understands where we are. In the \nevent there is missing information, let me explain where we are.\n  No. 1, we passed an FAA reauthorization bill that includes \nmodernization of the air traffic control system, very substantial \nsafety provisions, far more than what the Senator suggests we adopt \ntoday.\n  As the Senator knows because he is ranking member on the \nsubcommittee, we held a good number of hearings on the subject of the \nColgan crash and the safety provisions that need to be done as a result \nof it. The things the Senator raises on the floor today include most of \nwhat I have suggested, among other things. I appreciate the cooperation \nthe Senator offered when he was at the hearings we held on these safety \nissues.\n  But following the passage of this bill by the Commerce Committee, we \nhave not been able to appoint conferees in this Chamber. That is \nsymbolic of how dysfunctional the Chamber is these days because we have \nobjections even to appointing conferees. Notwithstanding the \nobjections, Senator Rockefeller and I have been working with the House, \nand we have kept the Senator involved, trying to narrow down most of \nthe provisions that differ between the House and Senate. There are 6 or \n8 or perhaps 10 significant differences we are working on now, and the \nSenator mentioned a couple: the issue of the perimeter rule, slots at \nWashington National Airport, a FedEx issue, passenger facilities \ncharge, and other issues.\n  I believe there is almost no dispute at all about the majority of the \nsafety provisions that both the House and the Senate will include in \nthe bill when it is complete. We had hoped it would be complete this \nweek. That is not going to be the case.\n\n[[Page S5653]]\n\n  Shortly after we return, I fully expect to have a conference report \non the floor of the Senate that will include all of these safety \nprovisions and more, I should say--many more--because, as the Senator \nknows, I chaired the hearings that helped develop these very \nprocedures.\n  It would have been nice to have gotten some notice about what the \nSenator chose to do today. I do not think it is appropriate to try to \nleverage an extension for 30 days for the current authorization of FAA, \nwhich, if not extended, will result in 4,000 people being furloughed at \nthe FAA. To try to leverage passing a portion of the FAA \nreauthorization bill that we are now negotiating with the House and we \nare very close to concluding does not make any sense to me.\n  No one cares more about these safety issues than I do. I can speak at \nlength--and perhaps I will--about the Colgan crash. I understand what \nhappened in that cockpit. I read all the transcription. I read all the \ninformation available about it. I sat for hour after hour in hearings. \nWhat happened there is an enormous tragedy. Some of the things that \ncaused it, in my judgment, will be remedied and can be remedied and \nsome of it is already remedied as a result of the action by the new FAA \nAdministrator.\n  I simply want to say to the Senator from South Carolina that I think \nit is very important that we extend for 30 days the current authority \nof the FAA and avoid the furloughs his objections would entail. If \nthere is any way to quickly and immediately and dramatically injure \nsafety in the skies in this country, it would be to decide to have that \nkind of furlough.\n  I did ask unanimous consent for a 30-day extension. I will do so \nagain this afternoon and hope that my colleague will not object to it. \nI have worked with my colleague all along the way on these safety \nissues. I wish perhaps he would have consulted us in terms of coming to \nthe floor today at 12:45 p.m. as a ranking member of a subcommittee and \nsaying: I am going to take this on myself and do this, for whatever \nreasons he described.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DORGAN. I will be happy to yield without losing the floor, if the \nSenator has a question.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, we have been promised for months that \nthis bill, the FAA reauthorization, which the Senator from North Dakota \nand I approve, would go through. The families of flight 3407 have been \nhere constantly. As the Senator knows, one of those families is from my \nhometown. They have waited long enough. There is no reason that we need \nto hold these safety provisions hostage to passing a whole bill that is \nbogged down in political fights.\n  I ask unanimous consent to amend my unanimous consent request to \ninclude the 30-day reauthorization of FAA. There are none of these \nprovisions the Senator objects to. If there are additional safety \nprovisions that can be in the final bill, we can do that. But nothing \nin my request compromises what the Senator from North Dakota wants to \naccomplish. I ask unanimous consent to amend my UC to call up and pass \nH.R. 5611.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Why don't we stop this sort of thing? It is unbelievable \nto me how dysfunctional this place is. I say to my colleague, we have \nworked on this issue for months and months. I wish it had been done in \nJanuary, but it was not. But we are very close to getting this done the \nright way. We have a couple things we have to do together, and I hope \nwe would not be debating this. We need to extend the authorities for \nthe FAA--and do it now--for 30 days. I expect--and the Senator knows me \nbecause I have had conversations with Senator Kyl, the No. 2 person on \nhis side. We all had conversations with the Senator from South Carolina \nand his staff. He knows we have been involved in finalizing at long \nlast just the few remaining issues in order to get a conference report \nto the floor of the Senate.\n  I have talked with and met with the families of the victims on the \nColgan flight many times. I do not know that anybody here has done much \nmore than I have done to reach out to them, to hold hearings, to listen \nto them, to compliment them, to say to them: Because of what you are \ndoing as families of victims, other people are going to have their \nlives saved because of aviation safety. I do not take a backseat to \nanybody in my interest and concern about that and what I have done \nabout that.\n  I have not had the families of the victims come to me to say: Let's \ndecide to object to extending for 30 days the FAA reauthorization or, \nby the way, let's decide to take this legislation apart and pull part \nof it out and leave some of the safety provisions outside the Senator's \namendment.\n  What the Senator is suggesting is that we should pass legislation \nthat came to us from the Senate with an amendment of his that takes a \nportion of the bill out that he decided he wants out.\n  This bill, by the way, passed the Senate 93 to 0. The Senator was not \nthere that day, so he did not vote. But 93 Senators voted, and no \nSenators voted against it. We can get this done, but we are not going \nto get this done by coming to the floor without consulting anybody; \nlet's take a portion of it and add it to a House provision and threaten \nto have the FAA not have their authority extended and they can furlough \n4,000 people in the coming weeks--that is not, in my judgment, a \nthoughtful way to proceed.\n  My hope is that perhaps we, in a rational moment, can just decide: \nLet's do the right thing. We are in conference with the House--not a \nformal conference but a substantial number of meetings have gone on. We \nhave another one at 5 o'clock this afternoon. My hope would be that the \nSenator from South Carolina would agree that there is the right way and \nthe wrong way to do this business. We will get all those safety \nprovisions done and more--much, much more--and we will not leave any \nsafety provisions behind that were in the legislation that passed the \nSenate 93 to 0. It is going to take another week or so beyond July 4, \nand we will have this done.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Committee on \nCommerce be discharged from further consideration of H.R. 3371 and the \nSenate proceed to its immediate consideration; that the bill be read a \nthird time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  Let me say that this is the 30-day extension of the FAA \nreauthorization bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me withdraw that request.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may withdraw his request.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The legislative clerk continued with the call of the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I just told my colleague that the \nunanimous consent request I intend to read is a unanimous consent \nrequest that will extend for 30 days the existing authorities of the \nFAA. The House has passed it, has sent it to us, and is now awaiting \naction by the Senate. I personally do not intend to support amending it \nand sending it back to the House. I believe we ought to do what we \nshould always do; that is, try to make things work, and the way to make \nthings work is to give the FAA the extended authority they need while \nwe finish the negotiations with the House.\n\n[[Page S5654]]\n\n  I indicated that we have a meeting this afternoon. Senator \nRockefeller and I have a meeting with the House counterparts this \nafternoon on these issues. We have had staff working for a long period \nof time. We are down to very narrow, in my judgment, or at least a few \nnarrow differences that I believe we can resolve. It would be a shame, \nin my judgment, if we do not, just as a matter of courtesy, decide, \nyes, this is the right thing to do while we try to negotiate these \nfinal areas in that legislation.\n  This issue of safety, I indicated to my colleague--I guess the \nSenator was absent when the Senate voted on the bill itself. It passed \n93 to 0. The Senator from South Carolina has been at the hearings. My \ncolleagues have been at the hearings I have called on safety. The \ncrafting of the provisions on safety are provisions I largely crafted \nin consultation with my colleague.\n  It seems to me to be Byzantine to be standing here and having my \ncolleague come to the floor offering this without consultation with \nanybody. It does not make sense to do it this way. Let's finish this \nthe way Congress should finish its work: negotiate with the House. We \ncan do that in the next week or two, get a conference report, bring it \nhere, and have a vote on it, and it will include all the safety \nprovisions my colleague wants, which I helped create, and many more. \nThat is the right way to legislate.\n  The wrong way to legislate would be for us to decide we are going to \nthreaten to not extend the reauthorization of the FAA and have about \n4,000 people laid off sometime over the Fourth of July weekend. These \nare people who work at the airports division, engineering facilities, \nand equipment division. It makes no sense to do this.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent--this is H.R. 5611, the FAA \nextension bill for 30 days--I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 5611, which was received \nfrom the House.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Reserving the right to object, Madam President, I assure \nthe Senator I am in complete support not only of the 30-day extension \nbut the bill he and I passed out of the Senate. Believe me, I was here \nfor that and very much support it. If the Senator's colleagues will \naccept it the way we passed it through the Senate, it would be done \ntoday. But because of this holdup, what I consider safety provisions \nbeing held up unnecessarily for political reasons, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, let me make a point very clearly. A \nnumber of the provisions dealing with safety that relate to the Colgan \nair crash are being implemented already by the FAA. Let me make that \npoint, No. 1.\n  No. 2, in order to successfully do what we really need to do to \npromote aviation safety, we need to get the bill passed that promotes \nmodernization of the air traffic control system. That is critically \nimportant. We are losing ground on those issues. We need to be able to \nmove airplanes around this country and the world with GPS capability. \nIt allows them to fly more direct routes, with a much greater margin of \nsafety for passengers. The modernization of the system is critically \nimportant. We worked long and hard on that issue.\n  This comprehensive bill includes air traffic control modernization, \nsafety provisions, and so many other provisions that are important.\n  My colleague, who is the ranking member on the subcommittee that \nhelped produce this bill, knows and I know that we have to have a 30-\nday extension. That has to be done and will be done this week. I cannot \nbelieve my colleague would go home and decide: I don't care who is laid \noff. I will tell my colleagues how to quickly diminish safety in the \nskies, and that is to do that, to behave like that. That is a \nnonstarter, in my judgment.\n  It is also the case that we are not going to have somebody come to \nthe floor without consultation and pull this provision, that provision, \nor the next provision out of the bill and say: By the way, I want \nunanimous consent to get this done. That is not serious legislating. It \njust is not. Everybody knows that.\n  It is time for us to start working together. This place is pretty \ndysfunctional these days. This is exhibit A as to why it is \ndysfunctional. My hope is that in the next couple of days, we can reach \nan understanding to fix some of the issues that affect the Senator.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                   Unanimous-Consent Request--S. 3462\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nJudiciary Committee be discharged from further consideration of S. \n3462, a bill to provide subpoena power to the national commission on \nthe British Petroleum oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico, and that the \nSenate then proceed to its consideration; that the bill be read three \ntimes, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; \nthat any statements relating to the measure be printed in the Record, \nwith no further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, on behalf of other Members of the \nRepublican conference, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                  Unanimous-Consent Request--H.R. 5481\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 442, H.R. \n5481, a bill to give subpoena power to the National Commission on the \nBP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling; that the bill be \nread a third time and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table, with no intervening action or debate.\n  This is legislation that passed the House 420 to 1.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, on behalf of other members of the \nRepublican Conference, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, I think we are witnessing exhibit B to \nSenator Dorgan's exhibit A about what the problems are in this Chamber.\n  I don't understand what is so objectionable. In the House, 169 \nRepublicans voted in favor of giving the Presidential commission \nsubpoena power. They understand how important that is because this \ncommission begins their investigation in the next few weeks. This \nshould not be a partisan issue. I don't understand why my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle are turning this into a partisan issue.\n  I find it unbelievable that after everything the people of the gulf \nregion have endured, and that this entire country has witnessed for \nover 2 months now, that anyone is still standing with the oil company \nthat caused this disaster instead of the victims who are suffering from \nit.\n  We recently learned that while BP was publicly telling us that the \nDeepwater Horizon rig was leaking an estimated 5,000 barrels of oil a \nday, internal BP documents showed, in a worst-case scenario, up to \n100,000 barrels of oil could actually leak into the Gulf of Mexico. \nWhat that says to me is that we need to make sure when we are \ninvestigating this oilspill, whether it be with employees of BP or \nanyone else, that they are being straight with the American people. \nThat is what subpoena power would do. If we want to get to the bottom \nof what happened so we can stop it from happening again, the \nPresidential commission needs the authority to compel people to provide \ndocuments and to testify under oath.\n  The full devastation of this catastrophic spill is far from being \nknown, but surely we know now that it will be one of the worst, if not \nthe worst, economic and environmental disasters in American history. We \nneed to make sure this never happens again. The Presidential commission \nneeds subpoena power to get the job done for the American people. The \nHouse moved quickly to pass this legislation and the Senate should now \npass this important legislation also. I can't understand why anyone is \nobjecting to this.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, I want to rise in support of what my \ndistinguished colleague from New Hampshire is trying to accomplish \nhere,\n\n[[Page S5655]]\n\nwhich is simply to give the oilspill commission the subpoena power it \nneeds to be able to do its job--to bring those individuals before it \nwho might be reticent to come forth.\n  What we have seen here on the floor--and what we have seen in the \nlast few minutes--is a whole process that I hope the American people \nunderstand is a clear contrast between who stands on their side and who \nstands on the side of special interests. How is it possible that \nMembers of this Chamber find it difficult to even proceed, when the \nHouse of Representatives, in a near unanimous vote, could say that the \nsubpoena power is necessary for the commission to be able to get to the \nbottom of what happened? The House voted unanimously, save for one \nvote. Yet we cannot even proceed.\n  This isn't rocket science. It is common sense to most Americans. We \nneed to fully learn the lessons of this disaster with a thorough \ninvestigation, not to protect oil companies from having their \nnegligence exposed. We need to get answers from BP and Transocean and \nHalliburton and everyone else, including the Federal agencies, not to \ngive apologies to them, as I have seen Republicans suggest that we \nshould apologize to BP for making sure the residents of the gulf region \nare held whole. We need to know the truth, and the commission needs \nsubpoena power to get the truth. So who are you protecting? What are we \nhiding here?\n  In addition to holding information and blocking data collection, BP \nhas seemingly misrepresented the magnitude of the spill. We need the \ntruth. Let's go through a little bit of remembering a very short period \nof time how this Congress and the American people were deceived. That \nis why there is a need for subpoena power, to get to the truth and to \nbring people to testify under oath.\n  We were told after the Deepwater Horizon burst into flames and then \nsank onto the ocean floor that there was no spill. Anybody remember \nthat? Can you believe it? The next day, they estimated that an absurdly \nlow flow rate of 1,000 barrels per day was taking place. Then, on May \n20, BP said they were siphoning off 5,000 barrels of oil a day from \nwhat they claimed was a 5,000-barrel-a-day spill--meaning that they \nwere capturing all of it. Can you believe it?\n  Then, video feed released under pressure from Congress on May 21 \nshowed a very different story, with a heavy flow of oil still spilling \nfrom the well. In response, only after that pressure and that video \nfeed could be measured, the company adjusted their siphon estimate down \nfrom 5,000 to 2,200 barrels a day to explain why oil was still flowing. \nWe now know that what the video actually showed was a much heavier flow \nrate. Only recently have experts begun to have access to some of the \ndata they need to make more credible estimates.\n  On June 15, the Federal Government officially estimated that the flow \nmay be as high as 60,000 barrels a day, which means that an estimated 3 \nmillion barrels have been spilled so far. Three million barrels. That \nwould amount to more than 13 Exxon Valdez spills, which took place in \nAlaska.\n  The point of all of this is that we need the truth. That is what \nSenator Shaheen is trying to accomplish--subpoena power for the \ncommission so they can bring in all the parties they need to make sure \nwe get to the truth. We need someone to swear under oath that they are \ntelling us, in fact, the truth about what happened and how much oil is \nspilling every day into the gulf.\n  Common sense and good judgment demand that we pass the legislation \nand move quickly to get to that truth. I can't understand, when I hear \nso many of my colleagues talk about truth and honesty and transparency, \nthat they can oppose the very effort to give the subpoena powers that \nget us there. It is a sad day.\n  While I have the floor, let me briefly say that something good did \nhappen today as it relates to this process, and I want to thank Senator \nBoxer, the chair of the Environment and Public Works Committee, Senator \nLautenberg, and the very supportive members of that committee, for \npassing my Big Oil Bailout Prevention bill out of committee today so \nthat we can get an up-or-down vote on the floor to hold big oil fully \nliable for the economic and environmental damage they have caused. \nFrankly, it is time we have a vote, after so many Republican \nobjections, to this commonsense legislation. The bill that the \ncommittee passed is simple and common sense. It asserts that we want to \nprotect those families, those taxpayers--and all of us as taxpayers--\nnot oil company profits. It asserts that oil companies should bear the \nburden of the economic damages that their spill causes, not taxpayers.\n  As we see the images and read the stories from the gulf coast night \nafter night, it could not be clearer that coastal families and \ntaxpayers are the ones who need protection, not oil companies. With \naction such as this one in the committee today, we have a lot of \nmomentum going right now. I think the American people have shown \nclearly they want oil companies held fully accountable, and we are \nworking to do just that. I think we are developing a head of steam.\n\n  It seems that the only people who consistently work to protect oil \ncompanies instead of coastal families right now are the oil companies \nthemselves and some colleagues who seem to, no matter what, oppose, \noppose, oppose either having subpoena power to get to the truth or \nlifting the liability cap so that the oil industry will be held \nresponsible.\n  Four times my Republican colleagues have blocked the Big Oil Bailout \nPrevention Act from passing quickly by unanimous consent here on the \nSenate Floor, even though there is a fierce urgency of doing so now. \nAll but one in the committee today voted in favor of the poison pill \namendment that would have gutted the bill. And they have blocked, as I \nhave said, the attempts of my colleague from New Hampshire to give the \ncommission all the tools necessary to do a full investigation.\n  So I say to them, if they continue to stand in the way of our efforts \nto hold oil companies fully accountable, they are going to get run over \nby public opinion. I hope that now the committee has acted, we can use \nthis as an opportunity to finally hold big oil accountable, and in \ndoing so, to send a message to the industry that they are going to have \nto be extremely careful; that they cannot cut corners; that they cannot \ngo cheap as they drill--to the extent that we are going to allow \ndrilling to take place. We cannot risk the kind of environmental \ndisaster we now have in the gulf. By the way, 11 lives were lost on \nthat day on that rig. We must guard against a future generation facing \nthis kind of environmental degradation. That is what is at stake here. \nThat is what is at stake here.\n  It is incomprehensible to me that we cannot get our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to join us in this effort.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown of Massachusetts pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 3551 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. If I may, before my colleague speaks--I will yield to him \nright away.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Before my neighbor from Massachusetts leaves the floor, let \nme commend him for his comments here without getting into details of \nthe bill he has offered but, more importantly, the general thrust of \nwhat he has expressed. As he is a newly arriving Member of this body \nand may be here for many years, I am wrapping up three decades of \nservice. But I hope people will listen to what he has to say.\n  People come to the Chamber and to this institution with the idea of \ngetting things done for our country. That is so critically important. \nWhat he has suggested, what I have heard others talk about today, is \nmaking this institution functional so we can actually come to terms. It \nis not easy. We represent different constituencies and different \ninterests. But if the spirit expressed by Senator Scott Brown of \nMassachusetts in these brief remarks he has made this morning can carry \nforward in all the debates and discussions we have, we will find a lot \nmore solutions. I want to say thank you.\n  Mr. BURRIS. I thank the distinguished Senator from Connecticut, who\n\n[[Page S5656]]\n\nhas certainly been an inspiration to me in this body, and an \ninspiration to all of us. I will be leaving with him, although I \ncertainly did not come with him. But he has been an inspiration to all \nof us. He knows what my--I will not say publicly, but I thought the \nSenator would have made a heck of a Supreme Court Justice.\n  Madam President, as a public servant, I have long been a strong \nadvocate for American small businesses--especially disadvantaged and \nminority-owned businesses.\n  And even before I sought elected office, when I was a banker, I \nworked hard every day to spur investment on Main Street.\n  I fought to make capital available to small businesses, so \nentrepreneurs and innovators could create jobs and bring prosperity to \nlocal communities.\n  But in today's harsh economic climate, many of these businesses are \nfinding it harder than ever to stay afloat.\n  Credit has largely dried up, and capital investment is difficult to \ncome by.\n  And even as our economy begins to inch along the road to recovery, \nsmall and disadvantaged businesses continue to lag behind.\n  I believe we need to do better.\n  I believe we need to place small businesses at the very center of our \nresponse to this economic crisis. They are uniquely positioned to \ncreate well-paying jobs and generate growth at a local level--so it is \ntime to make them a priority again. Because, if this Congress fails to \ntake action, if we neglect to pass the Small Business Lending Act, and \nfall short of our commitment to America's innovators and entrepreneurs, \nthen I fear that our Nation will slip into a jobless recovery, and \ndisadvantaged businesses will continue to suffer the full effects of \nthis great recession.\n  I recognize that government cannot directly create jobs in the same \nway that the private sector can. But few can deny that government has \nan important role to play in setting America back on the road to \nrecovery.\n  Our job is to support and encourage responsible practices, impose \ncommon sense regulations, and help to direct investment to the areas \nthat need it most. That is why I believe we need to pay special \nattention to the disadvantaged and minority-owned small businesses that \nhave borne the brunt of this crisis.\n  Under current law, the Small Business Administration provides key \nsupport to these entities through its 8-A program. This initiative \noffers technical assistance, training, and contracting opportunities to \nsmall businesses that meet specific criteria. I am a strong supporter \nof this program, which has helped to keep disadvantaged businesses \nviable, and made sure everyone has the chance to share in economic \nprosperity. Since its inception, 8-A has made a difference in countless \ncommunities, and eased some of the worst effects of this crisis for \nthose who stood to suffer the most. Yet, despite its success, this \nprogram's impact has been artificially limited, because only a small \nnumber of businesses are eligible for this kind of support.\n  As we cast about for a solution to our economic troubles, I believe \nwe should leave no stone unturned.\n  At various times since the onset of the recession, both Democrats and \nRepublicans have come to the table with constructive ideas. Many of \nthese have been passed into law--and I think they have made a real \ndifference. But we must not find false security in early reports of \nsuccess.\n  We have made progress--but the situation remains fragile. There is \nstill much more to be done. That is why I have introduced an amendment \nthat would improve and expand the 8-A program.\n  This measure would increase the continued eligibility amount, from \n$750,000 to $2.5 million, so more small businesses could benefit from \nthis assistance.\n  It is no secret that minority-owned businesses, particularly those in \npoor or urban areas, have been hit hardest by the current economic \ndownturn, so as we look to our recovery, these are the areas we should \ntarget for our strongest support.\n  By expanding the existing 8-A program, we can increase its economic \nimpact, without having to reinvent the wheel. We can rely on a proven \ninitiative to inject new life into disadvantaged areas.\n  I ask my colleagues to support my amendment, as well as the \nunderlying bill as a whole.\n  On behalf of small and minority-owned businesses, I ask for their \nassistance in these troubled times.\n  Our economic future may be uncertain, but with my proposal and the \nSmall Business Lending Act, we have the rare opportunity to influence \nthat future.\n  Let's pass these measures, to guarantee some degree of relief for the \npeople who continue to suffer the most. Let's renew our investments in \nAmerica's small businesses, and rely on them to drive our economic \nrecovery.\n  Let's do so today. Let's do it now, for tomorrow may be too late.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I should have noted, I will be leaving \nwith my friend and colleague from Illinois as well. He has been a \nwonderful addition to this institution. He has done a very fine job \nrepresenting the people of Illinois. I regret we didn't get to serve \nmore years together, that he didn't get a chance to come here earlier. \nHe made a good contribution in the short time we have been here. Had \nthe Senator been here longer, I think he would have made a significant \ncontribution over the years. I thank the Senator for the time he has \nserved and the manner in which he served as well.\n\n\n                           Wall Street Reform\n\n  I rise this afternoon to spend a few minutes to talk about a most \nimportant piece of legislation facing this body and, more importantly, \nour country, and that is the Wall Street reform bill. In fact, the \nPresiding Officer has had a deep interest in the subject matter and in \nher previous life actually worked in the area of financial services. \nShe not only brings an interest from the State of North Carolina, one \nof the fine States that has a significant involvement in the financial \nservices of our country, but has also a knowledge about these \ninstitutions, how they work, and how the financial system works. I am \nvery grateful to her for her thoughts and suggestions as we have been \nthrough this rather long journey over the last couple of years in the \nwake of the financial crisis that befell our Nation most dramatically \nin the fall of 2008.\n  I think all of our colleagues here know what is at stake. We do not \nneed to spend a lot of time talking about the circumstances over the \nlast couple of years. We know it, and more importantly, and more \npoignantly, our constituents know it, because they are living it.\n  All of us have jobs here. We are fairly well compensated, to put it \nmildly, by any standard. We have good health care. We own our homes or \nare not worried about whether we can afford the rent in the places we \nlive--whatever the circumstances. We are in some ways insulated from \nthe day-to-day agonies our fellow citizens go through and have gone \nthrough over these last couple of years.\n  But I also have a deep appreciation of the fact that my colleagues, \ndespite not personally going through these terrible times as their \nconstituents are, understand the importance of this issue. I am deeply \ngrateful to each and every Member of this Chamber over the last 2 years \nand almost everyone in this Chamber has been involved in this debate or \ndiscussion to one degree or another. The fact is we have come as far as \nwe have in this bill because there is that interest and because there \nis that concern that we need to address the architecture, the financial \nstructures of our Nation so as to avoid the kind of problems we have \nseen our Nation go through over these last several years.\n  Again, the numbers have been repeated so often I am almost hesitant \nto repeat them this afternoon. Certainly we will know better tomorrow. \nI guess the unemployment numbers will come out again.\n  But well over 8\\1/2\\ million jobs have been lost. Frankly, I think \nthat number is an underestimation of what has happened. Some people \nhave found part-time work, falling back in and out of it. But the \nnumber, 8.4 million, is used. It is certainly no less than that and, I \nsuspect, as I said, far more than that.\n\n[[Page S5657]]\n\n  Seven million of our fellow citizens have had their homes fall into \nforeclosure. Every time I say that sentence it seems it is so brief to \ncite the number. But imagine, as we must, that moment when, despite all \nof your efforts, that dream house you have acquired for your family, \nbecause of a lost job, the lost retirement, the closed business, all of \na sudden that which you had hoped and dreamed for that has brought \nstability to your family, a great sense of joy and hope, dreams \nfulfilled, is all of a sudden closed, foreclosed, lost.\n  Imagine coming home that night when all of the efforts to hold on to \nthat home are gone and facing your family and telling them the house \nyou have lived in--where you have played, you have eaten, you have \ndreamt, you have laughed, you have cried, you have done all of the \nthings that building enshrines in the American family--is no longer \nyours. For 7 million of our fellow citizens that night has happened. \nMany more face the prospect of that occurring in the months ahead, \ndespite the efforts to get our economy moving again. Retirement \nincomes, of course, have vanished in a flash, watching the markets \ndecline. Literally years of building security for those retirement \nyears, to contribute to a child's higher education costs, to blunt the \ncosts of a health tragedy to hit your family, all of those rainy days \nthat retirement or savings account can provide to weather those storms \nhave been eliminated.\n  So there has been a shocking loss of wealth in our Nation as well. \nTrillions of dollars are gone, incomes that will never be made up. As I \nmentioned, lost home values, even if you have been able to hold on to \nyour home, home values, on average, have declined about 30 percent. So \nthat equity you might have built up in that dream house, where you have \nraised your family over the last 10, 15, 20 years, you paid one price \nfor it maybe 20 years ago and had the full expectation that property \nvalue, while it may not skyrocket, would increase in value over the \nyears.\n  So as you became that empty nester as your kids went on to college or \nmarriage or jobs on their own, the hope that you would be able to sell \nthat home to another hopeful buyer and come out of it with some equity \nthat would then provide for that security that you needed to contribute \nto your family's well being has been totally gone in many cases, even \nif you have held on to your home.\n  Well, the bill I briefly want to talk about does not do anything \nabout what has happened. I would love to tell you if we passed this \nbill that you could get your job back; that passing this financial \nreform bill would give you your job back. I would love to be able to \ntell you that when we pass this bill you would get your home back or \nthat somehow you would be able to magically replenish that retirement \naccount or savings account.\n  This bill does not do any of those things. All this bill does is to \nsay that when the next crisis comes--and surely it will as night \nfollows dawn, as tomorrow follows today we will have another economic \ncrisis. I never suggested this bill was going to stop that. What I hope \nwe are able to do with this bill is minimize the effects of that crisis \nwhen it occurs so that it does not metastasize. That may be the best \nword to use in this case, much as a cancer does.\n  When an economic crisis hits, if you are able to handle it when it \nhappens, much as you are able to handle a cancer when you discover it \nbefore it contaminates your entire body--the crisis that will happen if \nwe can control it, identify it early enough, begin to address the \nproblems that it poses, then we might avoid the kind of catastrophic \neffect this present economic catastrophe has caused, the most \nsignificant in almost 100 years, since the Great Depression more than \n80 years ago.\n  So I want to briefly talk about not only the process we have gone \nthrough over the past year and a half, but also what this bill is \ntrying to do. Let me be the first to acknowledge and admit that it does \nnot do everything I would like it to do. I am not overly enthusiastic \nabout every provision in this bill. There are measures that I objected \nto that are in the bill.\n  But we serve in a body of our fellow colleagues, the 100 of us who \nserve here, who work with those who work down the hall from this \nChamber where 435 of our colleagues serve, with an administration and \nregulators, not to mention financial institutions and their employees \nand all that are involved in the financial network of our Nation, all \nare impacted and affected by this bill. So it is difficult to try to \nfashion a piece of legislation that accommodates the various interests \nand allows us to move forward. But that is what we have tried to do.\n  Process is important. I will not dwell on this point, but as someone \nwho has spent three decades of my life at this very desk--and it is the \nonly desk I have ever sat at since the day I arrived. This desk was \nplanted over in that far corner as the 100th Senator in the body up \nuntil I--some 20 years ago when, through seniority, you get to move \nyour desk around. I ended up in this seat, this spot about 20 years \nago, next to this remarkable man whose life we are going to celebrate \nand are celebrating those days, Robert C. Byrd. He has been my seatmate \nfor the last two decades.\n  As I said the other day, I was an 8-year-old child sitting in the \ngalleries of the other body watching my father, on January 3, 1953, and \na 35-year-old new Congressman from West Virginia be sworn in as newly \nminted Members of Congress. Some 6 years later, I sat in that gallery \nup here, in the family gallery, watching my father be sworn in as a \nSenator from Connecticut, along with a new Senator from West Virginia \nnamed Robert C. Byrd, never imagining, as a 7- or 8-year-old or as a \n14-year-old, that I would spend 20 years of my life at a desk next to \nthe man who has served longer than any other human being in the history \nof our Nation.\n  Process meant a lot to Robert C. Byrd. The Constitution meant a great \ndeal. I carry with me, and every day I have for 20 years, the \nConstitution that Robert C. Byrd gave me and autographed to me. It is \nrather threadbare and worn today, but he revered this document. He \ncould absolutely quote it verbatim. He gave me a copy, as he did to all \nnew Members when they arrive, and the importance of understanding the \nrole of this body in our constitutional framework.\n  He was such a great advocate of the civility and the respect for each \nother as we try to fashion answers to our Nation's problems. We have \nbeen through two major bills in the last Congress. There have been a \nlot of other bills to consider, but the health care debate and the \nfinancial reform debate, I would argue, are the two largest in this \nCongress, and they are two models of how an institution can operate.\n  Even though I am glad we prevailed with the health care debate and \nare going to finally end up dealing with cost and access to our health \ncare system and making it more available to people as a result of our \nactions taken, it was not a pretty process. Anyone who watched it, let \nalone those of us who were involved in it, certainly would have \npreferred that we arrive at the conclusion in a manner differently than \nwhat we went through. Maybe not everyone would agree with that. I feel \nthat way.\n  The second model, if you will, is the one we just went through on \nfinancial reform, which was about as open a process as you could ever \nhave. We went through literally months of listening in our committee, \nthe Banking Committee which I chair, to hundreds--and I am not \nexaggerating--hundreds of experts who came and briefed us either \nformally or informally, literally dozens and dozens of formal hearings \nto dissect what had happened, how we got into this mess, who caused it, \nhow was it caused, and what steps we should be taking to see to it this \nproblem, another economic crisis, would not explode as broadly as this \none has.\n  I invited my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to be involved in \nall of those meetings, to see to it that they would be present, even at \nWhite House meetings, to talk about what we needed to do. We laid out \nour first ideas together a year and a half ago, even before marking up \nanything close to a bill.\n  I presented our first discussion draft of this legislation in \nNovember of last year, and it was a discussion draft. After that draft \nwas put forward, I assigned bipartisan working groups to attack the \nmajor issues in the bill. In March of this year, I unveiled a new bill \nthat incorporated many of the bipartisan ideas that the working groups\n\n[[Page S5658]]\n\nhad produced. In fact, what I asked to be done in our committee, in the \nBanking Committee, was divide up the labor between Democrats and \nRepublicans on certain large, complicated subject matters. And to their \ncredit, they worked very hard. It did not always come up with a final \nanswer in various areas, but they contributed significantly to the \nproduct we now have before us in the form of a conference committee \nreport coming to this body, coming to the Senate.\n\n  So I am grateful to Richard Shelby, who is not supportive of the \nbill, but was my ranking member and was the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee for 4 years before I took over the chairmanship in January of \n2007.\n  I will not go down the list and mention all of the members, but the \ncommittee members worked very hard. Even though we ended up disagreeing \nwith what we finally produced, I am grateful to them for the efforts \nthey put into the legislation. Beyond that, I have worked every day to \nkeep my colleagues informed every step of the process, at least I have \ntried to, and if not them directly, their staffs, so there was that \nsense of inclusion, the model that everyone ought to be able to have a \nrole and participate in the debate of a significant bill.\n  So the point I am making is, this bill was the product of \ncollaboration of many of my colleagues before the debate even began on \nthe floor of the Senate. On this floor, the debate lasted almost a \nmonth, one of the longest debates in many years in the Congress of the \nUnited States. Nearly 50 votes were cast by Democrats and Republicans \nover a 4-week period.\n  One of the many that passed was the very second one, I think. Senator \nBoxer of California offered the first amendment that said taxpayers \nshould never again be asked to pay for a bailout of a financial \ninstitution. I think that passed unanimously. Then Senator Shelby and I \noffered an amendment where we reached a bipartisan agreement on \nmeasures to end all bailouts of financial institutions once and for \nall, one of the most contentious areas of the bill.\n  From that point forward, over the next 4 weeks, with almost 60 \namendments back and forth, we ended up passing the legislation by the \nthinnest of margins, overcoming the procedural votes we needed to in \norder to reach financial passage of the bill.\n  The last time the Banking Committee held a conference on any \nlegislation was 7 years ago. So I took my committee product, the Senate \nproduct, and we went to what is called a conference. The House had \npassed its bill in December. We had passed our bill in May. So what \nnormally has happened in the past is they never meet, or if they do \nmeet they met in closed-door sessions to work out the differences. Then \nthey would come back with a product.\n  The last time the Banking Committee had been to a conference with the \nHouse of Representatives on any bill was more than 7 years ago. Those \nmeetings were held mostly in private; the public was never even invited \ninto the room, let alone the press, to observe and to cover the event. \nWe changed all of that. Our conference committee, the 42 members of \nboth Chambers who met, again, for a 2-week period, almost 70 hours that \nwe met, we considered 180 amendments in 70 hours. And 54 amendments \nwere offered by Senators, 34 of which were offered by my Republican \ncolleagues in the conference, 20 by the Democrats.\n  So combined, between the number of amendments we debated on the floor \nof the Senate and the number of amendments we debated in conference as \nSenators--forget the House Members and their amendments--there were \nover 100 amendments by Democrats and Republicans to the financial \nreform bill. C-SPAN and the press sat there and watched every minute of \nthe conference and covered every second, gavel to gavel, of the \nproceedings that went on for almost 70 hours over a 2-week period. My \npoint is, this model of conducting our business, listening to each \nother, debating and deciding what ought to be in this bill, stands in \nstark contrast to how we went through the health care debate.\n  What is the point I am trying to make? If at the end of this process \nit appears as though we still face a procedural objection to going \nforward, what difference did it make, then, which course we followed if \nat the end of the process it did not make any difference?\n  The motion to invoke cloture is a strange phrase that I suspect most \nAmericans do not have the vaguest idea of its meaning, or very few do. \nIt sounds like something a doctor may do if you are ill, to get a \ncloture or something. That is what I thought it was when I first \narrived here.\n  Briefly, cloture is a method by which you end a filibuster. In this \nChamber, under our rules, we respect the rights of the minority, \nincluding a minority of one.\n  Members can talk as long as they can stand up, under most \ncircumstances, and continue. Robert C. Byrd, in fact, held one of the \nrecords. It wasn't the record--Strom Thurmond holds the record, a \nformer Senator I served with from South Carolina--but Robert C. Byrd \nconducted a filibuster for more than 14 hours. We can do that in this \nChamber. But if we want to end the filibuster, we have to invoke \ncloture. That takes 60 votes--more than a simple majority--to say: We \nhave had enough debate. The process has been fair. It is now time to \nvote. So we invoke cloture. If we don't think the process has been \nfair, that we haven't been given a chance to express ourselves, that we \nhave been denied the opportunity to offer amendments or contribute to \nthe debate, then we vote against invoking cloture.\n  There have certainly been many circumstances when that has been \nwarranted, but I don't know how anyone could make a case that a \nfilibuster on procedural grounds is warranted on this financial reform \nbill such as we have been through. I don't know what else I could have \ndone to make every Member of this Chamber feel more included in the \ndebate on the reform of Wall Street. If there is something else I could \nhave done to say to a Member: You would have had additional rights or \nopportunities, I would like to hear it. I don't think I could have. You \ncan't spend 4 weeks in this Chamber through almost 60 amendments, 54 \nmore in a conference, virtually allowing unlimited debate on almost \nanything that came up, and tell me you think you have been denied the \nopportunity to fully vent your feelings, to be heard, to offer your \nideas and thoughts.\n  As a departing suggestion of one about to leave in 5 or 6 months, \nthere ought to be some value to the process we have gone through. I \nhave heard this morning already concerns expressed because the \ninstitution, in the minds of some, is dysfunctional. I don't want to \nbelieve that. I want to believe it is still a functional institution. \nBut if, at the end, this process of what I have tried to lead on the \nbanking bill causes people to believe that it doesn't make any \ndifference, we are still going to vote for procedural roadblocks to \nthis bill because we don't like some of the provisions in it or don't \nlike the bill, then I do despair in some ways for whether this \ninstitution can ever function. If, at the end of all of that, we end up \nwith the same kinds of procedural roadblocks as we had on the health \ncare debate, where I would argue there was more legitimacy to invoking \nthose procedural roadblocks, then I think the institution is in a lot \nmore trouble than I would like to believe. I mention the process \nbecause it ought to be important to people, seeing to it that we have a \nchance to go forward.\n  At the end of that conference, we came up not only with the \ncompromises necessary for a bill but also how to offset the cost of \nthis bill. The House rules require that we demonstrate that the cost of \nthe bill to the overall Treasury of the United States is not going to \nleave it in deeper debt than would otherwise be the case. We had to \ncome up with offsetting costs for the bill.\n  The first proposal was not met warmly. It was assessments on large \ninstitutions primarily. But there were strong objections expressed, and \ntwo or three of our colleagues, who have been very helpful on this bill \nin offering ideas that would strengthen the bill and made significant \ncontributions, expressed their concerns to me that this was an \nunacceptable offset, in their minds. So I took the extraordinary step \nof reconvening the conference. We met yesterday to change the offsets. \nWe did so by two things. One we kept the same, and that was by making \npermanent the insurance fund in the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation,\n\n[[Page S5659]]\n\nmaking it permanent at $250,000. That requires an assessment increase \nin order to meet those obligations. That was already in the bill. The \nCongressional Budget Office scores that as providing about $8.5 billion \nin revenues over the next 10 years. That was there.\n  The second piece we did is end TARP. That is something all of us have \nwanted to see since the inception of the program. Can we bring this \nthing to a close? Under our alternative offset, we end TARP \nimmediately, except for its current obligations. The Congressional \nBudget Office--and I will provide letters from the CBO confirming these \nnumbers--scored that at about $11 billion over 10 years in savings. \nThat money goes into deficit reduction. This is an offset; it is not a \npay-for. What do I mean by that? If the budget of our Nation was $100 \nand the cost of a program was $10, you would have to make up that $10. \nIt doesn't go directly to pay for those programs, but it provides the \noffset for the cost of those programs.\n  The third piece of this to make up the difference was by increasing \nthe reserve ratio at the FDIC, which was supported by the chairperson \nof the FDIC, to go from 1.15 percent to 1.35 percent but to hold \nharmless all financial institutions or banks that have assets under $10 \nbillion and to do that not over 4 or 5 years but over the next 10 years \nuntil 2020. That provides an additional $5.7 billion.\n  The CBO has thus scored the entire bill as providing an additional \n$3.2 billion in deficit reduction because the amounts we will be \nbringing in exceed the cost of the bill.\n  So, for my colleagues, ending TARP and complying with what the \nChairman of the FDIC has said is a far better suggestion.\n  I would be remiss at this juncture if I did not specifically thank my \ncolleagues from Maine, Susan M. Collins and Olympia J. Snowe. It was \nMs. Collins who said this is a better idea to look at as an offset. I \nam grateful to her, as I am to her colleague from Maine and my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Senator Brown, who expressed his concerns \nabout the assessment approach. Again, I will let them speak for \nthemselves on these matters.\n  But it is important that colleagues know that, going back to a few \nmoments ago talking about process, it was at the suggestion of \nDemocrats and Republicans that changes were made to the bill, including \nthe extraordinary step yesterday of opening the conference. There are \nthose who wanted me to go forward anyway with it. Why would I do that \nif, in fact, Members have said: I can't be supportive under the present \ncircumstances. The opportunity to make a correction in the bill and \ntherefore come up with a better idea that was more acceptable to more \nof our colleagues seemed the appropriate step to take. That is exactly \nwhat we did. That is how we have offset the cost of this bill.\n  I will provide additional data. If I have misspoken on the numbers, I \nwill correct my own statement for the record. But I believe I am \napproximately correct.\n  Again, none of this is easy. I know there is a temptation at times \nlike this for emotions to rise, passions to find expression. I have \ngreat respect for all of my colleagues in the efforts they made. There \nare moments of frustration when you are trying to pass a major bill, \nseeking cooperation from your colleagues to get the job done. But this \nis a complicated piece of legislation. More than 2,000 pages are \nincluded in the bill. There are provisions that are not ones I would \nwrite myself, but this is the legislative process.\n  I introduced a bill last November, the one I would have preferred, \nbut in the months since, many Members have had their opportunities to \nmake changes. Some changes I liked; some I didn't. But it should not be \nthat because you don't like one or two or several provisions of a bill, \nthat ought to become more important than the total impact of what you \nare trying to achieve. There are those who don't like the bill, any \npart of it at all or very few parts of it. Again, I understand that. \nThose people are going to vote no. But when someone tells me there is \none provision or two they don't like and as a result they are going to \nvote against everything, that I don't understand, candidly.\n  We have had our debate. We voted on hundreds of individual provisions \nbetween the House and this body. There will be procedural votes. I have \nmade my case that at some point, a process that is as open as this one \nhas been, as inclusive as this one has been, as hospitable as I could \npossibly make it, as civil as I could possibly make it--if the \nprocedural roadblocks are no different than the legislation that was \nconducted without any civility, without any of the cooperation and \ninclusiveness of this, then what is the lesson? What is the lesson for \nthe next major bill if, in fact, going through all of that gets you no \nfurther in the process than what we have been through?\n  This bill doesn't bring back your home, your job, your retirement \nincome. What it does do is to try to see to it that the next crisis \nwill not cause the deep problems this one has.\n\n  Let me briefly identify the two or three or four things that are \nmajor in the bill. In the absence of these, if we defeat the bill, all \nof this is gone and we are right back to September of 2008, right back \nwhere we were when this body voted, with less than 40 days to go before \na national election, to ask the American taxpayer to write a $700 \nbillion check to bail out and stabilize financial institutions. If you \nreject this effort we have been involved in for almost 2 years in the \nweek when we come back, then we are exactly where we were in the fall \nof 2008, with all of the vulnerabilities we saw our country experience \nas a result of not reforming the structures to our financial system.\n  This bill will end taxpayer bailouts by making it tough for companies \nto engage in the kind of irresponsible behavior that threatened the \neconomy. It sets up a way to shut down the giant, dangerous companies \nthat failed, through bankruptcy or through a resolution mechanism that \nlays all of the cost and pain on them, not on the American taxpayer. \nThat is a major achievement.\n  We also include for the first time institutions that are financial \ninstitutions that have operated in the shadow economy of the Nation--no \nregulation, no one moderating their behavior. This bill brings them all \nin. They will now be regulated and controlled, so they can't engage in \nthe kind of wildcat behavior that brought our Nation to the point we \nhave been.\n  The bill creates a consumer financial services protection bureau. I \nget people acting as if this was the most radical idea in America. If \nyou buy a faulty product--a toaster, a car, a television set--and it is \na crummy product, you have a place to go to get some sort of redress. \nIn fact, they are required to recall the products under the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission and others. If you get a crummy mortgage, a \ncrummy insurance policy, you get a crummy piece of stock because \nsomeone lied about it, where do you go? Whom do you call? You get a \nlawyer--I guess that is the answer--if you have the resources. This \nbill sets up, for the first time in our history, a place where the \naverage consumer of financial services might be able to get a redress \nof their grievances.\n  I know people are acting as if this is some wild socialistic idea, \nsome crazy leftwing notion, after what the country has been through, \nthat we could end up having a place where the average American citizen, \nwho wants to have faith and trust in our economic system, can go to get \nsome relief. God forbid they are treated as they have been in too many \ninstances in the past. That is part of this bill.\n  This bill will create an advanced warning system. Instead of one set \nof eyes that, frankly, were closed most of the time, we now have what \nwe call sort of a risk assessment council made up of the various \nFederal agencies that have prudential responsibility over financial \ninstitutions to be meeting and looking at what is going on in the \neconomy, not only here in our Nation but abroad as well. Are there \nthings occurring within companies, within interconnected companies, \nwithin countries that could pose a financial risk to our Nation? \nSpotting them early enough to put a stop to them, to break them up, as \na last resort, or to insist that certain things be done to avoid these \nmetastasizing events that have contaminated every aspect of our life \nbecause no one stood up early enough to stop them when they first \nspotted them.\n  The bill further brings transparency and accountability to the \nderivatives\n\n[[Page S5660]]\n\nmarket, a $600 trillion--that is not misspeaking; that is not a \nmillion, not a billion--a $600 trillion market. It is a phenomenal \nmarket. Basically, it has been unregulated and out of control.\n  We have central clearing exchange trading with new margin and capital \nrequirements for large bank dealers and major swap participants. These \nsafeguards will ensure taxpayers are not left on the hook for Wall \nStreet's bets, particularly with depositors' money, as we saw happen, \nor an AIG circumstance.\n  The bill has the so-called Volcker rule to prohibit banking \norganizations from engaging in proprietary trading and strictly \nlimiting their sponsorship and investment in hedge funds and private \nequity funds. Again, if they want to risk their own money, that is one \nthing. Risking your money ought to be something else. We have expanded \nthe Volcker rule, with balance to it. We don't totally eliminate the \nability of a bank to hedge on things that are critically important for \nthem. We believe it is an important rule. Without it, we are right back \nwhere we were before.\n  The bill brings transparency to the Federal Reserve. I thank Bernie \nSanders of Vermont and others who have insisted on greater auditing and \naccountability out of the Federal Reserve System which under our bill \nwill bring transparency to it with audits of the so-called 13(3) \nemergency lending that took place during the financial crisis, and a \nrequirement that the Fed disclose who these so-called counterparties \nare and information about the amounts they are putting at risk and, in \nturn, for the American taxpayer, setting conditions on how that money \ncan be used, putting real limitations on it, and giving this body, the \nCongress of the United States, a chance to respond if, in fact, they \nexceed their authority.\n  Further, the bill limits the emergency Fed lending through 13(3) so \nit can no longer be used to prop up an individual company, as they did \nwith AIG.\n  The bill requires people to have skin in the game, requiring \ncompanies that sell products like asset-backed securities to retain at \nleast 5 percent of the credit risk, so there is no longer an incentive \nto sell garbage and junk loans to people who could never pay them back \nthus exposing our economy and our country to further abuse.\n  These are all things in the bill. If we scrap it, we are right back \nwithout any of these protections. I will tell you, it will be a \ngeneration before the Congress comes back to deal with these issues \nagain because in the absence of the crisis we have been in, we would \nnot have gotten to this. The crisis gave us an opportunity to respond. \nThese were not new issues. These issues had been lingering around. But \nthe financial resources behind many of these operations are totally \nresistant to the changes we are talking about because there is too much \nmoney to be made for them and too much risk for the American consumer \nto absorb, and it was not going to have the same kind of concerns and \ninterests brought to the bargaining table when these issues and this \nlegislation was drafted.\n  The bill gives shareholders, the owners of public companies, a say on \nexecutive pay and so-called golden parachutes. We require public \ncompanies to take back compensation awarded based on phony financial \nstatements. Shouldn't the owners of public companies have some say in \nthese matters?\n  Further, the bill encourages whistleblowers with a new program at the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission to encourage people to report \nsecurities violations. Ask the victims of Bernie Madoff whether that \nkind of provision might have made a difference, when we had the \nwhistleblowers writing and begging the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to take note of what was happening with the Madoff scam. No \none was willing to do a darn thing about it. Literally thousands of \npeople were wiped out because no one bothered to listen to a \nwhistleblower who identified the problem.\n  This bill changes that. It is not to say there will not be additional \nscam artists. I promise you, there will. But instead of denying the \nexistence of a whistleblower standing up and telling a regulatory body \ntheir responsibilities, this bill requires them to take note and to \nact.\n  Additionally, because of the size and the complexity of this bill, it \nis almost certain there will have to be a bill with technical \ncorrections in the future.\n  So when we take the sum total--obviously, I am describing five or six \nprovisions in a 2,000-page bill--we have a product that I think \nrestores financial security and trust. Let me mention just this point \non trust because there is no financial number I could put on trust. But \nit may be the most important element of all. Put aside all of those \nindividual provisions and titles of the bill, the one thing that has \nbeen so severely damaged that is the most important to restore is the \ntrust of the American people in our financial system. Today that trust \nhas been shattered by what has happened.\n  In the absence of people trusting that the financial system is fair \nand equitable, then I think we are in deeper trouble than any fix I can \nwrite into a bill. People understand when they deposit a paycheck in a \nbank, there is an assumption of risk that ought to be very little. When \nthey buy an insurance policy, it is a different assumption of risk. \nWhen they buy a stock, there is an even further assumption of risk. \nThere are no guarantees it is going to give a great return. In fact, it \nmay fail.\n  But we ought to be able to trust the system; that it is not going to \ndeceive us and defraud us; that it is not going to send people out to \nlure us into situations they know we cannot afford and they know they \ncan sell off quickly and make a fast buck on. That trust in our \nfinancial structure, which was so important for so long, has been \nseverely damaged over what has occurred in these last several years.\n  More than any other provision of this bill, more than anything else \nany of us can write into a piece of legislation, is whether we are \ngoing to regain the confidence and the optimism and the trust of that \nhard-working American family to believe that when they deposit that \npaycheck, there is not going to be someone investing in a hedge fund or \nsome risky venture with their money--that is prohibited in this bill--\nor when they buy a stock there is not going to be someone out there who \nis actually scamming them in a kiting system which ruins them forever \nand their families, or when they get a mortgage on a home there is \nsomeone not sitting across the table promising to be their financial \nadviser when they are anything but in the process.\n  That trust has been so severely hurt that our hope is, more than \nanything else I have written into this bill, we will be able to bring \nus back to where Americans feel confidence and trust in our country's \nfinancial systems again. So nothing less than that is at stake.\n  This is a fundamental overhaul of the way our financial system is \nregulated. It is the greatest change to occur since the reforms which \nwere invoked after the Great Depression of the 1930s.\n  Beyond that, of course, it is important that what we have done could \nbe harmonized with other nations. The American President, Barack Obama, \nwent to Toronto a few days ago to a meeting of the G20. The \nconservative Prime Minister of Canada pointed to this legislation and \nsaid: This is an opportunity for America to lead in helping the rest of \nthe world to harmonize its rules on financial services. Defeat this \nbill and someone else will set the ground rules, and we will have to \nharmonize with them.\n  If my colleagues think that is a better result, to let the European \nUnion or someone else write what the standards are going to be, then \nhave it and defeat the bill. But if my colleagues believe it is better \nfor the United States to lead and provide the guidelines and the \nstructures that the rest of the world can rally around, then get behind \nus and support this effort because nothing less than that is at risk, \nas well, in this legislation.\n  So no one is going to get everything they want in this bill. I \ncertainly did not. No one ever does. I have never seen a bill in 30 \nyears that ended up becoming the prerogative of one small group. This \nhas been a collective effort--a truly inclusive, collective effort. \nOver 100 amendments have been offered and considered by my fellow \ncolleagues to this bill in this Chamber in the most open process in \ndecades. It is the only time I have ever seen a conference conducted \nwith the public viewing every single second of it, with 42 Members from \nthe House and Senate\n\n[[Page S5661]]\n\nparticipating almost 70 hours in a 2-week period, not to mention the \nmonth we spent on the floor of this Chamber.\n  So I have done everything I know how to do in trying to accommodate \nmy colleagues to make this as fair and as balanced and as thoughtful as \nwe possibly could. But now is the time to act.\n  I wanted to take a few minutes today before we, tomorrow, participate \nin the solemn ceremony of celebrating the life of Robert C. Byrd in \nthis Chamber. It will be a historic moment. I know it was a desire of \nhis when he was alive that at the time of his passing he be recognized \nin this Chamber. Then, on Friday, many of us will travel to his home \nState of West Virginia, which he served so remarkably well over the 58 \nyears of his service, to participate at his funeral services. Then we \nwill be gone for a week over the Fourth of July break. Shortly after we \ncome back, based on the schedule set by the majority leader and the \nminority leader, we will vote on the financial reform package and bill.\n  So today I wanted to take a few closing minutes to say to my \ncolleagues, I do not know what else I could have done to make this more \ninclusive, to provide more balance and sense to all of this, to respond \nto the concerns my colleagues have raised in what we have done.\n  I urge you, I plead with you to give us the vote on this bill and to \nunderstand the process we have gone through and to set a template to \nsay that a process followed by which everyone gets a chance to \nparticipate ought to be the model of how the Senate conducts its \nbusiness. I hope my colleagues will not underestimate the value and \nimportance of that approach we have taken with this bill.\n  I have taken a long time, and I apologize to my colleagues. But I \nwanted to explain the process of what we have done in conference. \nAgain, I thank the majority leader. The majority leader does not get \nthanked enough. He is the captain of our Senate, as the majority leader \nwas under Howard Baker and Bob Dole and Bill Frist and Tom Daschle and \nGeorge Mitchell and Robert C. Byrd. Without his willingness to make \nsure we are here to conduct that debate, it would not happen.\n  So I would be terribly remiss, at the conclusion of these remarks, if \nI did not express a special thank-you to Harry Reid of Nevada, the \nmajority leader, for making it possible and being supportive of this \nopen process we have been through. Without his willingness to allow \nthat to happen, it would not have happened. I am deeply grateful to him \nand his staff and others for making it possible for us to come to the \nmoment we are in; that is, to vote for this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nWyoming is recognized.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today, as I have \neach week since the health care bill became signed into law, to visit \nwith Members of this Chamber about experiences I have had, having \npracticed medicine in Casper, WY, since 1983. For a long time, I was an \northopedic surgeon taking care of families across the Cowboy State. I \ncome today, as I have week after week, to offer a doctor's second \nopinion about the health care law because it seems every week since \nthis bill has become law there is some new, unintended consequence, \nsome new development, some new sharing of information that the American \npeople seem to say: That is not what I want for my health care. It is \nnot what I want for my family.\n  During the debate of the health care bill, it was the Speaker of the \nHouse, Nancy Pelosi, who said: First you must pass the bill to find out \nwhat is in it. Well, as the American people continue to learn about \nwhat is in this new health care law, they continue to be disappointed \nwith so many broken promises that were made by Members on the \nDemocratic side of this body and by the President of the United States.\n  The initial goal of the health care bill, which is now law, was to \nlower the cost of care, to increase the quality of care, and increase \nthe access to care. Yet in the weeks that have gone by--and the \nPresident of the United States had a press conference last week, 90 \ndays into the process--it seems to me this law is going to be bad for \npatients, those who need medical care in this country; it is going to \nbe bad for payers, the patients who pay for their care, the businesses \nthat pay for the insurance, the taxpayers who are going to be burdened \nadditionally; and it is bad for providers, the nurses and the doctors \nwho try to take care of these patients.\n  So as I look at this, it seems to me this health care law is going to \nresult in higher costs for patients and less access and less quality. \nThat is why across the board still a majority of Americans want this \nbill repealed, want the law repealed and replaced because, basically \nand fundamentally, they do not believe this was a law that was passed \nfor them. They believe it was a law that was passed for somebody else. \nThey think, as a result, they are going to end up paying more and \ngetting less.\n  That is why today I come to the Senate floor to talk about an \nadditional broken promise and why the American people continue to be so \nvery skeptical about this new health care law.\n  We have heard the promises in the past by the President. He said: If \nyou like your health care plan, you will be able to keep your health \ncare plan. Period. He said: No one will take it away. Period.\n  Last week I came to the floor to talk about the fact that over half \nof the people in this country who receive health care through where \nthey work--half of them--will lose the coverage they have, and it may \nbe within the next 4 years. Those are not my statistics. That is the \nreport that came right out of the White House just a little over a week \nago.\n  So the public is skeptical. I come to you as someone who has worked \nwith preventive medicine, who has worked as the medical director of \nWyoming Health Fairs that have provided low-cost health screenings for \npeople all across the Cowboy State, where thousands of people show up \nat health fairs on weekends to learn what their blood sugar is and how \nto help get that down; to help people with diabetes, where they get to \nlearn what their cholesterol levels are and how to get that better \ncontrolled, to learn if they have thyroid problems and do screenings \nfor cancer as well.\n\n  So people all across this country are concerned with their care and \nthe quality of their care and the cost of their care.\n  The President has made a number of promises, and there is another one \nhe made that I wish to talk about today, and that is a promise the \nPresident made to small businesses. On May 7, President Obama, on his \nmonthly job numbers, said:\n\n       Four million small businesses recently received a postcard \n     in their mailbox telling them that they are eligible for a \n     health care tax cut this year.\n\n  That is what the President said. He said:\n\n       Four million small businesses recently received a postcard \n     in their mailbox telling them that they are eligible for a \n     health care tax cut this year.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       It's worth perhaps tens of thousands of dollars to each of \n     these companies.\n\n  Well, on face value, that sounds pretty good. Small business owners \nall across the country would welcome that sort of help. Yet I wish to \nbring to the floor today an article written by one small business \nowner, Charles Arp. The title of his column is ``ObamaCare's Broken \nPromise: One Company's Experience.''\n  I talked with Mr. Arp yesterday by phone. He is in Illinois. He said \nthis is absolutely what has happened to his business, and he knows I am \ngoing to be sharing it on the floor of the Senate today, because he has \nconcerns. He got that postcard. He was at first encouraged by the \nPresident's words, the President's promise, but, again, it is another \nbroken promise to the American people. This is a letter dated June 18 \nof this year. He says:\n\n       A few months after the passage of President Obama's health \n     care overhaul, a postcard arrived which led me to believe \n     there may be a benefit coming to my small firm. The mailing \n     from the Treasury Department touted a generous 35 percent tax \n     credit to firms with less than 25 full-time employees \n     averaging less than $50,000 per year in wages, a category \n     which includes my company. In fact, I thought we were right \n     in the sweet\n\n[[Page S5662]]\n\n     spot, with 17 full-time employees averaging slightly more \n     than $42,000 per year.\n\n  Well, small business needs relief. He goes on to explain about his \ncompany:\n\n       I manage Pinney Printing Company in Sterling, Illinois. I \n     am the president of the firm which our family has owned for \n     100 years. Health care expenses are a major obstacle to \n     Pinney's long-term prosperity. Each year in May, our policy \n     renews and we are faced with double-digit premium increases--\n     20 to 40 percent in recent years.\n       Some of the increase is absorbed by the company, and some \n     gets passed on to the employees through higher premiums, \n     deductibles, and copays. We have experimented with self-\n     funding and high-deductible health plans. Last year we were \n     forced to downgrade to an HMO plan.\n       We are nearing the end of our rope, so I was hopeful to \n     learn there could be some benefit for us in the new law.\n\n  And what small business owner wouldn't?\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Postcard in hand, I did a quick calculation and figured our \n     tax credit should be about $28,000. That is 35 percent of the \n     $80,000 we expect to spend this year on employee health care \n     premiums. I phoned our health insurance broker and inquired \n     whether anything special had to be done, not wanting to be \n     excluded by some technicality. He reported there was no \n     special requirement--more good news.\n\n  Aha, the next section: ``Barrier to Tax Credit.'' He said:\n\n       But there was a problem. A few weeks later I received an e-\n     mail with a link to the National Federation of Independent \n     Business's online calculator. This is a calculator designed \n     to help firms determine their qualifications for the tax \n     credit. I plugged in our numbers, and pressed ``update'' to \n     yield a calculation of . . . zero-zip, nada!\n       Double-checking, I tried again and again, finally concluded \n     that the 35 percent tax credit will be available only to \n     firms with ten or fewer employees averaging $25,000 or less \n     per year. Increasing either factor--either the number of \n     employees or the average salary--greatly diminishes the \n     magnitude of the tax credit. Increasing both factors yields a \n     parabolic reduction in the result.\n       Being in the graphic arts industry, I decided to create a \n     chart diagramming the limits of this ``generous'' tax break.\n\n  I have the chart here.\n  He goes on:\n\n       Not one to give up easily, I continued my pursuit--\n\n  because he had the postcard, of course.\n  He said:\n\n       Surely, there was some benefit in this for me, after years \n     and years of paying the toll for big-government programs and \n     receiving nothing.\n       The vague language on the postcard instructed readers to \n     learn more at www.irs.gov. There it said to exclude owners, \n     those having a stake of 5 percent or more, from all the input \n     values. I eagerly entered new numbers--subtracting myself, my \n     annual premium, and my salary. This brought our head count \n     down to 16 employees and dropped the average salary to \n     $40,000.\n       I entered the numbers, and the NFIB calculator displayed \n     the same result--another big goose egg.\n\n  He goes on:\n\n       Talk about unintended consequences! My firm would have to \n     reduce its workforce and cut employee wages to benefit from \n     this newly enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act. Is this what the objective should be?\n       I would never consider taking such an action. Most of the \n     employees have worked at Pinney for twenty years or more. It \n     did get me thinking, though: Maybe we could divide Pinney \n     Printing Company into two smaller firms. While I'm no expert \n     at gaming the government, like some people, it's certainly a \n     possibility many will consider.\n       I feel foolish now, after getting my hopes up for a \n     government solution to our problem. Our firm is running out \n     of affordable options.\n       It is my belief that health insurance should be decoupled \n     from employment and bought by individuals and families in the \n     same way automobile insurance is purchased. It is my fear \n     that ObamaCare is a step in the wrong direction and matters \n     will get worse, not better, for Pinney Printing Company and \n     others like us.\n\n  So there you have it. It is a heartfelt letter written by someone who \ngot the postcard from the IRS, from the President, listened to the \nPresident's statement that said you will be eligible, but what he found \nout, as did many small business owners all around the country who \nreceived this postcard, is that it doesn't apply to them, and if they \nwant to make it apply to them, what they are going to need to do is \nactually fire employees and lower the wages of the other employees. It \nmakes no sense at all, and that is why I talked to Mr. Arp yesterday, \nthe owner of the company, who said he found this deceiving.\n  So that is why I come week after week to the Senate floor to say it \nis time to repeal this legislation and replace it with legislation that \ndelivers more personal responsibility, puts patients in charge; a \npatient-centered health care plan that allows Americans to buy \ninsurance across State lines; one that gives individuals the same tax \nrelief as the big companies when they buy their own personal health \ninsurance; one that provides individual incentives like the people who \nattend the Wyoming health fairs--people who take responsibility for \ntheir health and who try to find and detect problems early to get down \nthe cost of care. We need to replace it with something that deals with \nlawsuit abuse and the expense of unnecessary tests due to doctors \npracticing defensive medicine. We need one that allows small businesses \nto join together to find less expensive insurance to their employees.\n  These are the things I will continue to work on. These are the things \nI will continue to come to the Senate floor and share with the Members \nof this body and the American public. Today, that is why I offer this \nsecond opinion, and another reason to repeal and replace this health \ncare law.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to talk about the extension of \nunemployment benefits in the larger context of our national debt.\n  Allow me the opportunity to throw out a few numbers which I then will \nexplain in a few minutes: $30 billion, $200 billion, $13 trillion, \n$114,000, and 60 percent of GDP. To many Americans, these numbers are \njust that--numbers with no real meaning to them. Unfortunately, the \nsame can be said for many here in the Senate as well. These are just \nsimple numbers without consequence.\n  Nothing can be further from the truth. These five numbers are markers \nalong the road to fiscal catastrophe that we are heading down at full \nspeed. These five numbers together are symbols of the great threat to \nthe stability of our country, both today and in the future.\n  So the $30 billion number. Fourteen percent of Nevadans are \nunemployed at this point. People are hurting across my State. We lead \nthe country in unemployment. Well, a lot has been said on the issue of \nextending unemployment benefits, and while this issue has become one of \npolitical fodder and partisanship, the facts on this issue have been \nleft out in favor of high-strung rhetoric and political opportunity.\n  Let me take a moment to explain to my constituents the real debate on \nthis issue. I, along with my Republican colleagues, believe that \nextending these benefits for the unemployed should be a top priority \nhere in the Senate. I think both sides of the aisle agree on that. I \nknow we could pay to extend these benefits now by cutting spending in \nother areas and redirecting some stimulus funds which have had little \nimpact on the economy in my State and across the country.\n  Despite what some of my other colleagues may say here on the floor, \nthere is no debate on extending the benefits for those who have fallen \nvictim to OUR downturned economy. The debate on this issue actually \nlies with the fact that those on the other side of the aisle want to \ntake the easy way out, and they want to avoid paying for this important \nlegislation because it is tough to make cuts. Instead, we are going to \nadd another $30 billion on to our record-breaking national debt. I know \nthat $30 billion is just another number to those on the other side of \nthe aisle, but it is one that could easily be paid for now by adhering \nto their own policy of pay-go. Each time the Senate has proceeded to \nvote on extending unemployment benefits, Members in this body have had \ntwo options: One, the Democratic option of extending these benefits and \nputting the debt--adding the debt on to our children and our \ngrandchildren. On the other side, they have had the Republican option \nof not only extending these vital unemployment benefits but also paying \nfor them at the same time by reducing spending in other areas. The \nother side of the aisle has voted against these commonsense proposals \neach time--six times, to be exact.\n  Let me make that more clear. Democrats have voted against paying for \nthe unemployment extension six times. Unfortunately, this isn't the \nfirst time\n\n[[Page S5663]]\n\nthose on the other side of the aisle have gone against their own pay-go \npolicy, but it is the first time they have hurt thousands of Americans \nin doing so.\n  I mentioned the number of $200 billion earlier. This is the number \nthat represents the amount of spending that has violated the Democrats' \nown pay-as-you-go policy. Four months ago, there was a signing ceremony \ndown at the Rose Garden with the President. The Democrats decided to \nheed the warnings of many here, including myself, who said that we were \nliterally bankrupting the future of our country with the amount of \nnational debt we were passing down to our children and our \ngrandchildren. So they came up with a policy that would mandate paying \nfor spending proposals now rather than later. However, there were a few \ncaveats to this new fiscal responsibility proposal, one of which \nallowed for emergency funding to be exempt. What we have witnessed in \nthe last 4 months has truly been a genius way of skirting this pay-as-\nyou-go policy. They have deemed a grotesque amount of domestic spending \nas ``emergency spending'' when, in fact, it is not an emergency.\n  They have done this most recently with unemployment benefits. It is \nhard to argue that funding that we knew would expire to be an \nemergency, but they have tried to do so anyway. The real sticking point \nhere is that if we are to deem every spending measure that comes to the \nfloor of this body as an emergency, then we are only speeding up our \npath to fiscal ruin, ensuring that our record-breaking national debt \ncontinues to be just that--record breaking.\n  Another number: $13 trillion. That is our national debt today that we \nhave reached. It is a new milestone. But it is not one that I think \nmany are celebrating. Our national debt broke into a new stratosphere \nwhen it crossed the $13 trillion threshold--truly an astounding number. \nBut this gets much worse over the next 10 years under the President's \nown budget. The debt that will be added by 2019 will be three times the \namount that was rung up over the first 232 years of this country's \nhistory. So take all of the Presidents before President Obama, all the \nway through George W. Bush, and add the total debt they added to this \ncountry, and we are going to triple that in the 10 years from 2009 to \n2019.\n\n  Just like an average family, when they delay payment on a purchase \nand charge it to their credit card, they are borrowing money from the \nbank, with interest added to the amount they need to pay back. The \nUnited States, when borrowing money, is charging it on our national \ncredit card, so it is the same situation. However, our country isn't \nborrowing the money from a bank; we are borrowing it from China, \nRussia, and Saudi Arabia.\n  Each time the majority deems a spending bill as an emergency funding \nbill, we delay paying the cost for this legislation. We are adding on \nto this national credit card bill with interest we pay to China, \nRussia, Saudi Arabia, and many others. At any point, these countries \ncould decide to up our interest rate to such a level that, when we \nattempt to start paying down our debt, we are only able to pay off the \ninterest we owe on our credit card, not the actual debt. Further, \nshould our economic situation continue to decline, these countries \ncould revoke our borrowing privileges altogether. If that happens, this \nwould be catastrophic for the economy of the United States.\n  I mentioned $114,000 earlier. When President Obama first took office, \na child born in the United States was born with $85,000 of debt on his \nor her back. In a very short period of time, that child born in the \nUnited States today now has $114,000 of debt on his or her back. That \namount is going to continue to rise because of how fast we are adding \nto the national debt. Going even farther into the future, should \nPresident Obama receive a second term and our spending levels stay at a \nhigh level, as they are now, a child born in the United States will owe \n$196,000. As they are born, that is how much debt they will have--\n$196,000 for every child born in the United States.\n  I have spoken a lot over the past year about the future of our \ncountry and what this debt burden will actually mean. A new child owing \nthat much money means they won't be able to pay for college, buy a \nhouse, start a small business, raise a family, and maybe retire \nsomeday.\n  So this isn't just an abstract number; we actually owe these \ncountries the money we have borrowed from them, with interest. We have \nto pay that money back. Whether these countries demand payment 5 years \nfrom now or later, we still have to pay it back.\n  I mentioned 60 percent--60 percent of GDP. Let me remind you of this \nfinal number, what it means. It is a critical milestone on the path to \nfiscal ruin. Most of us remember the images we saw on the nightly news \nof the riots breaking out across Greece when it was revealed that the \ngovernment was beyond bankrupt and was no longer able to guarantee \nservices throughout their country.\n  Historically, our Federal debt has been around 35 percent of GDP. \nSince the Democrats have taken control of Congress, this debt has \nskyrocketed.\n  The tipping point is what Greece found when they had so much debt on \ntheir books that people realized they were going to be unable to pay it \nback. The tipping point where the world community realized that they \nshould be charging a lot more to lend Greece money was when Greece \nexceeded 60 percent of GDP. The United States passed that magic number \nthis year. Sixty percent was the tipping point for Greece. How far \nbehind them do you think we really are? The United States passed that \n60 percent part of GDP this year with the help of the health care \nbill--the $200 billion that should have been offset with pay-go, the \nstimulus bill, and last year's appropriations bills, which had large \nincreases in each one of them.\n  The country of Greece is foreshadowing the possible fate of the \nUnited States if we don't take responsibility for the fiscal mess we \nhave created. We have lived this year through instant-gratification \npolicies, and not only is the future of our country in jeopardy, so are \nthe next 10 years, the next 5 years, and this year.\n  Mr. President, $30 billion represents the amount of money the \nDemocrats want to add to our national debt to extend unemployment \nbenefits; $200 billion represents the amount of money that has been \ndeemed as emergency to get around the pay-go rules; and $13 trillion \nrepresents the recordbreaking national debt we have reached just this \nyear. The $114,000 I mentioned is the amount each child born today in \nthe United States has as debt on their back. Sixty percent of GDP is \nthe tipping point of economic collapse that puts the United States one \nstep closer to Greece. To many in this body, these are just numbers. I \nthink we all have to face the reality that these numbers represent \nmarkers on a path to fiscal ruin if we don't turn it around. We are \nheading dangerously close to fiscal catastrophe, and our country \nliterally stands at a crossroads. We have to draw a line in the sand \nand stop borrowing money for legislation when the option to pay for it \nstands only one vote away.\n  Extending unemployment benefits isn't a partisan issue, and neither \nis our country's impending fiscal crisis. The Senate needs to extend \nthese benefits by paying for them now, and we can take the first step \nand move the country in the right direction toward fiscal \nresponsibility and economic recovery.\n  Why are we not reducing unnecessary and wasteful government spending \nto pay for these unemployment extension benefits? Senator Coburn's \noffice has identified almost $4.4 billion in savings over 10 years from \nreducing unnecessary printing and publishing costs of government \ndocuments. Add up the savings from these cuts and this kind of wasteful \nspending, and it could pay for unemployment extension for a short time.\n  How about redirecting some of the unused stimulus funds? The stimulus \nbill was supposed to be an immediate stimulus. Some of the money has \nstill not been paid out or obligated. How about, instead of just adding \nto the debt, we take that money and pay for and offset spending for the \nunemployment benefits?\n  I don't understand the absolute refusal by the other side to extend \nunemployment benefits in a fiscally responsible way. For example, the \nsmall business lending bill, which the Senate is set to consider, \ncontains a number of offsets for improving tax collections\n\n[[Page S5664]]\n\nand changing the tax rules on retirement accounts. The so-called \nMedicare doc fix was recently signed into law by the President. This \nwas completely offset by changes in Medicare billing and antifraud \nprovisions and changes in pension rules.\n  I don't necessarily agree with some of the offsets the other side of \nthe aisle has used, but the point is that the debate on the floor \nregarding paying for any piece of legislation should not rest with \nwhether we pay for new legislation but how we should pay for it. This \nis a debate we owe to the American people, our future generations, for \nthe continued prosperity of our great Nation.\n  We will soon be voting on a bill that will extend unemployment \ninsurance benefits. The other side of the aisle will have one that \nextends those unemployment benefits, but it will just be adding to the \nnational debt. The Republican side will be offering an alternative that \nwill be completely offset. I hope this Chamber finally gets its fiscal \nhouse in order and extends those very important unemployment benefits \nthat need to be given to folks who are struggling in America, but let's \ndo it in a fiscally responsible way.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Webb are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                           Post 9/11 GI BILL\n\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, today marks the 1-year anniversary of the \nimplementation of the post-9/11 GI bill, landmark legislation I was \nprivileged to introduce on my first day in office. The idea was to \nprovide those who have served since 9/11 with the most comprehensive \neducational benefits since World War II. We did that. We began with a \nsimple concept even before I decided to run for the Senate, and that \nwas, if we keep calling these people the ``next greatest generation,'' \nwe should, as a Nation, express our appreciation in a proper way--by \ngiving them the same types of educational benefits those who came back \nfrom World War II received: pay their tuition, buy their books, and \ngive them a monthly stipend. It was a formula that worked magnificently \nfor those who served during World War II, where 7.8 million of those \nveterans, because of the GI bill, were able to have a first-class \nfuture and make an imprint on the future of our country.\n  We worked very hard in my office, with a lot of staff, pushing this \nlegislation. We eventually achieved the key cosponsorship of three \nother Senators, including Senators John Warner, my former senior \nSenator, a Republican from Virginia; Chuck Hagel, of Nebraska, now \ndeparted, another Republican; and Frank Lautenberg, of New Jersey, a \nfellow Democrat. So we approached this in a way that we were trying to \nshow a balance. We had two World War II veterans, two Vietnam veterans, \ntwo Republicans and two Democrats. We wanted to strip the politics out \nof the issue.\n  Along with our colleagues on this side and also in the House and the \ncooperation of the leading veterans service groups and the higher \neducation community and, quite frankly, despite the continued \nopposition of the previous administration, which for some reason \nopposed this legislation all the way to the day before they signed it, \nwe were able to get this bill through.\n  I am so proud of the fact of having accomplished that goal 2 years \nago. The bill was signed into law 1 year ago today. This bill went into \neffect for those who have served this Nation so honorably and so well \nsince 9/11. I can report to this body that as of today, in this first \nyear of implementation alone, more than 550,000 veterans have applied \nto receive this benefit, and more than 267,000 veterans are now \nattending classes using the post-9/11 GI bill. That is more than a \nquarter of a million young men and women who otherwise might not have \nhad the opportunity for a truly first-class future.\n\n  As my fellow Senators know, I am someone who grew up in the military. \nI was privileged to serve as an officer in the U.S. Marine Corps. I am \nvery proud of my son who served as a marine in Iraq and my son-in-law \nwho also served as a marine in Iraq and Afghanistan and continues to \nserve, and so many of my friends and compatriots over the years. I \nunderstand what it means to be a proper steward in this body toward \nthose who have given this type of service. That is our duty, and this \nGI bill shows a sense of responsibility and the desire of the \nleadership of this country to see those who serve be able to move \nforward in their lives after their service and continue to provide \ngreat contributions to our country.\n  When I ran for office--also I should point out--I spoke about the \nneed to reclaim economic fairness in this country, particularly in \ntimes as we see right now where our economic health is in danger. The \nhealth of our society overall is measured by how working people are \nable to make it through different barriers and achieve alongside people \nwho have had greater advantages. This bill today does that, just as it \ndid after World War II.\n  We should remember, as we look at the implementation of this GI bill, \nwhat it did for those who served in World War II, very few of whom ever \nthought they would be able to have a college education once they went \ninto the military during those dark and troubled times.\n  For every dollar through taxes that was put into that World War II GI \nbill, our country received $7 in tax remunerations because those people \nwere able to go forward and have a truly first-class future. This is \nwhat we are doing now.\n  We have never erred as a country when we have made sustained \ninvestments in higher education for our people, particularly when it \ncomes to veterans. This is not simply an advantage for this country, it \nis an obligation we have.\n  I want to, on this day, remember the contributions of other people in \nthis body and in the House of Representatives in coming together to \npass this legislation. I thank the American Legion, the Veterans of \nForeign Wars, the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, the \nMilitary Officers Association of America, the American Council on \nEducation, the National Association of Independent Colleges and \nUniversities, and many others, including nearly 60 Senators and more \nthan 300 Members of the House who signed on as cosponsors to this \nlandmark effort.\n  We can all take pride today in saying we have been able to provide a \nproper investment in the future of those since 9/11 who have given so \nmuch to this country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Reed are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. REED. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Landrieu are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I would like to talk about the \nunderlying bill that we are actually on today, which is the extenders \npackage.\n  The Democrats negotiated in very good faith with the Republican Party \nto try to figure out a way to get tax credits, tax cuts to businesses \nthat we all need to make sure continue in terms of research and \ndevelopment. These are credits they have relied on to keep not only \ntheir businesses open but keep them hiring. There is a long list. They \nhave been well explained on the floor. They are all very popular with \nboth sides of the aisle. They have been negotiated over and over.\n  The Democrats have, in good faith, argued or debated with the \nRepublicans that we need to get these extended for the purpose of \nstimulating our economic growth. But we have said there is one that we \nare not going to pay for because, A, we don't have to pay for it; and, \nB, because it is an emergency. So everything in the extenders package \nis paid for. Every single item is paid for. Although some people don't \nlike the pay-fors, every single item to extend a tax credit--not new \nspending on the part of the Federal Government through bureaucracy but \ntax credits--is paid for except for the unemployment benefits because \nit is an emergency.\n  With 15 million people out of work, it is an emergency. For anyone on \nthat side to come to the floor and say Democrats are big spenders and \nwe can't pay for anything and we don't know how to run the government, \nwe\n\n[[Page S5665]]\n\nhave put a great package together. But there is one thing that is not \npaid for, and that is unemployment because it is an emergency. That is \nwhat this debate is about, whether they are going to vote for it. If \nthey don't want to vote for it, it is completely at their feet that \npeople in America today, who have no benefits, will not get them for \nthe Fourth of July. They will not get them as we celebrate the birthday \nof our country. If they are not going to get them, it will be because \nthe Republican Party decided that we, as a Congress, are going to have \nto find a way to pay for unemployment benefits, when they never paid \nfor even 1 year of any war they helped lead us into when their party \nwas in charge.\n  So I hope the leadership over here holds the line. We are going to \npass the extenders package the way it was presented. They can continue \nto vote no on it. That is their choice. But everything in this bill--\nmany things very important to the State of Louisiana, such as flood \ninsurance--is paid for and is now being held up; for example, the \nplaced-in-service date which keeps four or five of our major housing \nprojects from being built. When I say housing, I mean neighborhoods, \nreally, being rebuilt. That is being held up because this side is \ntrying to make an issue of finding a way to pay for unemployment \nbenefits when it is clearly an emergency, clearly qualifies as an \nemergency, and in the past was always clarified that way. That is what \npart of this argument is about.\n  As one of the managers of the small business bill, which we are \nmoving to, I am very hopeful and will make sure that the extenders \ndebate stays separate from the small business debate. Now that the \nextenders bill has been set aside, we have another bill we believe we \ncan move forward with more bipartisan support for, and I want to thank \nthe Republican Senators who helped to move this bill to the floor: \nSenators Grassley, Voinovich, Snowe, Collins, LeMieux, Lugar, Bond, and \nBrown of Massachusetts. These eight Senators have negotiated in \nextremely good faith with both the Finance Committee and the Small \nBusiness Committee to bring a package to the floor that will actually \nhelp create, we hope, millions of jobs in our country.\n  I want to make one editorial comment before I speak about the small \nbusinesses, and as a Senator from Louisiana, I feel compelled to do so.\n  I have helped to manage and craft, along with my committee members--\nand I am very proud of the small business piece of this bill. There are \nthree pieces. There is the finance piece, there is a small business \npackage, and then there is a treasury piece. I will discuss all of them \nbriefly in just a moment.\n  We have worked hard over this year trying to come up with some things \nthat the government could do that wouldn't cost that much money but \ncould spur growth in small business. As the Presiding Officer knows, it \nis not the big businesses that are creating jobs. They are still laying \noff people or are putting in efficiencies, which means holding the \nline. Even as they get more contracts, they are not hiring because it \nis not what big business does. They have enough cushion to hold what \nthey have, but small businesses are affected immediately by \ncontractions and expansions. They can't afford to hold three or four \npeople on their payroll without a contract, so they let them go. But \nthe minute they get a new contract, they will hire them back. They are \nimmediately tied to the daily, weekly, and monthly jolts in this \neconomy.\n  That is why we see that 65 percent of all new jobs created since 1993 \nhave been by small business. When we want to look out from 2009 to the \nyear we are in, 2010, and to 2011 and 2012, which the country is \ndepending on us to do, we should focus our attention where the jobs can \nbe created. Mr. President, that is in small business. So that is what \nwe are here this week and next week to do, and these eight Senators \nhave said yes, basically, to small business in America. The package \nisn't going to be what all ten of these Senators would write if they \ncould write it themselves, but they understand this is a good package. \nIt is a worthy package to pass--the small business, the finance, and \nthe treasury package--to get small business moving again.\n  I feel compelled to comment, before explaining some of the pieces of \nthis bill, that it is concerning to me that while we are on the Senate \nfloor talking about a small business package, back home in Louisiana \nand in Mississippi, Alabama, and Texas, because of events almost beyond \nthe control of any of us here, we are facing a real economic challenge \nwith the oilspill in the gulf and the subsequent moratorium that was \nlaid down by the administration on deepwater drilling. I have to say \nright now there are, in fact, about 50,000 to 60,000 jobs immediately \nat risk while that issue is being worked out. So while I am here on the \nSenate floor to help create millions of new jobs--and I believe this \nbill will do that--we also want to be mindful of not losing the jobs we \nhave in trying to come up with some very quick, appropriate responses \nto the BP spill--the Deepwater Horizon spill--and the call for safety \nin the gulf. We need to be getting our people back to work.\n  I spent all morning in the Energy Committee on that subject, and I am \nproud to be leading and helping with some suggestions in that regard. \nBut I have to say I want all the Members of Congress, both Democrats \nand Republicans, to understand there is an economic calamity brewing in \nthe gulf that needs our immediate attention. We can do more than one \nthing at a time here, so we are going to continue to move forward on \nthe small business bill because small business in Louisiana will be \nhelped, as well as those in Mississippi, Alabama, Florida, Texas, and \nsmall businesses all over this country.\n\n  There are a couple of important components in this overall bill. \nAgain, I thank the members of my committee who voted these items out 17 \nto 1 and 18 to 0. Senator Snowe, the ranking member, did a magnificent \njob of working with the Republicans on our committee. We had many \nhearings and several markups. In the underlying bill, one of the most \nimportant provisions is the Small Business Jobs Creation Access to \nCapital Act. It increases 7(a) loans from $2 million to $5 million, 504 \nloans from $1.5 million to $5 million, and microloans from $35,000 to \n$50,000. If I had my way, I would like to see that go up to $100,000. \nWhy? Because small businesses need access to capital. They must have \naccess to grow.\n  If we want small businesses to be able to grow, they have to be able \nto expand by borrowing more money at relatively low interest rates on \nfavorable terms, and then they can start hiring people to get the jobs \nnecessary to, A, end the recession; and, B, as Senator Stabenow has \nsaid so beautifully all week, to start paying the deficit down.\n  What the Republican Party doesn't understand is that one way to pay \nthe deficit down--not the only way but one way to chip away at it--is \nto get more people working so they can pay the taxes to the local, \nState, and Federal Government and we can then take that tax money and \napply it to deficit reduction. Yes, we have to cut spending. Yes, we \nhave to stop giving out tax cuts we cannot afford. They never want to \ndo the tax cut piece, and they do not do the cutting piece well either \nmost of the time. But what they need to understand is that creating \njobs, both private sector and public sector jobs, where it is \nappropriate, generates taxes to the local, State, and Federal \ngovernments. Then we can begin chipping away at the deficit--a deficit \nthey left, by the way.\n  When the last administration came in--when President Bush came into \noffice--he was handed a surplus. We handed him a surplus of $5.1 \ntrillion and said: Mr. President, here is a world at peace and here is \n$5.1 trillion in surplus; the economy is creating jobs.\n  When he left office 8 years later, he handed the next President a \ndeficit twice that big, with Wall Street in collapse, two wars that \nhadn't been paid for, and a mess here at home--and they want to ask why \nwe haven't fixed all that in a year and a half? It is quite humorous to \nme. I know President Obama is smart and good--though I don't agree with \nhim on everything--but I don't think any human being could fix the mess \nthey left in just a year and a half.\n  We have been plodding along trying to fix different pieces of it, but \nit hasn't been pretty. All of it isn't working, but we are trying. Most \nof it is working. That is what the American people expect of us. They \ndo not expect\n\n[[Page S5666]]\n\nus to get it 100 percent right every day, but they do expect us to move \nforward; to say, yes, we will try not to say no and not to lecture \nDemocrats about deficits they created.\n  Having gotten that off my chest, I want to say here we are in our \nsmall business package. I am very proud that eight of these Republican \nSenators joined us to get on the discussion on the small business bill. \nThis is going to do a lot of good for a lot of people in many places, \nlet me say, not just New York and not just Wall Street. This is a Main \nStreet bill. This is about creating jobs in little towns in Oregon as \nwell as little towns in Louisiana, small towns in Washington State and \nMaine. That is what this is about.\n  The second piece is the export piece. This is a very exciting chart \nto me. I am maybe not as good as Kent Conrad is with charts, Senator \nConrad, but I like this one very much. This chart shows the potential \nof small business in America. Just think about this. We have so many, \nmillions and millions of small businesses, but less than 1 percent of \nthem today are exporting. This is tragic, if you think about it. If we \ncan get a few percentage points, up to 3 percent, 4 percent, 5 percent \nof small businesses in America exporting their products, using the \nInternet, using favorable tax provisions that will help--that are in \nthis underlying bill--using new support and technological support from \nthe Small Business Administration, from volunteer organizations such as \nSCORE, university-based technical support programs that can go to our \nsmall businesses and say: You sold 50,000 pairs of shoes last year but \nyou sold them all down the road. We can help you sell them to China or \nsell them to India. Think about the possibility of that. And it is \nreal.\n  That is what this bill does. Senator Snowe has done a tremendous \namount of work. I am extremely proud of her work on the export portion \nof this bill. Again, large businesses, percent of firms that do not \nexport, 58 percent. This number could be increased. But the exciting \nopportunity is small business. But sometimes they are intimidated, as \nyou can imagine. They don't know how to negotiate with foreign \ngovernments. Some of the things we are going to do in this bill will \nhelp them move that number up and they are going to be able to grow.\n  Third, the contracting piece. I know some people on both sides of the \naisle believe government is too big. Sometimes I agree with that and \nthink it is too. We have to shape it, make sure it is efficient and \neffective and muscular, not flabby and big but bold and muscular, so it \ncan do things it needs to do that the private sector can't do. But one \nof the things all governments do is spend a lot of money, and it is not \njust money to hire their own employees, it is spending money for the \nprivate sector. We contract out a lot of our work. When the Government \nhas a job to do, we do not always do it with government employees; we \ncontract it out. I do not have the exact numbers in front of me but it \nis billions and billions of dollars. We are the largest--if you put us \nin terms of a corporation--the largest corporation, potentially, maybe \nin the world. So the contracting provision we have in this bill says: \nOK, Federal Government, if you were a business, if you could contract \nwith more small businesses, meet your small business contracting goals, \nthen we could create a lot of jobs in America because it is, again, the \nsmall businesses that are creating these jobs.\n  If you give a big company a government contract, they might absorb it \ninto their infrastructure. They are so big, they have millions of \nemployees, or hundreds of thousands. But you give a contract to a small \nbusiness, you know what happens? They might have five employees. If \nthey get a very nice size contract from the government, they will hire \n10 people to implement that contract and they will do it right away. So \nwe have some contracting provisions in this bill that I am, again, very \nproud of. They have broad bipartisan support.\n  In addition, in this bill, which is paid for, is an additional $50 \nmillion for the Small Business Community Partnership Relief Act which \ngives $50 million in addition to women business centers, microloan \nintermediaries. It weighs or reduces the non-Federal share of funding \nso that for 1 year States all over this country can start enhancing and \nimproving their Women Business Owners' Center, their Minority Business \nCenters, the centers that are in universities all over the country. I \nam sorry I do not have a map to show what the Secretary or \nAdministrator of the SBA fondly calls our bone structure, because it is \na great structure in the country. It is not just isolated little \noffices of the SBA.\n  If you can imagine, so many of our universities have small business \ndevelopment centers and SCORE chapters, which is retired business \nexecutives, senior executives who volunteer to help younger businesses. \nThere are hundreds of these chapters around the country.\n  If you could imagine a map of the United States, you could see, if I \ncould show where these centers are, there are centers at universities \nand SCORE chapters and community banks, almost within a few miles of \nany citizen. Any citizen could find a SCORE chapter or a university or \na local bank. This bill is sending funding and help to all of those \nplaces. Again, not just on K Street here. There are lots of jobs on K \nStreet. In fact, there are so many buildings going up on K Street, I am \namazed how many. It never stops. There are lots of buildings going up, \nmaybe, on Wall Street--lots of office space. But where I represent, \nthere are empty spaces. There are lots of vacancy signs.\n  This bill is trying to push out money, not to the Federal Government \nbut to our universities, to our private sector partners to help them \ntweak--help support small businesses to help small businesses grow. I \nam very proud of that piece. The job impact analysis was something \nSenator Snowe wanted. We worked with her. On everything we do, this is \ngoing to be a way to say, in this bill, how many jobs will actually be \ncreated, to record them so we can be accountable to the American people \nfor that. I am happy she put that in the bill.\n  Going back to the 7(a) loan program, this is the major loan program \nof the SBA. As you can see, it has been sort of a happy and sad \nsituation here over the last couple of years since 2008.\n  When Congress acts and puts money in this program, loans to small \nbusiness go way up. When we dilly-dally and cannot agree and the \nprogram expires, loans go way down. When we get our act together again, \nit goes up. I wish this chart did not look like this. I wish it looked \nstraight up, like this. Right now it is down beneath where it was \nbefore the stimulus act was passed. It has fallen below the ARRA \naverage of $172 million. It is down to $154 million.\n  We need to get it back up. When we initially announced that the Small \nBusiness Administration was expanding the amount you could borrow, \nreducing the fees so you did not have to pay as much, and giving you a \n95-percent guarantee rate, those loans are good loans. Small businesses \nneed them, particularly because credit card companies are not lending \nthe way they used to or charging you too much for the money they do \ngive you. Credit lines are drying up. This is the core of the small \nbusiness bill. I hope we will see this number go straight up.\n  Banks all over our country want this program. Many of them--not every \nbank participates, but I would say about 1,000 or 1,200 out of the \n5,000 banks participate in this program, and they are very excited \nabout getting this funding back in place so they can begin to loan \nmoney again to small business.\n  There are many other things we can do and should do. One of the \namendments I have filed--I wish I could have gotten this in the base \nbill, but even as the chairman of the committee you can't get \neverything you want in the base bill. So I have agreed to offer one of \nthese as an amendment.\n  I am very proud to have Senator Cochran's support, Senator Wicker's \nsupport, Senator Vitter's support. It is a bipartisan amendment. What \nit would do is provide in the small business bill interest loan relief \nfor the gulf coast outstanding disaster loans from Katrina and Wilma, \nGustav and Ike, from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, and \nTexas.\n  There are 13,207 loans. I will take a moment to try to explain it. I \nwill try to wrap up in about 5 minutes.\n  There are currently today 13,207 small business loans that were taken \nout by businesses all along the gulf\n\n[[Page S5667]]\n\ncoast. Some of these loans are to fishermen whose boats were destroyed \nand they had just bought the new boat or fixed their net from some of \nthese hurricanes. They were just getting back into the water. The water \nwas coming back, the marsh was coming back after Katrina and Rita, and \nthen all of a sudden the Horizon BP disaster happened.\n  The same people who were affected by these hurricanes and who may be \naffected by hurricanes in this season--which unfortunately promises to \nbe a very difficult one--these are the businesses that are struggling \nto pay these loans on top of the economic disaster they are \nexperiencing. So I am asking the Senate to please give some \nforgiveness--in the loan forgiveness, but give some special help to \nthis group of loans. What we are asking in the amendment is 3 years of \nan interest rate reduction; not loan forgiveness, so the taxpayers will \nbe paid back the full principal amount of all the loans these \nindividuals and businesses have made. But if we could give them a \nlittle interest relief--let me give a specific example.\n  I actually took Karen Mills, our Administrator of the SBA, to \nLouisiana on several occasions to impress upon her the seriousness of \nthis situation. I took her to see the Bergerons, who run a gas station \nin Lakeview. This entire neighborhood was destroyed, 8,000 families. \nThree of my brothers and sisters lived in this neighborhood, with four \nchildren each. They lost everything, their homes, their clothes, \neverything was completely destroyed. That was true of their 8,000 other \nneighbors. This gas station--the Bergerons came back. They operated one \nof the most successful gas stations in this neighborhood. In order for \npeople to be able to rebuild their house, because they had fled to \nhigher ground hundreds of miles away, families would drive long \ndistances after work to come and gut their homes in Lakeview and try to \nrebuild their homes. But when they went to go back, there was no gas \nstation for them to fill up their car so they could get back to where \nthey were living until they could get home.\n  So the Bergerons, like a lot of what I call the pioneer businesses--\nthe hardware stores, the gas stations--said you know, I have been here \n40 years. Mr. Bergeron is in his 70s, still very active, but he said I \nam going to go back and open my gas station. So he went to the SBA and \ngot a loan. The problem was, he did a great thing, but his business \ncame back so slowly. But without his business no one in the \nneighborhood could come back because there was no place to get \ngasoline. He is paying on his loan $1,000 a month. If this passes, his \nnote will go down to about $400 a month. It will give him a little bit \nof relief because right now in his same neighborhood he has a lot of \npeople who work in the fishery industry or the seafood industry or the \noil and gas industry, so some of his customers cannot come and get as \nmuch gas as they want to because they are being affected now by this \nDeepwater Horizon.\n  I am begging the Members of the Senate to please help this particular \ngroup. I wish we could afford to do for everyone in America but not \neverybody in America right now is on the gulf coast. But these 13,207 \npeople are and we need to give them a little breathing room. That is \none of my amendments.\n  I am going to yield the floor after I make a comment on a nominee. \nBut that is one of the amendments I am going to ask the Senate, when we \nget an opportunity to offer amendments, to please give us a chance to \nhelp these small businesses. It is a temporary relief for them, but I \nthink it is something they deserve and will help this region that has \nnow been hit again.\n\n\n                     Nomination of Winslow Sargeant\n\n  Mr. President, at this time I want to talk for a minute about Winslow \nSargeant.\n  He is a gentleman who has been recommended by the President to serve \nat the SBA, in the advocacy position at the SBA. He comes highly \nregarded and highly recommended. He has a Ph.D. from the University of \nWisconsin in Madison in electrical engineering and a background as a \nvery successful small business owner. He is managing director of \nVenture Investors, a Midwest venture capital country with a \nconcentration in starting up health care technology companies.\n  Dr. Sargeant has a great deal of support from a wide variety of \nindividuals and businesses that I will submit for the Record.\n  With more than 80 percent of job losses coming from small firms, I \nbelieve this is someone who should be in the Office of Advocacy. For \nsome reason, he is being held up by the other side.\n  I understand there are nominations being held up on both sides of the \naisle, but I wanted to ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session to consider--I am going to wait and ask for unanimous \nconsent. I am not going to wait long, but I will continue talking for a \nfew minutes. I will wait for a few minutes, but at some point I am \ngoing to ask for unanimous consent that he be moved ahead because here \nwe are on a small business bill, and here is the man whom the President \nhas nominated, who obviously is well credentialed, has tremendous \nsupport, who is being held up. We do not really understand why he is \nbeing held up, so I would like to know, and in just a few minutes, I am \ngoing to ask for him to go by unanimous consent.\n  In the meantime, I will speak about one other potential amendment to \nthe underlying bill. This amendment is coming from Senator Boxer, and I \nam so excited that she came up with this idea and this amendment. I \nthink it has a lot of potential, and I think many Members might support \nit.\n  Senator Boxer called to my attention that there are many small \nbusinesses that operate out of their homes, and if you think about it, \nthere are many people who operate their business out of their homes but \nparticularly women who are trying to raise children, they are still the \nprimary caregiver--not the only caregiver, but in most homes the women \nare trying to balance being a good wife and a good mother and also \ncontributing to the bottom line of their family income. So a lot of \nthem might be running small businesses out of their homes.\n  Well, it has come to our attention that in order to take the tax \ndeduction that is rightfully there for anyone, man or woman, who works \nout of their home--it has come to my attention through Senator Boxer \nthat it is not really very easy to take that deduction. In fact, it is \nso complicated, to my knowledge, that many people don't take it. Think \nabout that.\n  If we are really supportive of family values, of people being \nflexible; if we don't like spending a lot of gasoline traveling back \nand forth to work and we are kind of trying to encourage people to stay \nat home and work if they can--many women who are very well credentialed \nbecause the government spent a lot of money on our universities getting \nthem the degrees they need, are home raising three, four, five kids, \nand they can't travel a long time to work, so they set up a business in \ntheir home. Senator Boxer's amendment would help them by simplifying \nthis deduction.\n  I am hoping Senator Boxer will come at some time to the floor over \nthe next couple of days--I am sure she will--and explain the details of \nthis, but I think it would be an excellent provision to add to the \nsmall business bill because again, remember, this underlying bill is \ncutting taxes for small businesses, specifically cutting taxes for \nsmall businesses; it is supporting the small business programs to \ncreate more of them, both in our country and their export potential; \nand then it is giving--the third leg of the stool--$30 billion to banks \nin America, voluntarily. It is not TARP-like, nothing about TARP; it is \n$30 billion to small banks in Oregon, Louisiana, and other places to be \nable to then take that money and lend it to small businesses. That is \nthe essence of this bill.\n  I am very hopeful we can add a couple of amendments to an already \nvery good small business package. So I am hoping Senator Boxer will \ncome at some point and explain this amendment.\n  My colleagues are here to speak, I guess, on either the extenders \npackage or the small business package. I see the Senator from Ohio, who \nhas been very supportive of small business. Of course, Ohio is one of \nthe States that has been hardest hit, and Michigan has been very hard \nhit in the underlying economy. So I am very happy to have, hopefully, \ntheir support on the underlying bill.\n\n[[Page S5668]]\n\n  But one more comment about the moratorium. And I started off by \nsaying I am proud to be the chair of the Small Business Committee \nadvocating for small businesses in the country. I think the small \nbusiness package, the finance and treasury package that we have on the \nfloor will deliver to the American people how to, in a very fiscally \nresponsible way, help us create the jobs we need. But one of the \npoints--and I am going to be very brief because I see the minority \nleader here, but at the same time I want to say again that the \nmoratorium on the gulf coast--and the Senator from Kentucky will, I \nbelieve, agree with me on this point--the moratorium on the gulf coast \nis really hurting many small businesses now.\n  I know we have to get this drilling safer and it has to be very safe. \nThe people of my State want that. The people of the gulf coast want \nthat. But we hope sometime in the next few weeks to clarify or fix or \nmodify this. The Federal judge, as you know, has ruled that the \nmoratorium is lifted, because the Federal judge did not agree with the \nactions taken by this administration, nor do I. So while we are \ndebating a small business bill, I am very hopeful that as soon as this \nsmall business package can pass, we can get on to getting more people \nback to work along the gulf coast who have been affected by both the \nmoratorium and this bill.\n\n\n             Unanimous consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  I ask unanimous consent for Winslow Sargeant to be Chief Counsel for \nAdvocacy, Small Business Administration; that the nomination be \nconfirmed, the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table, and any \nstatements relating to the nominee be printed in the Record; that the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and the \nSenate then resume its regular legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley.) Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Snowe, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, it is unfortunate to watch what \njust happened again in this institution. The chair of the Small \nBusiness Committee, who is serving her State, is an incredible advocate \nfor her State, is serving this country well, wants this government to \nbe able to govern. And you see one after another after another where \nthe President of the United States has dozens and dozens and dozens of \nappointees, noncontroversial. My guess is, when this nominee finally \ncomes to a vote--I don't know this for sure, but my guess is there will \nbe very few ``no'' votes. We have seen this with Federal judges, we \nhave seen it with U.S. attorneys, we have seen it with U.S. marshals, \nand we have seen it with Under Secretaries and Assistant Secretaries \nand all kinds of commission nominees.\n  We have never seen anything like this in this country where one party \nhas consistently and persistently blocked nominee after nominee after \nnominee. I mean, if your goal in government--if you come to the Senate \nand your goal is to block anything from happening, the Senate rules \nserve you pretty well. But if you want to move this country forward and \nput party aside, we would not see this kind of thing happen over and \nover.\n  So I commend Senator Landrieu for her work on the floor today, her \npassionate advocacy for small business, and her work generally in \nfighting for her State. But I was disturbed to watch what just \nhappened. If it were the only time, I guess I wouldn't be judging of it \nmuch, but it is not.\n  I come to the floor to talk about the unemployment insurance bill. I \nknow Senator Landrieu, in her State, and the Presiding Officer, Senator \nMerkley, in his State of Oregon, have people all over who have seen \ntheir unemployment run out. I just don't get it.\n  I know some of the opponents, some of the people who have voted no on \nunemployment compensation extension think it is welfare. I have heard \nsome of them say: Well, these people don't really want to work. Why \nshould we give them something for nothing?\n  Well, these are people who deserve unemployment. They have earned the \nunemployment. They deserve the unemployment insurance. They have earned \nit. Again, it is not called unemployment welfare; it is called \nunemployment insurance. You pay in when you are working; you get out \nwhen you are not. So it is a lot like car insurance and health \ninsurance. I don't want to collect on my car insurance premium. I don't \nwant to collect on it. I don't want to ever have an accident that hurts \nsomebody or damages a car. I have been in an accident like that. I \ndon't want that to happen again. I don't want to have to cash in any of \nmy health insurance. I don't want to be sick. I don't want my children \nto be sick. I don't want to be unemployed so I have to draw \nunemployment compensation. Most Americans don't want to be.\n  I just wonder about some of my friends on the other side of the aisle \nwho think about this--they really think it is welfare. I just ask my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to put themselves in another \nplace. I know virtually all of us get out enough that we meet people \nwho are unemployed occasionally, and I know we are pretty isolated here \ntoo often. But, you know, a lot of us meet people who are unemployed, \npeople who have lost their insurance. These people sometimes have lost \ntheir homes. But I think it is important that we think about what that \nmeans and try to personalize it, try to think about a husband and \nwife--one is working part time, not making much money, the other one \nlost their job, and then they lost their insurance because they can't \nafford the payment for COBRA.\n  COBRA is a bit of a cruel hoax. COBRA is the program where you can \nkeep your insurance after you lose your job, but you have to pay your \npart as the employee and then you have to pay the employer premium. And \nif you lost your job, how could you? Well, we have subsidized that. We \nhave actually under the Recovery Act, as the Presiding Officer knows in \nhis work on this bill in the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, helped people to pay that COBRA so they can keep their \ninsurance.\n  But put yourself in the place--since we can't seem to get the \nRepublicans to go along with that, either, now--put yourself in the \nplace of that family. The husband has lost his job. The wife, who was \nmaking only a little bit of money, is struggling. They lost their \ninsurance. Someone gets a little sick. They have these bills run up. \nThey are getting 2 or 3 months behind on their mortgage. They have to \nsit down with their family. They have to sit down with their teenage \nkids and say: You know dad lost his job. You know mom cannot find more \nthan part-time work. You know we do not have insurance anymore. You \nknow Jimmy got sick. Well, we are behind on our house payments. We are \ngoing to have to move. We are going to have to sell our house. We are \ngoing to get foreclosed on.\n  You have to explain to your kids that they are not going to have a \nroom to sleep in--separate rooms--anymore. They are going to have to \ngive away some of the stuff they have around the house or try to sell \nit. They are going to have to go to a new school.\n  What new school, dad?\n  Well, I don't know what school district we are going to move to.\n  I just wish my colleagues, when they cast these ``no'' votes on \nunemployment insurance and cast these ``no'' votes on the extension of \nCOBRA to help people keep health care, that they would think about what \nit means to an individual family.\n  I mean, these are all numbers. I can give you some great numbers \nhere. I can give you these numbers: The number of Americans who will \nlose their unemployment benefits: 1.3 million by the end of this week; \n1.7 million by the end of next week; 2.1 million by the end of our \ncongressional recess next week; 3.2 million by the end of July. These \nare pretty troubling numbers, but forget the numbers. I am going to \nread from some letters of people in Ohio that will explain better than \nI can what this means to individual Ohioans or individual Oregonians or \nindividual Floridians or Louisianians or Kentuckians.\n  And if you want to make it an economic argument, make it an economic \nargument. Forget about the human faces for a minute. Make it an \neconomic argument. If people are not getting their unemployment \ninsurance, it means they are not spending money in\n\n[[Page S5669]]\n\nthe community. You know what has happened when people receive \nunemployment benefits. The first 6 months following the passage of the \nRecovery Act, unemployment insurance pumped $19 billion into the local \neconomy. If we hadn't done that in this recession President Obama \ninherited a year and a half ago when we were losing 700,000 jobs a \nmonth, we would have been losing 800,000 or 900,000 because this $19 \nbillion wouldn't have been pumped into the economy--grocery stores, \ngoing in and buying clothes for the kids, getting medicine, stopping at \nthe drugstore--all of the things that keep economic activity generating \nin a community and provide jobs.\n  The first half of this year, $6 billion went in benefits to the \nStates. It would have meant layoffs of librarians and mental health \ncounselors and teachers and police officers and firefighters and people \nwho are cleaning the streets and picking up garbage. There would have \nbeen more layoffs, more unemployment, less economic activity.\n  So it is pretty clear, if you want to look at the economics of this \nand listen to one of Senator McCain's chief economic advisers who said \nthat nothing more than a dollar in unemployment has a greater \nmultiplying effect than that. That means for every dollar in \nunemployment compensation, it generates a lot of economic activity. \nThat dollar isn't pocketed. That dollar is spent by the unemployed \nworker to take care of his or her family's needs. It is the best thing \nfor the economy to pump unemployment compensation into the economy.\n\n  Yet time after time over the last several weeks Republicans have \nopposed extending unemployment benefits. Of all things to draw the line \non. I hear the arguments over and over. They say we can't keep adding \nto the national debt. I was in the House of Representatives when they \nran up the budget deficit, when George Bush and the Republicans ran up \nthe debt. In 2000, when President Clinton left the White House, we had \na budget surplus projected to be trillions of dollars in the years \nahead.\n  What happened? War with Iraq, hundreds of billions of dollars to pay \nfor the war charged to our grandchildren; tax cuts for the rich, \nhundreds of billions of dollars, charged to the grandchildren; a \ngiveaway to the drug and insurance industries in the name of Medicare \nprivatization, charged to the grandchildren. They don't mind spending \nus into deficit for two wars, for tax cuts for the rich, and for a \ngiveaway to the drug and insurance companies. But now that it is time \nto give about $300 a week to workers who have lost jobs and to help \nthem keep their insurance, they say we can't afford it. They don't want \nto run up the budget deficit. What does that say about values and about \nus as a country?\n  I don't get it. No matter how irrational or how much they want to \nplay to the crowd and say: I am standing up against big government, \nthey didn't stand up for taxpayers to pay for the wars, tax cuts for \nthe rich, and bailouts for drug companies and insurance companies. All \nof a sudden they are standing up for taxpayers when it comes to funding \nunemployment benefits and health care benefits for those workers who \nlost their jobs and lost health insurance.\n  I will close with reading four letters from people around my State. I \nget hundreds of these. I know the Senator from Oregon gets them from \nPortland and all over his State. I get them from all over my State. I \nwill start with Mark from Wood County, just south of Toledo, home of \none of the great universities in our country, Bowling Green.\n  Mark writes:\n\n       I send out on average 5 resumes a week, yet I almost never \n     hear back from employers. I have had only one interview, \n     though I didn't get the job.\n       I am not lazy. I want to work and I am trying to find work.\n       I didn't quit my job, my employer quit on me and everyone \n     else they laid off.\n       We need unemployment benefits extended, please don't turn \n     your back on us.\n\n  These are millions of people around the country. What Mark says is \nwhat most of them would say: Please don't turn your back on us.\n  Jennifer from Geauga County, southeast of Cleveland, writes:\n\n       I am a single mother of three beautiful girls. I am also an \n     experienced architect. But late last year, I was laid off \n     from a large engineering firm in Northeast Ohio.\n       I have been desperately seeking a job for the last six \n     months, but my industry has still not recovered.\n       What do I do now? I have been working 20 years in my field. \n     I am already four months behind on my mortgage.\n       Where do I even get the money to pay for it and the other \n     expenses to care for my family?\n       What do I do?\n\n  These are not people who don't want to work. I am sickened by some of \nmy colleagues who think this is welfare, who think these people really \ndon't want to work. Jennifer is a woman with three children, a \nprofessional, an architect. She has been working 20 years in her field.\n  All of these people are required to send out resumes week after week. \nThey are required to make calls and try to find jobs. They can't find \nthem because of the economy President Obama inherited a year and a half \nago--again, 700,000 jobs we were losing a month when the President took \noffice. My State was lucky enough in April to have a bigger job gain \nthan any State in the country, 37,000 jobs. But that is not nearly \nenough to make up for the hundreds of thousands of jobs lost because of \nthis economy, because of bad trade policy, because of outsourcing of \njobs, because of all that has happened with the financial crisis.\n  Jill from Franklin County writes:\n\n       I am very disappointed the Senate has not passed an \n     extension for those of us still facing unemployment.\n       I have been out of work for six months, even though I have \n     a Master's Degree.\n       I have never lived beyond my means, but without the small \n     check I get from unemployment, I will be losing my home at \n     the end of July.\n       Please find a way to pass this bill. Please help us.\n\n  I was not making it up when I said if somebody loses their job, they \nlose their insurance. Then they too often lose their home because a \nbunch of Republicans want to vote no on the extension of unemployment \nbenefits, crying: We have to cut spending.\n  I am sorry to say it over and over, but when I hear them say we can't \nafford it, when they didn't say that when it was tax cuts for the rich, \npaying for the war, or bailing out the drug companies and the insurance \ncompanies in the name of Medicare privatization--they only want to do \nit when it is unemployed workers. That is wrong.\n  The last letter I will read is from Amy from Perry County, a small \nrural county southeast of Columbus:\n\n       My husband is trying very hard to find a job. For the \n     government not to pass extensions is beyond me.\n       I am a nurse and work two jobs to help make up the \n     difference of my husband's lost wages.\n       Our hard working American citizens who helped build this \n     country are now in need of this country's help.\n       Please urge other Senators to vote this bill through.\n\n  I couldn't say it better than Jennifer and Mark and Amy and Jill. \nThey are all typical, hard-working Americans who have done the right \nthing. Some are very well educated, all are hardworking. Many have gone \nback to school to improve themselves. This is the economy they have \ninherited because of a whole bunch of bad policy decisions in the last \n10 years. They are the ones paying for it. That is just not right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n\n\n                             Gulf oilspill\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I have come to the floor today to talk \nabout the tragedy affecting my State as well as other States that \nborder the gulf. We are into this crisis now 72 days. On the worst \ndays, there is as much as 60,000 barrels of oil spewing into the gulf. \nThat is more than 4 million barrels of oil. That comes out to about 180 \nmillion gallons of oil that has gone into the Gulf of Mexico. We know \nBritish Petroleum is at fault. We know they are responsible for paying \nfor the cleanup. But that is just half of the story. The other half is \nthat the Federal Government has a responsibility in times of crises to \nstep up, to manage the crisis, to do everything possible to bring all \navailable resources to address the crisis, to keep the oil from washing \nup on our beaches in Florida, from getting into our coastal waterways \nand estuaries.\n  This is not a Republican issue. This is not a Democratic issue. This \nis an issue of doing the job those who wanted to be elected to these \npositions in the\n\n[[Page S5670]]\n\nexecutive branch now own. When you are the President, you don't get to \npick which crisis comes. You don't get to say: I don't choose to \naddress this problem or not address that one. When you are the \nPresident, your administration is responsible for trying to solve the \nproblems that happen on your watch. This oilspill has happened on this \nadministration's watch.\n  I want the President to succeed. All Americans do. But the truth is, \nthis administration is failing in keeping this oil off our shores. Why \ndo I say that? I don't say that without some reservation because it is \na serious charge. The facts speak for themselves. We have 2,000 \nskimmers in the United States. These are ships equipped to suck up oil \noff of the top of the water, bring it into the ship so it can be \nremoved from the area that has been polluted. We got this document last \nweek from the Coast Guard. Admiral Allen, with whom I met with the \nPresident weeks ago, said there were 2,000 skimmers.\n  I said to the President: Mr. President, if there are 2,000 skimmers, \nwhy aren't those skimmers in the gulf? At that time there were 24 \nskimmers off the coast of Florida. Today we believe there are about 84. \nFlorida says 84. The Feds say 130. Since this started, we couldn't get \na straight answer or one that reconciled between the State and the \nFeds. The good news is, it has gone up to 84 from 24. But it is still a \nmere fraction of what it could be.\n  We are told there are 400-some skimmers in the gulf. Around the \ncountry, there are 2,000; 1,600 or so in the continental United States.\n  Why are all those skimmers not in the gulf? This is something I have \nbeen calling for for weeks. Between Texas and South Carolina there are \n850. Why aren't they skimming up the oil? When I raised this issue with \nthe President, he and Admiral Allen said: Those skimmers need to be in \nother places in case there is an oilspill. That is like me saying that \nwe can't send a fire truck to your house that is on fire because we may \nneed it for another fire. That is not a lot of solace to you if your \nhouse is burning down, not a lot of solace to the people of the gulf \nwhen this oil is washing up onshore, ruining their lives, keeping them \nfrom working, hurting the ecosystem and the environment they love.\n  Something has happened that is good news. The day after I met with \nthe President, along with our Governor and other State and local \nofficials, on day 57 of the crisis, on day 58 Rear Admiral Watson \nissued a memo, June 16, 2010.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     From: J.A. Watson, RADM\n     FOSC BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill\n     To: NIC\n     Subj: FOSC Determination under 46 U.S.C. Sec. 55113 \n         Concerning Oil Spill Response Vessels Capable of Skimming \n         Oil\n       1. Pursuant to my authority contained in 46 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 55113, I have determined that an adequate number of oil \n     spill response vessels (OSRVs), as defined by 46 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2101(20a), documented under the laws of the United \n     States and capable of skimming oil cannot be employed in a \n     timely manner to recover the oil released from the BP \n     Deepwater Horizon spill.\n       2. Oil currently discharges into the Gulf of Mexico at \n     unprecedented levels. There are simply not enough U.S. OSRVs \n     capable of skimming oil available to keep up with the pace at \n     which oil flows from the well. Until the flow is stopped, \n     therefore, it is my opinion that domestic and foreign OSRVs \n     capable of skimming oil are needed to provide adequate and \n     timely protection to the Gulf Coast.\n       3. This determination applies only to OSRVs capable of \n     skimming. No foreign OSRV may avail itself of any privileges \n     conveyed by this determination unless its country has \n     accorded to vessels of the U.S. the same privileges.\n       4. Respectfully request that U.S. Customs and Border \n     Protection be notified of this determination.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. This is a four-bullet point paragraph document. It reads \nin part:\n\n       Pursuant to my authority, I have determined that an \n     adequate number of oil spill response vessels (OSRVs), as \n     defined by 46 U.S.C. Sec. 2101(20a), documented under the \n     laws of the United States and capable of skimming oil cannot \n     be employed in a timely manner to recover the oil released \n     from the BP Deepwater Horizon spill.\n       Oil currently discharges into the Gulf of Mexico at \n     unprecedented levels. There are simply not enough U.S. OSRVs \n     capable of skimming oil available to keep up with the pace at \n     which oil flows from the well. Until the flow is stopped, \n     therefore, it is my opinion that domestic and foreign OSRVs \n     capable of skimming oil are needed to provide adequate and \n     timely protection to the Gulf Coast.\n\n  That is the day after we raised this issue with the President. It \ncomes on day 58. It should not have taken 58 days to figure out they \ndidn't have enough equipment, but better late than never.\n  Monday of this week, the EPA and Coast Guard, on day 70, issued an \norder releasing these skimmers to come to the gulf from whatever legal \nrequirements keep them where they are, including releasing Navy \nskimmers. That is good too. Now it is day 70, but it is still progress. \nI am hoping, and what I am seeing is that these skimmers will come to \nthe gulf soon. We are tracking the skimmers. We got a list of these \n2,000. We are calling folks in different places where the skimmers are, \ndifferent ports around the Southeast and the Mid-Atlantic. We are going \nto check with them and say: Are your skimmers on the way? We need the \nhelp.\n  I was in Pensacola Monday. I have been down there four or five times \nsince the incident began. The oil on the beach is profound. It breaks \none's heart to see it. It is a splattering of oil and muck and scum on \nthe beaches. In some places I found what I would call tar rocks about \nthe size of grapefruit that have washed ashore. Who knows what is \nhappening down below the water, how far these plumes of oil go, what it \nis doing to marine life, to the turtles, to the porpoises, to the fish, \nwhat that is going to mean for the people of the gulf coast who rely \nupon fishing and the seafood industry, what it will mean for our \nhealth.\n  When you stand on the beach, you can smell the oil. The people of my \nState are heartbroken. I can see it in their faces and hear it in their \nvoices.\n  I talked to one woman who works at the pier. I asked her: Are people \ncoming to the beach.\n  She said: People are coming who don't often come. People are coming \nwho want to say goodbye, want to see the beach one last time.\n  That is like having a loved one who is in the hospital on their \ndeathbed, going to see the beach one last time.\n  We have these skimmers, these 2,000. Hopefully they are on the way. \nThat is progress. That is the domestic side of this issue.\n  The other side is foreign skimmers. We have been hearing from the \nbeginning that foreign countries have been offering assistance, \nreaching out to us the way we help the world because of the goodness of \nour hearts as Americans when the world has problems. When there is a \ntyphoon in Southeast Asia or an earthquake in Haiti or Chile, the first \ncountry there to respond because of the goodness of our people is the \nUnited States. We provide help and relief, military sometimes. Other \ncountries have also offered to help us in this, our time of need, \nsometimes for free. Sometimes those companies want to get paid. \nNonetheless, they have offered to help.\n\n  In fact, there have been 64 offers, according to the U.S. State \nDepartment's document of June 29, 2010. We have accepted 7 out of 64. \nLet me read some of these to you.\n  On June 23, Canada offered skimmers. That is under consideration. On \nMay 13, the European Maritime Safety Agency, still under consideration; \non June 22, Japan, under consideration. On April 30, Norway; some have \nbeen accepted, other offers are under consideration. On May 2, the \nRepublic of Korea offered skimmers--May 2--under consideration; on June \n23, Turkey; on June 22, Qatar; on May 10, the UAE, the United Arab \nEmirates, under consideration. Mr. President, 64 offers, 57 under \nconsideration.\n  Now, the State Department said yesterday they will accept 22 offers \nof assistance from 12 countries. Good. Good. It is day 72. Why wasn't \nit done sooner? I have come to the floor before and shown a picture of \na ship called the Swan that was offered on May 6 from a Dutch company. \nThe Swan had the capacity of soaking in thousands of pounds of oil and \nwater, and we never got back to them.\n  We now have the opportunity to bring another ship into our effort. \nThe Swan was a huge ship. As shown in this picture I have in the \nChamber, this is A Whale--appropriately named. It is reported to be the \nlargest skimmer in the world. I met with the folks who own\n\n[[Page S5671]]\n\nthe ship yesterday, Taiwanese folks. They have no approval yet to use \nthis ship, but they still steamed this ship from Taiwan to the gulf--it \nis just getting there now--on their own dime. Imagine what it costs to \nsail this ship, 300 yards long, bigger than an aircraft carrier. It is \nthe largest oil skimmer ever devised. It is at least 250 times that of \nthese modified fishing boats we are using for skimming. It has a \ncapability to draw as much as 500,000 barrels of oily water per 8- to \n10-hour cycle, and it does not have to stop. It puts the ship next to \nit, which it offloads the oily water to, and it can keep going 24 hours \na day.\n  By the way, storms are not a problem either because it is so big. It \ndoes not rock in the waves of a storm. So you hear these concerns now \nwith our Tropical Storm Alex in the gulf that certain ships are going \nto have to stop their efforts. If this ship is allowed to work, it does \nnot have to stop, according to what the owners told me. It is being \ntested by the Coast Guard either today or tomorrow.\n  Let's hope we use this incredible resource and ones like it because \nwhen this oil washes up onshore, when we have failed to respond to the \noffers of assistance from foreign countries, it is not just oil that is \nwashing up onshore, it is failure. We need every resource, domestic and \nforeign alike, in the gulf, and we needed them yesterday. In fact, we \nneeded them 50 days ago. It should not have taken this long to marshal \nthis response.\n  I just watched the President of the United States on television. He \nis in Racine, WI. He gave a speech, a very political speech. He likes \nto blame the Republicans for everything that has gone wrong in the \ncountry. It is all our fault. Well, let me take issue with him on this \none point. This is his job. He may not want to be in charge of the \nUnited States of America and be the President when we have the worst \noilspill we have ever had, but that is part of the job. It is not Thad \nAllen's job to run this. It is not Janet Napolitano's job. It is not \nKen Salazar's job. It is not Jane Lubchenco's job or any other folks \nwho work in the administration. It is the job of the President of the \nUnited States.\n  When he ran for President, he said President Bush's response to \nKatrina was halfhearted and it was half measures. I am not sure he \nwould want this same standard applied to him right now. I know it is \nfun to give a political speech, but the people in the Gulf of Mexico \nare suffering, and they need help and they need a President who is on \nthe job managing through problems.\n  Mr. President, being from Florida, we have had a lot of crises in the \npast several years with hurricanes. In 2004, in 2005, we had 9 or 10 \nhurricanes come through Florida that devastated us. I got to watch a \nchief executive officer of our State, our Governor at the time, Jeb \nBush, when I was in the Attorney General's Office, manage through \nproblems, overcome obstacles, work 12, 14, 16 hours a day to make \nthings happen, to get results.\n  That is what it takes, and there is no one like the chief executive \nofficer to overcome those obstacles. That is what we need from the \nPresident of the United States in this situation. I do not want to see \nhim in Wisconsin giving a political speech. I want to see him in \nFlorida getting these skimmers there, overcoming obstacles, solving \nproblems, managing through this crisis, so we can protect our beaches, \nprotect our estuaries, and protect the way of life for the people of \nFlorida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana.\n  This crisis is not over. It may not be on your television as much as \nit was, but the oil is still spewing out of this well. We hope these \nrelief wells work. We hope they can stop the oil from leaking in the \nGulf of Mexico at an unprecedented rate. We still do not know how much \nis leaking. We hope BP is capturing at least half of that oil now, \nmaybe a little bit more, but we do not know.\n  But every day that goes by that oil leaks in the Gulf of Mexico and \nwashes up on the shore of my State--when I stand on the beach in \nPensacola and I cannot see a single skimmer, I wonder where our Federal \nGovernment is. We need help. We need some urgency. We need some \npurpose. I am glad they signed the order this week to let those \nskimmers come. I am glad we are finally starting to accept foreign \nskimmers--72 days into the crisis. But I will continue to come to the \nfloor every day until that oil wellhead stops leaking to talk about \nthis issue and bring light and attention to it, to make sure this \ngovernment is doing everything it can, marshaling every resource \npossible to keep that oil from coming on our beaches and into our \ncoastal waterways.\n  I will close with this: In Florida, people love the water. It is the \nreason most people come to Florida. It is not just because of the great \nway of life. It is not just because of the great climate. It is because \nof the water. Ninety percent of the people of our State live within 10 \nmiles of the ocean. We have more recreational boaters than any other \nState in the country. We have more coastline than any other State in \nthe country save Alaska. The water is a way of life to people in \nFlorida.\n  I have had grown men, men I have known and respected my whole life--\nnot men you would consider emotional or soft--talk about the situation \nof this oil crisis with me and start to break down and cry. It is that \nmuch of an issue for the people of Florida. I want to see our Federal \nGovernment rise to the task and do everything possible to solve this \nproblem.\n  With that, Mr. President, I see my colleague is here and I yield the \nfloor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am sorry I was not here on the floor--\nbut I was watching in my office--when my colleague from Ohio, Senator \nBrown, made his recent statement on the Senate floor. I think Senator \nBrown pointed out very poignantly what is happening to so many people \nin our country today who have exhausted their unemployment insurance \nbenefits. I would like to follow up on the comments made by Senator \nBrown to reinforce what he said just a few minutes ago on the Senate \nfloor and the dire straits that so many people find themselves in going \ninto the Fourth of July holiday.\n  Recently, a national group of business economists released its 2010 \neconomic outlook, predicting that America's economy is ``on track'' \ntoward recovery. Well, this is encouraging news. It indicates we are \nmoving in the right direction under President Obama's leadership. But \nwe also know the recovery is very fragile.\n  For example, last week, we learned that sales of new homes plummeted \n33 percent in May, to the least level in 40 years. Let me repeat that. \nHome sales in May fell to the least level in 40 years. Banks are still \nreluctant to lend to small businesses. It is not that they do not have \nmoney. According to a new Federal Reserve report, U.S. companies are \nhoarding an all-time high sum of $1.84 trillion in cash, but they \nremain largely unwilling to invest, hire, and expand.\n  U.S. companies are hoarding an all-time high sum--$1.84 trillion in \ncash--but they are not investing, they are not hiring, and they are not \nexpanding. So the threat of this double-dip recession is very real.\n  These economic warning signs are not just abstract facts and figures. \nThey have very real consequences for families across the country. That \nis what my friend from Ohio was talking about earlier. The unemployment \nreport for May was very disappointing. By the official numbers, there \nare 15 million hard-working people who have lost their jobs through no \nfault of their own, and they are struggling to find work. Those are the \nofficial numbers--the official numbers. Many experts in this field \nagree that the real numbers are far higher.\n  So when you count the people who have become so discouraged that they \nhave stopped looking for work, or who are working part time \ninvoluntarily because they cannot get full time work, the number of \nunemployed workers is far higher, like about 30 million people.\n  So as shown on this chart, here is sort of the official figure of 15 \nmillion. But that is just people who are right now on the unemployment \nrolls who are actively looking for work. We have enough data to show \nthat people have been out of work for so long--they have hunted for so \nlong, and they are discouraged; they are not looking right now \nactively--they are not counted as\n\n[[Page S5672]]\n\nunemployed. The young people who have not had jobs for the first time, \nwho are out of school but have not had jobs for the first time, they \nare not counted as unemployed. People who are working makeshift jobs \nfor bits and pieces here and there, part-time, who one time had a full-\ntime job, they are not counted either. When we add all those up, our \nreal unemployment in this country is right around 30 million people.\n  The official figures will say there are five unemployed workers for \nevery available job. That is not true. It is more like 10 workers. Job \nopenings in America: 2.69 million. That is how many jobs are in America \nright now that are open--at least last month anyway. There are 30 \nmillion people out there after those 2.69 million jobs; not 1 in 5, but \n1 in 10, a little over 1 in 10. It is little wonder that the average \nspell of unemployment in this country has skyrocketed to 34 weeks, far \nhigher than in previous recessions. This chart shows that--here is the \nrecession of 1980, 10 weeks; in July of 1981, 14 weeks; in July of \n1990, 12 weeks; March of 2001, the recession, 13 weeks. These are the \nunemployment spells we had during those recessions. We are now up to 34 \nweeks and counting. Compare that to the recessions of the past. It is a \nsmall wonder that a lot of people say this is not a recession, this is \na depression. People don't want to say it, but in many ways, we are on \nthe edge of a depression.\n\n  As a result, a record number of Americans is facing long-term \nunemployment; 6.8 million Americans out of work for more than half a \nyear, by official numbers alone. That is the highest number of long-\nterm unemployed we have had since we started keeping track in 1948. Let \nme repeat that. The number of Americans out of work for more than half \na year is the highest--the highest--since we have kept track of this \nsince 1948. The families of these long-term unemployed are hanging on \nby a thread. Their savings are gone. Unemployment benefits are the only \nlifeline they have to pay the rent and put food on the table.\n  Again, I know I am not the only Member of this body whose office has \nbeen flooded with heartbreaking stories of families back home \nstruggling to make ends meet. We heard a number of those stories from \nSenator Brown from Ohio. These are people trying their hardest, doing \neverything they can to find work, but the jobs aren't there.\n  I heard from a community college professor from Sioux City who was \nlaid off due to budget cuts. She has applied for dozens of jobs, many \nfar below her skill level. She is often told she is overqualified. She \nhas exhausted her unemployment benefits. She and her sons, one of whom \nis a special needs child, are on Medicaid and they have applied for \nfood stamps.\n  I heard from a worker in Des Moines who has been in the insurance \nindustry for many years. She was laid off almost a year ago and has \nstruggled to find work. Her benefits were cut off last week. Here is \nwhat she writes. She says:\n\n       My concern is that my family cannot survive without the \n     unemployment benefits. We have depleted our savings just to \n     save the house and not get behind on the bills. I know there \n     are others far worse off. Please help pass the emergency \n     unemployment insurance extension.\n\n  I heard from a schoolteacher in northern Iowa who was laid off in \nOctober of 2008. She recently ran out of unemployment benefits and had \nto apply for welfare. She writes:\n\n       I have not felt so humiliated in 20 years. I have been a \n     productive and hard-working woman since I was 13, but now I \n     feel insignificant. Please do not misunderstand. I have been \n     trying to find full-time employment, but to no avail.\n\n  Again, these are hard-working people trying their best, who never \nimagined they would be in need of Federal assistance. They paid into \nthe unemployment insurance system while they were working. Their \nemployers paid in. They ought to be able to count on it when times get \ntough. To me, it is a matter of fundamental fairness and human decency.\n  Yet, in the face of so many families in crisis, an extension--a \nshort-term extension--of unemployment insurance is being needlessly, \nand I would even say cruelly, obstructed here in the Senate. Time and \nagain we have tried to pass an extension of unemployment benefits and \ntime and time again that effort has been blocked by Members on the \nother side of this aisle. As a result of this political gamesmanship, \nas of the end of last week--at the end of last week--1,350,000 \nAmericans exhausted their unemployment benefits because of the lapse in \nthis program. By the end of this week, that will go up to 1,720,000 who \nwill be cut off because we won't extend it here. By July 10, 2.14 \nmillion--2,140,000 Americans will have their unemployment benefits cut \noff.\n  Blocking this bill may be a political game for some over here in the \nminority party, but it is not a game to millions of Americans who have \nlost their lifeline. For them, the obstruction of this bill is a \npersonal and family crisis of the first magnitude.\n  Imagine: We are about to go out of here in a couple of days for 10 \ndays, 12 days, something like that, to celebrate our Nation's birthday, \nthe Fourth of July weekend. I am sure Senators will be with their \nfamilies; Congress men and women will be with their families, and all \nof our staffs. We all have jobs. We have good jobs that pay us well. We \nhave good benefits--health benefits, retirement benefits--as does our \nstaff, Republican staff and Democratic staff. Republican Senators and \nDemocratic Senators, we have good pay. We will have a good Fourth of \nJuly with our families. We will watch the fireworks and have hot dogs \nand hamburgers, listen to patriotic speeches, maybe make a few \nourselves. How about all these people? How about these people? How \nabout these families? What are they thinking about on the Fourth of \nJuly? They have lost their benefits. They don't know where to turn. \nWhat are they going to be celebrating? What are they going to think \nabout their country? What are they going to think about this Congress, \nthat turns its back on these people?\n  There is no reason why we can't extend the unemployment insurance \nbenefits, none whatsoever. I think that is what we have to be thinking \nabout.\n  Another thing that I think hits pretty hard, I have heard political \ncandidates out on the stump who want to take a place in the Senate, or \nmaybe in the House of Representatives, out there talking about how we \nshouldn't extend these benefits because this encourages people not to \ngo to work; it sort of encourages laziness. Well, I think that is \ninsulting and illogical. As I said, there are 30 million people out of \nwork looking for 2 million jobs. They say, Well, but if you give them \nthese unemployment benefits, it makes them lazy. They won't go to work.\n  The numbers vary from State to State, but the unemployment benefit \nnationwide is about $300 a week, below the poverty line. So here is the \naverage income for a family of four on unemployment benefits: It is \nabout $15,600. It is more in some States, less in other States. That is \nan average. So what is the poverty line for a family of four? It is \n$22,000. That is below the poverty line. They are telling me people \ndon't want to go to work? These are people who had work. They are not \nout of work because they walked off the job; they are out of work \nbecause they were cut off of work. In some States, benefits are \nsmaller. For example, in Mississippi, the weekly maximum benefit is \n$235 a week. Again, that is thousands of dollars less than the annual \nsalary of a full-time minimum wage worker. Again, I can't imagine \nanyone who had the alternative to make more money and to have a full-\ntime job would say, No, I want to stay on unemployment benefits. That \nis insulting. It is insulting.\n  I have also heard my colleagues object to this benefit extension on \nthe grounds that providing these benefits is too expensive. It will add \nto the deficit. I understand the concern, and we are all concerned \nabout the deficit of this country. But, it doesn't hold water when we \nare sitting in the midst of an economic crisis. We are about to pass a \nsupplemental appropriations bill here sometime soon, probably after we \nget back from the Fourth of July break. It has about $37 billion in \nthere in military aid to Iraq and Afghanistan. We are building \ninfrastructure projects over there. We are putting people to work \nthere. We are continuing to lose a lot of American lives, young \nAmericans getting injured and killed, and that is adding to the \ndeficit. Yet we are not paying for that. That is adding to the deficit.\n\n[[Page S5673]]\n\n  It seems to me if we are trying to look ahead and trying to protect \nthe people of this country, we want to get people back to work. We want \nto get the economy going again. We need to get the recovery up and \nrunning. Unemployment benefits cost money, yes, but think about it this \nway. That money is spent here in America. It is not spent overseas and \nit is not spent someplace else. It is spent here.\n  What do people do when they get unemployment insurance benefits? What \ndo they do with that money? Do they put it in a shoe box? Do they bury \nit in a hole in the ground? No. They go out and they spend it. They \nspend it on food and clothes and the necessities of life: housing, \nrent, utilities. That money spins around in the economy. That is why \nthe economists all agree that one of the--this is from \nmoodyseconomy.com. The biggest boost for the economy in terms of \nbenefits from the government, the biggest bang for the buck, so to \nspeak, are food stamps. That is because poor people who get food stamps \nspend it right away on food. Not all, but most of the food is grown in \nthis country and processed; not all of it, but most of it. So you get a \nbig bang for the buck. For every dollar in food stamps, you get $1.73 \nin economic activity in this country--$1.73 for every dollar invested. \nUnemployment benefits, $1.63. Right next to food stamps, unemployment \nbenefits. Infrastructure investments that so many of us talk about, \nvery close on their heels: $1.59. If we want to put people to work, \nlet's start doing infrastructure rebuilding in America. Rebuild our \nsewer and water systems, our highways, roads, bridges, rails, high \nspeed. That is a great investment, plus it will put a lot of people to \nwork too.\n  A whole lot of people say, Well, we have to extend the Bush tax cuts \nto get the economy going. Extending the Bush tax cuts is a 49-cent \nreturn on the dollar--not a very good investment, folks. Not very good.\n  So unemployment benefits, yes, they cost money. Yes, they do add to \nthe deficit, but they provide for a lot of economic activity in this \ncountry--a lot more than extending a tax cut. For example, in Iowa \nalone, more than 3,700 jobs were saved or created in my State in 2009 \nthanks to the benefits of unemployment insurance. That is 3,700 jobs in \nmy State alone because of unemployment benefits.\n  Again, under these circumstances, obstruction of an extension of \nunemployment benefits is inexplicable. How do you explain it? How do \nyou explain something such as that to someone who is on their lifeline, \nhas lost their benefits, or is on the verge of losing their benefits \nright now? It is like a person who is in the hospital with a serious \ninfection. The doctor says, OK, here is a 15-day course of antibiotics. \nThe patient goes home and says OK, 15 days, I have to take the \nantibiotics every day. But day 8 comes, day 9 comes, the patient feels \nbetter, they stop taking their antibiotics. The infection reasserts \nitself, the patient is right back in the hospital.\n  That is where we are in this economic recovery. We made the mistake \nonce before; history shows this. In 1937, we were getting out of a \ndepression, the public works projects and things President Franklin \nRoosevelt and the Democratic Congress put in place were getting us out \nof the recession. But then the so-called deficit hawks took over and \nbegan then to tighten down on the benefits and these programs. What \nhappened? The Federal Reserve started tightening up the money, Congress \nslashed spending, the Fed tightened its policy, and the economy plunged \nback down into a depression.\n  That is why I used the analogy of someone in the hospital with a \nserious infection and they are prescribed 15 days of antibiotics, but \nafter 5 to 7 days, they feel better and they stop, the infection then \nreasserts itself, and they are right back in the hospital. That is \nwhere we are now.\n  Well, quite frankly, there is an infection in our country. The \ninfection is called a recession, a deep recession, a depression. Thirty \nmillion people are out of work. That is an infection. There is one \nthing that will help relieve that infection right now: the medicine of \nunemployment benefits.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. HARKIN. I am delighted to yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for bringing this \nissue and timely discussion to the floor.\n  We had a meeting today of the deficit commission--18 of us who have \nbeen charged with finding a way to deal with our Nation's deficit. \nSpeaking to us was the Director of the CBO, Congressional Budget \nOffice, Mr. Elmendorf, who talked about what we need to do. I asked him \na question that went directly to the Senator's point: As we talk about \nreducing the deficit, isn't there a worry or concern that if we hit the \nbrakes too soon, we can plunge even deeper into a recession, with more \npeople out of work? He said yes. He said that you have to make sure we \nstart moving forward, putting people to work, with the GDP growing; and \nonce you have the economy stabilized and moving forward, with people \npaying taxes--which, incidentally, brings down the deficit--then you \ncan talk about the long-term deficit fix. So I say to the Senator from \nIowa, he really hit the nail on the head.\n  Our colleagues on the other side who refuse to support extending \nunemployment compensation benefits say: We want to take it from some \nother area of spending. Well, of course, that just reduces the stimulus \nto the American economy. So they are not helping things. What we need \nto do is help them.\n  I see the Senator from Iowa has 3,700 workers in Iowa affected by \nthis. We have over 10,000 in the State of Illinois. In fact, it is \n20,000 at this point. It will be 80,000 by the end of June, if I am not \nmistaken. At this point, these folks have reached a point of \ndesperation.\n  I had a call over the weekend from a friend who is unemployed. She is \nthe mother of three kids, with a grandchild in the house. They are \ncutting off her utilities because her unemployment check was cut off. \nThat is the reality of life for people who have lost jobs through no \nfault of their own.\n  I thank the Senator for bringing up this issue. I will be embarrassed \nif we leave here for the Fourth of July break without taking on this \nunemployment issue and helping people across the Nation who are \nsimilarly situated.\n  I will ask the Senator a question since he yielded for that purpose. \nDoes the Senator even possibly agree with what I have said?\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, who has been a \nchampion of working people and families for all the many years I have \nknown him, and that is many years now. I thank him for telling us about \nwhat the CBO said in the deficit commission.\n  I pointed out a couple of things earlier. The Senator is right on the \nmark in terms of economic activity, and that is why it is so important \nright now to get the economy moving again, to keep it moving. The \nbiggest bang for the buck we get is food stamps. People spend those \nright away on food.\n  Second to that, for every dollar we put into unemployment benefits, \nit causes $1.63 of economic activity. That is not a bad return on the \ndollar. Well, down here on the chart, extending the Bush tax cuts, you \nonly get 49 cents back. That is what my Republican friends say you need \nto do--more of these Bush tax cuts. That is dismal. Yet an \ninfrastructure investment brings $1.59 cents. If you invest more in \ninfrastructure--sewer and water, plants and highways, roads, bridges, \nhigh-speed rail--not only do you get a great return, you get a lot of \npeople employed at the same time.\n  How can we leave here tomorrow or Friday, when we leave for 10 or 12 \ndays, when we know this is what is happening? At the end of last week, \n1,350,000 Americans lost their unemployment benefits. At the end of \nthis week, it jumps up to 1,720,000. By July 10, before we come back, \nit will be 2,140,000 Americans who will lose their benefits. How can we \ngo home and celebrate the Fourth of July with fireworks--the birthday \nof our Republic--and give patriotic speeches about how great we are, \nwhat a good country this is, when we are going to leave all these \npeople out in the cold? What does that say about this body, about the \nCongress?\n  I will tell you, I say to all those families who have written me \nletters, contacted me by e-mail, and have come into my offices, telling \nme of your joblessness and your struggles: You are not forgotten. We \nare here fighting to try to get this done.\n\n[[Page S5674]]\n\n  My Republican colleagues refuse to let us extend unemployment \nbenefits--even for less than half a year, a short period of time. Well, \nwe will do everything we can to get this done. For the sake of these \nfamilies, our country, and for the sake of, yes, our economy, we can't \nleave here without extending these unemployment benefits.\n  I ask my Republican colleagues who have been blocking this to have a \nsense of humanity on this, a sense of compassion, of caring for these \nfamilies. We all make good money around here. We get good pay and \nbenefits, good retirement benefits. All our staffs are employed. \nEverybody here in this Chamber is employed. How about these people who \nare unemployed? You have to think about them before we close up shop \nand leave here this week.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Kerry are located in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I begin by complimenting the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts for a remarkable tribute to the late Senator \nRobert Byrd. It was beautifully delivered, beautifully written. It \ncaptured the spirit of this wonderful Senator and highlighted just a \nfew of the extraordinary accomplishments in his life. I was privileged \nto be on the floor to hear it delivered by the Senator from \nMassachusetts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes \nas in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Small Business Lending Fund Act\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I was here earlier today, following \nSenator Baucus's handling of a portion of the small business bill. I am \npleased to share in that responsibility on a small business bill that \nis not immediately before the Senate because, remember, we came off it \ntemporarily to talk about the unemployment measure that is pending \nabout which Senator Harkin just spoke.\n  I want to return to the small business bill because at some point, \nafter a vote on the unemployment measure before the Senate, we will get \nback to a very important bill for you, Mr. President, and you have been \na leader in this area, as well as many of us.\n  I want to speak for a moment about a couple of provisions of the \nsmall business bill. The bill itself has three major pieces to it. \nThere is a piece that came out of the Small Business Committee about \nwhich I spent some time this morning talking, the elements of \nstrengthening the SBA lending programs, expanding the limits for the \namount of money that businesses can borrow. There is a piece that is \ncoming out of the Finance Committee that is broadly supported. Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley have done a great job. Basically, it is tax \ncuts relative to small businesses that can help them with tax \nprovisions. Then there is a piece that has come from the Treasury, the \nWhite House, the leadership team, about small business lending.\n  I want to talk for a few minutes about a piece of the small business \npackage, and then I want to talk about the bank investment program, the \n$30 billion program.\n  First of all, one of the most important aspects of the small business \nbill is the extension and the expansion of 7(a) loans. To put this in \nplain English, these are the loans that the Small Business \nAdministration partners with banks to make what we call floor plan \nlending. It is any business that has inventory--maybe it is a tractor \ncompany or a manufactured home company or a boat, marine industry with \na small business owner--and you have some of these in Illinois, I know, \nMr. President, and I have many of them in Louisiana--that has to buy \ninventory and put it in their showrooms for when people come by and \nthey look at the product.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S5674, June 30, 2010, at several places, the Record \nreads: . . . 584 . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . 7(a) . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  Some people might go on the Internet these days. My son does this. He \nspends a lot of time looking for automobiles because he has not yet \nbeen given permission to purchase his first one. He is looking every \nnight, bringing pictures to his mother and father, talking about the \nbenefits.\n  People today go on the Internet. They look at all these products they \nwant to buy--boats, tractors, for example. They do not usually push the \nbutton to buy these products on the Internet; they go down to their \nlocal dealer. They want to walk into a showroom. They want to look at \nthe product. They heard about it, and they might have documents from \nthe Internet. They go to their local small business, whether it is in \nsome parts of Illinois or Louisiana down in Thibodeaux, Violet, Larose. \nThey walk into that local marine operator and say: I have looked on the \nInternet, and this is the kind of boat I want to buy. Do you have one \nin stock? If we pass this bill, he might have one in stock. If we do \nnot pass this bill, chances are he will not be able to make that sale. \nThat is what the 7(a) lending program does.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S5674, June 30, 2010, at several places, the Record \nreads: . . . 584 . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . 7(a) . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  I have a letter from the National Marine Manufacturers Association \nthat says they have over thousands of members. They say that they \nbelieve if we pass this provision in this small business bill, it could \naffect over 350,000 jobs in America because that is how these small \nbusinesses operate.\n  Unlike a lot of businesses we talk about, these are not businesses in \nChina or in India or in South Africa or in France. These are small \nbusinesses with American-made products in our own neighborhoods, almost \nin every neighborhood in America, that has an inventory, that is trying \nto sell something. When that purchase is made, tax dollars are \ngenerated, money changes hands, and our economy gets rolling again.\n  This 7(a) lending program is not to be underestimated. It is not just \nan old government program that does not work. This program will \npotentially leverage loans up to $5 million. The way the program works \nis the Federal Government backs 40 percent of the loan. The banks \nusually take the first 50 percent, and then there is another 10 \npercent. So when you add all of that up, because our portion can now go \nup to $5 million, it is basically a $5 million loan.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S5674, June 30, 2010, at several places, the Record \nreads: . . . 584 . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . 7(a) . . .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S5674, June 30, 2010, at several places, the Record \nreads: . . . $12 million . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . $5 million . \n. .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  That is a lot of money for a small business to be able to purchase a \nnumber of tractors for their inventory or automobiles or RVs or jet \nskis.

For those of my colleagues voting no, \nthey are going to have some explaining to do because the automobile \ndealers in their States, the marine manufacturers in their States are \ngoing to say why didn't you vote for a bill that would allow me to go \nto my local bank, borrow up to $5 million so I can put inventory in our \nshowrooms so people in this town can come to my shop or my place of \nbusiness and purchase that equipment?\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On page S5674, June 30, 2010, at several places, the Record \nreads: . . . $12 million . . .\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . $5 million . \n. .\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  This 7(a) loan program is very important.

I know there may be others on the floor \nto speak. In another section of this small business bill, in our \nattempt to get jobs created in America to bring this recession to an \nend, to get our people back to work--yes, we have to extend \nunemployment, but eventually--eventually, not now, but some time soon, \nnot now because it is too soon, many economists say, but at some time, \nwe are going to have to stop the emergency extension of unemployment \nand have a job for people to go back to because I agree with Senator \nHarkin, most people--99.9 percent of people in America--men and women, \nBlack and White, Hispanic or Asian, would rather work because it not \nonly helps their family economically, but it is very rewarding to work, \nparticularly at something one likes to do, and it is life \naffirming. People aren't interested, as some of my Republican \ncolleagues want to say, in sitting home and collecting $215 a week. In \nsome States, I think in Mississippi, it is $146 a week. Who wants to do \nthat? How many mouths can you feed at $146 a week? Please, tell me.\n\n  Not many. I do the shopping in my family. That wouldn't cover 4 days' \nor 5 days' worth of groceries in my family, and I have only two \nchildren.\n\n[[Page S5675]]\n\n  So I am not sure what people are talking about on the Republican \nside, that people would like to stay home and collect a real big check. \nPeople want to get back to work. But in order to help them get back to \nwork, we are going to have to have some extraordinary measures to get \nbanks--medium-sized banks, community banks--lending again.\n  I think the President and the Treasury have come up with quite an \ninnovative program. It is $30 billion, and many Republican Senators \nvoted for it--at least eight. I don't know what the others were \nthinking, but I would like to give them a couple of arguments to \nrethink their vote.\n  Some of them have said this is the TARP again. Remember what TARP \nstands for. TARP stands for Troubled Assets Relief Program. It is a \nprogram for troubled banks. The ``T'' stands for ``trouble.'' This $30 \nbillion program we have come up with should be called the healthy bank \nprovision because this is not for troubled banks; this is for healthy \nbanks. These are banks that are not troubled. They are healthy banks.\n  This program will allow them to voluntarily--not mandatorily but \nvoluntarily--ask the Treasury to infuse some capital through an \ninvestment in all of our banks. The banks will then take that money \nand, if they follow the guidelines of Treasury in terms of the program \nas it is outlined, and they start to lend the money to small \nbusinesses, they will get a benefit. They do not have to pay the \nTreasury back a dividend. They can pay the Treasury back a lower \ndividend on the investment the taxpayers have made in that bank.\n  So for my colleagues who say this is TARP II, they are absolutely \ndead wrong. There is not a ``T'' in this program for ``trouble.'' This \nis for banks that are healthy, and I am very excited to say that our \ncommunity banks in Louisiana survived this meltdown because they didn't \nengage in some of this reckless behavior that some of the large banks \nparticipated in. Our community banks in Illinois and in Michigan and in \nOhio--I know they had a little more trouble in the rust belt--but many \nof the community banks in the South did very well and were very smart \nabout their lending. They never got into trouble.\n  So this $30 billion infusion from Treasury into preferred stock in \nthese banks, investments structured this way, will encourage these \nsmall banks to make money the old-fashioned way--not on transaction \ncosts, not on charging people extra for the balance they do or don't \nhave in their checking accounts, but by getting back to old-fashioned \nbanking: making money in your bank when you make good loans to \nbusinesses. When you are smart and you are looking at businesses in \nyour community and you are lending them money, they are expanding and \nthey pay you back the loan with interest. You lend them more money, and \nthey pay you back the money you lent them with interest. They grow, the \nbusiness grows, the bank grows, and the community grows.\n  Mr. President, I suggest in America that we get back to the old-\nfashioned way that banks should make money. The Presiding Officer did \nthat successfully when he was in Illinois--lend money to small \nbusiness. That is what the President's $30 billion does.\n  I hope Republicans who voted against this provision because they \nbelieve this is TARP II will actually read the bill. It is not very \nlong. It is just a few pages. It is just a few pages. It is not a \ntroubled bank program; it is a healthy bank program, and they should be \nfor it because, as the chairman of the committee, I have received a \nletter from the association that represents the community banks. They \nsaid: Senator, we favor this provision. We want this to happen.\n  So for the taxpayers listening, don't be fooled by the arguments on \nthe other side. That just gets back to we are the party of no. We are \ngoing to say no, no matter how good the idea is. This is a good idea \nfor healthy banks that the bank association supports. I think we should \nbe for it, and I am hoping we can vote for it when we get back.\n  One other point. Then I am going to cede the floor. Because of the \ngreat work Senator Warner of Virginia and Senator Levin have done, they \nhave convinced enough of us on both sides of the aisle, I hope, to add \nto this provision something we call the State small business credit \naccess fund. So in addition to what President Obama came up with, he \nand his team, Senator Warner and Senator Levin did a lot of work on \nthis and explained it to many of us. Many of our colleagues were \nGovernors before they got here, so they know something about this. \nTheir job was to create jobs when they were Governors. Now, happy for \nus, they are Senators and they are still trying to create jobs. So they \nbrought an idea to our committee which we looked at very carefully and \nsaid yes. Then they worked through Finance, and Finance said yes.\n  What this does is set aside $2 billion for State programs that are \nalready established and that act in very different ways but are \nmission-driven organizations run by our Governors. These are Governors \nfrom different parties, so it is not a partisan program. We are going \nto give $2 billion out through these programs, and they will then turn \naround and lend money and make the master plans of economic development \nin the State of Virginia real.\n  It helps the State of Michigan, where they have some great small \nbusinesses, Carl Levin says. But he said to me: Mary, the problem is \nthat they do not have the collateral they once had to get the loan \nbecause their collateral has depreciated. So the banks are not going to \nlend them the money because they do not have the collateral. So we have \ncome up with a way to enhance their collateral to make it a good loan--\nnot a risky loan but a good loan. So that is in here.\n  So for people who say government is not creative or not innovative or \nwe are not trying to do the smart things, this is a smart bill. Besides \nbeing a healthy bank bill, it is a smart lending bill. In some of these \ninstances, the Federal Government is actually going to make a profit. \nSo I hope when we get back, when we are talking about small business, \nwe can be enthusiastic in supporting the basically $32 billion lending \nprogram, the small business package, and the tax cuts that Senator \nBaucus and Senator Grassley, with the help of Senator Snowe, have put \ntogether for small businesses throughout the country. I hope we can \nstop fighting, stop saying no, and just say yes to job growth and \ncreation in America for hard-working taxpayers and Americans who \ndeserve our best effort on this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I support the comments of and the \nlegislation by the Senator from Louisiana. I think it makes a great \ndeal of sense to strengthen small businesses. They are, after all, the \njob generators in this country. So I appreciated her comments. We don't \nalways agree on every issue around here, but I am a strong supporter of \nher work as chairman of the Small Business Committee and of the \nlegislation she has described.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to come to the Senate floor briefly today \nbecause we are talking about extending unemployment compensation, \nunemployment benefits, to people who are out of work, and we are having \na very difficult time doing that. These benefits are for people who \nworked on payrolls. They actually paid a little of their money in taxes \nto support an unemployment fund so if they lost their jobs they would \nbe able to get some unemployment help. But in order to do that, this \nhas to be extended by the Senate, and it has become increasingly \ndifficult to extend unemployment compensation to those who are out of \nwork.\n  I find that kind of inexplicable because for the folks at the top of \nthe economic ladder, there is no problem in their getting what they \nwant out of this Chamber. I noticed in the last 24 hours or so that one \nof my colleagues objected to something that was in the financial reform \nbill. He said: Well, you are going to impose a fee on the biggest \nbanks. He said: I won't accept that. He said: If you do that, I won't \nvote for the bill. The biggest banks in the country shouldn't have to \npay this fee.\n  I was thinking to myself: Why not? They drove the country into the \nditch. They are the ones involved in the cesspool of greed, many of \nthem, trading things on things they will get from people who never had \nit and making money on both sides, which created an\n\n[[Page S5676]]\n\nunbelievable orgy of speculation that ran the country right into the \nditch. There is nothing wrong, it seems to me, with their having to pay \na fee here or there.\n  But one of our colleagues said: I won't support that. All of a \nsudden, the conference committee got back together and said: How can we \nfluff up your pillow, big guy? Can we give you an aspirin, put you to \nsleep?\n  If you are at the top of this economic ladder in this Chamber, you \ncan do just fine because somebody will make you comfortable. But what \nabout the people at the bottom? What about the person who came home \nfrom work after 18 years on the job and said: Honey, I lost my job \ntoday. And they can't find another job? What about that family and that \nperson? What about extending unemployment help for that person?\n  Things never change. Here is what Will Rogers said many years ago. He \nsaid:\n\n       The unemployed here ain't eating regular, but we will get \n     around to them as soon as everybody else gets fixed up OK.\n\n  Boy, if there was ever a description of the way things work these \ndays, this is it. Old Will Rogers. And this description is as old as \neight or nine decades, isn't it? The unemployed here ain't eating \nregular, but we don't have time yet. We will get to them after \neverybody else gets taken care of. And who gets taken care of first? \nThe folks at the top of the economic ladder.\n  I wonder, I just wonder what would happen with a bill to extend \nunemployment benefits if the only Americans who were unemployed were \ninvestment bankers? Do you think that wouldn't have been passed in a \nnanosecond, just like that? But, no, the unemployed are people named \nSmith and Jones and Adams and Johnson. They are the ones somehow at the \nbottom of the economic ladder who don't seem to matter to some people.\n  My hope is this Congress will have the good sense to do the right \nthing. During tough times, we have something called a safety net--that \nis the unemployment compensation--that helps people when they are laid \noff, when they are out of work and are having trouble and can't find \nanother job. It is our responsibility to extend that. That is what we \nshould be doing.\n  As Will Rogers said: Everybody else gets help. In the last 24 hours, \nthe folks at the top of the economic ladder got help--the biggest banks \nin the country. Why? Because somebody said they needed some comfort--a \nbedtime story, a fluffed pillow, an aspirin, some comfort. They got \ntheir comfort. But we are still waiting to see if the people who lost \ntheir jobs and who are at the bottom of the economic ladder will get \nthe help they were promised. I hope so. We will have a vote on that and \nwe will soon see.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Mr. President, I wanted to mention that yesterday a group of us went \ndown to meet with the President on the subject of energy, and following \nthat meeting a number of my colleagues spoke to the press. I did not. \nBut because there were stories today about the representation of that \nmeeting with the President, I thought I would at least offer my notion \nof what that meeting meant and what the consequences of it will or \nshould be.\n  The meeting with the President, calling a number of Republicans and \nDemocrats--about 10 or 12 of us--down to the White House, was to talk \nabout energy and to simply try to evaluate what is achievable, what \nshould be done with respect to energy. We know two things are making \nthis country vulnerable: No. 1, we are way too dependent on foreign \noil. We use one-fourth of the oil that is pulled out of this planet \nevery morning. Every day we use one-fourth in this little place called \nthe United States. Yet over 60 percent of that which we use comes from \nother countries. That leaves us far too vulnerable to others, and, by \nthe way, some of whom are in very troubled parts of the world. We are \nfar too vulnerable to others for our energy supplies. That is a fact.\n  The second something that is happening to this planet is called \nclimate change. We don't necessarily know exactly what that is, but the \nwide consensus of scientists tells us we need to be concerned about it \nand we need to be taking actions to deal with it.\n  I appreciate the President's leadership on these issues and saying we \nneed to move. We need to do some things here. But the discussion was, \nWhat is achievable?\n  What is achievable, in my judgment, from listening and participating \nin that meeting, is what I have always believed was achievable. The \nonly thing achievable is that which will get 60 votes to come from the \ncalendar of the Senate to the floor because it takes 60 votes on a \nmotion to proceed to consider anything. I believe the only thing that \ncan get 60 votes, based on not only the meeting yesterday but other \ndiscussions I have had, would be to bring the bill passed by the Energy \nCommittee, which was bipartisan, to the floor of the Senate. That does \nnot exclude anything else. That does not exclude anybody from offering \nclimate change amendments, comprehensive climate change amendments. But \nwe will never get to the floor unless we get to the floor with \nsomething that can get 60 votes, and I am convinced the only thing that \ncan achieve that is the bipartisan Energy bill out of the committee.\n\n  The Energy bill itself is a bill that does reduce carbon. It does all \nthe things I think it should do. Yes, it says we are going to continue \nto use the fossil energy--coal, oil, natural gas--but we are going to \nuse that in a different way. We are going to decarbonize and take great \npains to protect the planet as we do. We are going to build some \nnuclear. We are going to maximize renewables--solar and wind energy. We \nare going to do the biofuels, including biodiesel, ethanol, and \ngeothermal. All of these sources of energy are important to our \ncountry's future.\n  All of these areas--conservation, including retrofitting buildings; \nthe first ever renewable electric standard; building an interstate \nhighway of transmission capability; high-voltage transmission so you \ncan collect energy where the wind blows and the Sun shines and put it \non a wire and send it to where it is needed in the load centers--all of \nthat was part of the bill that was passed out of the Energy Committee 1 \nyear ago this month. That is, in my judgment, what is achievable to get \nto the floor of the Senate, and then it is open for amendments. That \ndoes not exclude, by the way, any other amendments people wish to offer \nthat can achieve the 60 votes, once it is on the floor, that can \naddress climate change.\n  As I said before, there is something to climate change, as far as I \nam concerned. We would be fools not to recognize and fools not to \naddress it. The question is not whether; it is when and how.\n  I said before that I would support capping carbon and I would support \npricing carbon. I also said I will not support what is called cap and \ntrade because I do not intend to give Wall Street a trillion-dollar \ncarbon securities market to trade so they can tell us what the cost of \nour energy is going to be. But that aside, I really think it is \nimportant that we not end this year without doing an energy bill that \nadvances this country's energy and national security.\n  Let me mention one additional item very quickly; that is, yesterday \nthere was a hearing in the Armed Services Committee with respect to the \nnomination of General Petraeus to assume command in Afghanistan. I am \nnot going to speak at length about this. I fully support General \nPetraeus and this nomination. I think the President has made an \nexcellent choice. By the way, I don't think he had much choice but to \nreplace General McChrystal, and replacing him with General Petraeus \nmakes a great deal of sense to me.\n  I wish to say with respect to Afghanistan that I think it is long \npast the time for us to have a very significant discussion about \nAfghanistan. The President has indicated the potential withdrawal date \nbeginning on July 1 of next year, 2011. But I think that even before \nthat, we need to have a discussion in this country about what our role \nis in Afghanistan. What, in fact, is victory in Afghanistan? Are we \nfighting al-Qaida? Are we fighting terrorists in Afghanistan or are we \nfighting insurgents in Afghanistan? What about the Afghanistan \nGovernment and President Karzai? What is achievable?\n  Every day, we are sending young men and women to fight in a war, and \nmany--I should not say ``many''--a number of them will lose their \nlives. We go on almost ``out of sight out of\n\n[[Page S5677]]\n\nmind,'' not thinking about it, not debating it nearly enough. What is \nit we are achieving? We have been at war for nearly 8 years, spending a \ngreat deal of money--lost treasure and lost lives. By the way, with \nrespect to treasure, not a penny of it has been paid for.\n  I think it is time for us to have a good discussion in this country \nabout what are we doing? How long will we do it? What is victory? What \nis achievable? Should we, in fact, be engaged in a long-term war \nagainst insurgents in that country? Where is al-Qaida? We know where it \nis in part: northern Pakistan. Where is al-Qaida? What is this--a war \nagainst terror or is it a war against insurgents?\n  My own view is that I think it is highly unlikely, no matter how long \nthis country is in Afghanistan, that we will ever be successful in the \nrural tribal lands of Afghanistan. But my hope and my desire is to want \nthe best for this country. I think the best will be achieved if we have \na thoughtful, good, full, complete discussion as a nation about what \nour objectives are, how we achieve those objectives, and when, at last, \nat long, long last, we can bring troops home and be in a position where \nwe are not saying America at this point is at war. We need to be \naddressing the terrorist threat across this planet, and that will take \nus a long while, but I think that is a very different circumstance than \nbeing engaged in the fight in Afghanistan as it currently exists.\n  I yield the floor.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, tomorrow evening, I think at about 5:30, \nwe are going to have a vote that is going to immediately impact over 1 \nmillion people across the country, and millions more after that, if we \ndo not extend unemployment benefits as we have done in every recession, \nDemocratic or Republican President, throughout our history.\n  Anytime we have seen the unemployment rate, I believe at about 7.5 \npercent, above 7.5 percent or so, we have extended unemployment \ninsurance benefits--insurance benefits--because you pay in and then \nwhen you are not working, you receive benefits. We have done that \nthroughout our history for two reasons: No. 1, because we acknowledge \nwhat happens to a family when someone in the family loses their job, \nwhen the breadwinner can't bring home any bread; and No. 2, because we \nknow it stimulates the economy. Every economist, from the right to the \nleft, has agreed that the best way to stimulate the economy is to \nprovide dollars to people who are forced to spend it, because they \ndon't have a job. So someone who receives that $250 or $300 a week--it \nis not enough to do much on, but it is enough to pay the rent, enough \nto buy some food, enough to pay the electric bill; maybe get the kids \nsome clothes, maybe put some gas in the car so they can continue to \nlook for work. So we know it not only stimulates the economy, but it is \nthe right thing to do from the standpoint of ethics, morals, values.\n  Tomorrow, we are going to have an opportunity to see whether there \nare 60 colleagues in the Senate who are willing to vote to stop a \nfilibuster that has now gone on--I believe this is the ninth week--\nactually, 8 weeks on a jobs bill that included unemployment benefits \nextension--and then this week, the ninth week on the bill that we are \nfocusing on, including unemployment benefits. It will also do something \nimportant for people who have used the first-time home buyer tax credit \nthat runs out at the end of this month, which has been a great \nstimulus, another part of the Recovery Act that has been very important \nto the economy. It runs out, and we want people who haven't yet closed \non their homes not to lose the ability to have a credit, so the bill \nwill also include extending the home buyers credit implementation until \nOctober.\n  I understand there is a willingness and strong bipartisan support to \nhelp first-time home buyers but not to help the people who are out of \nwork and probably are going to lose their houses, which I continue to \nnot understand. I am grateful because I know we have at least one, \nmaybe two Republican colleagues who will join with us to stop the \nfilibuster. I am grateful for that. But we need at least three \nRepublican colleagues to join with us in order to get this done \ntomorrow night.\n  We hear a lot of debate, a lot of discussion, a lot of arguments from \nthe people who say: We are happy to extend unemployment benefits; we \njust want to pay for it.\n  That sounds great on the surface, unless you know the full history of \nhow unemployment insurance works and the other kinds of decisions we \nmake as a body. We have always funded unemployment benefit extensions \nthrough something called emergency spending. As I have said before, if \n15 million people being out of work in America isn't an emergency, I \ndon't know what is. That is more people than are affected by a \nhurricane or a flood or a tornado or an agricultural disaster. We have \ntraditionally done this because it was the right thing to do as an \nemergency, but also because, again, we lose the economic stimulus, the \neconomic benefit, if we don't do it that way.\n  For two reasons we have always done it this way. It is interesting \nthat folks who argue passionately that we should not worry about the \ndeficit if we are expanding the estate tax cut for the top 200 or 300 \nfamilies in America, then deficits don't matter--or the top tax \nbracket, with the tax cuts under President Bush. Deficits don't matter \nto them. But, boy, they matter if we are talking about people who are \nout of work.\n  I talk to people every day in my State, people who have never been \nwithout a job in their lives. They are horrified they can't find a job. \nThey are looking for a job every day. They want to work, but they are \nin an economy they didn't create, where right now there are five people \nlooking for every one job. That is better than last year when it was \nsix people looking for every one job. We know that because of what we \nhave done with the Recovery Act, we are slowly coming out of the hole, \nbut we have a long way to go yet.\n  Certainly, this isn't the time to filibuster jobs bills, whether it \nbe small business or the jobs bill that we have been trying to pass in \nthe last 8 weeks. It certainly isn't the time to say we are just tired \nof hearing about those people who are out of work; it is tiresome. Some \npeople say that. They are tired of hearing about the unemployed.\n  Well, people in Michigan are tired of being unemployed. They want to \nwork. They know how to work. They have worked their whole lives. It is \nnot their fault that the crisis happened on Wall Street that dried up \ncredit, that stopped manufacturers and small businesses from getting \nloans to be able to continue to do business. It is not their fault that \nthey lost their savings or their 401(k)s or their pensions. It is not \ntheir fault we didn't enforce the trade laws in this country and lost 6 \nmillion manufacturing jobs under the previous administration because \nthe focus was on cheap products rather than American jobs. That is not \ntheir fault.\n  It was not their fault that we continue to have tax incentives that \npromote jobs going overseas, which we want to do away with in the jobs \nbill. It is not their fault.\n\n[[Page S5678]]\n\n  Mr. President, I want to read one e-mail out of the thousands I \nreceive. I received it today. It is from Serena in Dearborn, MI. It \nsays:\n\n       Senator Stabenow, the argument by the Republicans seems to \n     be that they don't want to strap ``our children and \n     grandchildren'' with the debts of their parents; however, I \n     believe they are talking about their children and not mine. I \n     say this because my children will be homeless and hungry in \n     the next week or so.\n       A lot more damage is going to be done in the here and now \n     than anyone realizes. If they are talking about the numbers \n     of people being taken off unemployment insurance benefits, \n     they are talking about families, not just adults. Families. I \n     have two sons; where are we going to live, and how are we \n     going to survive?\n       I wonder how many of these ``intelligent'' people went to \n     college and paid for it all as they went and did not incur \n     any debt? I am attending college currently and I am incurring \n     debt because I plan, in the future, to be able to pay back \n     the money with my new, better paying job. That is how most \n     people have to do it, invest in the future and know that you \n     are doing something not just for yourself but also for the \n     country, become a positive influence on the society.\n       I don't know what I am going to do with my children, how I \n     am going to pay my rent and utilities, have food to eat and \n     gas to put into my car, so I can continue going to school and \n     looking for work. I have never been without a job before.\n\n  Mr. President, that is a story that is repeated hundreds of \nthousands, in fact, unfortunately, millions of times across this \ncountry right now. People who are doing what we have asked them to do; \nthey are caring for their children, many going back to school and \ntrying to do a different career or upgrade their skills to give them \nsomething that gives them an edge in the job market to be able to get a \njob. But they are using unemployment benefits to keep them between \nbeing on the street and having a roof over their heads.\n  That is not some political rhetoric. That is what is happening to \npeople. It doesn't have to happen to people. Serena, in Dearborn, MI, \ndoesn't have to become homeless in a week or so. She doesn't have to, \nif we can come together and override this filibuster on unemployment \nbenefits. We just need 60 people to support it in order to be able to \nget this done. I fear for Serena and for the tens of thousands of \npeople in my State if we don't do this--and the millions who find \nthemselves in a situation across the country.\n  We will never get out of deficit with over 15 million people out of \nwork. This idea that suddenly now nothing matters but deficits ignores \nhow we are going to get out of deficit. Back in the 1990s, when we \nactually balanced the budget, I was proud to do so. I think it was in \n1997, when I was in the House under President Clinton. Part of what we \ndid was focus on work, jobs, and education, and 22 million people got \nnew jobs--22 million new jobs were created, and we came out of deficit. \nThat is what we believe. That is what our Democratic majority believes, \nthat you focus on work, you focus on small businesses getting capital, \nand manufacturers getting back to hiring people, and you focus on jobs. \nThen you lift us up out of deficit because people are working and \nbuying things and paying their taxes, and they are part of the economy. \nIt can't just be about a few people in our country.\n  We will not have a strong country if somehow the policies are only \nset for a privileged few. We have been different from other countries \nbecause we have had this strong middle class, which we are losing as a \nresult of the policies, yes, in the last administration, and the \ndeficits that were created, and we are losing it because we cannot get \npast filibusters now to move forward on a jobs agenda and help people \nwho are out of work to be able to continue to live.\n  The Recovery Act that was put in place last year has worked, but \nthere is much more to do. It stopped us from going over the cliff and \nbegan to turn things around. But there is much more to do. Somehow, \njust saying that, well, Wall Street is doing better--despite the ups \nand downs on Wall Street--and things are kind of doing OK now for those \nfolks, so we are done ignores what is going on for way too many people \nin this country.\n  Mr. President, I think the latest poll I saw was that 47 percent of \nthe people in my State have someone in their immediate family who has \nlost their job, and their family is impacted by that. That is \nastounding. We don't have the highest unemployment rate anymore; we \nhave the second highest rate. I am sure that can be said of Nevada, \nRhode Island, California, and around the country.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to set aside the election politics, set \naside whatever it is that has been getting in the way of getting this \ndone, and be willing to look at what is happening for real families \nright now and how we can make sure that Serena isn't homeless with her \ntwo children in a couple of weeks and how millions of other Americans \ncan be able to continue to care for their families while they look for \nwork.\n  Then the most important thing we can do is partner with business, \ncreate the atmosphere and incentives to create that work. That is our \njob. I am laser-focused on that as well.\n  I see my distinguished friend from New Jersey. I will yield the floor \nto him and thank him for his passionate support for the people in this \ncountry who just want a fair shake. I thank the Presiding Officer, as \nwell, for his passion and commitment to jobs and making sure we move \nour country forward by paying attention to the great middle class of \nthis country, who need us to fight for them. That is what we are doing \nin the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the daily digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Lautenberg are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to speak for a few minutes in two \nareas, if the Chair can let me know when 10 minutes has expired.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator will be so notified.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Graham are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the cloture \nvote on the motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate \namendment to H.R. 4213 with amendment No. 4425 occur at 8 o'clock \ntonight, and that any time until then be equally divided and controlled \nbetween the two leaders or their designees; that upon the conclusion of \nthis vote, if cloture is not invoked, the majority leader be recognized \nto enter a motion to reconsider the vote by which cloture was not \ninvoked; that upon the conclusion of this vote, the Senate then proceed \nen bloc to the consideration of Calendar No. 455, H.R. 5623, and H.R. \n5569, which is at the desk; that the bills be read a third time, \npassed, and the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table en bloc; \nthat any statements relating to these measures be printed in the Record \nwith no intervening action or debate.\n  Does the Senator from Texas wish to speak?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I would appreciate, Mr. Leader, if I could ask a \nquestion.\n  Mr. REID. We will have the vote start at about 3 after 8. Is that OK?\n\n[[Page S5679]]\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is fine.\n  Parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. REID. That will give the Senator time to talk.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Is the flood insurance bill that was passed by the \nHouse that will extend flood insurance for those coastal State people \nin what the leader just read.\n  Mr. REID. Yes. I was able to work that out with Senator Landrieu a \nshort time ago so we could do that now.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. OK. I was very anxious to get it done. So we can start the \nvote at 8 o'clock, if the Senator gets through speaking.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the leader very much.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Texas.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, in the couple minutes before the vote \nstarts, I just want to say this is a huge move for the people of the \ngulf coast who have been trying to purchase flood insurance under the \nNational Flood Insurance Program that lapsed June 1. The hardship is \nthat, of course, we are going into hurricane season. Private insurance \nis not available on the coast for floods right now, so the Federal \nprogram is all there is.\n  People have not been able to close on housing contracts, on purchases \nof houses, because flood insurance is required and they have not been \nable to get it.\n  So Senator Landrieu, Senator Vitter, I, Senator Cornyn, Senator \nSessions, Senator Shelby, Senator Nelson, Senator LeMieux--everyone has \nbeen very concerned about this if we represent a border State--and \nSenator Cochran and Senator Wicker.\n  So we have been pressing, and I know there have been a lot of \ncompeting interests. But it is very important we are passing the bill \nthat has passed the House already. It will be sent to the President, \nand the people of the gulf coast will once again be able to purchase \nthat flood insurance, as we see a tropical storm moving toward our gulf \ncoast as we speak. So it is certainly timely. It will certainly be a \nrelief, and the extension will be until September 30. So the people who \nwant to purchase insurance, which, of course, they need and will know \nthey are covered, will be covered.\n\n  I thank the Chair. I thank the leader as well.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I originally said 8:03. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the vote begin now.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order and \npursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending \ncloture motion, which the clerk will state.\n  The assistant bill clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. \n     4213, the American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act, with a \n     Reid amendment No. 4425.\n         Harry Reid, Max Baucus, Jack Reed, Edward E.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory \nquorum call has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to concur with amendment No. 4425 in the House amendment to the \nSenate amendment to H.R. 4213, the American Workers, State, and \nBusiness Relief Act of 2010, shall be brought to a close?\n  The yeas and nays are mandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris).

Mr. President, let me just say briefly, once again, \nthe majority wants to make this debate about Republicans opposing \nsomething. Let me make it clear that we have offered ways of paying for \nthese programs, and we have been eager to approve them. But we cannot \nsupport job-killing taxes and adding tens of billions to the already \nunsustainable national debt. So the only reason the unemployment \nextension has not passed is because our friends on the other side \nsimply refuse to pass a bill that does not add to the debt. That is it. \nThat is the only difference between what they have offered and what we \nhave offered.\n  In a moment, I will offer a 2-month extension of the expired \nunemployment insurance benefits. This extension would be fully paid \nusing the very same stimulus funds 57 Democrats, including my friend \nthe majority leader, voted to redirect for these same purposes. Let me \nrepeat that. We would pay for this extension with a Democrat-approved \nstimulus offset. This extension we will offer would cover the month of \nJune, when benefits have lapsed, and it would cover next month, so we \nwill have time to further debate these proposals.\n  If the Democrats object to extending these programs using their own \nstimulus offset to pay for them, then they will be saying loudly and \nclearly that their commitment to deficit spending trumps their desire \nto help the unemployed. So let's be clear about the principle that is \nreally at stake here: Are Democrats willing to extend these programs \nwithout--without--adding to the debt? That is the real question in this \ndebate.\n  Therefore, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4853; that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the McConnell amendment at the desk be \nagreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, \nand the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, my friend the \nRepublican leader knows full well that everything in the so-called \nextenders package was paid for. It was paid for because it was the \nright thing to do. We, as a Congress--Democrats and Republicans--have \nalways extended unemployment benefits because it is an emergency. \nPresident Reagan did it for almost 3 years. President Bush did it for a \ncouple years. It has been going on on a bipartisan basis when times are \ntough in America.\n  This is only an excuse the Republicans have. We only needed one more \nRepublican to get this done. And I so appreciate the two good Senators \nfrom Maine for recognizing that these people who are unemployed deserve \nthis.\n  Mark Zandi, John McCain's chief economic adviser, said that for every \n$1 spent on someone who is unemployed with unemployment compensation, \n$1.61 is returned.\n  For people to talk about, there are jobs out there and that all they \nhave to\n\n[[Page S5682]]\n\ndo is go look for them--for every job in America, there are five people \nlooking for that job. It is better than it was. Just a short time ago, \nit was one job for every six job applicants.\n  So I understand and I think the American people understand what the \nRepublicans are doing, and I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5682-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5682-S5683]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         NOMINATIONS DISCHARGED\n\n  Mr. CARPER.

BYRD\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, the Senate has lost its most talented, \ndedicated, and best-informed Member about the precedents, rules, and \ncustoms of the Senate, when the distinguished President pro tempore, \nRobert Byrd, passed away to join his beloved wife Erma in the heaven he \nwas confident existed for those who were true believers.\n  I had the good fortune to work closely with Robert Byrd as a fellow \nmember of the Appropriations Committee for 30 years. I served as the \nranking minority member when he was chairman and as chairman when he \nwas the ranking minority member. I preferred being chairman. But I \nthoroughly enjoyed the opportunities to conduct the hearings, schedule \nthe committee markups, and negotiate with our House colleagues to \nformulate and pass the bills that funded the departments of the \nexecutive branch, the judiciary, and the Congress.\n  One of the highlights of my experience with Robert Byrd was a trip we \ntook to several European capitals. He was comfortable discussing our \nmutual interests and differences with the leaders of other nations. His \nmastery of European history and politics was as impressive as his well-\ninformed understanding of American history and politics.\n  On one leg of our trip, Senator Byrd asked my wife Rose to come sit \nby him.\n\n[[Page S5684]]\n\nHe wanted to dictate something to her. He started a recitation with \nnames that were not familiar to me, but eventually Rose realized that \nhe was reciting from memory the names of the monarchs of Great Britain, \nthe United Kingdom as we know it, and in the order in which each had \nserved throughout the entire history of that great country. It was an \nunbelievable performance, reflecting an awesome ability of recall, and \na reverential appreciation of a nation which has been our closest ally \nin recent history.\n  Robert Byrd was not only my friend but a mentor, an example of \ndedicated, disciplined, and determined leadership. I will miss him, but \nI will always remember his legacy of seriousness of purpose, and his \nlove for the Senate, its role in the legislative process, its powers of \nadvise and consent, and its continuity that has helped make our \ngovernment the most respected in the world.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I want to take a few moments today about \none of the best teachers I have ever known: Senator Robert C. Byrd.\n  The man we lost this week is known for many things: as the longest \nserving member of Congress in the Nation's history; as an accomplished \nlegislator; as an author and historian; as a self-made man who reached \nexalted heights, yet never forgot the coal miners and the families of \nthe mountain home community from which he came. I think of him as a \nteacher, one who began teaching me from the moment I came to the U.S. \nSenate, and one whose lessons I sought right up to the time he was \ntaken from us this week.\n  Serving as a new Senator in the majority means, among other things, \nhours spent in this Chamber, presiding over the Senate. I was fortunate \nthat for many of my early years here, I spent much of that time in the \nPresiding Officer's chair listening to Senator Byrd speak on the \nhistory of this body, its traditions and practices, and its historic \ndebt to another great body that played a major role in mankind's march \ntoward democratic government, the Roman senate.\n  I was learning from him two decades later, when Senator Byrd led a \nsmall group of us who filed a lawsuit and later a legal brief \nchallenging a law we believed to be unconstitutional: the law granting \nthe President the so-called line-item veto. He, like I and many others, \nsaw this law as bending the Constitution in ways that usurped \nCongress's constitutional authority and responsibility. In 1998, the \nU.S. Supreme Court agreed. The majority in that case, citing its \n``profound importance,'' concluded that the line-item veto ``may or may \nnot be desirable,'' but that it was surely not consistent with ``the \nprocedures designed by the Framers of article I, section 7 of the \nConstitution'' the so-called presentment clause.\n  I remember standing next to Senator Byrd at a press conference \ncelebrating that victory for the Constitution, as he pulled out of his \npocket the copy of that great founding document he always carried with \nhim. A copy of the Constitution that sits today on my desk, in front of \nme at all times, was inscribed to me by Senator Robert C. Byrd.\n  I had hoped to visit with him this week to again listen and learn. In \nFebruary, Senator Byrd sent all of us, his Senate colleagues, a letter \nsetting out his position on preserving the ability to engage in \nextended debate in the Senate. It was yet another powerful defense of \nboth the enduring traditions of the Senate, and the need for \nthoughtfulness in invoking those traditions. Senator Byrd's letter \nsparked some thoughts of my own, and last week, I discussed with his \nstaff scheduling a meeting with him this week to get his take. Once \nagain, I was in need of the insight and wisdom of Senator Robert Byrd.\n  How I wish he were here today, to continue teaching us. While that \nwas not to be, the lessons of Senator Byrd's life and long service will \nendure.\n  His career is a testament to hard work and determination. This is a \nman who spent 10 years in night school classes to earn his law degree, \nwho when he focused on an issue he did so with uncommon intensity. We \ncan all learn from his commitment and grit.\n  Like any good teacher, Senator Byrd never stopped trying to learn. He \nwas a man of strong convictions who knew the value of admitting when he \nwas in error. He acknowledged that earlier in his life, he had taken \npositions and held opinions on the subject of civil rights that he \nlater regretted. When he shared those regrets, he created a powerful \nteachable moment. We can all learn from his willingness to learn and \ngrow to the very end of his life.\n  He was tireless in his defense of the role the Constitution assigns \nto the Congress, and specifically the Senate, in our democracy. In his \nletter to us in February, he wrote: ``The Senate is the only place in \ngovernment where the rights of a numerical minority are so protected.'' \nHe called those protections ``essential to the protection of the \nliberties of a free people.''\n  Whether it was Congress's constitutional obligations to render \njudgments on matters of war and peace or to exercise the power of the \npurse, Senator Byrd was a relentless fighter for the role the Founding \nFathers carefully set out for us. He was not defending Senate authority \nfor its own sake. His passion was not for Senate prerogatives for their \nown sake, but for the brilliantly conceived constitutional balance of \npowers essential to our freedoms. He passionately believed that we must \nnot yield one ounce of the authority that the Constitution entrusts to \nthe peoples' elected representatives. We can all learn from the \nconviction, the dedication and the intellectual power he brought to \nthat cause, to the end of making it our cause. Let the mission he so \neloquently espoused be our mission, though our power to persuade be far \nless than Senator Byrd's.\n  Robert Byrd had many loves--his late, beloved wife Erma, West \nVirginia and its people, his God, and the Constitution of the nation he \ncherished. But the Senate is his special legacy. For more than two \ncenturies we have kept our traditions intact: our unique respect for \nextended debate and minority rights, and for the legislative authority \nthat the Constitution places in our hands to exercise and defend. These \ntraditions are maintained because of Senators like Robert Byrd, \nSenators who live them and fight for them. I learned more about these \nweighty issues from this great teacher than from anyone or anything in \nmy years in the Senate.\n  Robert Byrd is no longer with us, teaching us, leading us. But the \nlessons of Robert Byrd's life and career will endure, guiding all of us \nnow occupying these desks, and Senators who will occupy these desks for \nages to come.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, the Senate, in its 223-year history, has \nnever had a greater champion than Robert Byrd. West Virginia, in its \n147-year history, has never had a more powerful advocate or public \nservant than Robert Byrd.\n  Like so many Senators elected before and after me, I learned very \nquickly how passionate Robert Byrd was about this institution, its \nroots in the Constitution. As all of us remember, he had that dog-eared \ncopy of the Constitution he carried in the front pocket of his suit, \nand sometimes in the caucus or other times on the floor, he would pull \nit out to help reinforce a point he was making, even though we all knew \nhe could recite the Constitution by memory. But he consulted it often \nwithout hesitation. In its words, he reminded us that he always found \nwisdom, truth, and excitement--the same excitement he felt as a young \nboy in Wolf Creek Hollow, reading by kerosene lamp about the heroes of \nthe American Revolution and the birth of our Nation. Those words \nliterally guided him through the 58 years he spent in Washington as a \nMember of the Congress and as a Senator.\n  It is fair to say that no one knew the Senate--its history, its \ntraditions, and its precedents--better than Robert Byrd. It is all \nthere in the four-volume collection of his speeches on the Senate, \nwhich we were all privileged to receive from him.\n  Every freshman Senator got a personal crash course on the Senate's \nhistory from Robert Byrd himself. I was one of five Democratic freshmen \nelected in 1984. The class of 1984 was privileged to share some lofty \nhopes and goals. Four of the five of us eventually ran for President: \nAl Gore, Paul Simon, Tom Harkin, and myself. All of us can tell you \nthat we arrived in the Senate with a thirst for action and an \nimpatience for delay. Then-minority leader Robert Byrd didn't \ndiscourage any of\n\n[[Page S5685]]\n\nthat. In fact, he encouraged it, and he helped all of us with our \ncommittee assignments so we could push the list of our policy ideas \nthat we exuberantly believed we could and would pass into law. But in \nmeetings with us individually, he also helped each of us to see the \nbigger picture, to impress upon us the fact that one of our most \nimportant responsibilities as Senators was to be caretakers of this \ninstitution--an institution he regarded as both the morning star and \nthe evening star of the American constitutional constellation.\n  To Robert Byrd, the Senate was, as he said, ``the last bastion of \nminority rights, where a minority can be heard, where a minority can \nstand on its feet, one individual if necessary, and speak until he \nfalls into the dust.'' Indeed, earlier this year, when many of us felt \nfrustration over the Senate's rules governing filibusters--\nspecifically, the requirement of 60 votes to cut off debate--Robert \nByrd cautioned against amending the rules to facilitate expeditious \naction by a simple majority. In a letter sent to all of us, he observed \nthat:\n\n       The occasional abuse of the rules has been, at times, a \n     painful side effect of what is otherwise the Senate's \n     greatest purpose--the right to extended, or even unlimited, \n     debate.\n       The Senate is the only place in government where the rights \n     of a numerical minority are still protected.\n\n  He added:\n\n       Majorities change with elections. A minority can be right, \n     and minority views can certainly improve legislation. . . . \n     Extended deliberations and debate--when employed \n     judiciously--protect every Senator, and the interests of \n     their constituency, and are essential to the protection of \n     the liberties of a free people.\n\n  Robert Byrd also impressed upon us the fact that we did not serve \n``under'' any President; that as a separate but equal branch of \ngovernment, we served ``with'' Presidents, acted as a check on the \nexecutive's power. Robert Byrd was the longest serving Member of \nCongress in all of our Nation's history, and as such he served with 11 \nPresidents.\n  At no time in his career was Robert Byrd's defense of legislative \nprerogatives more pronounced and more eloquent than in arguing against \ngranting the Bush administration's broad power to wage preemptive war \nagainst Iraq. He chided the Senate for standing ``passively mute . . . \nparalyzed by our own uncertainty,'' ceding its war powers to President \nBush.\n  Robert Byrd was, as we all know, a lot more than the guardian of the \nSenate. He was a major figure in the great panorama of American history \nover more than half a century. He was a thinker--thinking and \nreevaluating more in his eighties and nineties than many Senators do in \na lifetime. He was an ardent supporter of the Vietnam war but surprised \nmany with his fierce opposition to President Bush's invasion of Iraq. \nHe was a protector of West Virginia's coal industry but came to accept \nthe mounting scientific data of global warming and took part in finding \na solution. To do otherwise, he said, would be ``to stick our heads in \nthe sand.''\n  Robert Byrd cast more than 18,500 votes in the Senate--a record that \nwill never be equalled. His last vote was June 17 against a Republican \nproposal to prevent the extension of unemployment benefits. Earlier \nthis year, even with his health failing, he cast one of the most \nhistoric votes of his career in support of legislation to expand health \ncare to all Americans--the life work of his old and departed friend Ted \nKennedy.\n  Whether he voted with you or against you, it was never hard ideology \nwith Robert Byrd. He had no use for narrow partisanship that trades on \nattack and values only victory. I learned that as a candidate for \nPresident in 2004 when Senator Byrd came to my defense after opponents \naimed religious smears at me. I was forever grateful to him for doing \nthat.\n  It all began one Sunday when Senator Byrd was home in West Virginia \nand found that a brochure had been inserted in a church bulletin saying \nthat if elected President, I would ban the Bible. Senator Byrd \nexploded. ``No one side has the market on Christianity or belief in \nGod,'' said this born-again Baptist. Later at a rally in Beckley, he \naccused my opponents of having ``improperly hijacked the issue of \nfaith'' and said that the suggestion that I intended to ban the Bible \nwas ``trash and a lie.''\n  But Senator Byrd was not done. He also went to the Senate floor to \ndenounce this kind of politics:\n\n       Paid henchmen who talk about Democratic politicians who are \n     eager to ban the Bible obviously think that West Virginians \n     are gullible, ignorant fools. They must think that West \n     Virginians just bounced off the turnip truck. But the people \n     of West Virginia are smarter than that. We are not country \n     bumpkins who will swallow whatever garbage some high-priced \n     political consultant makes up.\n\n  That was Robert Byrd telling it the way he thought.\n  Anytime Senator Byrd spoke, any of us who had the privilege of \nserving with him remember his speeches were filled with as many Bible \nreferences as historical references. When the Senator spoke, the Senate \nkind of came to a halt. Senators would lean forward and listen, as they \ndid not necessarily do otherwise, and learn.\n  It is fitting that this teacher in the Senate, this guardian of the \nSenate, will lie in state in this Chamber on the floor of the \ninstitution he revered and which also had so much respect for him. He \nis as much a part of this Chamber in many ways as the historic desks or \ngalleries or the busts of Senate presidents.\n  He ran for public office 15 times, and he never lost. He was first \nelected to the West Virginia legislature in 1946 and served three terms \nin the House of Representatives before his election to the Senate. It \nis no wonder that he was such a keen observer of politics.\n  I remember when I decided to run in 2004, I went to talk with Senator \nByrd. His advice, in fact, was among the first I sought. He advised me \nto ``go to West Virginia,'' ``get a little coal dust'' on my hands and \nface and ``live in spirit with the working people.'' In keeping with \nhis advice, I did just that. What a great experience it was.\n  He was deeply proud of West Virginia and its people. He proudly \ndefended his work to invest Federal dollars in his State, the kind of \nspending that some people deride as pork. Robert Byrd knew it was \nsomething else. It was opportunity for his people. He took pride in the \nway that Federal funding helped to lift the economy of West Virginia, \none of the ``rock bottomest of States,'' as he put it. He breathed new \nlife into so many communities across that State with funding for \nhighways, hospitals, universities, research institutes, scholarships, \nand housing--all the time giving people the opportunities that he knew \nso many West Virginians of his generation never had. ``You take those \nthings away, imagine, it would be blank,'' he once said.\n  Robert Byrd's journey was, in many ways, America's journey. He came \nof age in an America segregated by race. But like America, he changed, \neven repenting, and he made amends. Not only did he come to regret his \nsegregationist past, but he became an ardent advocate of all kinds of \ncivil rights legislation, including a national holiday honoring Dr. \nMartin Luther King. And in the end, Robert Byrd endorsed Barack Obama \nfor President. ``I have lived with the weight of my own youthful \nmistakes my whole life, like a millstone around my neck,'' he wrote in \n2008. ``And I accept that those mistakes will forever be mentioned when \npeople talk about me. I believe I have learned from those mistakes. I \nknow I've tried very hard to do so.''\n  That is the expression of a man with a big heart and a big mind.\n  The moments that define most men's lives are few. Not so with Robert \nByrd. He devoted his life to Erma and his family and to public service, \ncompiling an extraordinary record of accomplishment and service in more \nthan half a century in Congress. His mastery of Senate rules and \nparliamentary procedure was legendary. His devotion to his colleagues \nand to this institution was unequaled. And his contributions to his \nState and to the Nation were monumental.\n  Robert Byrd spent most of his life making sure the Senate remained \nwhat the Founding Fathers intended it to be: a citadel of law, of \norder, of liberty, the anchor of the Republic. And in doing so, he \ntakes his place among the giants of the Senate, such as Daniel Webster, \nJohn C. Calhoun and, of course, his and our dear friend Ted Kennedy.\n  May Robert Byrd rest in peace.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise to celebrate the life and career of \nSenator Robert C. Byrd. I have been in\n\n[[Page S5686]]\n\nthe body now since 2002, and Senator Byrd will go down in history as \nnot only the longest serving Senator to date--maybe forever--but also \nas one of the most effective Members of the Senate.\n  He was tough. During his prime, they tell me, there was no tougher \nopponent and no better ally than to have Senator Byrd on your side. And \nwhen he was on the other side, you had a long day ahead of you.\n  He talked about his early life. He is a human being, like the rest of \nus. I think what he was able to do for his people in West Virginia, and \nthe country as a whole, will stand the test of time, and he will be \nviewed for many things, not just one. That is the way it should be for \nall of us.\n  I had the pleasure of getting to know him when I first came to the \nSenate and I walked into one hell of a fight over judges. The Senate \nwas in full battle over the filibustering of judges. The Senate had \ngone down a road it had never gone down before--an open resistance to \nthe judicial nominations of President Bush across the board. The body \nwas about to explode. There were 55 Republicans at the time, and we all \nbelieved that what our Democratic colleagues were doing was \nunprecedented, unnecessary, and, quite frankly, dangerous to the \njudiciary. I am sure they had their view, too, and everybody has a \nreason for what they do around here.\n  The Gang of 14--affectionately known by some, and discussed by \nothers--was formed during that major historical moment in the Senate. I \nremember talking to some observers of the Senate who were telling me \nthat if the rules were changed to allow a simple majority vote for the \nconfirmation of judges, that would take the Senate down a road it had \nnever gone down before, and where it would stop, nobody knew. At the \nsame time, there was another constitutional concept that meant a lot to \nme and to others, and that is that people deserve a vote when they are \nnominated by the President.\n  Well, Senator Byrd and 13 other Senators--and he was a big leader in \nthis--came up with the compromise called ``extraordinary \ncircumstances.'' We agreed that we would not filibuster judges unless \nthere was an extraordinary circumstance. We understood that elections \nhad consequences. What we had in mind was that we would reserve our \nright to filibuster only if the person did not meet the qualification \ntest. I believe the advise and consent role of the Senate has to be \nrecognized, and I respect elections but not a blank check. So there is \nalways the ability of any Senator here, or a group of Senators, to \nstand up and to object--one party versus the other--if you believe the \nperson is not qualified.\n  The second issue we dealt with was that we all reserved unto \nourselves the ability to object if we thought the person was an \nactivist judge--a political person who was going to be put on the bench \nand the robe used to carry out the political agenda rather than to \ninterpret the law.\n  The law meant a lot to Senator Byrd--the Constitution did. One of my \ncherished possessions is a signed copy of the Constitution, given to \nall the members of the Gang of 14. That is just one example of where \nvery late in life he made a huge impact on the Senate. As history \nrecords that moment, I daresay it is probably one of his finest hours. \nBecause the consequences of not resolving that dispute the way we did \ncould have changed the Senate rules forever, and I think the judiciary \nfor the worse. So we have a lot to celebrate.\n  His family, I know, mourns the loss of their loved one; the people of \nWest Virginia, their best champion has passed. But we all pass. It is \nwhat we leave behind that counts, and I think he has left a lot behind \nand something both Republicans and Democrats can be proud of. Even \nthough you disagreed with him, as I did on many occasions, I had \nnothing but respect for the man. He was a true guardian of the Senate \nand what it stands for.\n  I don't think we will ever find anybody who loved the institution \nmore than Senator Byrd. He will be missed. But the best way we can \nhonor his memory is to try to follow in his footsteps when it comes to \nmaking sure the constitutional role of the Senate is adhered to, and \nthat we understand the Senate is not the House, the Senate is not the \nexecutive branch, the Senate is something special, and let us keep it \nthat way.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I rise to pay tribute to an extraordinary \nSenator--Robert Byrd of West Virginia. Chairman Byrd was the longest \nserving Senator in the history of this country. He served with \nextraordinary distinction not only on behalf of the people of West \nVirginia but on behalf of all of us.\n  The great lesson of his life is that through constant self-\nimprovement, through constant education, not only can one rise to great \nheights but one can also contribute to one's country and community.\n  Senator Byrd was born in very humble circumstances. At his birth, I \ndo not think anyone would have predicted he would become the longest \nserving Senator in the history of the United States. In fact, \ntragically, within a year of his birth, his mother passed away, and he \nwent to live with his father's sister. But in those difficult \ncircumstances in West Virginia, he rose above it through tenacious \neffort, through hard work.\n  Through his life's path, he had an extraordinary companion, the love \nof his life--Erma. Together they not only had a family but they built a \nlife of service to others. I know how dear his dear Erma was to Senator \nByrd.\n  Their children, Mona, Marjorie, their sons-in-law, their \ngrandchildren, and their great-grandchildren all at this moment are \nreflecting on the wonderful person Robert Byrd was, how much he meant \nto them, and also I hope recognizing how much he meant to all of us. In \nthis very difficult moment, I am sure his memory and his example will \nsustain them as it sustains all of us.\n  Senator Byrd, from these humble circumstances through hard work in \nshipyards, in the coal fields of West Virginia, rose up. He rose up \nbecause of his incredible talent, not only intellectual talent, but I \nhad the great good fortune once to hear him play the fiddle. Anyone who \ncan play a fiddle like that has great hope of employment, at least in \nthe musical world. But he went beyond that.\n  Again the lesson Senator Byrd teaches us all is constant striving. He \nwas someone who received his law degree while a member of the Congress, \nthe first and perhaps only person to go to law school while he was also \nserving the people of West Virginia and the Congress.\n  He wrote what is regarded as the foremost history of the Senate, not \nonly this Senate but also the Roman Senate. He did that because he was \ncommitted to finding out about history, about life, about human \nchallenges, about great human endeavors, and using that knowledge to \nhelp others.\n  He was someone whom we all revered. When I arrived in the Senate, he \nwas gracious and kind and helpful. I can always remember he would greet \nme as ``my captain.'' He had a deep affection for those who served, \neven someone as myself who did not serve at the same level of \ndistinction as Dan Inouye, John Kerry, John McCain, and others. He is \nsomeone who helped and supported me, and I appreciated very much his \nkindness.\n  I also appreciate the passion he brought in defense of the \nConstitution of the United States and the passion he brought to ensure \nthe Senate and the Congress played its rightful role in the \ndeliberations of this government.\n  He would say quite often that he had not served under numerous \nPresidents; he had served with them as a Senator, in the legislature, a \ncoequal branch of government. He fought not simply for personal \nprerogatives, he fought for principle, that this government would be \nbased on, as our Founding Fathers' designed it, the interplay between \nthe executive, legislative, and judicial branches. His passion for the \nConstitution was evident and obvious.\n  He also was passionate in the last few years about the foreign policy \nof the United States. He spoke with eloquence and with passion against \nour engagement in Iraq. He saw it, as now it is becoming clearer and \nclearer, as a strategic distraction from the true challenge, which was \nto defeat our opponents, al-Qaida and their affiliated terrorist \ngroups, and to do that to protect this country.\n  He was a remarkable man, born of humble origin, self-educated, \nunceasingly educating himself and always\n\n[[Page S5687]]\n\nseeking to better and improve himself. I would suspect in his last few \ndays he was still striving to learn more.\n  I simply close by thanking him for his service, thanking his family \nfor supporting him in his service, and thanking the people of West \nVirginia for their wisdom in sending Robert Byrd to the U.S. Congress \nand the U.S. Senate.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to \nspeak on a couple of different subjects. Briefly I wish to say a few \nwords about our extraordinary and great colleague who has left the \nSenate and left this world, but his spirit will be here for many years \nto come and his presence will be felt here for decades, if literally \nnot centuries, and the extraordinary contribution that Senator Robert \nByrd of West Virginia has made to the Congress, to the Senate, to our \ncountry, and to the world.\n  My colleague, the Senator from Rhode Island, gave a beautiful tribute \na few minutes ago. I was in the Chamber and listened to what he said. I \nwish to add that not only did Robert Byrd rise up through educating \nhimself--in these days that is almost a foreign concept to so many \npeople. You go to school, you get a degree--but he did all of that and \nmore. He read so much. He was so curious about so many aspects of life, \nnot just politics, not just government, but industry, art, and music \nthat literally he was one of the most inspirational human beings I have \never had the pleasure to know or ever read about in that sense.\n  Senator Reed said he lifted himself from literally an orphan status \nin one of the poorest communities in the world, West Virginia. Parts of \nit are much like a few parts of our country that are extraordinarily \npoor, even by world standards.\n  He came from a very humble, orphaned beginning with virtually no \nchance at anything much, and ended up, we know, sitting at that desk, \nwhich is one of the great desks of honor in this Chamber. As people who \nwork here know, the longer one is here, the closer one gets to the \ncenter aisle. Since he held up the center aisle literally with his \npresence every day, one cannot get any more senior than that desk. We \nlook at it now these days and are reminded of him.\n  He lifted himself, he lifted his family, but I would say in that \nearnest curious way, he lifted an entire State and an entire Nation. \nThere are not many individuals who can say that their life actually did \nthat. But Robert Byrd is one of them. West Virginia today is lifted so \nmuch higher. The children of West Virginia, the families of West \nVirginia, the communities of West Virginia literally were lifted by the \nstrength--the spiritual and intellectual strength--and courage and \ntenacity of a man for whom there is no peer in this room relative to \nthat, and our Nation across decades, through many of the great trials \nof this Nation. He lifted this Nation to a better place and was such a \nstrong man and such a great man that he would even admit when he made \nsome very bad mistakes, which raises him even higher in my eyes.\n  He said toward the end of his life many times that his stand on civil \nrights was not right. He apologized profusely for being on the wrong \nside of history on that issue. He did not make many mistakes such as \nthat. But he was such a great man that he admitted when he did.\n  Senator Reed recalled that he always called him ``captain,'' but \nSenator Byrd had a way of referring to each of us in a special way. He \nwould always say to me: How are you today, Senator, and how is that \nfine father of yours, Moon Landrieu? It would always make me feel so \nwonderful that he would say he was such a great mayor. How is Moon \ntoday and how is Verna? Can you imagine a gentleman with so much on his \nmind that he would always remember to me the parents I have and that we \nboth admire so much? It was a special way about him.\n  Finally, when Katrina happened and all of us on the gulf coast were \ndevastated--frankly, I could not find a great deal of comfort at the \nlevel of the administration that was in power. I never thought they \nquite understood the depths of the destruction that occurred. It \nworried me then and it still troubles me to this day. But the first \nmeeting I had with Senator Byrd, when I was trying to explain to him \nhow devastating this situation was--because it wasn't a hurricane, it \nwas a flood and the Federal levees had collapsed--he just sort of put \nhis hand out and said: Senator, have a seat. He said: I do understand, \nand I am going to work with you. I am going to help you. I am going to \nbe here for the people of Louisiana and the gulf coast as we try to get \nthis right.\n\n  Mr. President, we were shortchanged by other Members of Congress and \nby the White House. They never quite understood. When the first \nallocation of funding was given out, it was just an arbitrary number \nthrown out that we were going to take $10 billion and help the gulf \ncoast, but no State could get more than $5.4 billion. Well, when you \nlooked at the facts at the time, the numbers were so disproportionate \nto the injury that Louisiana and our people had suffered, had you done \nit on just a disaster basis--which we should have done in calculating \nit--we should have gotten $15 billion relative to that distribution.\n  When I brought those numbers to Senator Byrd, he said: We are going \nto work on it. And you know what, Mr. President, he did. Unbelievable \nas it might be to the people in this Chamber, because he was a very \npowerful chairman of the Appropriations Committee, he could actually do \nit, and he did.\n  I didn't have to explain that much or beg that much. I just had to \npresent the data to him that showed this is how many houses were \ndestroyed, this is how many homes were lost, this is what the President \ngave to X, Y and Z; what do you think, Senator Byrd? Is it fair for us? \nAnd he said: Absolutely. So he gave us literally billions of dollars.\n  Today, St. Bernard Parish, the city of New Orleans, and parishes all \nin the southern part of the State are recovering because of one person, \nSenator Byrd, the chair of the Appropriations Committee, who said: We \nare not going to leave you at your hour of greatest need.\n  I will never forget, and my State will never forget, the generosity \nand the courage it took for him to stand with us through that difficult \ntime. So I wanted to, in a small way, add my voice to the many tributes \nthat Senator Byrd has received, and those are the most important ones \nthat I wanted to share today.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is not my regular seat in the \nSenate, but I came here to stand near the place that Senator Robert C. \nByrd occupied. His absence is noted by the flowers and the black cloth \nthat covers his desk.\n  There is so much to say about Robert C. Byrd that to have a serious \ndiscussion about who and what he was would take far more time than we \nhave available. He was an unusual man, brilliant, genius, credited with \nencyclopedic knowledge.\n  When I came to the Senate in 1983, I was not a young man. I am now an \nolder man. When I came, I wanted to meet Senator Byrd. I came from the \nbusiness world. I was chairman and CEO of a significant corporation \nthat carried substantial esteem and respect for the record compiled by \nthe three of us boys from poor working-class families in Paterson, NJ, \nan industrial city that had its origins as an industrial place at the \ntime of Alexander Hamilton.\n  I was privileged to meet a lot of people who could be described as \nlofty and holding positions of importance. When I went in to Senator \nByrd's office to introduce myself--I had met him a couple of times \nbefore I was elected to the Senate seat from New Jersey--it was with \ngreat awe and respect that I sat in front of this individual who had \ngiven so much to our country, who taxed our wits and made us think more \ndeeply about our responsibilities than sometimes we have. He was a \ntower of knowledge and strength.\n  I introduced myself to him, and we had a nice chat for a while. He \nasked me about my background. I talked about my life and my \nexperiences, which are not anything like the depth of Senator Robert \nByrd's background. I came from a poor family. I served in the Army. I \nreceived my education at Columbia University because I was able to use \nthe scholarship that was given to soldiers who had served in the \nmilitary.\n  As I listened to Robert Byrd, what he had accomplished in his \nlifetime\n\n[[Page S5688]]\n\ndwarfed anything I had ever seen. He was a man born into poverty, \norphaned at an early stage in life, and turned over to relatives to be \nbrought up. He taught himself how to play the violin and attended law \nschool part time at night for years, finally getting his law degree \nfrom the university. He was an incredible figure in our time.\n  We feel his absence already. In his latest years, he was not \nfortunate enough to have the kind of health he had as a younger man, \nbut he always had the respect of everybody who knew him.\n  When we look at his history, if one has time to go to the computer \nand get a biography that is held in Wikipedia and see the more than 30 \npages' worth of his accomplishments and history, it was a privilege and \nan honor for those of us who knew him when we look at the positions he \nheld. He had elegance. He had grace. He had resilience. He was tough. \nHe had a meticulous grasp of history.\n  I came out of the computer business. I used to tease Robert C. Byrd. \nI called him ``my human computer.'' He had so much knowledge that, \nfrankly, I think it competed very ably with the computers in the early \neighties when I came to the Senate.\n  When I visited him in his office, he asked me if I knew the history \nof the monarchs of the British Empire. I said I did not know much about \nthem. I knew the recent one, the sitting monarch at the time. He \nproceeded for more than one hour to give me the history of the monarchs \nof the British Empire, starting with William the Conqueror, 1066, and \nrecalling everybody who was King or Queen of England, of the British \nEmpire. He talked about how long they served, the precise dates they \nserved, whether they died by the hand of an assassin, whether they died \nfrom a disease, whether they died from an accident. He knew all of that \ndetail. I was sitting in total bewilderment as to how one could capture \nand remember so much of that information.\n  When I asked to be excused because I had some other business, he was \nready to give me the history of the Roman Senate. He did this not like \nmost of us, with notes. He had it in his brain while he recalled \neverything he learned and did, the number of votes, where he cast them, \nand on what issue. It was remarkable.\n  He served at a period of time when we had some of the most remarkable \npeople this body has seen. Not to suggest we do not have talent equal \nto the stature of some of those who served then. It is worthy of \nmention that he was the majority leader in the Senate from January 1977 \nto January 1981 and again from 1989 to 1989, a relatively short period. \nHe preceded and served with people such as Howard Baker on the \nRepublican side, Bob Dole, Mike Mansfield, and George Mitchell. He was \nan equal with those powerhouses and stood as one of them. He stood out.\n  He revered this Senate and the process with which we then operated. \nWe are far less committed to process. Bob Byrd insisted we have the \ntime, respect, courtesy, and proper addressing of individuals, giving \nit a certain loftiness that we otherwise would not have had.\n  Nobody knew more about this body than Robert C. Byrd. He was this \nChamber's protector. He protected the Senate's rules, the Senate's \nintegrity, and he protected the Senate's civility. He taught each and \nevery one of us how the Senate works--the ins, the outs. It is hard to \nimagine serving a single day without him. He had such respect for the \nmanagement of this country of ours.\n  We should be inspired by Robert C. Byrd's legacy to become more \ncooperative and more civil in the days ahead. We ought to reflect on \nthose values tomorrow as we view Senator Byrd's casket lying in repose \nin this Chamber that he loved so dearly. He loved it so much that he \nreminded all of us from time to time--he would pick up on a phrase. \nSomeone talked about serving under President this or that President. He \nsaid: Sir, never, never under. We serve with the President of the \nUnited States. We never serve under them. We are a body of equal \nimportance. And he knew that from every possible position of \nresponsibility he held.\n  What we should do as a Senate is accept the best that Robert C. Byrd \nbrought to us, to share the image he brought to all of us and to the \nstature of this body.\n  Robert C. Byrd's journey in life was simply remarkable. He was born \ninto deep poverty, growing up without the comforts that many of us take \nfor granted, such as running water, and setting an example for all \nAmericans of what you might be if you make the effort and you have the \ndedication to a higher purpose.\n  Although he was high school valedictorian at the age of 16, he had to \nskip college because he did not have the means to pay for it. He \novercame that obstacle by becoming a self-taught man and a student of \nhistory. How did he learn to play the violin all by himself, and learn \nwhat he did about education and law?\n  He served half a century--51 years--in the Senate, holding every \ncritical position, including, as I mentioned, majority leader and \nminority leader and President pro tempore. In that position he was \nthird in line for the Presidency of the United States.\n\n  Still, he never forgot where he came from and his duty to help \neveryday people. He pleaded their case, particularly his beloved West \nVirginia, as well as across the country.\n  I had the privilege to serve with Senator Byrd when he was chairman \nof the Appropriations Committee. Some like to make light of his \nposition to fund projects in West Virginia, but there was nothing \ncynical about his life's cause to stamp out poverty in his home State \nand in this country. Senator Byrd called bringing Federal dollars back \nto his State one of his greatest achievements. He understood that a new \nschool meant a child would have a better chance for a future. A new \nsewage system meant that families might have clean water--unaccustomed \nas they were in lots of places in his home State. A new highway meant \nthat farmers and companies could bring their product and their produce \nto market in hours.\n  I will use the expression that he ``elegantized'' the beauty of the \ndeeds of working people and brought meaning to the purpose of their \nlives and their work.\n  He was a forward-looking man. He, working with all of us, recognized \nthe importance of an appropriate infrastructure--the importance of \nAmtrak, of the railroad that serves so many millions of Americans every \nyear. He was a voice for stronger rail service, knowing that could get \npeople more reliable travel so they would not be stuck in massive \ntraffic jams when they had to get someplace. It was an important part \nof an agenda that he had that was so broad.\n  Years ago, when Amtrak--a favorite part of my view of what has to \nhappen with our infrastructure--was under siege, we worked side by side \nto protect America's premier rail network from being defunded. In 2007, \nwhen the Amtrak law I authored was on this floor, we faced a difficult \nvote to defeat a killer amendment. I remember standing here as they \nwere counting the yeas and nays, and Senator Byrd had occasion to let \nhis simple yes or no ring out across this place. He put a stamp on \nthat, and that meant that he didn't like it or he did like it.\n  He wanted everybody in this place to remember that he was chairman of \nthe Appropriations Committee. He remembered when people voted with him \nand when they didn't. He couldn't stand the hypocrisy of people who \nwould say: Oh, these earmarks are terrible, and then they would put in \ntheir list. But he would remember it. It was not a good thing, to meet \nwith Robert C. Byrd's disapproval, when you wanted something; \nespecially after so hypocritically voting against something and then \nwanting that very thing for your own State.\n  We have an obligation to honor the legacy of this giant of an \nindividual, this giant of a Senator, this giant of a public servant, \nand that means never losing sight of the millions of Americans out \nthere who don't know whether they will have a home now or have a job, \nor whether they will be able to afford electricity or food or a roof to \nsleep under, or a way to take care of their children. But he reminded \nus on a constant basis what our commitment was.\n  It also means, I think in reflection, that we should be renewing our \ncommitment, as hard as it is--and it is easy to kind of pontificate \nhere--to working together. But let us look at what is happening. Let us \nlook at what\n\n[[Page S5689]]\n\nhas been happening now. I don't think this is an appropriate time to \nvoice lots of criticism, but when we see how difficult it is to move \npositive things through this institution, it is hard to understand, \nbecause the fundamentals that Robert C. Byrd brought to his work were \nthat we were here to serve the public. That was the mission.\n  Rather than standing in the way of permitting things to be \nconsidered--things of value--perhaps we ought to have a Byrd lecture to \nthe Senate-at-large every now and then and let someone who knew him or \nstudied him talk about what he brought to the Senate, in addition to \nextraordinary leadership; someone who could talk about the degree of \ncollegiality that is necessary for us to consider things--serious \nthings--and to get them done.\n  Senator Byrd recently said--and he said this on a regular basis:\n\n       The world has changed. But our responsibilities, our duties \n     as Senators have not changed. We have a responsibility, a \n     duty to the people to make our country a better place.\n\n  It would be fitting if in the shadow of his passing that we could \ntake a sledgehammer to partisan gridlock, put the unnecessary rancor \naside and start functioning in a deliberative fashion once again.\n  I thank you, Senator Robert C. Byrd, for what you gave to us and gave \nto this country. All of it will not be recognized in these moments. But \nas history is reviewed, people will remember--I hope they do--that even \nwhen he made a mistake, a serious mistake in his early days--when he \nwas not eager to support desegregation; that he should not have abided \nwith segregationists; that this country belonged to all the people and \nno one should be discriminated against--that one can be forgiven with \ngood deeds after some bad ones. And he redeemed himself so nobly, so \nwonderfully.\n  So we say, as we have been for these days, thank you, Robert C Byrd. \nWe loved being with you, and we will miss you.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I have not yet had the opportunity on the \nfloor to express my regret for the passing of Senator Robert Byrd and \nmy incredible respect for the service he gave our country.\n  I was only able to serve with Senator Byrd at the twilight of his \ncareer. I knew him in my capacities as Assistant Secretary and then \nSecretary of the Navy years ago, and I admired him for many years as an \nindividual of fierce intellect. He was a strong proponent of the \nbalance of power, particularly protective of the powers of the U.S. \nCongress as they relate to the executive branch, which is an area I \nhave also focused on over the years.\n  Senator Byrd had great love for the people of Appalachia. He was \ntheir greatest champion. He was a self-made man in every sense of the \nword--self-made economically, born an orphan, and self-made in terms of \nhis own education.\n  I recall that when I was Secretary of the Navy, I had the authority \nto name various combatants, and I named a submarine the ``USS West \nVirginia.'' When I made the statement about why I named it that, I \npointed out that West Virginia, in every war in the 20th century, \nranked either first or second in terms of its casualty rate. He was \nsomeone who never forgot the contributions of the people of that much-\nmaligned State to the well-being and greatness of our country. He left \nhis mark on all of us, and I would be remiss if I didn't express my \nregret in his passing.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to our \ndeparted Senate Dean, Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. Senator Byrd \nserved in this Chamber longer than any Senator in history, 50\\1/2\\ \nyears. Combined with 6 prior years in the House of Representatives, \nSenator Byrd's service spanned nearly a quarter of the history of the \nRepublic, from the Truman administration to the Obama one, longer than \nthe span of my life.\n  To serve with Senator Byrd, as was my privilege for too short a time, \nwas to serve with a giant of the Senate, an apotheosis of a long-ago \nage when oratory was an art. How fortunate I was to sit on the Budget \nCommittee several chairs away from the man who wrote the Budget Act. I \nwill never forget a Budget Committee hearing last year at which, with \n35 years of hindsight, Senator Byrd reviewed the very budget process \nthat he had designed. On that February morning, Senator Byrd delighted \nin describing his crafting of the budget process and its implementation \nand evolution over three and a half decades.\n  Tomorrow, for the first time since 1959 when Robert C. Byrd was a 40-\nyear-old first-year Senator, a departed Member of this body will lie in \nrepose in its Chamber. The tribute will surely be fitting, as the \nSenate's most senior Member occupies the floor one final time.\n  The man will be missed, but his legacy will continue to guide this \ninstitution for generations to come, and the institution to whose \nprinciples and welfare he dedicated his life, the U.S. Senate, will \nendure with his lasting imprint upon it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5689-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK.

SKUTA\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize COL Phil Skuta, \nUSMC, who will complete his tour of duty with the U.S. Marine Corps' \nOffice of Legislative Affairs on July 15, 2010. In his role as the \ndirector of the Marine Corps' Senate Liaison Office, he has provided \nexcellent support by ensuring the smooth and timely passage of \ninformation from the Marine Corps to Senators and their staffs. His \nsense of duty and responsibility contributed to a successful \nrelationship between the U.S. Senate and the U.S. Marine Corps. His \ndedication to serving the U.S. Senate will be missed.\n  A native of Williamsport, PA, Colonel Skuta attended the University \nof Pittsburgh and received a commission as a second lieutenant in the \nU.S. Marine Corps in 1987. His career as a Marine officer has been \nvaried and admirable. Prior to his assignment to the U.S. Senate, he \nserved on the Joint Chiefs of Staff, in the Strategic Plans and Policy \nDirectorate. Before that, he led 1,200 marines, soldiers, and sailors \nin combat in Iraq in 2004 as a battalion task force commander. Over the \npast 24 months, his excellent work, leadership of his liaison team, and \nexample of professionalism have served the Senate well and reflected \ncredit on the U.S. Marine Corps.\n  Upon his arrival as director of the U.S. Senate Marine Corps Liaison \nOffice, Colonel Skuta assumed and upheld the distinguished standard set \nby his predecessors. His approach to resolving complex issues allowed \nhim to advise and inform Members and their staffs of Marine Corps \nplans, policies, programs, and worldwide activities. Despite the \nfluidity of legislative process, Colonel Skuta established and \ndeveloped productive working relationships through engagement \nopportunities.\n  As liaison officer to the Senate, Colonel Skuta represented the \nMarine Corps on all Marine-related matters and effectively articulated \nthe Marine Corps' most difficult and challenging legislative \ninitiatives to Members and staff. He has been an integral player in \nmaintaining effective relationships between the Marine Corps, my \ncolleagues in the Senate, professional committee staff, and personal \nstaff members. In particular, he responded to hundreds of congressional \ninquiries, ranging from such sensitive issues as notification of combat \ncasualties from the Afghanistan and Iraq campaigns to providing timely \ninformation on the operation, organization, and budget of the Marine \nCorps. He also planned and executed dozens of international \ncongressional delegations. I had the pleasure of traveling on two of \nthese congressional delegations with Colonel Skuta and was impressed \nwith his service to the Members of the Senate. He reflected well on his \nservice at numerous Marine Corps and joint social events on Capitol \nHill. Among others, these events included\n\n[[Page S5690]]\n\nthe Marine Corps Birthday Commemoration, the Joint Services Reception, \nthe Marine Corps Marathon, and several Marine Corps seasonal \nreceptions.\n  On behalf of the Senate, I thank Colonel Skuta for his continued \nservice to the Nation and the U.S. Marine Corps, and I thank his wife \nJane for her steadfast support while he fulfilled this essential duty. \nWe in the U.S. Senate, and I personally, wish them all the best as Phil \ndeparts to assume duties as Director of the Marine Corps' Strategic \nInitiatives Group at Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps, Washington, DC.\n  Semper Fi!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5690-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5690]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HARRIS v. McRAE\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, 30 years ago today, the Supreme Court of \nthe United States announced its landmark decision in Harris v. McRae, \n448 U.S. 297, upholding the constitutionality of the Hyde amendment, \nwhich prohibits Federal funding of abortions under the Medicaid \nProgram. That decision made it possible for Congress, by annual \nenactment of the Hyde amendment, to protect American taxpayers from \nbeing forced to fund the destruction of innocent preborn human beings.\n  The majority opinion, written by Justice Potter Stewart, established \nthree important principles. First, no matter what unwritten right to \nabortion may be said to exist in our written Constitution, ``it simply \ndoes not follow that a woman's freedom of choice carries with it a \nconstitutional entitlement to the financial resources to avail herself \nof the full range of protected choices.'' Second, the Court accepted in \nfull the argument of Solicitor General Wade McCree that the Hyde \namendment is rationally related to the interest we all have in \npreserving nascent human life and encouraging childbirth. Finally, the \nCourt rejected the spurious claims of the Hyde amendment's opponents \nthat the amendment violated the establishment clause of the first \namendment because it somehow incorporated into federal law the \nreligious doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church.\n  In our recent debate over healthcare reform, we often heard that \nbecause the Hyde amendment is already ``settled law,'' there was no \nneed for specific provisions to ban taxpayer subsidies for abortion \nthrough the health insurance exchanges or other features of the \nlegislation. That argument, of course, was wrong. The Hyde amendment \naffects the appropriations that fund the Departments of Labor and of \nHealth and Human Services. The vast health care bureaucracy created by \nthis new legislation will exist outside of those departments. Time will \ntell whether those who argued so strongly that the Hyde amendment is \nsettled and ``good law'' will nonetheless challenge it again in the \nfuture.\n  Let's be honest about a fundamental point: change in our health care \nsystem provides another opportunity for abortion advocates to claim \nthat abortion is health care that must be funded by the taxpayers. That \nclaim must be resisted and defeated, just as it was resisted and \ndefeated in Harris v. McRae.\n  Were he still among us, our dear and esteemed colleague Henry Hyde \nwould have reminded our colleagues of this, with an eloquence we cannot \nmuster. The amendment bearing his name, after all, did not become law \nby accident; nor did it survive other than by the heroic efforts of \nHenry Hyde and a small cadre of pro-life attorneys who persuaded the \nDepartment of Justice to make the very arguments critical to \nsuccessfully defending the Hyde amendment in court.\n\n  Henry Hyde was vilified at the time for his amendment, and for his \nunwillingness to yield or compromise on its principles. Investigators \nfor the plaintiffs in Harris followed the Congressman to Mass, and then \nargued to the Federal district court in Brooklyn that his amendment was \nmotivated by his religion. What a scandal--that a Congressman's faith \nwould motivate his work.\n  Henry, of course, did more than simply introduce and achieve passage \nof his amendment. That alone would have been heroic. But he also \nentered the litigation challenging his amendment as an intervening-\ndefendant, joined by former Senator and now-Judge James L. Buckley, \nSenator Jesse Helms, and others, to ensure that the amendment would \nreceive the most vigorous defense in court.\n  His New York lawyers, Lawrence Washburn and Gerald Bodell, were \njoined by the superb legal team at Americans United for Life Legal \nDefense Fund, a fledgling Chicago-based office that suddenly found \nitself in the biggest case in its short existence. The AUL lawyers, \nincluding Northwestern University law professor Victor G. Rosenblum, \neminent Chicago trial lawyer Dennis Horan, and AUL staff attorneys \nPatrick Trueman and Thomas Marzen, were pivotal in framing the legal \narguments that prevailed in Harris. They simultaneously represented \nintervening defendants in Williams v. Zbaraz, defending an Illinois \nversion of the Hyde amendment. In Williams, named for AUL's clients Dr. \nJasper F. Williams and Dr. Eugene F. Diamond, Professor Rosenblum \neloquently argued to the Supreme Court that neither due process nor \nequal protection required government at any level to treat abortion on \na par with the life-giving alternative of childbirth.\n  The victories in Harris and Williams remain the most significant pro-\nlife legal victories of our lifetimes. But, until the Hyde amendment \nbecomes a part of the United States Code rather than an annual \nappropriations amendment, so that it covers a government programs and \nexpenditures, we must continue to make the same vigilant effort that \nmade the victories in those cases possible. AUL was a key partner as I \nand others in Congress fought to put true Hyde-type language in the \nhealth care legislation. Undaunted at the loss in Congress, AUL has \nturned its attention to the States, helping to draft legislation \nallowing States to ``opt-out'' of coverage for abortion through the \ninsurance exchanges, and to take other steps to ensure that health care \nreform does not undermine the principles of the Hyde amendment.\n  Many of the courageous warriors who first defended those principles \nthree decades ago have passed from our midst: my friends Henry Hyde and \nJesse Helms, attorneys Dennis Horan and Tom Marzen, and Dr. Jasper \nWilliams. Thankfully, some of the young lawyers who worked with them \nsuch as Carl Anderson, Robert Destro, and Paige Comstock Cunningham, \nremain active pro-life leaders today. Meanwhile, the ranks of young \nlawyers and students eager to follow in the footsteps of these legal \npioneers continues to grow. That is what trailblazers do, they lead the \nway so that others may follow and continue the fight. May their efforts \nbe blessed, and this Nation move swiftly to the day when the lives of \nthe unborn receive full legal protection.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5690-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5690-S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CLEAN AIR ACT AMENDMENTS OF 2010\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I rise to discuss my support for the \nClean Air Act Amendments of 2010 and how I plan to continue to work \nwith the sponsors to improve the bill to meet health standards for \nMaryland and the States of the Northeast.\n  First, I want to commend Senator Carper for his years of hard work \nand dedication to clean air policy issues. I know these issues are very \nnear and dear to Senator Carper and his perseverance is admirable. I \nfeel the same way about water quality protection in the Chesapeake Bay \nwatershed. When this bill received a hearing in the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee in March I expressed my support for the goals of \nthe Clean Air Act Amendments of 2010 and what the bill aims to achieve. \nBecause I believe this legislation is the right framework to protect \npublic health, I have added my name as a cosponsor of this bill.\n  The strong limits the legislation sets on mercury emissions is \nimportant. Air pollution, primarily from powerplants, is the main \nsource of the mercury that contaminates the fisheries of the Chesapeake \nBay Mid-Atlantic. We have fish consumption advisories throughout \nMaryland because of the high levels of mercury found in fish tissue.\n  A large part of my motivation for restoring the Chesapeake Bay is to \nrestore a healthy fishery for Maryland watermen to make a sound living \non and for recreational anglers to enjoy. I am pleased with the effects \nthis bill would have on the health of our fishery and the people who \nrely on healthy fish from a healthy bay.\n  The cap on sulfur dioxide, SO2, levels in the Clean Air \nAct Amendments of\n\n[[Page S5691]]\n\n2010 is strong as well. SO2 is a harmful particulate that is \na major component of acid rain which does serious damage to plants and \ntrees. States in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast see the worst of acid \nrain's effects on our forests and croplands. EPA's acid rain program \nhas yielded tremendous success and the SO2 reductions that \nthe bill calls for would help us achieve greater SO2 \nreductions.\n  These important limits on two harmful air pollutants are very \nimportant measures to protect the public health and the environment.\n  Nitrogen Oxide, NOX, is a dangerous air pollutant that \ncontributes to haze, water nitrification, and ground level ozone during \nthe summer months which is extremely dangerous to breathe particularly \nfor people who suffer from respiratory diseases like asthma and \nemphysema. Maryland, and Northeast and Mid-Atlantic States struggle to \nachieve attainment of healthy air standards because of NOX \nemissions. The Federal Government must do what it can to help these \nStates achieve healthy air through reductions in NOX.\n  I am committed to working with Senators Carper and Alexander to make \nthe bill achieve the goal of NOX reductions to protect the \npublic health of citizens of all States including Maryland.\n  Maryland's experience as a downwind State motivated the Maryland \nlegislature and our Governor to take firm and decisive action to reduce \nmercury, SO2 and NOX emissions in the State by \nimplementing the toughest powerplant emissions law on the east coast. \nThe Healthy Air Act, enacted in July 2007, established an ambitious \ntimetable of 3 years for Maryland's powerplants to meet a new set of \nrobust clean air standards.\n  Using 2002 as its emissions baseline, Maryland's Healthy Air Act has \nthe State well on its way to reducing NOX emissions in \nMaryland by 75 percent by 2012, after already achieving an interim goal \nof 70 percent reduction target for NOX in 2009. \nSO2 emissions will be reduced by 80 percent this year with a \nsecond phase of controls in 2013 to achieve 85 percent SO2 \nemission reductions. The Healthy Air Act also sets a 90 percent \nreduction in mercury by 2013.\n  Maryland's powerplants quickly met this challenge by immediately \ninstalling and operating pollution emission reductions technologies. In \nless than 3 years Maryland's State electricity generators began \nachieving significant mercury, SO2 and NOX \nemissions reductions. The Maryland Department of Environment tells me \nthat all of our power generators are either meeting or are on schedule \nto meet the near term targets of Maryland's Healthy Air Act.\n  The Clean Air Act Amendments of 2010 supports Maryland's mercury and \nSO2 reductions goals. Because Maryland has taken positive \nsteps to also reduce NOX emissions I must work to ensure \nthat any national standard supports Maryland's healthy air attainment \nlimits for NOX as well.\n  Being a downwind State that must mitigate or offset pollution that \ntravels in from other States has made it especially challenging for \nMaryland to be in attainment with the National Ambient Air Quality \nStandards, NAAQS, for ozone and fine particulate matter by the Federal \ndeadline of 2010. Maryland is doing its part.\n  I mention all of this so that my colleagues understand how important \nstrong clean air requirements are to me and to Maryland. I support the \ngoal of cleaner air and I think the approach the Clean Air Act \nAmendments of 2010 takes is correct. I very much want to save lives by \ncleaning up our air and I want to work with Senator Carper, Senator \nAlexander and the other sponsors of this bill to make it stronger. \nSpecifically, I want to ensure that EPA will review its air quality \nstandards. Should the agency's analysis of the ozone standard indicate \nthat additional NOX emissions reductions are necessary to \nprotect public health it is important that the EPA has a congressional \nmandate to act to strengthen the emission reduction requirement on \nNOX to address this public health threat.\n  In a matter of days, EPA will issue its revised Clean Air Interstate \nRule, CAIR, following the DC Circuit's determination that CAIR did not \nadequately address transport. Later this summer EPA will also propose \nnew National Ambient Air Quality Standards. These landmark policies \nought to guide what steps need to be taken to better protect public \nhealth and inform us about the congressional authority needed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5691-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5691]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                         TRIBUTE TO SUSAN BERRY\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, my hometown of Silver City, NM, \nis in the southwestern corner of our State. It is the county seat, and \nthe largest town for about a hundred miles around. Right on the edge of \nthe Gila Wilderness, it has been called by others, not by just me, \n``One of the 100 Best Small Towns in America.''\n  One of the reasons it is so outstanding is because of the tireless, \nthoughtful work of Susan Berry.

An early force of the MainStreet Project in Silver \nCity and a longtime member of the Design Review Committee, she has done \nso much so well, that the New Mexico Historic Preservation Division \nrecently gave her its Lifetime Achievement Award which she earned \nduring a career of preserving the past for the future.\n  On Saturday of this week, she will retire after decades of service as \ndirector of the Silver City Museum. Her accomplishments in that \ncapacity are too numerous to list, but as a result of her vision and \nskill, that museum has been accredited by the American Association of \nMuseums, one of only thirteen in New Mexico to be so designated.\n  She has helped make Silver City a significant destination for \ntravelers to the Southwest, and added to the list of reasons that \n10,000 people like to call it ``home.'' We are so fortunate that she \nchose to make the town the focus of her considerable ability and vision \nfor so many years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5691-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5691-S5692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING POLLY ARANGO\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to \nthe extraordinary life of Polly Arango, who died on Saturday, June 26, \n2010, in a tragic accident in Alamosa, CO. Her husband, children, \ngrandchildren, family, and friends have lost a very special individual. \nAnd New Mexico and the Nation lost a tireless advocate for children, \nparticularly those with disabilities.\n  Polly spent her life working on behalf of the most vulnerable in our \nsociety. Early in her career, she organized programs that allowed \nAmerican families to adopt orphans from Ecuador. She and her husband \nJohn later adopted themselves, providing loving care to a son who had \nsevere developmental difficulties. Shortly thereafter, Polly began her \nlifelong to work to ensure that other families in similar situations \nhad access to vital education, health care, and support services.\n  To do so, she cofounded Parents Reaching Out, a nonprofit \norganization that works with parents, caregivers, educators and other \nprofessionals to promote healthy, positive and caring experiences for \nNew Mexico families and children.\n  Polly also founded and served as the executive director of Family \nVoices, an advocacy group that strives to bolster both the access and \nthe quality of health care for children with special needs. In her work \nfor Family Voices, she, more than any other leader in the advocacy \nworld, fought for family-centered care for children with disabilities. \nHer efforts with officials in New Mexico led to many important \nsuccesses such as establishing the Medically Fragile Children's Program \nand the New Mexico High Risk Insurance Pool, reducing the school age \nfor children with disabilities, and increasing coverage and services \nfor children in Medicaid Programs.\n  Polly was very helpful to my staff and me over many years as we \nworked together on major health reform and education issues. She was in \ncontact with us monthly and even weekly to inform us of developments in \nNew Mexico and across the Nation and she had a wonderful ability to \nblend an understanding of complex policies with the practical needs of \nNew Mexicans. I know she was particularly heartened by our recent \npassage of national\n\n[[Page S5692]]\n\nhealth care reform. And, I know she would agree that we all must \ncontinue to fight to ensure that the needs of children remain central \nin our efforts to forge a more effective and equitable health care \nsystem.\n  I extend my sincere condolences to Polly's husband and children, and \nthe entire Arango family.\n Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to \ncelebrate the life--and mourn the loss--of one of New Mexico's finest \npublic servants.\n  The Land of Enchantment suffered a tremendous loss last Saturday, \nwhen Polly Arango was involved in a fatal accident in Alamosa, CO. As a \nlong-time resident of Algodones, NM, Polly was one of the most \nexemplary advocates for children living with disabilities our State has \never known. During her time with us, Polly taught us that regardless of \nsocioeconOmic status, culture, race, religion or health conditions, our \nchildren have inalienable rights that we must fight to protect.\n  Born in Green Bay, WI, Polly moved to our State in 1962 to attend \nUniversity of New Mexico. After marrying John Arango, she began her \ncareer as an advocate placing Ecuadorian orphans with families in the \nUnited States while her husband served as Peace Corps director in \nPanama and Ecuador.\n  A turning point for Polly and John came with the adoption of their \nson Nicolas. As Polly learned that Nicolas had a severe developmental \ndisability, she began her work securing full education and access to \nhealth care for children with chronic health conditions. Nicolas \ninspired Polly's work to open the eyes of school officials, \npolicymakers, community leaders, friends and neighbors to the \nchallenges facing children with disabilities. Her efforts were not only \nfor Nicolas, but for thousands of other New Mexican families in need.\n  In 1992, Polly cofounded a national grassroots network called Family \nVoices. Today, Family Voices consists of more than 45,000 New Mexican \nfamilies and friends working together to improve health care for \nchildren and youth with special needs. Polly served as the first \nexecutive director and most recently served on the board of directors. \nPolly also cofounded Parents Reaching Out, a statewide network of \nprograms designed to meet the ever changing needs of New Mexican \nfamilies. Based on her leadership, this organization continues to \nconnect children and their families to resources that will improve \ntheir quality of life.\n  Polly represented families and family-centered care on many national \nboards, commissions and international forums. She was named to the New \nMexico Medicaid Advisory Committee and served as a member of the New \nMexico Supreme Court's Court Improvement Project on foster care. She \nalso co-authored several books and many articles on health care, foster \nchildren, and families, and she was executive producer and writer of a \nPBS documentary about inclusion titled: ``What Does Normal Mean?''\n  Through her work, Polly displayed a noble commitment to fight for the \nhealth and civil rights of all children, especially disabled children, \nwho often cannot fight for themselves. Polly actively demonstrated one \nof our greatest American values: that families can be the most \nimportant caregivers, and every child deserves a family.\n  She was survived by her husband, John; her four children--Carlos \nArango, Francesca Wilson, Maria Arango and Nicolas Arango; her seven \ngrandchildren--Sloan Wilson, Conor Arango, Gabby Arango, Kellen Wilson, \nGrace Arango, Lenor Arango and Isabel Arango; and seven of her eight \nbrothers and sisters--Richard Egan, Kevin Egan, Martha Egan, Kathryn \nStout, Patrick Egan, Michael Egan and Thomas Egan.\n  In her recent obituary, Polly's friends and family kindly thanked me \nfor my role in health care reform and my support for rural health \nprograms. While I appreciate these sentiments, I want to thank Polly. I \nwant to thank her for her invaluable contributions as a mother, friend, \nand public servant on behalf of all she touched. Our State won't be the \nsame without her. I am blessed to have known her. New Mexico will miss \nPolly Arango, but we know that her legacy will live on.\n  As Polly Arango is laid to rest this week, I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in honoring this remarkable public servant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5692-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5692]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO PETE JOHNSON\n\n Mr. COCHRAN.

The residents were having difficulty agreeing \non a new name, and Isadore Gintzler is said to have looked at his \npocket watch to check the time at a very late hour and suggested its \nbrand name, Elgin, as a compromise name for the town site. The post \noffice was established August 11, 1910. Elgin was incorporated as a \nvillage in 1911.\n  Some of the present day businesses and accommodations that continue \nto thrive within the city of Elgin include the Jacobson Memorial \nHospital Care Center and Clinics, Dakota Hill Housing, a dentist, an \neye clinic, a cafe and bowling alley, a grocery store, a hardware \nstore, gas stations, a bank, accounting offices, a drug store, \ninsurance agencies, a newspaper, the post office, a lumber yard, a \nmotel, a new public library, and grain elevators.\n  Citizens of Elgin organized numerous activities to celebrate their \ncentennial. Some of the activities included an opening ceremony, \nhistorical Power Point presentation, historical bus tour, musical \nentertainment, an alumni football game, a magician show, and an antique \nparade.\n  I ask the U.S. Senate to join me in congratulating Elgin, ND, and its \nresidents on the first 100 years and in wishing them well through the \nnext century. By honoring Elgin and all the other historic small towns \nof North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier spirit alive for \nfuture generations. It is places such as Elgin that have helped to \nshape this country into what it is today, which is why this fine \ncommunity is deserving of our recognition.\n\n[[Page S5693]]\n\n  Elgin has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5693-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WAKONDA, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \n125th anniversary of Wakonda, SD. The town calls itself ``The Good Life \nTown'' and I would have to agree. With a strong sense of community and \na welcoming spirit, Wakonda is a wonderful place to call home.\n  Wakonda was founded when the North Western Railroad expanded its line \nin northwestern Clay County. Surveyors originally planned out the town, \ncalling it Summit, but when negotiations on land price fell through, \nthe town was moved southwest. The building crews stayed on local farms \nand completed their work by the end of the year. GEN William Beadle is \ncredited with suggesting the name of Wakonda, a Santee Sioux word \nmeaning ``wonderful.'' The town quickly sprouted, with many new \nbusinesses popping up in the coming years.\n  To celebrate Wakonda's historical achievement, the town will join \ntogether for a weekend of activities. With a golf tournament, kids \ncarnival, and artistic exhibits, this town is sure to have a great time \ncelebrating. I am proud to recognize Wakonda on reaching this milestone \nand wish them all the best in their future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5693-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       FIRST STATE BALLET THEATRE\n\n Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, it has been an honor to watch the \narts blossom in the State of Delaware. One of the organizations leading \nthis movement is the First State Ballet Theatre, which is celebrating \n10 years of dedication and excellence in the art of dance.\n  The late choreographer Martha Graham once said:\n\n       We look at the dance to impart the sensation of living in \n     an affirmation of life, to energize the spectator into keener \n     awareness of the vigor, the mystery, the humor, the variety, \n     and the wonder of life. This is the function of the American \n     dance.\n\n  Since the founding of the First State Ballet Theatre in 1999 by Pasha \nand Kristina Kambalov, it has been devoted to exposing Delawareans to \ndance. Through providing dance training and conducting education \noutreach, its audiences have learned much about the history and \nrelevance of the art of dance.\n  The company's impressive 10-year run has brought a host of classical \nballets, including favorite classics such as ``The Nutcracker'' and \n``Swan Lake.'' The theatre has also been involved in vibrant \nproductions such as ``Carmen,'' showing the depth and amazing talent \npresent within the troupe. The theatre hosts a cast of talented \ndancers, who come long distances to perform throughout our State. The \nballet company currently has a troupe of 15 talented resident dancers \nwho star in a variety of productions.\n  The theatre has also attracted an outstanding group of master \nchoreographers, who have created a diverse range of shows. They are led \nby artistic director Pasha Kambalov, school director Kristina Kambalov, \nand assistant artistic director Lev Assaouliak. Between them, these \nthree have many years of experience in the art of dance and countless \nachievements, including performing in many impressive repertoires, and \nthey were trained professionally in renowned schools of ballet. In \n2006, the Kambalovs were honored with the Wilmington and Wilmingtonian \nAwards for their outstanding work improving the quality of life in the \ncommunity.\n  As Delaware's only professional dance company, the First State Ballet \nTheatre has strived to help the arts flourish, and by doing so it has \ndrawn both in-State and out-of-State audiences to its performances. By \noffering enticing productions that appeal to various sections of the \npopulation at affordable prices, the First State Ballet Theatre has \ninspired a whole new generation to become a part of the theatre's \nfamily. The theatre has also taught over 7,000 children about dance \nwith the help of its talented and caring staff.\n  For 10 years, the First State Ballet Theatre has stood for excellence \nin the arts, and has treated its audiences to breathtaking and vibrant \nproductions that have inspired the people of Delaware. The First State \nBallet Theatre has been a great asset to my home State, and its \naccomplishments will inevitably continue to bring it success for years \nto come. Once again, I would like to congratulate the theatre on \nreaching this 10-year milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5693-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO ARKANSAS PROFESSIONALS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an \nAmerican hero, Arkansas native Bass Reeves, one of the first African-\nAmerican U.S. Deputy Marshals west of the Mississippi River. He was one \nof the most respected lawmen who served the U.S. District Court for the \nWestern District of Arkansas, which had criminal jurisdiction in the \nIndian Territory, the present State of Oklahoma. He captured more than \n3,000 fugitives in his legendary career. Many scholars consider Bass \nReeves to be one of the greatest frontier heroes in U.S. history.\n  Born into slavery in 1838 in Crawford County, AR, and then moved to \nTexas, Bass fled to Indian Territory during the Civil War and lived \nwith the Seminole and Muscogee (Creek) Indians. Following emancipation, \nhe settled near Van Buren, AR, to raise horses and start a family. He \nand his wife Nellie Jennie had 10 children: 5 boys and 5 girls.\n  In 1875, Isaac Parker was appointed U.S. district judge for the \nWestern District of Arkansas, and Bass was recruited to serve as a \nDeputy U.S. Marshal. He stood 6'2\", weighed 180 pounds, and could shoot \na pistol or rifle accurately with either hand. He was known for his \ntoughness, intelligence, and detective skills, even though he could \nneither read nor write.\n  He arrested some of the most dangerous criminals of the time, \nrepeatedly demonstrating honor and integrity. He had to stand trial \nhimself and was imprisoned for 5 months on a false accusation of \nmurder. Following acquittal, he returned to tracking down and arresting \ncriminals.\n  Bass served the Federal courts in the Indian Territory for 32 years, \nfrom 1875 until 1907 when Oklahoma became a State. At age 68, he became \na member of the Muskogee, OK, police department and served until his \ndeath from Brights disease on January 12, 1910.\n  Mr. President, I recognize Deputy U.S. Marshal Bass Reeves as a real \nAmerican hero.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5693-5", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5693-S5694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TRIBUTE TO CAPTAIN JOHN B. NOWELL, JR.\n\n Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the extraordinary contributions of Captain John B. Nowell, \nJr., U.S. Navy, to our Nation. Captain Nowell has served with \nexceptional distinction as the director, Navy Senate Liaison, a \nposition of great responsibility, from August 2008 to June 2010.\n  Captain Nowell's service to our country began with his induction into \nthe U.S. Naval Academy in the summer of 1980. Upon his graduation and \ncommissioning in 1984, he started out on what would become a \ndistinguished career as a talented and respected surface warfare \nofficer--a career that continues today. His naval service has literally \ntaken him around the world, as he has served on ships from the east \ncoast to the west coast, from Africa to Japan, and all of the oceans \nand seas in between.\n\n[[Page S5694]]\n\n  Recognizing the enormous talent and potential in him, the Navy \nrewarded Captain Nowell with command at sea, entrusting him with the \nleadership of the guided-missile destroyer USS Porter and her crew from \nApril 2002 to December 2003. During this time, Captain Nowell was \ncalled upon to lead his crew into combat, surge-deploying for Operation \nIraqi Freedom into the Fifth and Sixth Fleet Areas of Responsibility \nwhere the Porter conducted Tomahawk strikes and Theater Ballistic \nMissile Defense. The crew of the USS Porter earned numerous accolades \nduring Captain Nowell's command, including the coveted Battle ``E'' \nAward.\n  Captain Nowell's success as a wartime commander at sea ultimately led \nto command an entire Destroyer Squadron and to assume the role of the \nmaritime force commander for Joint Task Force Lebanon. However, the \nmost telling vote of confidence in his ability to lead would surely be \nhis selection to command the inaugural Africa Partnership Station \ndeployment, a multinational force of ships, submarines, aircraft, \nexpeditionary partnership teams, and land-based forces charged with \nbuilding partnership capacity throughout the African continent.\n  Today, we say goodbye to Captain Nowell after nearly 2 years of \nextraordinary service as the Navy's lead liaison to the U.S. Senate. \nDuring this time he led 15 congressional and staff delegations to 30 \ncountries, often being requested by name to facilitate visits to combat \nzones and fleet locations for the most senior-ranking delegations. As \nhe departs for his next challenging assignment as the head of surface \nwarfare assignments at Naval Personnel Command, I honor him for his \nservice to our country, his inspirational leadership, and his \nirrepressible drive. I call upon my colleagues to join me in wishing \n``fair winds and following seas'' to Captain Nowell, his wife Jo, and \nhis children Katherine, Stephen, and John III, who will be following \nhis father's legacy as a midshipman at the U.S. Naval Academy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5694-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               ASSOCIATION FOR COMMUNITY AFFILIATED PLANS\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, a few months ago we completed \ndebate on one of the most significant reforms of American health care \nin decades. As a result of that work we will see over 30 million \nAmericans who haven't had access to health insurance gain that access. \nThe law that we passed helps all Americans, but especially the most \nvulnerable, gain access to quality, affordable health insurance. Today \nI rise to recognize an organization that for 10 years has been \nsimilarly working to provide care for our Nation's most vulnerable \ncitizens.\n  The Association for Community Affiliated Plans, ACAP, is a national \ntrade organization representing 51 community-based health plans in 25 \nStates, together covering over 7 million people. Its nonprofit Safety \nNet Health Plan members provide health coverage through public \ninsurance programs, primarily Medicaid, Medicare, and the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, CHIP, delivering desperately needed health \nservices to low-income and vulnerable Americans who would otherwise be \nuninsured. Coordinating with State and local governments, community \ngroups and health care providers, ACAP plans, by delivering the \nservices made possible by Medicaid, Medicare and CHIP, serve as a \nsafety net for those who fall through the gaps in a system that largely \nrelies on employer-provided or privately purchased coverage.\n  In 2000, 17 safety net plans, often started by community health \ncenters who were serving uninsured and Medicaid patients, came together \nto form ACAP. In the ensuing decade ACAP plans have grown from covering \n1 million people in 2000 to 7 million today. These plans, like \nChildren's Mercy Family Health Partners in my home State of Missouri, \nremain deeply rooted in their communities, serving those who need help \nthe most. Over 55,000 of my constituents receive their insurance from \nChildren's Mercy Family Health Partners as they provide a critical \nsafety net that makes a difference in Missouri.\n  I commend the Association for Community Affiliated Plans and its \nmembers for their service to our Nation's underserved populations, as \nwell as congratulate them on their 10th anniversary of supporting the \nNation's nonprofit Safety Net Health Plans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5694-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RECOGNIZING U.S. NAVAL ACADEMY CLASS OF 1970\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to express our deep \ngratitude for the inspirational leadership and outstanding service to \nour nation by the U.S. Naval Academy class of 1970. It has been an \nhonor to support the Naval Academy in my capacity as a Senator from \nMaryland and as a member of the U.S. Naval Academy Board of Visitors \nfor over 20 years. The Naval Academy has a proud history of developing \nexcellence in education and personal character of our past and present, \nand continues to prepare and train the future leaders of our nation. I \nam so proud of the class of 1970 for exemplifying the high quality \nstandards of the academy.\n  The Naval Academy class of 1970 started their journey as midshipmen \nin 1966, during the height of the Vietnam war. They volunteered for the \njob knowing that after graduation their roles as Navy and Marine Corps \nofficers would be during difficult and demanding times for the U.S. \nmilitary. That it was such a challenging time for our nation and our \nmilitary did not deter them, it made them more determined. Their \nservice and extraordinary spirit has enriched and sustained our Nation. \nI come to the floor today to ensure that their sacrifice and patriotism \nis remembered and celebrated.\n  From their graduation day on, the class of 1970 set a very high \nstandard. Their accomplishments and careers are impressive. Members of \nthis class fought valiantly in the Vietnam war, the gulf war and other \nconflicts during the last 40 years. They served in the air, on land and \nat sea. Members of the class of 1970 have served at the very highest \nlevel of our military. They served as commanding officers of warships, \ncombatant commanders, and as the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff. Twenty-four members of this class achieved flag or general \nofficer rank.\n  Since their early years as midshipmen, they have given of themselves \nnot just on the battlefield but also in their communities on the home \nfront. Whether volunteering at the Boys Club and Big Brothers programs \nas midshipmen, teaching at our nation's military colleges or \nvolunteering in their community they have generously contributed to the \nsupport of academics, ethics, character development, and leadership of \nour next generation.\n  Even more extraordinary than their time in uniform is the amount the \nmembers of this class have continued to give back since their military \nservice ended. This remarkable class has continued to lead by example. \nThey have worked to educate our children, support defense agencies, and \nto promote community services. Their accomplishments and achievements \nhave reached the highest levels of government, industry, science, law, \nmedicine, education, and religious vocations. Many have continued to \nfight for our freedom in their roles as leaders of corporations that \nare vital to our national defense. I admire the spirit of service and \ndedication to making our country and the world a better place.\n  The U.S. Naval Academy class of 1970 exemplifies the Navy ethos of \n``Honor, Courage, and Commitment.'' These values have defined their \ncommitment and dedication to the United States. Like many others before \nand after them, they have sacrificed long deployments, separation from \nloved ones, tests and trials that most Americans can't imagine. Some \neven sacrificed their life doing their duty. I know that new \ngenerations of midshipmen and future Naval and Marine Corps officers \nwill be inspired by the rich heritage of service they have passed down \nto them.\n  As the U.S. Naval Academy class of 1970 gathers to mark forty years \nof service to our nation and to the U.S. Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, \nArmy, and Naval Academy, it is with great pleasure that I offer my \ngratitude for their service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5694-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5694-S5695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO MARY A. FRANCIS\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to an \nAlaskan who has devoted most of her adult life to education in Alaska. \nDr. Mary A.\n\n[[Page S5695]]\n\nFrancis will retire today, June 30, 2010, from her positions as the \nexecutive director of both the Alaska Council of School Administrators \nand the Association of Alaska School Administrators. Her leadership, \nadvocacy, encouragement, and experience will be missed.\n  Mary's career in education began as an English teacher. Over the \ncourse of time, her skills and dedication brought her to different jobs \nin communities across Alaska. Her first assignment as an administrator \nwas as curriculum director for the Lower Kuskokwim School District, a \ndistrict that includes some of Alaska's most remote villages along the \nKuskokwim River in southwest Alaska. Later, as assistant superintendent \nin Fairbanks, she experienced life ``in the big city''--a comparative \nterm as Alaskan cities go. The bulk of her career, though, has been \nspent in southeast Alaska, as superintendent in Wrangell, a 12-year \ntenure as Petersburg's superintendent, and most recently 8 years in \nJuneau serving Alaska's school administrators.\n  It was in Petersburg where Mary's competence was recognized on the \nnational stage when she was selected by her peers and recognized by the \nAmerican Association of School Administrators as Alaska's \nSuperintendent of the Year in 2000.\n  At the time of her retirement from Petersburg, Mary briefly \nconsidered spending her remaining years playing golf and enjoying life. \nShe quickly realized that she would be bored stiff and accepted the \nposition as executive director of the Alaska Council of School \nAdministrators in 2002. This is not an easy job, as Mary was asked to \nrepresent the diverse perspectives of superintendents and other central \noffice administrators, university professors, elementary and secondary \nprincipals, and school business officials. As executive director, Mary \nwas also asked to assist these diverse member organizations to \naccomplish their mission: to provide leadership for and promotion of a \ncollective professional voice in setting the educational agenda for \nAlaska. Throughout her tenure, Mary provided inspiration, authentic \nunderstanding, advocacy, and encouragement to the council as a whole as \nwell as to its individual members.\n  Mary Francis has done this difficult job with grace, tact, firmness, \nand a sense of humor for 8 years. Mary noted, in announcing her \nresignation, ``There is never a good time to make a decision to leave a \nposition. However, ACSA's financial position is sound and with a \nworking Strategic Plan in place, the organization is on solid footing \nnow and for the future.''\n  ACSA Board President Pete Swanson remarked, ``Dr. Francis' \nresignation has been accepted with reluctance by the Board. She will be \nsorely missed as she provides just the right balance of oversight for \nour board and the AASA board for whom she also serves in the Executive \nDirector capacity. Her ability to advocate for and represent the school \nadministrators of Alaska with the Legislature and many statewide \ncommittee forums is considerable. Dr. Francis leaves a legacy of \nworking hard for the concerns and issues of Alaska's school \nadministrators.''\n  On behalf of the countless educators whose lives she has touched, I \nextend my gratitude to Dr. Mary A. Francis for her selfless dedication \nto advancing the cause of education in Alaska and I wish her a happy, \nhealthy, and exciting retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5695-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5695]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REMEMBERING CEDRIC ERROLL FLOWERS, JR.\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to Cedric \nErroll Flowers, Jr., my dear friend who passed away on May 25, 2010.\n  Cedric was born and raised in Sumter County, AL, where he attended \nDemopolis High School. There, he developed an interest in English \nliterature and world history, as well as a passion for music. He \ndevoted his ample talents to the piano and the clarinet, the latter of \nwhich he played for the Demopolis High School concert band. This is \nremarkable given his failing, and eventual loss of, eyesight. Despite \nhis blindness, Cedric excelled in high school.\n  Following graduation from Demopolis High School in 1951, Cedric \nenrolled at the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and Blind where he \npursued his love of music. Without eyes to guide him, Cedric studied \nand mastered the art of piano tuning by ear. It was also at the Alabama \nInstitute for the Deaf and Blind where he met Sue Akel, whom he would \nlater marry in 1962.\n  After earning his degree from the Alabama Institute for the Deaf and \nBlind, Cedric took his newly acquired skills to Savannah, GA, where he \ncared for all the pianos within the Chatham County and Savannah City \nSchools. In 1954, he came back to Alabama where he performed this same \ninvaluable service for the concert series program at my alma mater, the \nUniversity of Alabama.\n  In 1964, Cedric opened his own business, Flowers Piano Company. Known \nas the ``People Who Know Pianos,'' Flowers Piano Company began as a \nspecialty piano retail store and a service-based enterprise. For many \nyears, Cedric, who was also instrumental in founding the Tuscaloosa \nMusic Merchants Association, served as the exclusive local dealer of \nhigh-end pianos in the Tuscaloosa area. As his business flourished, \nCedric expanded the store's inventory to include band instruments and \nsheet music and offer beginner piano lessons.\n  Cedric's passion for tending to pianos did not cease with the \nestablishment of his company. His skills as a Master Concert Tuner/\nTechnician served the Piano Technicians Guild and the National \nAssociation of Music Merchants well. In fact, while continuing to serve \nand provide equipment to the University of Alabama, he worked with \nartists and musical groups who performed in and around Tuscaloosa and \nBirmingham. His expertise and precision benefitted music and \nentertainment throughout Tuscaloosa and Jefferson Counties.\n  Cedric also served the Tuscaloosa community as a deacon at the First \nPresbyterian Church of Tuscaloosa and a volunteer for many music and \nart-related endeavors and causes.\n  A faithful member of the University of Alabama family, Cedric never \nmissed game day play-by-play radio coverage of the Crimson Tide. I can \nonly imagine how happy he was to hear the sweet sound of the Million \nDollar Band playing ``Yea, Alabama'' in the Rose Bowl following the \nTide's BCS National Championship victory this past January.\n  I was fortunate to have known Cedric during his time here, and I \nmourn his passing. He is loved and respected throughout our community \nand will be missed by his beloved wife of 47 years, Sue, and his \ndaughter, Marcia. I ask the entire Senate to join me in recognizing and \nhonoring the life of my friend, Cedric Erroll Flowers, Jr.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5695-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5695-S5696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING GERALD PELLETIER INC.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, this summer, thousands of Mainers \nand Americans will be drawn to the town of Millinocket to enjoy the \nnatural beauty of Maine's outdoors. This year, however, they will also \nhave the opportunity to enjoy the bountiful meals provided by the \nPelletier family at the Pelletier Loggers Family Restaurant. Besides \nserving up hearty Maine cooking to locals and tourists alike, the \nPelletier family performs the herculean task of delivering many \nthousands of cords of firewood each year to the people of Maine through \ntheir extensive logging operations. As such, I rise today to honor the \nPelletier family and their small business, Gerald Pelletier, Inc., \nwhich has continued to embrace the spirit of entrepreneurship by \nproviding critical jobs to rural Mainers as well as serving the people \nof our State for over 50 years.\n  What began as a log hauling operation in 1954 by a father that wanted \nto put extra food on the table during the winter months, eventually \ndeveloped into a successful logging operation employing family members \nand dozens of Mainers alike. Gerald Pelletier Inc., produces over \n200,000 cords of firewood each year, much of which is hauled over the \nGolden Road, a treacherous logging highway cutting through the Maine \nwoods to the Canadian border. The company's logging operation is \ncarried out with the utmost care thanks to the training many of the \nworkers receive through the Certified Logging Professionals program, \nwhich trains and certifies loggers in safe, efficient, and \nenvironmentally sound logging practices. The company is also a\n\n[[Page S5696]]\n\nmember of the Sustainable Forestry Initiative, the Maine Forest \nProducts Council, and the Professional Logging Contractors of Maine. \nToday, with brothers Eldon and Rudy Pelletier at the helm, Gerald \nPelletier Inc. has over 100 employees during the frigid winter months \nthat, in addition to logging, build and maintain roads and bridges \nthroughout Maine.\n  Gerald Pelletier Inc. has become a very attractive operation thanks \nin large part to the television show American Loggers, which airs on \nthe Discovery Channel. This popular show has catapulted the company \ninto a bright spotlight, and thrust the family into a form of reality-\nstardom. Produced by a native son of Maine, the show portrays the \nstruggles and successes of the family as it continues its work in one \nof Maine's most remarkable and historic industries.\n  With this newfound nationwide appeal, Gerald Pelletier Inc. was \nrecently able to undertake another entrepreneurial endeavor, the \nPelletier Loggers Family Restaurant in Millinocket. Their restaurant \nserves up hearty Maine meals prepared from scratch to an array of \nlocals and visitors alike. Customers can order from a wide variety of \ncreatively titled menu items like the Moose on the Loose, a 10 oz. \nfilet mignon, or for those interested in sampling fresh seafood, the \nTriple Trailer, which is a seafood medley of lobster, scallops and \nshrimp.\n  While at the restaurant, customers from across the country can also \nget a true visual taste of the Maine logging experience. In front of \nthe building, a tractor trailer truck can be seen bursting from the \nsecond floor. Inside, various tools used in the logging trade adorn the \nwalls, including a rugged chainsaw that is stuck through one of the \nbeams. Clearly, the Pelletiers have invested a great deal of effort in \nproviding visitors with a thorough and fulfilling traditional \nexperience.\n  Truly, Gerald Pelletier Inc. embodies the entrepreneurial spirit that \nmakes America so great. The Pelletier family has shown that a small \nbusiness can succeed through hard work and personal sacrifice. I extend \nmy congratulations to Rudy and Eldon Pelletier, the two coowners, and \neveryone at Gerald Pelletier Inc. for their remarkable enterprises, and \noffer my best wishes for their future success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5696-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5696]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LYDIA SAND\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to provide a fully offset extension of emergency \nunemployment insurance assistance, enhanced Medicaid FMAP \nreimbursements, and summer employment for youth, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, I rise to speak about \nlegislation that I have introduced today in the Senate. The name of the \nbill is the Fiscally Responsible Relief for Our States Act of 2010.\n  As you know, over the past week, the Senate has vigorously debated \nthree different versions of the extenders bill, and we will be debating \na version of it again today. Even though it is true each of these \npackages contained extensions of programs important to all of our \nconstituents, especially in these tough economic times--such as \nemergency unemployment benefits, which I know we are trying to work on \nagain today; increased FMAP reimbursements; and funding for summer jobs \nfor the youth throughout America--it is also true that each of these \npackages contained billions of dollars of tax increases for businesses, \nand each added billions to our record $13 trillion and rising national \ndebt which our kids and grandkids and great-grandchildren will have a \ndifficult time paying back, and they will have the responsibility to \npay it back.\n  A lot of what I am proposing today in this bill, and other bills that \nwe will probably be discussing, is whether we should use our bank \naccount or we should put it on our credit card. That is all we are \ntalking about. We are not talking about the viability of these \nproposals. Of course we want to help with summer jobs. Of course we \nwant to help people who are hurting with unemployment insurance. Of \ncourse we want to provide FMAP and Medicaid reimbursements to help our \nstruggling States. But do we use our checking account or do we use the \ncredit card? I am in favor of using the checking account by using \nunallocated stimulus dollars, by finding other monies that are in the \nso-called slush funds that haven't been used in years or are still \navailable or cutting across the board in various entities to come up \nwith the money we need to fund these programs.\n  As I said, no one is disputing the value of these very important \nprograms, especially in my home State of\n\n[[Page S5701]]\n\nMassachusetts, but throughout the country as well. Our economy has \nshown signs of slowly recovering, but people out of work certainly need \nsome help to search for new employment and, as I said, States need help \nin providing funding for some of the most vulnerable in our population. \nBut we also have to make tough choices, and we have to live within our \nmeans.\n  It is clear the American people want their elected Representatives in \nCongress to start paying for the initiatives and start exercising the \ntype of fiscal responsibility as each and every citizen in \nMassachusetts and in America is already doing. They are looking to us \nfor guidance to show a better way. They are challenging us to do it \nbetter, to look outside the box and pay for things with the checking \naccount, not the credit card; to not continue to add to the debt, \ncontinuously adding to the debt.\n  As evidenced by what the Banking Committee chairman did--and he is \nsitting in the Chamber of the Senate--they thought about it a little \nbetter. They found a way to pay for the financial reform bill. They did \nbetter. They thought outside the box. Why can't we do the same?\n  Today I introduce the Fiscally Responsible Relief for Our States Act \nof 2010. It provides for an extension of emergency unemployment \nbenefits through November 30, 2010. It also includes extension of \nenhanced FMAP reimbursements for States. But also, as has been \npreviously discussed, it includes the gradual drawdown of the enhanced \nfunding because we need to send a clear message to the State \ngovernments that they must get their own fiscal houses in order and \nthey cannot always come to the Federal Government with a can saying: \nPlease help us. So we need to ensure that we do the necessary reforms \nto ensure their future budgetary viability is real and so is that of \nthe Federal Government.\n  Last, this proposal I am making provides important summer jobs--\nobviously summer is just starting--for the youth in our cities and \ntowns.\n  The cost of extending these programs is fully paid for through the \nrescission of unobligated Federal funds including stimulus funding as \nwell as cuts in other areas. In fact, my legislation reduces the \ndeficit, all of this accomplished without raising taxes on businesses \nat a time they cannot afford it, or when our economy is just about to \nrecover, putting more and more burdens on businesses and individuals in \nthe middle of a 2-year recession. Some of these pay-fors are even \nprovisions the majority party has supported in previous bills.\n  My legislation is an attempt to compromise, listening to the concerns \nof so many Americans who have called for us to extend these programs \nbut also taking into consideration not burdening future generations. \nSome of them are sitting right here. It will allow us to provide for \nthe needs of our citizens without putting more debt on the credit card. \nOnce again, it is the checking account versus the credit card. \nCommending Senator Dodd for what they did with the bill we are going to \nbe discussing next week, that is a perfect example of thinking outside \nthe box and finding a way to pay for a lot of these things we are \ntrying to do. If we use these commonsense steps, we can get our fiscal \nhouse in order, and we will continue to put our country on the path to \nrecovery.\n  Madam President, I have great respect for you and everyone in this \nChamber. I have been in Washington a little over 5 months now. I have \nbeen following you and others--it seems that everybody is following my \nvoting record. It speaks for itself in that I worked to work across \nparty lines to solve problems. But the thing that is a problem is, it \nneeds to be a two-way street. Bipartisanship is not just from the new \nSenator from Massachusetts. It needs to be with the majority party \nlooking outside the box, as Senator Dodd and his team did, to find a \nrealistic solution to pay for a lot of these things the people are \nrequesting, that they expect. But they also expect us to use fiscal \nsanity and fiscal responsibility to do our very best, to get the job \ndone. It is not only good for Massachusetts, it is good for this \nNation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 3557. A bill to provide for Kindergarten Plus programs; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation to \njump-start the chances for success of low-income children entering \nschool. Today, I am introducing the Sandy Feldman Kindergarten Plus Act \nof 2010.\n  The Kindergarten Plus Act will provide children below 185 percent of \nthe poverty line with additional time in school during the summers \nbefore and after the traditional kindergarten school year to ensure \nmore children enter school ready to succeed.\n  Too many low-income children enter school unprepared because they \nhave not had the same resources as their more affluent peers. As \nexhibited by the nation's achievement gap which is already well-\nestablished prior to kindergarten, it becomes difficult for them to \never catch-up.\n  We must do a better job of preparing less fortunate children for \nschool. To do this, we should expose them to classroom practices, \nintroduce them to critical educational concepts, and familiarize them \nwith school activities such as story time or circle time. Ultimately, \nwe need to provide them with a solid foundation that allows them to \nenter school with the skills necessary to become strong students.\n  Only 39 percent of low-income children, compared to about 85 percent \nof high-income children, can recognize letters of the alphabet upon \narrival in kindergarten. Moreover, low-income children often have a \nmore limited vocabulary. By the time they are in first grade, children \nin low-income families have on average 5,000 words in their vocabulary. \nIn contrast, children from more affluent families enter school with \nvocabularies of about 20,000 words. These startling discrepancies \nshould tell us that more needs to be done to help all children enter \nschool with an equal opportunity for success. This legislation strives \nto provide these opportunities and to lessen the achievement gap by \ngiving low-income children more support and exposure to quality \neducation.\n  This legislation was named after Sandy Feldman who was a tireless \nadvocate for children and public education. Her commitment to social \njustice and her focus on early childhood education led her to develop \nthe concept for this legislation, and it was Sandy who spent countless \nhours developing the details to ensure this would be a high-quality \ninitiative.\n  This bill is supported by the American Federation of Teachers. I urge \nmy colleagues to join this effort and cosponsor this legislation. I \nencourage them to help give low-income children a jump-start on school \nsuccess. .\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 3558. A bill to improve the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, 9 years ago I and many of my colleagues \nsupported the No Child Left Behind Act because every American child \ndeserves an education that opens up opportunities for success and \nprepares him or her for the 21st century economy.\n  Today, because the high hopes we had for this law have not been \nrealized, I rise to reintroduce the No Child Left Behind Reform Act.\n  The objective of the law we passed nearly a decade ago was the right \none. Students, parents, teachers, principals, and other stakeholders \nall agree that educators and schools should be held accountable for the \nresults they are getting on behalf of our children.\n  But instead of rewarding excellence, No Child Left Behind has turned \nout to be a law that punishes our schools, further straining those that \nalready were in need of help. At times, the law has been implemented \nrigidly and with little regard for what is actually going on in \nschools. The previous administration's repeated failure to live up to \nfunding promises has robbed our efforts to improve our education system \nof the resources that would make success possible.\n  We can have accountability without a regime of draconian punishments \nfor schools that fall behind. What we cannot have is an inflexible and \nunfunded mandate that fails school districts, teachers, and, worst of \nall, the very students whose futures are at stake.\n\n[[Page S5702]]\n\n  Although the legislation I am introducing today does not deal with \nthe issue of funding, I do want to note that it simply will not work if \nwe treat education as anything less than an urgent budget priority. \nThis administration has made a solid commitment to education funding, \nand I was pleased to see that commitment bear fruit in the form of \nfunding through the Recovery Act.\n  I am also heartened to see that the administration supports \ncomprehensive reform of No Child Left Behind. Reform does not mean \nrepeal. The fundamental aim of the law was right. Accountability is as \nimportant now as it was when we passed the law.\n  The two main reforms my legislation makes are designed to enforce \naccountability with measures that accurately reflect student \nperformance and to encourage better teacher performance without the \nimposition of mandates that make it harder to ensure that students are \ntaught by qualified and dedicated educators.\n  First, my legislation will allow schools to be given credit for \nperforming well on measures other than test scores when calculating \nstudent achievement.\n  Test scores are important measures of what students know. But they \nare not the only, or even necessarily the best, measures of how much \nprogress a school's student body has made. Dropout rates, participation \nin advanced placement courses, individual student improvement over \ntime--these are metrics that can tell us not just where students are, \nbut how far they have come.\n  Unfortunately, current law only allows these measures to show how \nschools are failing, not to reflect how schools are succeeding. When \nmore kids are taking advanced courses or fewer are dropping out, a \nschool is doing something right--and it should receive credit for doing \nso.\n  Second, my legislation reforms the teacher certification process.\n  The next student, parent, or, indeed, teacher I meet who does not \nbelieve educators should be highly qualified will be the first. But \nunder the current law, ``highly qualified'' is poorly defined.\n  For instance, a high school science teacher could be required to hold \ndegrees in biology, physics, and chemistry to be considered highly \nqualified. In small schools where there may be only one 7th or 8th \ngrade teacher teaching all subjects, these teachers could similarly be \nrequired to hold degrees in every subject area.\n  The result is a shortage of teachers and a surplus of confusion.\n  My bill will allow states to create a single assessment covering \nmultiple subjects for middle school teachers and allow states to issue \na broad certification for science and social studies.\n  No Child Left Behind was supposed to challenge our schools to do \nbetter. Instead, it has become an obstacle to progress, a struggle that \noften distracts from the business of education. As we reauthorize the \nlaw--and we should--we must reform it so that it encourages students, \neducators, and school administrators to do better instead of punishing \nthem when they fall behind.\n  Every American child deserves to be taught by a great teacher in a \ngreat school. Until we reach that goal, we must always dedicate our \ntime and resources towards helping students succeed. Until our laws are \nmoving us towards that goal, we must continue to reform them.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD:\n  S. 3559. A bill to amend the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965 to strengthen mentoring programs, and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I rise to introduce the Mentoring \nAmerica's Children Act of 2010, which will help promote positive youth \ndevelopment for children.\n  Approximately 17.6 million young people, which is nearly half the \npopulation between ages 10 and 18, live in situations that put them at \nrisk of not living up to their potential. Without intervention by \ncaring adults, these young people could make choices that undermine \ntheir future as well as the economic and social well-being of our \nNation.\n  Mentoring programs that provide youth with support, advice, \nfriendship, positive reinforcement, and constructive examples have \nproved to be a powerful tool for enhancing positive development among \nyouth. I, myself, was a mentor in the Big Brother Program in \nConnecticut, and I saw first-hand the impact these programs have on the \nchildren involved. Research has found that mentored youth have fewer \nschool absences, better attitudes towards school, less drug and alcohol \nabuse, fewer incidents of hitting, better relationships with their \nparents, and more positive attitudes towards helping others. Mentored \nyouth are also more likely to graduate from high school and go on to \nhigher education. Thus, mentoring invests not only in the individual \nchild, but our Nation's future success. However, approximately 14.6 \nmillion young people are in need of mentors; they are part of what we \ncall our nation's ``mentoring gap.''\n  The Mentoring America's Children Act of 2010 amends the Elementary \nand Secondary Education Act of 1965 ESEA, in order to strengthen the \nmentoring program is several ways. First, it will update the purpose of \nthe program to include character education and school connectedness, \nwhich has been found to reduce school absentee rates and improve \nacademic performance. This bill broadens the scope of mentoring to \ninclude special populations such as indigenous youth, delinquent and \nneglected populations, and programs targeting middle and high school \nmigrant youth. All of these special populations are at increased risk \nof not reaching their potential.\n  The Mentoring America's Children Act of 2010 also provides training \nand technical assistance to grantees, tracks student outcomes, and \nimproves the sustainability of grant recipients. Finally, it \nstrengthens the research related to school-based mentoring to help \ninform future mentoring programs in order to best meet the needs of our \nyouth.\n  Mentoring plays a key role in improving the lives of youth, \nespecially those from disadvantaged backgrounds. It is critical that we \ninvest in our youth and help provide them with the opportunities to \nreach their potential. Thus, I urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting the Mentoring America's Children Act of 2010. Together we \ncan invest in the lives of our youth and improve the future of our \nnation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5702-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5702-S5703]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 575--CONGRATULATING THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA \n BASEBALL TEAM FOR WINNING THE 2010 NCAA DIVISION I BASEBALL NATIONAL \n                              CHAMPIONSHIP\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. DeMint) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise to celebrate tonight that last \nnight the University of South Carolina won the College World Series. I \nnever thought I would live long enough to hear myself say that.\n  I have been a Gamecocks fan since high school. I went to the \nUniversity of South Carolina, and there is no group of people who loves \nsports and their university more than the University of South Carolina, \nbut we have been a long-suffering group.\n  We have been waiting for next year every year I can remember, and we \nhave knocked on the door and the door has never opened. But this group \nof young men and Coach Tanner of the University of South Carolina \nbaseball team were down and out, one strike away from elimination, lost \nthe first game, and made it all the way through to beat great teams \nsuch as Clemson. Last night's game, if you watched it--it was over \nabout 12:30--was a nail-biter. It was probably the best example of \ncollege baseball I have ever seen, amateur athletics. And what a \nfitting tribute to Rosenblatt Stadium for that to be the last game. It \nwas a well-played game. To the opponents at UCLA, I know your heart was \nbroken, but you acquitted yourself well.\n  I rise on behalf of the University of South Carolina, my alma mater, \nand the State of South Carolina to let people in South Carolina and \nthroughout the country know that we finally did it, that this group of \nyoung men pitched incredibly well, had timely hits, and never gave up. \nIt was about a lot more than baseball to the people in South Carolina. \nTo those who have been following Gamecock sports, there is the legend \nof the chicken curse, that our mascot is a gamecock fighting chicken \nand we have been cursed because of that. I am here to tell you on the \nSenate floor tonight that the chicken curse is over. Long live the \nGamecock Nation.\n  To my friends at Clemson--I live 5 miles away from the baseball \nstadium at Clemson University--your day is coming. It won't be long \nbefore I will be able to take this floor and celebrate Clemson \nUniversity's winning of the College World Series.\n  Upon the passing of Robert C.

Res. 576\n\n       Whereas the Electronic Signatures in Global and National \n     Commerce Act (ESIGN) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.) was enacted on \n     June 30, 2000, to ensure that a signature, contract, or other \n     record relating to a transaction may not be denied legal \n     effect, validity, or enforceability solely because the \n     signature, contract, or other record is in electronic form;\n       Whereas in that Act, Congress directed the Secretary of \n     Commerce to take all actions necessary to eliminate or \n     reduce, to the maximum extent possible, the impediments to \n     commerce in electronic signatures, for the purpose of \n     facilitating the development of interstate and foreign \n     commerce; and\n       Whereas June 30, 2010, marks the 10th anniversary of the \n     enactment of ESIGN and would be an appropriate date to \n     designate as ``National ESIGN Day 2010'': Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of a ``National ESIGN Day \n     2010'';\n       (2) recognizes the contribution made by Congress in the \n     Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act \n     (ESIGN) (15 U.S.C. 7001 et seq.) to the adoption of modern \n     solutions that keep the United States on the leading \n     technological edge; and\n       (3) reaffirms the commitment of the Senate to facilitating \n     interstate and foreign commerce in an increasingly digital \n     world.\n\n                              S. Res. 577\n\n       Whereas Henry Vinton Plummer was born into slavery on July \n     31, 1844, in Prince George's County, Maryland and escaped \n     from slavery to serve honorably in the U.S. Navy during the \n     Civil War;\n       Whereas Henry Plummer was assigned in 1864 to the Union \n     gunboat U.S.S. Coeur de Lion, which engaged numerous \n     Confederate ships trying to run Union blockades in the \n     Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries during the Civil War;\n       Whereas after being honorably discharged from the Navy in \n     1865, Henry Plummer studied to become a minister, and felt \n     called to serve again in the United States military;\n       Whereas in 1866, the 39th Congress passed legislation to \n     establish African-American military units and stipulated that \n     a chaplain be assigned to each regiment;\n       Whereas in July 1884, Henry Plummer was appointed the first \n     African-American chaplain in the United States Regular Army \n     with a military rank equivalent of Captain;\n       Whereas Chaplain Plummer served for more than 10 years with \n     the Ninth Cavalry and was stationed at Army forts in Kansas, \n     Wyoming, and Nebraska;\n       Whereas during his time in uniform, Chaplain Plummer worked \n     to improve education and voter participation and reduce the \n     temptation of gambling, drunkenness, and prostitution among \n     soldiers under his ministry;\n       Whereas Chaplain Plummer fought racism and other injustices \n     of the time while serving his country with the Ninth Calvary;\n       Whereas Chaplain Plummer's records in Fort Riley and Fort \n     Robinson noted that he performed admirably in his work among \n     soldiers and in his efforts on behalf of their spiritual \n     well-being;\n       Whereas Chaplain Plummer endured racial bias and animosity \n     throughout his time in uniform, including being denied \n     officer housing and being forced to live among enlisted \n     personnel despite holding the Army officer rank equivalent of \n     Captain;\n       Whereas in 1894, Chaplain Plummer was court-martialed, \n     convicted, and dismissed from the Army under circumstances \n     tainted by racial and personal animus;\n       Whereas the Army Board for Correction of Military Records \n     concluded that personal grudges and racial bias were driving \n     factors that led to Chaplain Plummer's court-martial;\n       Whereas the Army Board for Correction of Military Records \n     noted evidence that shows Chaplain Plummer served his country \n     well and was a highly respected and admired officer;\n       Whereas in 2005, the Army Board for Correction of Military \n     Records changed the status of Chaplain Plummer's military \n     discharge to ``honorable'';\n       Whereas despite the unfair and racially charged atmosphere \n     that led to Chaplain Plummer's conviction and discharge, he \n     continued to ask for reinstatement in the military out of a \n     desire to serve his country;\n       Whereas Chaplain Plummer was a devoted family man, \n     minister, veteran, and community leader committed to the \n     principles of liberty and opportunity for which the United \n     States stands; and\n       Whereas Chaplain Plummer rose from the depths of slavery to \n     remarkable heights, and led a life of selfless contributions \n     to his country: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) celebrates the life and patriotism of Chaplain Henry \n     Vinton Plummer;\n       (2) expresses its admiration for Chaplain Plummer for his \n     perseverance and resolve in the face of racial oppression in \n     the military history of the United States; and\n       (3) congratulates Chaplain Plummer's extended family for \n     their work to commemorate his life of devotion to helping \n     others while overcoming tremendous adversity.\n\n                              S. Res. 578\n\n       Whereas the Summer Food Service Program provides healthy, \n     nutritious meals to an average 2,900,000 children each \n     weekday during the summer;\n       Whereas there are 34,700 feeding sites in low-income \n     neighborhoods located at churches, schools, parks, recreation \n     centers, and summer camps in all 50 States;\n       Whereas thousands volunteer at summer feeding sites;\n       Whereas summer feeding programs play an important role in \n     providing safe places for children and teenagers to engage in \n     physical activity and provide educational opportunities to \n     spur learning during the summer months;\n       Whereas data from the Department of Agriculture has shown \n     rates of hunger and food insecurity among school-age children \n     increase during the summer months;\n       Whereas of the 19,500,000 children receiving free or \n     reduced priced meals through the National School Lunch \n     Program, only 1 in 9 receive meals at a summer feeding site \n     on an average day;\n       Whereas there are only 34 summer food sites for every 100 \n     school lunch programs; and\n       Whereas many low-income, food insecure children in rural \n     areas lack access to summer feeding locations: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates June 2010 as ``Summer Food Service Program \n     Awareness Month'';\n       (2) encourages schools, nonprofit institutions, churches, \n     parks, recreation centers, and summer camps to sponsor summer \n     feeding sites in their communities; and\n       (3) encourages schools, local businesses, nonprofit \n     institutions, churches, cities, and State governments to \n     raise awareness of the availability of summer feeding sites \n     and support efforts to increase participation of children who \n     might otherwise go without meals if not for the Summer Food \n     Service Program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/30/senate-section/article/S5717-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5717-S5718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE AND CONDITIONAL RECESS OR \n                       ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. CARPER.
