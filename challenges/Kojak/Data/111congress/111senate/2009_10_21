Mr. President, the prayer of the Chaplain today was right \non point for something that has taken place in the last 3 or 4 days. In \nAfghanistan, we are at a critical juncture. For Afghanistan to move \nforward and win the fight against the Taliban, the country must have a \nlegitimate government.\n  The first round of elections in Afghanistan was tainted by \nallegations of significant fraud, and we faced the possibility of a \npotential political crisis in Afghanistan. I am pleased President \nKarzai has recognized the need for a runoff election.\n  The reason I mention sacrifice and service is in relation to Senator \nJohn Kerry. If you look at his life, it has been one of sacrifice, it \nhas been one of service to our country--whether in the jungles of \nVietnam, where he was wounded three times and received a Silver Star \nfor his heroism, or whether it was in his capacity as the Democratic \nnominee for President or whether it has been as chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee.\n  He took off for Afghanistan and Pakistan at a time when he was badly \nneeded. I missed him here. We had some votes I wish John Kerry could \nhave been here for. I told him that when he called me. But he explained \nwhat he was doing there, and immediately upon his hanging up, I \nreceived a call from Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, saying: He is \ndoing extremely good work there. Don't be upset at him because he can't \nbe here because what he is doing in Afghanistan is something that is \nvitally important to not only our country but to the world.\n  That sacrifice and that service--and also the Chaplain mentioned \nlabor--this man worked very hard. He has labored, as chairman of this \nForeign Relations Committee, as I have never seen. He has been so \ninvolved in what is going on there. Not only is he dealing with the \nissues we see every day--\n\n[[Page S10588]]\n\nAfghanistan, Pakistan, North Korea, with what is going on on the \ncontinent of Africa--he is involved in global warming because of the \ntreaty implications of the treaty we are trying to negotiate in \nCopenhagen in December.\n  I am extremely impressed with Senator Kerry always but especially in \nthe last few days. As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, he \nhas played a central role in resolving the crisis in Afghanistan.\n  As many have read in the news, he had been trying to persuade \nPresident Karzai that a second round of elections was necessary--and \nthey were necessary. If you read the press today, it was a touch-and-go \nthing. It was not until President Karzai and Senator Kerry took a walk \ntogether to talk about what is going on in that part of the world that \nthe decision was made by President Karzai that he would go along with \nthe second election.\n  Senator Kerry has worked closely with our diplomatic team, including \nAmbassador Eikenberry; Secretary Clinton; our National Security \nAdviser, General Jones; and others to send a clear message to President \nKarzai.\n  We all know the situation in Afghanistan remains fragile and that \nthere will still be many steps needed to be taken so we have a credible \nand legitimate government in Kabul. But I believe very sincerely \nSenator Kerry played a pivotal role in preventing a crisis in \nAfghanistan and that his work has not only stabilized Afghanistan but \nthe entire region.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, over the last several months, lawmakers \nin Washington have been engaged in a serious and wide-ranging debate \nabout the fate of our Nation's health care system. It is a debate that \ngrew out of a recognition that while America may have the best health \ncare in the world, the cost of care is too high and too many lack \ninsurance. This much was never in dispute.\n  There is not a single Member of Congress from either party who does \nnot want to solve these problems. That is why the disagreements we have \nhad have arisen not over the ends but over the means of achieving these \ncommon goals. That is why, over the past few months, two very different \napproaches to reform have come into view.\n  For most Democrats, reform seems to come in a single form: a vast \nexpansion of government, detailed in complicated, 1,000-page bills, \ncosting trillions. The only thing that is clear about the Democratic \nplans are the basics: They cost about $1 trillion, they increase \npremiums, raise taxes, and slash Medicare.\n  In short, they include a lot of things Americans did not ask for and \ndo not want, and they include very few of the things Americans thought \nthey were going to get.\n  What was supposed to be an exercise in smart, bipartisan, commonsense \nreforms that cut costs and increased access somehow became an exercise \nin government expansion that promises to raise costs, raise premiums, \nand slash Medicare for seniors. For Democrats in Congress, the original \npurpose of reform seems to have been blurred.\n  Republicans have taken a different approach. We agreed at the outset \nthat reform was needed. But in our view, those reforms would not \nnecessarily cost a lot of money, would not add to the debt, and would \nnot expand the government.\n  Instead of a massive government-driven experiment, Republicans have \noffered commonsense, step-by-step solutions to the problems of cost and \naccess--things such as medical liability reform, which would save tens \nof billions of dollars and increase access to care; needed insurance \nreforms that would increase access and lower costs; and prevention and \nwellness programs, such as the ones that have been so successful in \nbending the cost curve in the right direction--which is downward--at \nmajor businesses such as Safeway.\n  Here were the two approaches to reform. Well, the American people \nlooked at these two approaches and they made their choice. All summer \nlong, we watched as ordinary Americans reacted to the administration's \nplan to put government between individuals and their health care and to \npay for it with higher premiums, higher taxes, and Medicare cuts in the \nmiddle of a recession.\n  Americans rejected the idea of a vast, new experiment to reorder \ntheir health care and nearly one-fifth of the economy in a single, \nstunning move. They know the stakes are too high. Last Friday, the \nTreasury Department announced the government ran a deficit, in the \nfiscal year that just ended, of more than three times the previous \nrecord.\n  The national debt is nearly $12 trillion. It is expected to grow by \nanother $9 trillion over the next 10 years. Medicare and Medicaid cost \nthe Federal Government nearly $700 billion a year--a cost that is \nexpected to double in 10 years. These numbers are like nothing we have \never seen. Yet in the midst of all this, the administration is \nproposing that we conduct a $1 trillion experiment in health care that \nwould expand government spending even more. Now Democrats in Congress \nare proposing that we put another $1/4 trillion on the government \ncharge card in order to prevent a cut in the reimbursement rate to \ndoctors who treat Medicare patients.\n\n  All of us want to keep this cut from happening, but the American \npeople don't want us to borrow another cent to pay for it, and they \ndon't want Democrats in Congress to pretend that this $\\1/4\\ trillion \nisn't part of the cost of health care reform because it is. It is also \na clear violation of the President's pledge that health care reform \nwouldn't add a single dime to the deficit over the next decade. In \nfact, if Democrats have their way, this bill would add nearly 2.5 \ntrillion dimes to the national debt. Well, the American people have a \nmessage for Democrats in Congress: The time to get our fiscal house in \norder is not tomorrow, it is not next year, it is now--right now.\n  Last week, 10 Democratic Senators sent a letter to the majority \nleader outlining some of the problems that can be expected to result \nfrom our record deficit and debts. They pointed out that each \nAmerican's share of today's debt is more than $38,000, that long-term \ndeficits will lead to higher interest rates and inflation, and all this \ndebt threatens to weaken not only our basic standard of living but also \nour national security. Then they make an urgent plea. They called on \ntheir party to do something to deal with these urgent fiscal realities.\n  Well, they shouldn't hold their breath because instead of addressing \nthese urgent issues, a handful of top Democrats are pressing forward \nbehind closed doors with a health care plan that, once fully \nimplemented, and including the physician reimbursement issue, would \ncost more than $2 trillion.\n  It is hard to imagine, but if the history of government entitlement \nprograms is any guide, then these estimates are almost certainly on the \nconservative side. History shows these kinds of programs almost never \ncome in under cost. Consider just a few examples: At the time that \nMedicare Part A was created, it was estimated that costs for hospital \nservices and related administration for the year 1990 would run about \n$9 billion. The actual cost was seven times that amount. Medicare Part \nB, a program that covers physician services, was expected to run on \n$500 million a year from general tax revenues, along with a $3 monthly \npremium. Last year, the program was funded through nearly $150 billion \nin Federal revenue.\n  As I say, these are just a few examples, but they illustrate a larger \npoint that can't be ignored. The nature of government entitlements is \nsuch that they only get bigger with time. The estimates we are getting \nhave to be viewed in light of past experience, and past experience \nisn't encouraging.\n\n[[Page S10589]]\n\n  Several months into this debate, it is easy to forget that at the \noutset everyone seemed to agree--at the outset of this debate on health \ncare everyone seemed to agree--on two things: that health care reforms \nwere needed and any reform would have to lower overall health care \ncosts. We all agreed on that. Yet the evidence suggests that the bill \nSenate Democrats and White House officials are carving up in private \nwould do just the opposite. It would actually increase costs, it would \nincrease premiums, raise taxes, and slash Medicare. That is not reform.\n  Americans are concerned about the direction in which we are headed: \nrecord debts, record deficits, endless borrowing, and yet every day we \nhear of more plans to borrow and spend, borrow and spend. Americans \ndon't want the same kind of denial, delay, and rationing of care they \nhave seen in countries that have followed the path of government-driven \nhealth care for all. They are perplexed that in the midst of a terrible \nrecession, near 10 percent unemployment, massive Federal debt, and a \ndeficit that rivals the deficits of the last 4 years combined, the \nWhite House would move ahead with a massive expansion of government \nhealth care. They are telling us that common sense, step-by-step \nreforms are the better, wiser, and more fiscally responsible way to go.\n  This is the message I have delivered nearly every day on the Senate \nfloor since the first week of June because, in my view, it is the \nmessage the American people have been sending us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I wish to talk this morning about the same \nhealth care issue the Senator from Kentucky just addressed. I think \nRepublicans have always had a lot of very good alternatives to deal \nwith two critical problems: No. 1, the rising costs of health care and, \nsecondly, the problem of some uninsured in this country needing help to \nget that insurance. Unfortunately, our ideas have not been included in \nthe legislation passed by the committees. In fact, when we have offered \namendments to propose these alternative ideas, they have been rejected.\n  One of the primary ways we know we can reduce costs is through the \nmechanism of medical malpractice reform. That deals with the problem of \nthe jackpot justice system that currently is abused by trial lawyers \nwhere they file lawsuits, they get big recoveries or they force \nsettlements, and the net result is two things which I spoke about \nyesterday.\n  First of all, liability insurance premiums for physicians now consume \nabout 10 cents for every health care dollar spent. If we had medical \nmalpractice reform, we could reduce that. We wouldn't, obviously, get \nrid of it, but the cost for physicians would be significantly less.\n  For example, we know some specialties, such as obstetrics, \nneurosurgery, and some others, including anesthesiology, for example, \nwill frequently have annual liability premiums in the range of \n$200,000. That, obviously, is a cost that is passed on. When they bill \npatients, they have to cover the cost of their medical malpractice \ninsurance.\n  I mentioned yesterday a study by the former president of the American \nAcademy of Orthopedic Surgeons, Dr. Stuart Weinstein. He has written \nabout the extra cost of delivering a baby because, he said, if a doctor \ndelivers 100 babies a year and pays $200,000 for medical liability \ninsurance, $2,000 of the delivery cost for each baby goes to pay the \ncost of the medical liability premium. So we could reduce by $2,000 the \ncost of delivering a baby if we were able to pass meaningful medical \nliability insurance reform.\n  The even bigger cost is defensive medicine--the kinds of things \ndoctors do, not because they are necessary to take care of their \npatients, but because if they don't do them they might get sued and \nsome expert will claim they should have had this extra test or done \nthis extra procedure; and if they would have just done that, then maybe \nthe patient would have been all right. So as a result, defensive \nmedicine results in hundreds of billions of dollars of expenses every \nyear.\n  In fact, a 2005 survey published in the Journal of the American \nMedical Association found that 92 percent of the doctors said they had, \nindeed, made unnecessary referrals or ordered unnecessary tests just to \nshield themselves from this liability. How much does this potentially \ncost? I said hundreds of billions. Well, let me cite two studies.\n  All of the studies I have seen are roughly within the same ballpark. \nThey differ just a little bit. For example, Sally Pipes, who is \npresident of the Pacific Research Institute, found that defensive \nmedicine costs $214 billion a year. A new study by \nPricewaterhouseCoopers reveals similar findings, pegging the cost at \n$239 billion per year. Well, $214 billion, $239 billion, we can quibble \nabout the amount; it is not insignificant. So when we are talking about \nwell over $200 billion a year in defensive medicine, we know there is a \nbig amount of money to be saved, and we could pass those savings on to \nthe consumers of health care.\n\n  Yesterday I cited the statistics from Arizona and Texas where both \nStates have implemented medical liability reforms of different kinds, \nbut both States have found significant reductions in insurance premiums \nfor physicians, fewer malpractice cases filed, and, in the case of \nTexas, an infusion of a remarkable number of physicians into Texas \nbecause it is a more benign environment now in which to practice their \nprofession.\n  The reason I mention all of this is we have been talking about this \nfor months now and not one of the Democratic bills contains medical \nmalpractice reform. The reason is clear. Democrats are frequently \nsupported by trial lawyers, and trial lawyers don't like medical \nmalpractice reform. That is how they make a lot of money, so they don't \nwant to see the reform. We ought to reform the system for the benefit \nof our constituents rather than to not do it in order to help trial \nlawyers.\n  Again, the reason I mention this is because a bill we are going to be \ntaking up later today, the so-called ``doc fix''--and that is a very \nbad name for it--is a bill that would deal with the formula under which \ndoctors are compensated for Medicare. One of the things that has been \nreported in newspapers is that the American Medical Association will \nnot push for medical malpractice reform if they are able to get this \nbill passed. I find that to be a very troubling fact because all of the \nphysicians I know realize we need medical malpractice reform.\n  Here is how the Washington Post editorialized it yesterday morning, \nand I am quoting:\n\n       The so-called ``doc fix'' is being rushed to the Senate \n     floor this week in advance of\n\n[[Page S10590]]\n\n     health reform not because it has nothing to do with health \n     reform, but because it has everything to do with it. The \n     political imperative is twofold: To make certain that \n     Republicans don't use the physician payment issue to bring \n     down the larger bill--\n\n  That is because of the fact that it would add to the deficit--\n\n     and to placate the American Medical Association.\n\n  The concern I have is that it doesn't help the physicians. All this \nlegislation does is to say that the formula which has been in effect \nsince 1997, but never adhered to by the Congress, will not be the \nformula that goes forward in the future, but it doesn't fix the payment \nproblem. Every year, because the formula would result in huge cuts to \nphysicians who take care of Medicare patients--and everybody agrees \nthat is a bad thing--we say we are not going to pay attention to the \nformula. We are going to raise the doctors' reimbursements by a \npercentage point or a half percent or some modest amount.\n  All this legislation does is to freeze physician payments for 10 \nyears--to freeze them--zero; not even any kind of cost-of-living \nincrease. I guarantee that after 10 years, physicians not getting any \nkind of an increase at all are going to be hurting.\n  I know what is going to happen, which is that physicians and groups \nsuch as the American Medical Association will have to come back to \nCongress every year and say they need to have some kind of a modest \nincrease. Republicans want to be able to offer amendments on this \nlegislation to provide for such modest increases. Incidentally, those \nmodest increases would be offset--that is to say, the cost to the \ngovernment would be offset--so that we wouldn't be adding to the \ndeficit. It is very clear there is no new formula in place, no new \nformula has been proposed, so this legislation doesn't solve the \nproblem. It simply says, well, we are not going to adhere to the \nformula in the future. Big deal. We have never adhered to it in the \npast. We are never going to adhere to it because it makes no sense. \nEverybody agrees with that. So what do we get out of this? Nothing. A \nfreeze for 10 years is not a solution to the problem.\n  I hope physicians don't see this as a solution as a result of, as I \nsaid, this having been reported in some of the media, so that they will \ndecide not to push for medical malpractice reform because physicians \nknow how important that is. I have just talked about how important it \nis.\n  We need solutions to problems. One of the problems is we have \nincreases in the costs of providing health care. One solution to that--\nand we are talking about well over a couple of hundred billion dollars, \nas I indicated, from the studies I cited a moment ago. One solution to \nthat is to tackle this problem of medical liability reform. Some \nStates, probably about four or five, have done this, and they have \ndemonstrated it can work.\n  The President's approach is, well, let's have a study about it. Let's \nmaybe have a demonstration project. We have some demonstration \nprojects. One of them is Arizona and one of them is Texas, and they \ndemonstrate that it works. Since the Federal Government has to pay \nabout half of all of the cost of health care in the country because of \nMedicare, Medicaid, and veterans care and so on, the Congressional \nBudget Office says we, the Federal Government, could save ourselves $54 \nbillion if we had meaningful medical malpractice reform. We could \nexpect the same amount for the private sector.\n  The bottom line is, the bill we are going to be voting on later today \ndoesn't solve any problem. It does not help the physicians. One way we \ncan help not just physicians but patients by reducing their cost of \ncare is accepting some of the Republican alternative ideas that have \nbeen proposed, starting with medical liability reform.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor to the Senator from Tennessee.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10590-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10590-S10592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            NO ENEMIES LIST\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, in 1969 and during the first half of \n1970, I was a wet-behind-the-ears, 29-year-old staff aide in the West \nWing of the Nixon White House. I was working for the wisest man in that \nWhite House whose name was Bryce Harlow. He was a friend of President \nJohnson, as well as the favorite staff member of President Eisenhower \nand President Nixon's first appointee.\n  Based upon that experience and my 40 years since then in and out of \npublic life, I want to make what I hope will be taken as a friendly \nsuggestion to President Obama and his White House, and it is this: \nDon't create an enemies list.\n  As I was leaving the White House in 1970, Mr. Harlow was heading out \non the campaign plane with Vice President Spiro Agnew, whose job was to \nvilify Democrats and to help elect Republicans. The Vice President had \nthe help of talented young speechwriters, the late Bill Safire and Pat \nBuchanan. In Memphis, he called Albert Gore, Sr., the ``southern \nregional chairman of the eastern liberal establishment,'' and then the \nVice President labeled the increasingly negative news media as \n``nattering nabobs of negativism.''\n  These phrases have become part of our political lore. They began \nplayfully enough, in the back and forth of political election combat. \nBut after I had come home to Tennessee, they escalated into something \nmore. They eventually emerged into the Nixon's enemies list.\n  In 1971, Chuck Colson, who was then a member of President Nixon's \nstaff and today is admired for his decades of selfless work in prison \nreform, presented to John Dean, the White House Counsel, a list of what \nhe called ``persons known to be active in their opposition to our \nadministration.'' Mr. Dean said he thought the administration should \n``maximize our incumbency . . . [or] to put it more bluntly''--and I am \nusing his quotes--``use the available Federal machinery to screw our \npolitical enemies.''\n  On Colson's list of 20 people were CBS correspondent Dan Schorr, \nWashington Star columnist Mary McGrory, Leonard Woodcock, the head of \nthe United Auto Workers, John Conyers, a Democratic Congressman from \nMichigan, Edwin Guthman, managing editor of the Los Angeles Times, and \nseveral prominent businessmen, such as Howard Stein of the Dreyfus \nCorporation, Arnold Picker, vice president of United Artists. The New \nYork Times and the Washington Post were made out to be enemies of the \nRepublic.\n  Make no mistake, politics was not such a gentlemanly affair in those \ndays either. After Barry Goldwater won the Presidential nomination in \n1964, Daniel Schorr had told CBS viewers that Goldwater had \n``travel[led] to Germany to join up with the right wing there'' and \n``visit[ed] Hitler's old stomping ground.'' Schorr later corrected that \non the air. What was different about Colson and Dean's effort, though, \nwas the open declaration of war upon anyone who seemed to disagree with \nadministration policies. Colson later expanded his list to include \nhundreds of people, including Joe Namath, John Lennon, Carol Channing, \nGregory Peck, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Congressional Black Caucus, \nAlabama Governor George Wallace. All this came out during the Watergate \nhearings. You could see an administration spiraling downwards, and, of \ncourse, we all know where that led.\n  The only reason I mention this is because I have an uneasy feeling \nonly 10 months into this new administration that we are beginning to \nsee the symptoms of this same kind of animus developing in the Obama \nadministration.\n  According to Politico, the White House plans to ``neuter the United \nStates Chamber of Commerce,'' an organization with members in almost \nevery major community in America. The chamber had supported the \nPresident's stimulus package and defended some of his early \nappointments, but has problems with his health care and climate change \nproposals.\n  The Department of Health and Human Services imposed a gag order on a \nlarge health care company, Humana, that had warned its Medicare \nAdvantage customers that their benefits might be reduced in Democratic \nhealth care proposals--a piece of information that is perfectly true. \nThis gag order was lifted only after the Republican leader, Senator \nMcConnell of Kentucky, said he would block any future nominees to the \nDepartment until the matter was righted.\n  The White House communications director recently announced that the \nadministration would treat a major television network, FOX News, as \n``part of\n\n[[Page S10591]]\n\nthe opposition.'' On Sunday, White House officials were all over talk \nshows urging other news organizations to boycott Fox and not pick up \nany of its stories. Those stories, for example, would include the video \nthat two amateur filmmakers made of ACORN representatives explaining \nhow to open a brothel. That is a story other media managed to ignore \nuntil almost a week after Congress decided to cut ACORN's funding.\n  The President himself has not stopped blaming banks and investment \nhouses for the financial meltdown, even as it has become clear that \nCongress played a huge role, too, by encouraging Americans to borrow \nmoney for houses they could not afford. The President was ``taking \nnames'' of bondholders who resisted the General Motors and Chrysler \nbailouts. Insurance companies, once allies of the Obama health care \nproposal, have suddenly become the source of all of its problems \nbecause they pointed out--again correctly--that if Congress taxes \ninsurance premiums and restricts coverage to those who are sicker and \nolder, the cost of premiums for millions of Americans is likely to go \nup instead of down. Because of that insubordination, the President and \nhis allies have threatened to take away the insurance companies' \nantitrust exemption.\n  Even those in Congress have found ourselves in the crosshairs. The \nassistant Republican leader, Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona, said to ABC's \nGeorge Stephanopoulos that the stimulus plan wasn't working. The White \nHouse wrote the Governor of Arizona and said: If you don't want the \nmoney, we won't send it. Senator McCain said this could be perceived as \na threat to the people of Arizona.\n  Senator Bennett of Utah, Senator Collins, Senator Hutchison and I, as \nwell as Democratic Senators Byrd and Feingold, all have questioned the \nnumber and power of 18 new White House czars who are not confirmed by \nthe Senate. We have suggested this is a threat to constitutional checks \nand balances. The White House refused to send anyone to testify at \ncongressional hearings.\n  Senator Bennett and I found ourselves ``called out,'' as they say, on \nthe White House blog by the President's communications director.\n  Even the President, in his address to Congress on health care, \nthreatened to ``call out'' Members of Congress who disagree with him.\n  This behavior is typical of street brawls and political campaign \nconsultants. It is a mistake for the President of the United States and \nfor the White House staff. If the President and his top aides treat \npeople with different views as enemies instead of listening to what \nthey have to say, they are likely to end up with a narrow view and a \nfeeling that the whole world is out to get them. And, as those of us \nwho served in the Nixon administration know, that can get you into a \nlot of trouble.\n  This administration is only 10 months old. It is not too late to take \na different approach, both at the White House and in Congress. And here \nis one opportunity: At the beginning of the year, shortly after the \nPresident's inauguration, the Republican leader, Senator McConnell, \naddressed the National Press Club. He proposed that he and the \nPresident work together to make Social Security solvent.\n  Senator McConnell said he would make sure the President got more \nsupport in that effort from Republicans than President George W. Bush \ngot from Democrats when he tried to solve the same problem.\n  President Obama held a summit on the dangers of runaway costs of \nentitlements. I was invited and attended. Every expert there said \nmaking Social Security solvent is essential to our country's fiscal \nstability. There is still time to get that done.\n  Or on clean energy, Republicans have put forward four ideas--build \n100 nuclear plants in 20 years, electrify half our cars and trucks in \n20 years, explore offshore for low-carbon natural gas and for oil, and \ndouble energy research and development for alternative fuels. The \nadministration agrees with this on electric cars and on research and \ndevelopment. We may not be so far apart on offshore exploration. At his \ntown meeting in New Orleans last week, the President said the United \nStates would be, in his words, ``stupid'' not to use nuclear power. He \nis right since nuclear power produces 70 percent of our carbon-free \nelectricity.\n\n  So why don't we work together on this lower cost way to address clean \nenergy and climate change instead of enacting a national energy tax?\n  On health care, the White House idea of bipartisanship has been akin \nto that of a marksman at a State fair shooting gallery: hit one target \nand you win the prize. With such big Democratic majorities, the White \nHouse figures all it needs to do is unify the Democrats and pick off \none or two Republicans. That strategy may win the prize but lose the \ncountry.\n  Usually on complex issues, the President needs bipartisan support in \nCongress to reassure and achieve broad and lasting support in the \ncountry.\n  In 1968, I can remember when President Johnson, then with bigger \nmajorities in Congress than President Obama has today, arranged for the \ncivil rights bill to be written in open sessions over several weeks in \nthe office of the Republican leader, Everett Dirksen. Dirksen got some \nof the credit; Johnson got the legislation he wanted; the country went \nalong with it. Instead of comprehensive health care that raises \npremiums and increases the debt, why should the White House not work \nwith Republicans step by step to reduce health care costs and then, as \nwe can afford it, reduce the number of Americans who do not have access \nto health care?\n  The President and his Education Secretary Arne Duncan have been \ncourageous--there is no better word for it--in advocating paying \nteachers more for teaching well and expanding the number of charter \nschools. These ideas are the Holy Grail for school reform. They are \nalso ideas that are anathema to the labor unions who support the \nPresident. President Obama's advocacy of master teachers and charter \nschools could be the domestic equivalent of President Nixon going to \nChina. I, among others, admire that advocacy and have been doing all I \ncan to help him.\n  Having once been there, I can understand how those in the White House \nfeel oppressed by those with whom they disagree; how they feel besieged \nby some of the media. I hope the current White House occupants will \nunderstand that this is nothing new in American politics--all the way \nback to the days when John Adams and Thomas Jefferson exchanged \ninsults. The only thing new is today there are multiple media outlets \nreporting and encouraging the insults 24 hours a day.\n  As any veteran of the Nixon White House can attest, we have been down \nthis road before, and it will not end well. An enemies list only \ndenigrates the Presidency and the Republic itself.\n  Forty years ago, Bryce Harlow would say to me: Now, Lamar, remember \nthat our job here is to push all the merely important issues out of the \nWhite House so the President can deal with a handful of issues that are \ntruly Presidential. Then he would slip off for a private meeting in the \nCapitol with Democratic leaders who controlled the Congress and usually \nfound a way to enact the President's proposals.\n  Most successful leaders have eventually seen the wisdom of Lord \nPalmerston, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who said:\n\n       We have no eternal allies, and we have no perpetual \n     enemies.\n\n  The British writer Edward Dicey was once introduced to President \nLincoln as ``one of his enemies.'' ``I did not know I had any \nenemies,'' Lincoln answered. And Dicey later wrote: ``I can still feel, \nas I write, the grip of that great bony hand held out to me in token of \nfriendship.''\n  In conclusion, here is my point. These are unusually difficult times, \nwith plenty of forces encouraging us to disagree. Let's not start \ncalling people out and compiling an enemies list. Let's push the street \nbrawling out of the White House and work together on the truly \nPresidential issues--creating jobs, reducing health care costs, \nreducing the debt, creating clean energy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe I am recognized now for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to speak on another topic, but I was \nfascinated by the presentation of the Senator from Tennessee. I think \nwe are all\n\n[[Page S10592]]\n\nconcerned about the direction of this calling out. I take it the \nSenator from Tennessee is suggesting this administration is \n``Nixifying'' the White House; is that correct?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is a word I had not thought of. What I am seeing \nis some of the same signs I saw as a young man in the early stages of \nthe Nixon administration. I am seeing those same signs in the Obama \nWhite House, and I am suggesting that going down that road leads to no \ngood end. ``Nixifying'' is an interesting way to describe it.\n  Mr. GREGG. I may have just made up that word. Hopefully, it will be \nadded to the lexicon.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I think it will. That is good.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee. He has \nmade some valuable points on that issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10592-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10592-S10594]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise today to continue a discussion I \nhave pursued on this floor a few times, and it deals with where our \ncountry is going and what we are passing on to our children.\n  I often quote the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator Conrad \nfrom North Dakota, because I have immense respect for him. He has \nsaid--and I agree with him and I think most Americans, when they think \nabout it, agree with him--that the debt is the threat, the fact that we \nas a nation are running up this incredible debt which we are going to \npass on to our children. To try to put it in context is very difficult \nbecause the numbers are so huge. I have talked about it numerous times \nhere--the fact that we are running deficits at approximately $1 \ntrillion over the next 10 years under the President's budget; that we \nare seeing 5 to 6 percent of GDP in deficits; that the public debt goes \nfrom about 38 percent of GDP up to well over 80 percent of GDP under \nthe most recent estimates. But these numbers are incomprehensible to \npeople because they are so big. We are talking trillions and trillions \nof dollars, and the implication of these numbers is staggering to our \nnext generation--to our children and our children's children--because \nit means they have to bear the burden of paying this debt that is going \nto be put on their backs.\n  Last week, the deficit for this last fiscal year was pegged at about \n$1.4 trillion--an incredible amount. That is three times the largest \ndebt in our history, in numeric terms. As a percentage of GDP, we \nhaven't had those types of numbers since World War II. Nobody is \narguing that deficit is not an event and something we don't like but \nthat we probably have to tolerate because of the fact that we have been \nthrough this very difficult situation with the recession and the \npotential meltdown of our financial houses. It took a lot of money to \ntry to stabilize the situation, and I am not holding that against this \nPresidency at all.\n  The problem is, as we go forward we are seeing these deficits expand. \nThere is no reason to maintain that type of deficit once we are past \nthis recessionary period, once the financial situation has been settled \ndown. For all intents and purposes, we are moving past that situation, \nso the deficits should start coming down. But they aren't coming down. \nThey aren't coming down. And today we are about to see one of the \nreasons they aren't coming down because today it is being proposed that \nwe add another $250 billion to the debt by doing something called the \ndoctors fix and not paying for it.\n  It is not an extraordinarily complicated issue. Basically, we don't \nreimburse doctors at a rate they should be reimbursed under Medicare \nbecause of a rule we passed back in the 1990s. It gets cut arbitrarily \nand in a way which has no relationship to what is a proper \nreimbursement rate. So every year since we passed that rule and it \nturned out it wasn't going to work right, we have corrected that. We \nhave reimbursed the doctors at a reasonable rate. But every year we \nhave done that, we have paid for that change, so that the cost of \nreimbursing doctors fairly did not get passed on to our children. I \nmean, if you pass that cost on to our children, when somebody goes to \nget an eye exam, someone who is in their eighties or seventies or \nsixties and who is on Medicare, when they get the bill from the doctor, \nessentially we are saying: Oh, I am sorry, the government is not going \nto pay that--the government you are a part of today. We are going to \ntake that bill and give it to a child who is not even born yet, and \nthey are going to have to pay that bill. But it is an expense today, \nand it should be paid today by the government.\n  We are having this proposed today on this floor, by this \nadministration: that we should spend $250 billion to correct this \ndoctors fix problem for the next 10 years, which is about what it will \ncost, but not pay for it, just simply take it and send the bill off to \nour kids. It is actually more than $250 billion because that $250 \nbillion, when you put it on the debt, will generate interest \nresponsibilities of about $50 billion. So it is actually a $300 billion \nitem. That is not small change; that is a third of a trillion dollars. \nThat is huge money. That is a tremendous burden to transfer over to our \nchildren.\n  Do you know why this is being done? It is being done for a very \ncynical reason. The health care reform package is being discussed \nsomewhere in this building behind closed doors. It is being written in \nsome office over on that side of the Capitol by three or four Members \nof the Senate and a lot of staff from the Democratic side, with no \nparticipation by Republican Members, no participation by the American \npeople, and the press is totally locked out of the room. The bill is \nbeing rewritten over there, but we do know that within the parameters \nof the bill is the representation that it won't cost more than $1 \ntrillion over a 10-year period. So all sorts of games are being played \nto try to keep it under $1 trillion.\n  The most significant and most cynical and most inappropriate game--\nthough it is not a game, really--the most inappropriate action is this \nidea that they are going to take $250 billion to fix the doctors \nreimbursement program, which is clearly part of health care, and move \nit entirely out of the health care system reform effort. They will move \nit over here somewhere and claim they don't have to pay for it. They \nwill just send the bill to the kids. Don't worry about it, it is only \n$250 billion. Just send the bill to the kids. Don't worry about it. And \nthen, voila, they will have $250 billion they can spend on health care \nreform that should have been used for the doctors fix.\n  But now, since they have claimed the doctors fix doesn't matter--it \nis somewhere over here, out of sight, out of mind, being taken care of \nby our children and grandchildren--voila, they can spend that $250 \nbillion on goodies, on initiatives within the new health care reform \nbill, which will cost the taxpayers $250 billion in order to do it. And \nI presume it will get them a few constituencies to support them because \nthey have just spent $250 billion on them.\n  So the true cynicism of this is that it doubles up the doctors fix \ncost. Not only does the doctors fix not get paid for, but it will then \ncreate $250 billion worth of new spending. So it is actually a doubling \nup of this whole exercise. It is a doubling down event here. You know, \nit is almost a Bernie Madoff--well, it is a Bernie Madoff approach to \nfunding. I mean, basically, this is an entire scam. Unfortunately, in \nthis instance--and obviously in the Bernie Madoff instance the people \nwho invested with him were wiped out, but they made a choice to invest \nwith him. Our children and grandchildren are going to get this bill \nwithout any rights. This $250 billion bill is going to be sent to them, \nand then the spending is going to occur, which they are also going to \nhave to pay for. It is going to be added on top of the health care \nbill. It is Bernie Madoff comes to Washington and does our budgeting \nfor us, and it is inexcusable that we would do this to the next \ngeneration.\n  Some are suggesting: Well, let's do a 1-year or a 2-year fix. This \nwas the original plan of Senator Baucus with regard to his bill. Let's \njust sort of ignore the fact that the doctor problem exists for the \nnext 10 years even though we are doing a 10-year health care reform \nbill here. What is the effect of that? Well, yes, for at least 1 or 2 \nyears you pay for it. That was the proposal in the original bill that \ncame out of the Finance Committee--1 year, I believe, they paid for it, \n9 years they didn't pay for it. What did that mean? One year paid for \nwas $11 billion, I think. So we\n\n[[Page S10593]]\n\nknow the cost of the whole thing for 10 years is $250 billion. So what \nthey got was $239 billion to spend under the Baucus bill as it came out \nof the Finance Committee because they just simply ignored the concept \nthat the doctors fix had to be done too. That also is a pretty cynical \nact--not as cynical as the idea you are going to pass the full $250 \nbillion fix and not pay for it, any of it, which is what we will be \nvoting on later today, but still pretty cynical in that they would \nbasically be spending $239 billion which they know we don't have.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to speak for an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. So they know we don't have the $239 billion, but at least \nthey admit it is there and they don't try to pass the whole bill off to \nour children.\n  So as we go forward in this health care debate, let's have no more \nsanctimonious claims that we are being fiscally responsible and \nproducing bills that are in balance and that don't add to the deficit, \nnot when we put a $250 billion IOU on our children's backs. It is \ntotally inappropriate.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I understand I am recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, in 10 minutes Senator LeMieux will make \nhis maiden speech to the Senate, and I know Members are anxious to hear \nthat speech, but in the meantime I would like to talk further about \nhealth care reform.\n  Earlier this month, the Senate Finance Committee voted to approve a \ndeeply flawed bill that would raise taxes, cut Medicare, increase \ngovernment spending, increase health care premiums, and actually drive \nthe cost of health care up, not down. We know the Finance Committee's \nbill will not be the final product voted on by the Senate.\n  Three or four Members of one party, and one party only, without the \npress there, without the public looking in, without other Members of \nthe Senate there, are meeting now behind closed doors to merge the \nFinance Committee bill with the HELP Committee's version. The secret \nnature of these meetings is all the more reason for the final version \nof the bill to be made available to the public prior to a final vote.\n  We have all heard the outcry from our constituents asking us to read \nthe bills before we vote on them. I think we should go one step further \nthan reading this health care bill ourselves: we should allow the \npublic to read the bill themselves.\n  Just recently, eight of my friends on the other side of the aisle \nsent a letter to the majority leader demanding--rightly--that this \nhealth care legislation be made available for 72 hours before the \nSenate proceeds with this bill. The letter from these eight \nconscientious Democrats says, among other things:\n\n       Without a doubt, reforming health care in America is one of \n     the most monumental and far-reaching undertakings considered \n     by this body in decades.\n\n  The letter goes on to ask four things of the majority leader: that \nthe legislative text and complete budget scores from CBO on health care \nlegislation to be considered on the Senate floor be made available 72 \nhours in advance; secondly, the letter asks that the legislative text \nand complete CBO score on health care legislation as amended be made \navailable; and they make the same request as far as amendments to be \nfiled and offered on the floor and the final conference report which \nmight come from the House and Senate.\n  I congratulate these Members of the other party for making this \nrequest. I think the question on the minds of people around Washington, \nDC, and around the country watching this issue is, Will this request be \nignored? Will these eight Members of the Democratic caucus be \nsteamrolled by their leadership? Will this conscientious request be \ncast aside by the majority leader?\n  The people deserve to see the final product of the majority party. \nAnd we know the American people want to see it because as more \nAmericans learn about the product, the less they like it. A survey \nreleased Monday found that a majority of Americans opposed the plans \nbacked by the President and Democrats in Congress. This skepticism \npersists despite the best public relations ever of my Democratic \ncolleagues and our President.\n  The bill approved by the Finance Committee essentially is still a \npartisan one. Numerous studies and estimates have highlighted how the \nbill's new mandates would actually raise insurance premiums for \nAmericans, not lower them. A recent Pricewaterhouse-\nCoopers analysis of the bill found that by 2019, the average cost of a \nfamily's insurance policy would increase by $4,000, more than it would \nif Congress simply does nothing at all. Of course, no one is suggesting \nCongress do nothing at all. The status quo is clearly inadequate, and \nthere are many things we can do on a step-by-step basis to improve the \nhealth of Americans.\n\n  But back to this $4,000 in extra costs for insurance, the driving \nfactor behind that is the staggering tax hikes necessary to pay for \nthis $1 trillion new entitlement program. The Finance Committee's \nproposal raises taxes by hundreds of billions of dollars--on insurance \nplans, on medical device producers, on pharmaceuticals. We all know \ntaxes will not lower the cost of these services. In fact, we can expect \nthe opposite--these taxes will be paid by average Americans.\n  Former CBO Director Douglas Holtz-Eakin recently said: ``These costs \nwill be passed on to consumers by either directly raising insurance \npremiums or by fueling higher health care costs that inevitably lead to \nhigher premiums.''\n  He went on to say the plan ``would not only fail to reduce the cost \nburden on middle-class families, it would make that burden \nsignificantly worse.''\n  In addition to failing to reduce the price of health care, the \nFinance plan carries a number of other serious flaws, particularly as \nit relates to Medicare and health care options for our seniors. The \nbill cuts Medicare by $500 billion. Let me repeat that. The bill cuts \n$500 billion from Medicare, despite the fact that the Medicare program \nis already insolvent and on the path to bankruptcy in the year 2017, \nunless we take action.\n  Billions of Medicare dollars would be cut from hospitals, from \nnursing homes, from hospice care under this Finance Committee proposal. \nIt would also slash $120 billion from Medicare Advantage, denying 11 \nmillion seniors the health care choices and options regular Medicare \ndoes not offer.\n  If these provisions were not bad enough, the bill's negative impact \non State budgets is even more disturbing. Medicaid would be expanded to \na level that threatens funding of essential State services such as \neducation, such as law enforcement. In my State of Mississippi, \nMedicaid payments already make up 12 percent of our State's overall \nbudget, and Governor Barbour has joined a growing chorus of Governors, \nboth Republican and Democratic, in warning of the consequences of \nCongress forcing States to shoulder more of the Medicaid burden. In \nfact, if the finance bill is enacted, Medicaid's expansion would result \nin fully 25 percent of Americans being on this government-run health \ncare system. We know it is now run so poorly that many physicians will \nnot accept Medicaid patients. The bill proposes we put one-quarter of \nAmericans on this very poorly run program.\n  After weeks of talk, we get a bill that is worse than the status quo. \nI fear this bill is only going to get worse when the majority leader \nemerges from his secret negotiations and tries to pass his version of a \nFederal health care takeover. I think we can do better. Raising taxes, \nincreasing costs, and eliminating choice is hardly the type of health \ncare reform the American people want, particularly during a time when \nunemployment levels are at a 25-year high. There are many commonsense \nreforms that could pass Congress quickly and with bipartisan support. \nThis is not a choice between a Federal takeover and the status quo. A \nstep-by-step approach can inject competition, increase choices, and use \nmarket principles to bring down prices. By allowing people to purchase \nhealth insurance across State lines, by implementing medical \nmalpractice reform and allowing small businesses to join in association \nhealth plans, we can lower the cost of health care and increase choice \nwithout raising taxes or\n\n[[Page S10594]]\n\nincreasing government spending or increasing the size and scope of \ngovernment.\n  That is the kind of health care reform the American people deserve, \nand it is the direction the health care debate should take.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senator from \nFlorida is recognized for 20 minutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10594-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10594-S10596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   NATIONAL DEBT AND FEDERAL DEFICIT\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, it is an honor for me to stand on the \nfloor of the Senate, on behalf of my State of Florida and before this \nNation, to give my maiden speech. First, let me thank my wife Meike for \nher support. No one succeeds in life alone. That is certainly true for \nme. She is the strength of our growing family of five, soon to be six. \nI would not be here without her love and support.\n  It is humbling to think of those who have come before me and spoken \nbefore this body on the great issues of the day. I will not seek to \nmatch their skill in poetry or prose, but I will work to honor them \nwith clear and straightforward language, passion to find solutions to \nthe challenges that face us, and resolve to follow words with deeds. It \nis the tradition of this Chamber, as Senator Ted Kennedy stated in his \nmaiden speech nearly 50 years ago, that ``a freshman Senator should be \nseen, not heard; should learn, not teach.'' But similar to Senator \nKennedy, who asked for the dispensation of his colleagues to speak to \nthe great cause of civil rights being debated at the time, I, too, seek \nthe consideration of my colleagues to rise and speak at such a critical \ntime in our Nation's history.\n  During my first week here, the senior Senator from Ohio, Mr. \nVoinovich, told me that while my time in the Senate may be short, just \n16 months, it might be the most important 16 months in modern history. \nMy brief experience here has confirmed the wisdom of his insight.\n  The issue that commands the attention of this Congress is the health \nof our people and proposals that address the problem of those who \ncannot afford or simply do not have health insurance. We seek solutions \nto the rising costs of medical procedures and hospital stays. We are in \nsearch of ways to ensure that every American has access to affordable \nand quality health care. These are noble goals. Floridians and \nAmericans are struggling with the high cost of health care. Premiums \nfor family health care have risen 131 percent over the past 10 years. \nWorking families are finding it harder and harder to make ends meet. \nBetween the demands of taxes and insurance, families have less and less \nto save and spend on their own priorities.\n  Health care costs are burdensome on seniors as well, who, while \ncovered by Medicare, often buy additional insurance to supplement their \nneeds. Rising costs for seniors living on fixed incomes prove more than \ndifficult. Still more troubling are those who have no insurance at \nall--some 4 million Floridians and an estimated 45 million Americans \nnationwide. For many of the uninsured, a serious illness or an accident \nis all that may separate them from bankruptcy.\n  I believe the problem of health care must be addressed. No American \nshould be denied access to quality health care. No American should be \nrendered destitute by illness. No American family should have to live \npaycheck-to-paycheck because they cannot find affordable health care. \nThe problem is great, and it is one worthy of our full attention.\n  But before we can address health care and the cost of reform, we need \nto consider the broader state of affairs in which we as Americans find \nourselves. We need to draw back the curtain, widen the lens. No issue, \neven one as important as health care, stands alone. We have \nresponsibilities in other equally important areas such as national \ndefense, education, and the economy.\n  Balanced equally with all these priorities must be our ability to \nafford them. Our Nation's spending problem is not a topic that many \nlike to discuss. It is, after all, more desirable to speak of new ideas \nand grand plans for the future, but that very future is at stake if we \ndo not address the problem now.\n  Our national debt grows at an alarming rate of nearly $4 billion a \nday. When I took office, just 5 weeks ago, our national debt was $11.7 \ntrillion. Today it is nearly $12 trillion. During the time it will take \nfor me to give this address, it will increase by another $50 million.\n  Since the debate on health care began in March to the time it likely \nconcludes at the end of this year, we will have amassed an additional \n$1 trillion, near to the very amount we are discussing for this health \ncare proposal. Instead of spending less to stem the tide, we learned \nlast Friday that in the fiscal year we just completed, Congress amassed \na record-setting $1.4 trillion budget deficit--a larger single-year \ndeficit than the deficits of the last 4 years combined.\n\n  Our Government spending is out of control and it is simply \nunsustainable. Why does it matter? What is the consequence of \naccumulating trillions of dollars in debt? What does it mean for us, \nfor our children, and for our grandchildren? The consequences are a \ngovernment hamstrung by its obligations and a people taxed beyond their \nability to prosper. Last year, our Nation spent $253 billion alone on \nthe interest payments for our debts. That is a statement worth \nrepeating. Last year, our country spent $253 billion alone on interest \npayments, the third highest expenditure in the Federal budget. That is \nnearly $700 million in taxpayer dollars spent on interest, every day--\nmoney that could be spent on worthwhile programs or, better still, \nreturned to the people because, after all, it is their money.\n  In 10 years, the White House projects our national debt will be a \nstaggering $23 trillion, surpassing the total value of goods and \nservices made in the United States in 1 year. I have not been in \nWashington for long so it is hard for me to comprehend the idea of $1 \nbillion, let alone $1 trillion. I think that is true for most \nAmericans. So it is worth a moment to understand the enormity of these \nfigures.\n  If you were to lay down single dollar bills, edge to edge, $1 million \nwould cover two football fields; $1 billion would cover the city of Key \nWest, FL, 3.7 square miles; and $1 trillion, laid edge to edge, would \ncover the State of Rhode Island--twice.\n  Still more staggering, from the time our Government began in 1789, it \ntook 167 years for the Federal Government to spend its first $1 \ntrillion. This year we will spend $3 trillion. Increasing debt and \nincreasing costs of entitlement spending and increasing interest \npayments mean we are on a path which is unsustainable. The American \npeople know this and they are showing their frustration with Congress's \nout-of-control spending. We need to learn from families in America. \nFamilies in America and across Florida deal with their budgets every \nday. They sit around the kitchen table. They look at what they make and \nwhat they spend and they try to make ends meet.\n  But the Federal Government is similar to that family with the credit \ncard debt--every month the debt grows, the interest compounds. The \nfamily spends more and more just to make the minimum payment. Yet the \nbalance due continues to grow. In order to get out of debt, the family \nhas to do the right thing, it has to cut spending or mom or dad have to \nget another job. If the family does the right thing, pays off its debt, \nit can save a little, build a nest egg, and recover. If they do not, \nthey reach that point where the debt grows out of control. They reach \nthe point where they are too far gone.\n  The Federal Government has reached that moment in time. In the past \n27 years, we have gone from $1 trillion to $12 trillion in December, \nand it is estimated that by the end of 10 years, we will be $24 \ntrillion in debt. The point of no return is upon us. We must recognize \nthis simple truth: We cannot afford the Government we have, let alone \nthe Government the majority in this Chamber wants. We ought to be \ncutting taxes, not raising them; we ought to be spending within our \nmeans, not increasing our debt; we ought to be fighting with the same \nvigor to cut waste, fraud, and abuse that some fight to create new \nentitlement programs we cannot afford.\n  It has also become clear that our policies of limitless spending \nthreaten to devalue the dollar.\n\n[[Page S10595]]\n\n  Recent reports suggest a rush by U.S. investors to pull their money \nfrom domestic investments and instead seek opportunity in emerging \nmarkets. Investors find markets such as China and Brazil to be more \nattractive because those nations use their financial reserves to \nweather the economic crisis.\n  There is also talk in the international community that perhaps the \ndollar is no longer the best benchmark for their reserve currencies. \nAccording to the International Monetary Fund, the dollar is held now at \nits lowest point on record in reserve currency of the central banks \naround the world.\n  Our unsustainable spending and debt and our inability to make the \ndifficult decisions necessary to change course is decreasing confidence \nin our Nation abroad, and if not corrected, it will impact the quality \nof life for all Americans.\n  What is the answer? The answer is we have to stop. We have to stop \nfinancing today's programs on the backs of future generations. Common \nsense tells us we need to balance the Federal budget. The Federal \nGovernment has not done that since 2001. There is no reason why it \ncannot happen again. The Framers' ideal of limited government is one we \nneed to pursue and we need to do it if we have the will to make it so.\n  As the father of three young sons and a baby on the way, one of my \ngreatest concerns is that 1 day one of my children will come to me when \nthey are grown and say that they are moving to another country, perhaps \na place such as Ireland or Chile, because they believe the \nopportunities are greater than the promise and the opportunities of \nAmerica.\n  Even now, as many as 200,000 skilled American workers could leave for \nplaces such as China and India in the next 5 years. America has always \nbeen the land of opportunity, a beacon for those who seek a better \nlife. That life cannot be darkened.\n  Let us not stand witness to the decline of our great Nation. Let us \nnot sit idly by so that the work and sacrifice of those who came before \nus can be squandered. Let us not miss out on this moment in time to \nshoulder the burden of leadership to do what we must do for our \nchildren, their children, and the American dream.\n  Their future is bound to the decisions we make. I come from a State \nwhere a balanced budget is a constitutional requirement, where \nlawmakers are required to spend within their means. And it is not \nalways easy. In fact, it is often a painstaking process that requires \nleadership and tough choices, with Republicans and Democrats sitting \ndown together to make responsible decisions.\n  In the past 3 years in Florida, Governor Crist and the Florida \nlegislatures have cut spending by more than $7 billion, almost 10 \npercent of the State budget. Florida has made tough choices because it \nmust, because lawmakers in 1838 adopted language requiring our State to \nhave a balanced budget.\n  It works for Florida and 41 other States, and it can work for our \nNation. The Federal Government should be held to the same standard. \nThis Congress must balance its budget. There is no reason why Congress \ncannot do what American families and the majority of States do. There \nis also no reason why the President of the United States should not \nhave the same powers as 43 Governors do to strike wasteful spending \nwith a line item veto. These issues are not partisan. Republicans and \nDemocrats alike should chart a course to a balanced budget to reduce \nthe national debt and restore the American dream.\n  We were promised a budget deficit-neutral health care plan. President \nObama said to a joint session of Congress, he ``will not sign a plan \nthat adds one dime to our deficit now or in the future.''\n  I am encouraged by the President's words, but I am concerned by the \nproposals we have seen. Cutting a half trillion dollars from Medicare \nis not budget neutral. Shifting costs to the States for increases in \nMedicaid is not responsible. And taxing medicine and lifesaving devices \nwill increase, not decrease, the cost of health care. That is not \nreform.\n  The fact is, we do not know where the money is coming from to pay for \nthe proposed health care plan, and in light of our desperate financial \nsituation, we cannot budget on faith alone. Last week I participated in \na hearing to discuss runaway premiums in a program designed to let \nFederal employees buy long-term health care. Employees were given two \noptions: a fixed option that had a higher cost but guaranteed that \npremiums would not go up, and a variable option which was less \nexpensive but it provided no guarantee.\n  Smart Federal employees paid a little more to get that guaranteed \nFederal plan. But it is not going to be that way. Because now the \nFederal Government has come back and said: We were wrong. We cannot \ninsure the premiums at the guaranteed rate. We are going to raise your \nrates by 25 percent.\n  The government made a mistake. The government got it wrong. And now \nthese Federal employees who did the right thing are going to have to \npay for it, more than 6,000 of them from Florida. If the Federal \nGovernment cannot get it right for 250,000 Federal employees, how is \nthe government going to get it right for 45 million Americans?\n  I stand with my colleagues on this side of the aisle ready to create \naccess to health care without sacrificing quality. But it has to make \nfinancial sense. We stand ready to address the issue of portability, \nallowing people to keep their health insurance whether they change jobs \nor move across State lines. We stand ready to offer ideas to make \nhealth insurance more affordable for small businesses, which can join \nexchanges to offer lower premiums for their employees. We stand ready \nto address the high incidence of doctors practicing defensive medicine, \nwhich steadily drives up costs. Finally, we stand ready to focus on \nstopping the estimated $60 billion in Medicare waste, fraud, and abuse, \nand using those funds to care for our people.\n  Current proposals do little to address these problems. We want to \nwork in a bipartisan fashion to create a bipartisan bill. Spend less, \nsave more on this and in everything. The reality is that our Nation is \nhungry for a new course, a course that takes greater care of the \npeople's money. Some may call this thinking naive, but I call it \nhopeful.\n  Since our Nation was founded, there has been one constant our people \nhave carried forth. I consider it the American creed, and the creed is \nthis: Each generation has the obligation to provide a better future for \nits children than the generation before. We cannot fulfill this promise \non our current course. That truth is so evident even our children \nunderstand it.\n  I close with the words of one of my constituents, 12-year-old Joshua \nMailho of Niceville, FL. Joshua is concerned about the very issues we \nare talking about today. He is concerned with his share of the national \ndebt and how he is going to pay for it.\n  He wrote to me in September and this is what he wrote:\n\n       Here is an example of how long me, a 12 year old, would \n     have to pay off my share of the national debt. If I worked at \n     Home Depot and I get paid $10 per hour . . . it would take me \n     almost 8 years of full-time work [to reach $161,000] . . . my \n     share of the national debt.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       This debt will affect all of the kids in America . . . so \n     please find a way to fix your own mistakes, before the \n     children of today have to pay for your mistakes tomorrow.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, let me be the first to congratulate the \njunior Senator from Florida on his thoughtful and very persuasive \ninitial speech here in the Senate.\n  I think I can safely say, after observing his work for the last 5 \nweeks, that the people of Florida are very fortunate to have such an \nintelligent and insightful Senator. He is doing an excellent job on \ntheir behalf. I again congratulate him on his initial speech here in \nthe Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to join with our \ncolleagues on the floor in thanking my new colleague from Florida, with \nwhom I have had the pleasure of starting a very fast and meaningful \nfriendship.\n  As he knows, his predecessor Mel Martinez and I had a friendship that \nhad spanned more than three decades. I am equally enthusiastic about \nthis opportunity to represent the State of Florida with Senator \nLeMieux.\n  Let me say that as I was listening to the Senator's maiden speech, of \ncourse\n\n[[Page S10596]]\n\nI reflected back 9 years ago to my maiden speech. And, interestingly, \nat that time--I think it was about 6 weeks after I had been here, so it \nwas the middle of February 2001--I spoke on the budget and the fact \nthat we had a surplus, and how we wanted to keep that surplus and not \ngo into deficit, a lot of the same themes the new Senator from Florida \nhas sounded here today.\n  Of course, your maiden speech in this August body is quite memorable. \nI did not have the luxury, as the new Senator from Florida has, to have \na number of his colleagues sitting here. As a matter of fact, it was an \nempty Chamber for this Senator save for the Presiding Officer. But in \nthe course of this speech, I mentioned that it was my maiden speech. I \nam proceeding on. All of a sudden the doors, these side doors, swing \nopen, and in strides the senior Senator from West Virginia, the person \nwho is a walking political history book. He assumes his position in \nthis chair right here. I get through with my remarks, and he says: \n``Will the Senator from Florida yield?''\n  I said: ``Of course I yield to the senior Senator from West \nVirginia.''\n  He proceeds to give, off the top of his head, a history of the Senate \nmaiden speeches. And, of course, what a memorable event that was for \nthis Senator in his maiden speech, and it will be equally a memorable \nevent for the new Senator from Florida. I join our colleagues in \ncongratulating him on his maiden speech.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10596-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10596]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida.

Mr. President, as you well know, being one of the \nfreshmen Senators, along with me and a number of others of us, we have \nbeen coming to the floor for the past several weeks to talk about the \nneed to address health care reform.\n  We are here again this morning for the next hour to talk about why \nthis is so imperative. I am going to yield my time, about 5 minutes \ninitially to Senator Warner, who has another engagement and needs to be \noff. So at this point I yield 5 minutes to Senator Warner.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from New \nHampshire, for leading the freshmen Senators here this morning as we \nonce again take the floor to talk about health care reform.\n  I also commend my friend, the junior Senator from Florida, for his \ncomments today. I share his views about the necessity of bringing our \nFederal deficit in line.\n  In the Commonwealth of Virginia, we have a balanced budget \nrequirement and we meet our budget every year. I am proud of the fact \nthat Virginia has been named the best managed State in America. So I do \nhave to take issue with some of the comments made by my colleagues, who \nI think understand States' needs. The fastest growing costs in my \nState, as well as the State of Colorado, New Hampshire, and I would \nassume the State of Florida, are health care costs.\n  Medicaid is going to bankrupt virtually every State in the Nation by \n2025 if we do not act. I hope for, and welcome, my colleagues' efforts \nto try to reach a bipartisan consensus on health care reform.\n  I will again make the point I have made repeatedly over the last few \nweeks: What happens if we don't act? What happens if we simply kick the \ncan down the road another 10 years? That is the appeal I make to my \ncolleagues on the other side. Join us. Particularly join the freshmen \nSenators, who don't come to the Senate with the same background of the \nlast 20 years and experience of past battles. Join a group who does, \nhowever, come to this body wanting to do the people's business. That \nmeans driving down health care costs, expanding coverage, and making \nsure our health care system is financially sustainable.\n  If we don't act, not only will States' increasing Medicaid costs go \nunmet, State budgets will not be balanced. If we don't act, the Federal \ndeficit will explode. The largest driver of the deficit is not the TARP \nspending or stimulus spending; it is health care spending. If we don't \nact, the current Medicare Program, which seniors depend on, will go \nbankrupt by 2017. That is not a political statement; that is a fact.\n  If we don't act, American companies will not be competitive in the \nglobal economy. We have the most productive workforce in the world. But \nno American company can compete when they have built in health care \ncosts of $3,000 to $4,000 more per worker than any other competitor in \nthe world. If we don't act, for the 65 percent of us who get our health \ncare coverage through the private insurance market, an average Virginia \nfamily will be paying 40 percent of their disposable income on health \ninsurance premiums within the next decade.\n  I ask my colleague from Florida and others on the other side of the \naisle to join us in this bipartisan effort to reform health care. This \nmorning we will lay out how we think health care reform can both expand \ncoverage and drive down costs. We will look at some of the models \ncurrently being used by large employers who have had the flexibility to \ndesign their own benefit plans. These models have successfully driven \ndown costs by putting in place prevention and wellness activities, \nnegotiating better prices with providers, and restructuring a financial \nincentive system which currently rewards hospitals based on higher \nreadmission rates, rather than quality care.\n  I thank the Senator from New Hampshire for organizing the freshmen \none more time. As a former Governor, I know she has been a leader on \nissues like Medicaid and health care costs. I call on my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle to actually join in this effort to make \nsure we do achieve bipartisan health care reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank the Senator from Virginia for his comments. As \nhe said, our health care system is on an unsustainable path. Now is the \ntime to fix it.\n  Health care has not been working for families, for workers, for \nbusinesses, and for the Nation's economy. Today we are actually going \nto talk about some of the good news we know we can accomplish with \nhealth care reform. We are going to talk about what health care reform \ncan do to help those families, workers, and the economy. It is our \nopportunity to control costs for Americans and to improve quality.\n  Let me be clear: We can control cost and improve quality at the same \ntime. When we do this, we have to remember to keep patients at the \ncenter of the debate. The truth is, in so many cases the health care \nindustry can do more for less. Usually I like to tell a story about \nwhat is going on with my constituents. It helps us keep people at the \ncenter of the debate.\n  Today I want to talk about some of the innovative health quality \ninitiatives happening in New Hampshire. We all know hospital \nreadmissions are a costly problem in the country. We have an exciting \nprogram going on in Manchester, the State's largest city, at the Elliot \nSenior Health Center. They recognized what was happening with \nreadmissions. They recognized that hospital discharges can be confusing \nand sometimes overwhelming for seniors and that providing a little \nextra attention to help those seniors as they are transitioning out of \nthe hospital can help keep them from being readmitted. They developed a \nprogram they call the TRACE Program. TRACE provides seniors with a \nhealth coach who helps patients with the tools and support to take a \nmore active role in managing their medical care. The support those \npatients receive improves their understanding not only of their own \nhealth care, of the health care system in general, it helps keep them \nout of the hospital.\n  Senator Collins and I have introduced a bill that would help do this \nsystemwide called the Medicare Transitional Care Act. It builds on \nsuccessful programs such as the one at the Elliot Senior Health Center. \nOur legislation would improve the quality of care, reduce hospital \nreadmissions, and\n\n[[Page S10597]]\n\nlower costs. Research shows we can save $5,000 per Medicare beneficiary \nif we enact this kind of a program systemwide to deal with hospital \nreadmissions. I am happy the key provisions of this idea are included \nin the Finance Committee bill. It will give us an idea of how this is \ngoing to work systemwide. It is one example of what we can do to \nimprove the quality of care while we control cost.\n  There is another initiative we have been working on. I know all of us \nhave been forced to wait in a crowded emergency room sometimes. \nEmergency room overcrowding is a problem that has become all too \ncommon. It is a symptom of what is going on in our health care system. \nFrequent users of health care services are a small but very costly \nportion of our population. They contribute to overcrowding in emergency \nrooms, and they raise costs for everyone. These individuals often have \nmultiple chronic conditions. Sometimes they have mental illness. \nSometimes they are faced with issues such as poverty and homelessness. \nThey are among our most vulnerable but most frequent users of emergency \nrooms because they have nowhere else to go.\n  In one study, one individual used the emergency room 115 times in 1 \nyear. This was in Camden, NJ. Another patient accumulated $3.5 million \nin hospital charges over 5 years. These are charges for which the \nAmerican taxpayer paid the bill. Our health care system is not \nadequately dealing with frequent users of emergency rooms. The good \nnews is, we can change this. Through increased outreach and \ncoordination, we can reduce utilization. We can save costs. Research \nshows that after 2 years of participation in a program that provides \nthis kind of coordinated care for people who use emergency rooms, usage \nof emergency rooms was cut by over half. This translates into \nsignificant savings for the taxpayer. It is the kind of reform we must \ncontinue to look at if we are going to change the health care system \nand make it work for taxpayers, for businesses, and for families.\n  These are only a few examples of how health reform can benefit \nAmericans. We can improve the quality of care available to people, and \nwe can control health care costs at the same time. I believe we can do \nthis. Now is the time to pass meaningful health reform for the citizens \nof New Hampshire and for all Americans so we can achieve these changes \nin our system.\n  I now yield the floor to Senator Merkley for 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, it is a pleasure to talk about health \ncare following upon the remarks of Senator Jeanne Shaheen and Senator \nMark Warner, both of whom, as Governors, had the opportunity to know \nfirsthand how important health care reform is to taking our Nation \nforward. They come from very diverse States, but the observation is the \nsame. Health care reform is essential to putting our Nation back on \ntrack, and now is the time.\n  I wish to direct my comments specifically to the benefits of health \ncare reform to small business. We all know the current system doesn't \nwork for small business employers or their employees. Without numbers \nbehind them, they have no ability to negotiate rates with insurance \ncompanies. They are like lambs led to the slaughter. More often than \nnot, they have to take whatever deal is offered. Those deals are not \nvery good. On average, small businesses pay 18 percent more than large \nfirms for the same health insurance policies. Because of this, they are \nfar less likely to provide health insurance. Just 49 percent of firms \nwith 3 to 9 workers and only 78 percent of firms with 10 to 24 workers \noffer health insurance to their employees, as compared to 99 percent of \nfirms with 200 or more employees in the same year.\n  When small firms do offer health care, rising premiums force owners \nto make hard choices between keeping health coverage, expanding their \noperations, or increasing wages. In the last decade, health care \npremiums for the average Oregon family more than doubled, while median \nearnings rose only 23.8 percent. It is no coincidence. Employers are \nspending more in compensation, but that compensation is going to higher \ninsurance premiums rather than higher wages.\n  Last month I talked to small business owners in Medford and Portland, \nOR, who share strikingly similar stories about the problems rising \nhealth care costs are causing for them. Dave Wilkerson runs a Medford \narchitectural firm that has 12 full-time employees. He is dedicated to \nproviding a family-friendly work environment, and he provides full \nmedical, dental, and vision coverage to his employees. The company has \nhad to deal with large annual increases in health care premiums and has \nhad to change carriers several times in order to try to keep costs \ndown. Health care costs are the second highest expense for David's \nfirm. Only payroll exceeds them.\n  This year rising health care costs forced David and his partners to \nlook very closely at either eliminating health care benefits or laying \noff employees.\n  Jim Houser and his wife Liz Dally tell a similar story. They operate \nthe Harthorne Auto Clinic in Portland. When they opened their doors 26 \nyears ago, they made a commitment to offer those who worked for them a \ngood benefits package, including comprehensive health care. Jim and Liz \nare still able to provide health insurance to their employees, but \npremiums have gone from 9 percent of their payroll to 18 percent in 5 \nyears. As a result, they have had to cut back on benefits. These and \notherwise successful small businesses have been hamstrung by health \ncare costs.\n  Will reform help these small businesses? Yes, it will. It will help \nthem a lot.\n  First, it will allow them to enter health care exchanges, where they \nwill be part of a much larger pool. With their increased market clout, \nthey will be able to negotiate lower premium costs. These rates will be \nmuch more stable than in past years. One sick employee will no longer \nmake an entire group uninsurable.\n  Second, the exchanges will offer more and better policies from which \nto choose. Currently, many small businesses struggle to find any \ninsurers that will offer policies. But through health care reform, and \nas part of the exchange, they will be able to choose from a number of \ndifferent plans. Because these plans will have to meet certain \nstandards, small businesses will have higher quality policies from \nwhich to choose.\n  Finally, better choices at a lower price will mean small businesses \ncan dedicate more revenue to increasing wages--more money in the \npockets of their employees--have more opportunity to invest in new \nequipment or hire additional employees. This is good for these owners, \nit is good for our economy, and it is good for the employees.\n  Health care costs have become a millstone around the neck of our \nsmall businesses, dragging down our economy. Health care reform will \nhelp small businesses thrive by lowering cost, improving service, and \nenabling small business owners to focus on making their businesses more \nsuccessful.\n  I yield back the floor to my colleague from New Hampshire, and I \nthank her for conducting and managing this set of conversations from \nthe freshman Senators today.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank very much Senator Merkley for \npointing out what a difference health care reform can make for small \nbusinesses.\n  I will now yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Alaska, Mr. Begich.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  I say to Senator Merkley, I am going to follow up on your points as \nto small businesses, and they are very good points. In Alaska, 52 \npercent of our population is self-employed, in some form or another, or \nthey are self-employed and employ many individuals.\n  Again, I am pleased to be back here with our freshman colleagues to \ntalk about why America needs health insurance reform and why we need it \nnow.\n  Last week, we busted myths being pushed by the opponents of reform. \nToday, we join forces to describe the undeniably positive aspects of \nreform--how it will help our friends, our neighbors, and our loved \nones.\n  I rise to address the unquestionable link between health insurance \nreform and economic recovery in America. All of us on this floor have \nheard from\n\n[[Page S10598]]\n\nthose who say we should not do health reform now, that with the economy \nstill hurting, we should wait. Some of that commentary comes from loud \nand angry naysayers looking for any excuse to kill reform.\n  But that concern has also been raised by average Alaskans at our \ntownhall meetings. It is a legitimate question, and here is how I \nanswer my constituents: If we want to do this right, economic recovery \nand health reform have to go hand in hand. You cannot have one without \nthe other.\n  There are already signs in this country of our economic turnaround in \nprogress. That is welcome news for American breadwinners going back to \nwork, for businesses racking up new sales, and for manufacturers \nramping up production to fill new orders.\n  But there is more work to do, more progress to make. That is where \nhealth insurance reform comes in because the status quo is directly at \nodds with the possibility of continued economic growth. Here are a few \nexamples. Businesses, big and small, have been saddled with \nskyrocketing health care costs for their workers. You have heard many \nexamples this morning. The average health insurance premium in Alaska \nhas risen 102 percent in the past decade--more than doubled.\n  No matter which State you are from, those premium increases take a \ntoll on business. Money that could go to innovation, investment, pay \nraises or added staff is going instead to insurance. Today, employer-\nprovided family premiums in Alaska average more than $14,000, about the \nannual pay of one new minimum wage job.\n  Household budgets are also strained. In this decade, health insurance \ncosts for Alaska families have risen five times faster than wages. That \nis a loss of purchasing power that could be going instead into our \nlocal economy or to education to improve individual earning power.\n  Of course, my Alaska examples are happening in States all over this \ncountry. The statistics are troubling. Today, one-sixth of the entire \nAmerican economy is devoted to health care costs. Think about it. That \nis more than $2 trillion each year that does not go to job creation or \nbusiness innovation or investments in infrastructure.\n  If we do nothing to reverse this trend--if supporters of the high \ncost of insurance manage to kill this reform--this problem will get \nmuch worse. By the time my 7-year-old son is raising his family, one-\nthird of the entire U.S. economy could be consumed by health care.\n  Yesterday, on the floor of the Senate, one of our colleagues in \nopposition to health care reform put up a prop--which we will see over \nand over again--a large bill that was put on the desk. It is about \n1,500 pages of the Finance bill, and over time that will change. But \nwhen you think about it, one-sixth of the economy will be decided by \nthat bill--1,500 pages. To me, that is a small amount of work, in the \nsense of the legislation, to deal with one-sixth of our economy. But, \nagain, we will see that prop over and over again. But I hope the \nAmerican people will see through that and see how important dealing \nwith one-sixth of the economy is and how having a bill of that length \nis important.\n  How can we expect American businesses to shoulder such costs and be \ntruly competitive in a global economy? Here is one example. Right now, \nGeneral Motors reports that health care spending adds $1,500 to the \ncost of every car it produces. Of course, its chief overseas \ncompetitors do not have to worry about health care costs because their \ncountries dealt with this years ago.\n  We can and must do better. Economic peace of mind is fundamental to \nour democracy. It is the goal of every family in this country. It is a \ncornerstone of the American dream.\n  Let me say again, if we are serious about economic recovery in this \ncountry, then we must be serious about health insurance reform. It is a \npackage deal.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield back the floor to the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I say to Senator Begich, thank you very \nmuch and thank you for pointing out how important health care reform is \nto our economy.\n  I now yield time to Senator Kaufman from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Shaheen for her \nleadership in putting this together and thank her for her leadership on \nhealth care and so many other issues.\n  I appreciate the opportunity, once again, to join my colleagues in \ncalling for the passage of meaningful health care reform.\n  This morning, we are answering the question: What can health care \nreform do for you?\n  I wish to take a couple minutes to talk about how health care reform \ncan help Americans stay active and healthy by enhancing prevention and \nwellness services for all Americans.\n  As I have said many times on the floor, the present health care \nsystem is out of control. It has become a gigantic resource-eating \nmachine which, over time, sucks in more money and delivers fewer \noptions and poorer care.\n  As odd as it sounds--and it does sound odd--health is not always the \ntop priority in the present health care system. The current system, all \ntoo often, waits to treat illness and respond to health problems until \nthey become particularly acute and costly to treat.\n  Promotion of health, both physical and mental health, is not given a \ntop priority in the present health care system because, frankly, it is \nnot rewarded. Because of this lack of emphasis, our present health care \nsystem is weighed down by Americans who battle one or more chronic \ndiseases every day.\n\n  Despite all we spend on health care--and in 2009 this figure will \napproach $2.5 trillion--almost one in two Americans suffers from \ncommon, costly, and often preventable chronic diseases.\n  The Partnership to Fight Chronic Disease estimates that almost 80 \npercent of American workers have at least one chronic disease, and 55 \npercent have more than one chronic condition. In fact, treatment of \nchronic disease accounts for approximately 75 percent of every dollar \nspent on health care today.\n  The spending rate is even higher in the Medicaid and Medicare \npopulations, with 83 percent of spending in Medicaid and 98 percent in \nMedicare going for the treatment of chronic disease.\n  The rapid growth of chronic disease increases insurance costs for \nAmericans, undercuts U.S. competitiveness, and threatens Medicare and \nMedicaid viability. Our present health care reform effort gives us the \nopportunity to finally reverse this trend.\n  By empowering and motivating Americans to be physically active and \ngiving them a financial stake in maintaining their day-to-day health \nstatus, health care reform can put the focus back on healthy living.\n  An example we can build on is the recent success Safeway Corporation \nhas had in reducing health care premiums for many of their employees by \nproviding them incentives to change their behavior.\n  The CEO of Safeway, Steven Burd, created a program that rewards \nemployees with lower premiums if they reduce their tobacco use, lower \ntheir blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and achieve a healthy \nweight. The completely voluntary program tests for these four measures, \nand employees receive premium discounts for each test they pass.\n  Aided by this program, obesity and smoking rates at Safeway are \nroughly 70 percent of the national average, and their health care costs \nfor the last 4 years have remained constant. Let me repeat that: Their \nhealth care costs for the last 4 years have remained constant.\n  Right now, discounts for healthy behaviors such as Safeway's are \nlimited to 20 percent of the regular premium. Recognizing the success \nof the programs such as these, the health reform bills moving through \nCongress include provisions to expand the premium discounts for healthy \nbehaviors from 20 percent to 30 percent.\n  Another attempt to bring increased wellness to the workplace through \nhealth reform is a measure that provides grants to small businesses to \nprovide access to comprehensive, evidence-based workplace wellness \nprograms that would help employees make healthier choices.\n  These are both positive steps to promote healthy behaviors and give \nincentives to keep premium costs under control.\n\n[[Page S10599]]\n\n  Also, by authorizing and expanding school-based health clinics, \nhealth care reform gives America's children more opportunity to learn \nabout the merits of healthy behaviors at a young age, giving them the \ntools they need to make healthier choices throughout their lives.\n  In addition to promoting healthy lifestyles among American workers \nand children, health care reform will make it easier for those enrolled \nin Medicare and Medicaid to gain access to preventive services and \nwellness programs. This is incredibly important not only for the \nindividual health of the enrollees but also to reduce the long-term \ncosts of chronic disease in these programs.\n  For instance, health care reform will provide Medicare beneficiaries \nwith a free visit to their primary care provider every year to create \nand update a personalized prevention plan. These plans can address \nhealth risks and chronic health problems and design a schedule for \nregular recommended preventive screenings.\n  Health care reform will also eliminate out-of-pocket costs for \npreventive services for Medicare beneficiaries, making these services \nmore affordable and increasing the likelihood they will seek early care \nbefore the cost of treating a disease is prohibitive.\n  For those enrolled in Medicaid, health care reform will offer tobacco \ncessation services to pregnant women, create a new State option for \nproviding chronically ill individuals with a health home aide to \ncoordinate care, and encourage States to cover preventive services \nrecommended by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.\n  Again, these are all steps that begin to reward preventive medicine \nand give people the incentive to utilize such services.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 6 minutes.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, may I have 1 more minute?\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Yes, 1 minute.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. In short, the long-term financial viability of the \nhealth care system requires a focus on improving health and addressing \nthe burden of chronic disease.\n  Health care reform gives us the chance to facilitate our health \nsystem's transition from one that focuses on just treating illness to \none that is more designed to prevent or delay disease onset and \nprogression.\n  It is time to gather our collective will and do the right thing \nduring this historic opportunity by passing health care reform. We can \ndo no less. The American people deserve no less.\n  Thank you.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank very much Senator Kaufman for \ngiving us one more reason why we need to address health care reform.\n  I now yield 6 minutes of my time to Senator Udall of New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I thank very much the Senator \nfrom New Hampshire. I thank her for her leadership on the floor and for \nthe hard work she has done on this issue. I know everybody back in New \nHampshire very much appreciates that. This is the fourth time the \nSenate's freshman class has gathered on the Senate floor to talk about \nhealth reform. Already we have talked about why maintaining the status \nquo is not an option. We have talked about how reform will contain \ncosts and dispel the myths about reform. We have talked about how \nreform will mean many things to many different people. What I wish to \ntalk about today is what reform will mean for rural New Mexicans.\n\n  Our rural areas are the backbone of America. It is where we grow our \nfood. It is where the values and traditions that make our country \nunique continue to thrive. It is where the potential for a clean energy \nfuture grows brighter and brighter every day. Unfortunately, our rural \nareas are also places where the disparities in America's health care \nsystem are the most startling.\n  It shouldn't matter whether one lives in a vast metropolis such as \nNew York City or a frontier town in New Mexico. All Americans, \nregardless of where we choose to call home, deserve access to quality, \naffordable health care.\n  However, the reality is that right now, where one lives does have a \nbig impact on whether they have access to quality, affordable coverage. \nAmericans living in rural areas are more likely to be uninsured, and if \nthey do have insurance, it can be very difficult to find a doctor. As a \nresult, rural Americans end up getting sicker, they have higher rates \nof chronic disease, and they are often forced to travel hundreds of \nmiles for preventive or emergency care, if they are able to find any at \nall.\n  I have seen these disparities firsthand, as a Member of the other \nChamber and now a Senator for one of the most rural States in the \nNation. Geographically, New Mexico is the fifth largest State in the \ncountry with more than 120,000 square miles of some of the most \nbeautiful land that God created. Of the 2 million people who call New \nMexico home, about 700,000 live in rural areas. Several places in New \nMexico are so sparsely populated they are classified as frontier areas \nwith less than six people per square mile.\n  Many of New Mexico's rural residents are farmers and ranchers, and \nthey run their own businesses. Their only access to health insurance is \noften through the individual market where coverage can be extremely \nexpensive, difficult to obtain, and nowhere near as comprehensive. As a \nresult, rural Americans pay nearly half of their health insurance costs \nout of pocket, and one in five farmers lives in medical debt.\n  With health care reform, we must ensure that America's farmers and \nranchers, as their small business counterparts in more urban areas, \nhave more affordable choices for coverage. I believe the best way for \nmaking this happen is through a health insurance exchange that includes \na strong public option. Inserting more choice into the market would \nkeep insurers honest and allow consumers to compare plans and prices \nand decide what works best for them.\n  With health care reform, we must also address the growing doctor \nshortage in rural America. In my State, for example, 30 of 33 counties \nare categorized as ``medically underserved.'' Americans should not have \nto travel hundreds of miles for health care. Whether it is lifesaving \ntreatment for a heart attack or a basic preventive service such as a \nmammogram, people are more likely to get the help they need when they \nneed it if the services are close to home. Through incentives such as \nlow-interest student loans, loan repayment programs, and scholarships \nfor students and midcareer professionals, we can encourage more doctors \nand nurses and specialists to establish and grow their medical careers \nin rural America.\n  Finally, with health care reform, we must better support rural \nhospitals that serve large numbers of low-income and uninsured \npatients. This could be through initiatives such as expanded drug \ndiscount programs, increased Medicare payment caps for rural health \nplans, increased National Health Service Corps doctors, and expanded \ndemonstration programs to test reasonable cost reimbursement for small \nand rural hospitals.\n  We will never achieve true reform in our country if we don't address \nthe very real health care challenges facing rural Americans from the \ndeserts of New Mexico to the mountains of Maine and everywhere in \nbetween. The improvements I have outlined are a good start, but there \nis more left to do, and I plan on talking about how we can accomplish \nthis in the coming weeks.\n  We have traveled a long way over the past few months. I applaud my \nfellow freshman Senators for standing up each week and making sure \ntheir voices were heard in this process. I believe, working together, \nwe can create a system where all people can find and afford quality \nhealth insurance that provides the care they need. We can guarantee \nquality, affordable health insurance to every American, and we must do \nthat.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield to the distinguished Senator from \nNew Hampshire.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank Senator Udall very much for giving us another \nreason health care reform is going to be good for our families and for \nAmerica.\n  Now I wish to yield 6 minutes to the Senator from Colorado, Mr. \nBennet.\n\n[[Page S10600]]\n\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from New \nHampshire for yielding, as well as the Senator from New Mexico for his \nexcellent comments.\n  I am a father of three little girls who are 10, 8, and 5. One of the \nthings I miss most in being here and not being in Colorado is being \nable to read to them at night or be with them. Over the years, we have \nmoved from one story to another. Harry Potter is now being read. But I \nheard a story from Colorado this morning that I couldn't believe that \nreminded me so much of ``Goldilocks and the Three Bears.'' So that is \nwhat I wish to talk about today.\n  In Colorado, we have a young boy named Alex Lange who is 4 months \nold. He is 17 pounds. Several weeks ago he was denied insurance because \nof his ``preexisting condition'' which, in his case, is obesity. Bernie \nand Kelli Lange, his parents, tried to get insurance and were told by \nan insurance broker that their baby was too fat to be covered. As his \nfather said:\n\n       [I] could understand if we could control what he is eating, \n     but he is 4 months old. He is breastfeeding. We can't put him \n     on the Atkins diet or on a treadmill.\n\n  So that was one story of a child who is too fat to be covered.\n  Today we have the story of Aislin Bates. By the way, in the Lange \ncase--and I want the record to reflect this--the insurance company did \nthe right thing, which is to say: We made a mistake, and we need to \ncover this young man.\n  Today comes the story of Aislin Bates who is 2 years old, 22 pounds, \ndenied insurance because of her ``preexisting condition,'' which is \nthat she is underweight. Rob and Rachel, her family, tried to get \ninsurance and they received a letter saying:\n\n       We are unable to provide coverage for Aislin because her \n     height and weight do not meet our company's standards.\n\n  Her pediatrician wrote a letter in support of the family's request to \nappeal the insurance company's decision, but the company stuck by its \ndecision. The Bates family has said it costs as much to cover Aislin \nunder COBRA as it costs to cover the remaining three family members.\n  So in Colorado we have children who are too big to be insured; we \nhave children who are too little to be insured. The reason this \nreminded me of Goldilocks was that it looks as though you have to be \n``just right'' to get insurance, even if you are an infant.\n  We can do better than that as a country, and we are proposing to do \nbetter than that as a country. One of the most important parts of this \ninsurance reform is to get rid of denials of coverage based on \npreexisting conditions. I have spoken to many people who work for \ninsurance companies that are tired of having to deny claims for this or \nfor that or relying on the fine print when they know the right thing to \ndo is to provide coverage.\n  I am tired of living in a country where 62 percent of bankruptcies \nare health care-related and 78 percent of those health care-related \nbankruptcies are happening to people who have insurance, working \nfamilies who have insurance. I am tired of the fact that we have public \nhospitals in Denver that 2 or 3 years ago spent $180 million of \ntaxpayer money on uncompensated care for people employed by small \nbusinesses.\n\n  So I think what we are talking about at the end of the day is trying \nto create some stability for our working families, trying to create \nsome stability and some fairness for our small businesses that, after \nall, are paying 18 percent more to cover their employees just because \nthey are small.\n  Politics has gotten in the way of reform of our health care system \nfor more than 20 years. It has been longer than that. In the last 10 \nyears alone, the costs of health insurance premiums have gone up 97 \npercent in my State, while median family income has declined by $800 \nover this same period. This is unsustainable for our working families. \nIt is unsustainable for us as an economy, for us to spend more than \ntwice what any other industrialized country in the world is spending on \nhealth care. We can't hope to compete in this global economy when we \nare devoting more than twice what anyone else is spending on health \ncare.\n  We can do better. The commonsense reforms that are in front of us and \nthat I am sure are going to be improved upon in the coming weeks are a \nbig step forward for working families and small businesses. It is going \nto be a big step forward for these young children in Denver, CO, and in \nthe rest of our State who can't be denied coverage because they are not \n``just right,'' because they are too big or they are too small or there \nis one other issue that nobody anticipated.\n  Our families need help. They need stability in order to get ahead. \nThat is why I support this health care reform effort.\n  I wish to thank, again, the Senator from New Hampshire for her \nleadership this morning and throughout the months as we have been \ntalking about this issue. I look forward to working with her in the \ncoming weeks as we finally bring this matter into its safe harbor.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. I thank Senator Bennet very much for yet another reason \nwe must pass health care reform.\n  Now I wish to yield 6 minutes to Senator Burris from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. I thank the Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. President, this week my freshman colleagues and I have come to \nthe Senate floor to answer a simple question. It is a question we have \nbeen hearing from ordinary Americans across the country. They want to \nknow: What can health care reform do for me?\n  I believe this question deserves an honest answer. Opponents of \nreform have resorted to lies and distortions to try to scare the \nAmerican people into siding with the big insurance corporations. They \ntalk about death panels and government takeovers and a lot of redtape \nbetween ordinary people and their doctors. These myths have been \ndebunked many times. They have had no basis in reality.\n  I believe the American people are tired of the scare tactics and the \ndishonesty. They are too smart to fall for this kind of tactic. They \nare interested in the truth behind our reform proposals. They just want \nto know: What can health care reform do for me?\n  This is what reform with a public option can do for all Americans: It \ncan make insurers compete for their business. Reform with a public \noption will restore choice to an insurance market that is currently \ndominated by only a few companies. In my home State of Illinois, two \ncompanies control 69 percent of the insurance market. In some places, \nthe market is even more concentrated. As any businessman will tell us, \nas competition shrinks, profits soar. That is bad for the consumer.\n  Between 2000 and 2007, profits increased by an average of 428 percent \namong 10 of America's top insurance providers. Other insurance premiums \nare rising four times faster than wages. Big corporations have the \nAmerican people in a vice grip, and they are squeezing them for \nextraordinary profits. It is time for this to end.\n  If we reform the insurance industry and create a not-for-profit \npublic health option, it will force private companies to improve their \nprices and their products. It will restore choice and competition to \nthe market and will help make our insurance more affordable.\n  If you like your current plan, no one will force you to switch to a \npublic option. Understand: If you have your doctor, you have your \nproviders, and you have insurance coverage today, we are not going to \nimpact you. But if your insurance provider isn't treating you right or \nis not giving you the coverage you need, you will have the ability to \nshop around. You can buy a better private plan that is guaranteed to be \naffordable for someone of your income level or you can choose the \npublic option which will set its premiums at an affordable rate. Then \nit will rely on those premiums to remain self-sufficient.\n  These are the facts. This is what health insurance reform with a \npublic option means to the American people: competition, choice, and \naffordability. That is why I refuse to compromise on the public option \nbecause it is the only way to give the American people the quality \naffordable care they deserve.\n  Let me be as clear as I possibly can. I will not vote for any health \nreform bill that does not include a public option. I ask my colleagues \nto stand with me. We have been debating reform for almost a century. \nNow is not the time to back down. Now is the time to act\n\n[[Page S10601]]\n\non our convictions. Let's do this for the American people. Let's make a \npublic option a reality.\n  I yield back my time to the distinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Burris for pointing out \nthat we need health care reform to get competition in our health care \nindustry.\n  I yield 6 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina, Mrs. Hagan.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I am joining my colleagues on the floor \ntoday to discuss the need for health care reform and what it means for \nAmericans with preexisting conditions.\n  Millions of Americans live today with what insurance companies \ndescribe as preexisting conditions. They range from something as common \nas asthma or diabetes to diseases such as cancer or MS. Some insurance \ncompanies, believe it or not, even consider a C-section to be a \npreexisting condition.\n  Under our current system, if you are shopping for insurance on the \nindividual market and you have a preexisting condition, you are faced \nwith one of three frightening choices: One, you could be denied \ncoverage altogether; two, you could be charged an exorbitant premium; \nthree, you could be granted insurance with a rider that stipulates your \ninsurance company is not required to cover your preexisting condition.\n  Recently, I received an e-mail from a family in Mooresville, NC, that \ntruly underscores why millions of Americans living with preexisting \nconditions simply can no longer afford inaction on this issue.\n  Seven years ago, Tim became disabled and lost his job. Because he \nlost his job, his wife Marilyn also lost her coverage under his \nemployer-provided plan. Tim's health care, which requires his wife \nMarilyn to provide constant home care, is covered by Medicare. But \nMarilyn has Osler's disease, which is a blood disease considered to be \na preexisting condition by her insurance company. Marilyn is only able \nto purchase a high-cost, high-deductible plan. Compared to Tim's \nillness, her condition is relatively minor. But over the last 7 years, \nthey have racked up more than $72,000 in debt for her health care. And \nthis past year, her health insurance premiums cost more than the \nmortgage on their home.\n  Unfortunately, there are millions of Americans all across our country \nsuch as Tim and Marilyn who are literally one medical emergency away \nfrom bankruptcy. This couple is sick and stuck.\n  Over the last 10 years, medical premiums in North Carolina have \nskyrocketed, increasing 98 percent, while wages, on the other hand, \nhave increased only 18 percent.\n  The Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, of which I am a \nmember, crafted a bill that ensures a preexisting condition never again \nprevents anyone from obtaining health insurance. It also provides \nsecurity and stability for people with insurance, expands access to \nhealth insurance for people without it, and it will stop draining the \nfinances of American families and the Treasury. The Finance Committee's \nbill also includes these critical elements.\n  My goal is to send the President a bill that gives people the peace \nof mind that if they change or lose their job, as Tim did, they will no \nlonger have to fear losing their health insurance too.\n  Every single day I hear from North Carolinians who are looking for an \nopportunity to purchase quality affordable health insurance and protect \ntheir families. Hard-working Americans, such as Tim and Marilyn, simply \ncannot afford to wait any longer.\n  I yield back my time.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Hagan for yet another \nreason why health care reform is going to make a difference for \nAmericans.\n  This morning, the freshman Senators have again talked about why we \nmust pass health care reform. We have heard nine very important reasons \nwhy health care can make a difference for American families.\n  We heard from Senator Warner that health care reform is going to be \ncritical to States as they look at the rising costs of Medicaid in \ntheir budgets and how to get those health care costs under control.\n  We heard from Senator Merkley why health care reform is critical to \nhelp small businesses as they are trying to cover their employees and \ndeal with the costs as they get out of this recession.\n  We heard from Senator Begich about why health care reform is critical \nas we are looking at economic recovery. Health care costs are 18 \npercent of this economy, one-sixth of this economy, and we cannot allow \nthose costs to continue to grow at this rate and expect we are going to \nbe able to recover robustly from this recession.\n  We heard from you, Mr. President, about why health care reform is \ngoing to improve prevention and wellness. The goal is to make us a \nhealthier population, and health care reform can help spur that.\n  We heard from Senator Bennet about why health care reform is going to \nhelp people who already have health insurance, to make that health \ninsurance better provide for families who need it.\n  We heard from Senator Burris about why health care reform is going to \nbe critical to making health insurance companies compete for business \nand, therefore, better accommodate the health issues families have.\n  We heard from Senator Udall about why health care reform is going to \nmake a difference for rural areas, places such as the north country of \nNew Hampshire where we have too many people who have to spend too much \nand go too far for their health care.\n  We heard from Senator Hagan about the importance of health insurance \nreform and health care reform to address things such as preexisting \nconditions.\n  I talked about the fact that health care reform can both lower costs \nand improve quality for Americans.\n  Those are nine critical reasons why health care reform is going to be \nimportant to help American families, American businesses, the American \neconomy.\n  The time to act is now. Hopefully, we can act in a bipartisan way. \nBut we must act to make a difference for this country and for families.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remaining time in morning business. I \nyield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10601-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10601]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

LANGE TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE FOR \n                      THE DISTRICT OF SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Roberto A. Lange, of South \nDakota, to be U.S. District Judge for the District of South Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nhours of debate equally divided and controlled between the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Leahy, and the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, or \ntheir designees.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, a few weeks ago I stood here on the floor \nand offered my support for Jeff Viken to be a District Judge for South \nDakota. That nomination passed with a vote of 99 to 0. Today, I am here \nto encourage my colleagues to offer the same support for Roberto Lange, \nalso a nominee to be a District Judge for South Dakota. I spoke at that \ntime of the importance of Federal judgeships and the lifetime tenure of \nthese appointments. The lifetime appointment of a Federal judge is a \nvery serious decision; one that has a lasting impact on our democracy.\n  When I last spoke on the floor nearly a month ago, only two judges \nhad been confirmed--including now-Justice\n\n[[Page S10602]]\n\nSotomayor. That day, we confirmed a third judge. That confirmation was \nJeff Viken to fill a vacancy in my home State of South Dakota. Since \nthat time no other judges have been confirmed by the Senate. I am proud \nto have both the third and the fourth judges confirmed by the Senate \nthis Congress to be for the District of South Dakota. However, it is my \nunderstanding that there are currently ten other judicial nominations \npending on the Executive Calendar. We are lucky in South Dakota to have \nour vacancies filled so quickly, but I encourage my colleagues to act \nswiftly to fill these other vacancies.\n  Mr. Lange has an impressive background. He has over 20 years of \nexperience practicing law in South Dakota. Before that, he clerked for \nthe very same docket that he has been nominated for. He attended \nNorthwestern University School of Law on a full tuition scholarship \nwhere he was on the dean's list every semester. Prior to that, he \ncompleted his undergraduate degree at the University of South Dakota, \nmy law school alma mater. In addition, Bob has received a well-\nqualified rating from the American Bar Association.\n  I am proud to have put Bob's name forward for this post. It is a \ngreat honor that President Obama has placed on Bob with this \nnomination. South Dakota will be well served by this selection. I \ncongratulate Bob and his family on this accomplishment.\n  It is with great confidence in his abilities that I will cast my vote \ntoday for the confirmation of Roberto Lange to be the next U.S. Federal \nDistrict Judge for South Dakota. I urge my colleagues to support this \nvery qualified nominee.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous \nconsent that the time under the quorum call be equally divided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak up to 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Afghanistan/Pakistan Strategy\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to renew my call for President \nObama to give full support to his top military commander in \nAfghanistan, GEN Stanley McChrystal.\n  Several weeks ago, I stood in this Chamber and made the case for our \nCongress and the American people to hear directly, and as soon as \npossible, from General McChrystal to ensure that political motivations \nhere in Washington do not override the vital needs of our commanders \nand troops on the ground. I was concerned then, as I am now, that \ncontinued wavering by the administration and others in Washington could \nunravel the hard work by our military and intelligence professionals on \nthe battlefields of Afghanistan.\n  As the ``friendly'' death toll continues to rise in Afghanistan, \npolitical indecision here in Washington persists. We have heard no firm \ncommitment from the administration to the fully resourced \ncounterinsurgency strategy the President forcefully outlined last \nspring. I came to the floor and I supported the President's \ncounterinsurgency strategy fully; and with General McChrystal's recent \nreport to implement that strategy to deal with the situation in \nAfghanistan, I fully supported President Obama's statements in March.\n  But instead of commitment, the past few weeks have brought a flurry \nof internal debate in the administration and in the media about the \nbasic tenets of the strategy and assessment--counterinsurgency versus \ncounterterrorism; clear, build and hold, or fire and fall back; more \ntroops versus fewer strategy; crafting a strategy or crafting a \nstrategic message. In what must be a historic first, it appears I am \nmore supportive of the President's own strategy than the President is.\n  Amidst this indecision, our Afghan people, our NATO, ISAF, regional \nallies, and our own troops wait. The Afghans wait to hear if the United \nStates will continue to stand beside them in spite of the growing \nthreats of the insurgent violence of the resurgent Taliban control. Our \nallies wait to see if they were wrong to put trust and confidence in \nthe U.S. leadership in the region. Our military forces and brave \ncivilians who serve in Afghanistan under constant stress and mortal \ndanger wait to see if their sacrifices and those of their fallen \ncomrades will have been in vain.\n  We have heard excuse after excuse, constant attempts to justify \ndelay. Over the past week, another red herring was floated by some \nofficials--we have to wait until the dispute surrounding the Afghan \nelections are resolved. This red herring--and those people peddling it \nas an excuse--has missed a truth even more applicable to the mountains \nand villages, and our towns and cities here in America--all politics is \nlocal, and so is the security that the Afghan people need.\n  While we would all like to see a pristine election in Afghanistan--\nsomething we still haven't accomplished 100 percent in our own Nation--\nthe Taliban is not waiting for election results as they continue to \nkill our troops and attack the people of Afghanistan and gain momentum. \nSecurity in Afghanistan will not come from Kabul. It will have to be \nbuilt village by village and valley by valley. That is what the \ncounterinsurgency strategy is designed to do.\n  Even if the naysayers continue to ignore this important truth about \nsecurity in Afghanistan, yesterday's announcement that a run-off \nelection will now be held on November 7 has made that red herring of an \nexcuse gone and useless. In light of this electoral process in \nAfghanistan and the progress that has been made, what are we hearing \nfrom the White House? As though this decision seemed something to be \napplauded, the administration continues to proclaim its indecision. \nToday, the White House press secretary said, ``It's possible,'' but \nthere are no guarantees that a decision may be made before the \nelection--17 days from now. More people killed, more progress for the \nTaliban, more wondering and hesitancy by the Afghans we are trying to \nserve.\n  It is a simple question: Will we support President Obama's commanding \ngeneral, Stan McChrystal, or not?\n  I have heard some pundits opine that delaying a few more weeks won't \nmake any difference because it will take some time for troops to get \nthere anyway. Using that logic, no decisions need to be made for \nmonths. But it is pretty clear postponing any decision simply postpones \nthe date of actual engagement. And even the right strategy won't work \nif it is not implemented on time. We are losing time, and it can never \nbe recovered. It certainly won't work if it is never acknowledged as \nour strategy.\n  Defense Secretary Gates waved a red flag recently, noting that the \nUnited States cannot wait for questions surrounding the legitimacy of \nthe Afghan Government to be resolved before a decision on General \nMcChrystal's troop request is made. He understands what I believe is a \nsimple truth: The longer we wait, the stronger and more determined the \nenemy gets.\n  Read the papers. Violence is up this season over last. Violence is up \nthis year over the last. The Taliban continues to gain influence in \nparts of Afghanistan. We keep fighting with what we have, but the \ninsurgents keep getting stronger. We cannot and must not wait any \nlonger for a decision.\n  It comes down to this: Delay leads to defeat, not victory. Our \ncommanders in the field--the real experts who see firsthand what is \nrequired for victory--have asked for more boots on the ground, and \nthere is no reason not to give them those troops now. While politicians \nand pundits debate here, the enemy is building strength and \nestablishing even greater control over Afghanistan, the Afghan people, \nand future generations of potential terrorists. While we talk here, \nAmerican heroes and our ISAF and Afghan allies are dying in increasing \nnumbers in the barren regions of Afghanistan.\n  In a war where winning hearts and minds is critical, delay in \nWashington is a public diplomacy disaster in Afghanistan and abroad. It \nadvertises our lack of resolve to our allies and the people of \nAfghanistan. The Afghan people have been disappointed by the\n\n[[Page S10603]]\n\nUnited States before. Now they need to know with certainty that the \nUnited States will not abandon them again in this fight against \nterrorism. Our allies, who are at this very moment being urged by the \nSecretary of Defense to contribute to the Afghan campaign, need to know \nthat we will remain by their sides to defeat this enemy together. \nInstead, the message we are sending is one of absurdity.\n  Imagine this diplomatic sales job: We send a diplomat out and say: \n``Friends in Afghanistan, we would like to keep fighting the good fight \nagainst the terrorists and insurgents, but we haven't yet decided how \nstrong our commitment is.'' I would like to see that message sell. And \nto our allies around the world: ``We would really like for you to \ncontribute more troops and resources for this fight, but we need a few \nmore weeks to decide what our contributions will be.'' That message \nisn't going to work either.\n  I strongly doubt this new brand of public diplomacy will sell for \nmuch in the streets of Kabul or the villages of Nangarhar. What this \nmessage does tell the people of Afghanistan and the key Shura leaders \nacross the country is: Don't trust the Americans, and instead look to \nthe Taliban as the most likely force for the future in Afghanistan. A \ndisaster.\n  Perhaps even more troubling is the message this wavering sends to our \nterrorist enemies. If they simply wait us out, we will go home in \ndefeat. While the administration dithers, the terrorists have honed \ntheir own message of hatred and extremism. Radical Islamic terrorists \nhave staged suicide attacks for maximum publicity, propagandized their \nmessage on the Internet, and convinced their fellow terrorists-at-arms \nthat they will defeat the international community.\n\n  In the years leading up to the 9/11 attacks, al-Qaida--operating \nunder the Taliban control in Afghanistan--was emboldened by our \nlukewarm response to their attacks and provocations. Failing to commit \nto victory now will only embolden these enemies of freedom that much \nmore to stage more attacks.\n  Let there be no doubt, from all that I have read and all that I have \nlearned in my travels to the region, and heard here, if we fail now, if \nthe Taliban returns to power in Afghanistan, the price we pay in the \nfuture will be far greater than any price General McChrystal is asking \nus to pay now. We have to decide which price we are going to pay.\n  The stakes are high. General McChrystal's strategic assessment makes \nclear the situation in Afghanistan is deteriorating and the Taliban is \ngaining momentum. The causes of this deterioration have been debated by \nmy colleagues countless times over the past several years. Pointing \nfingers for past judgments or even past mistakes, however, does nothing \nto solve the problems of today in Afghanistan. For this reason, I was \ndisappointed to learn yesterday of the House majority leader's \ncriticism of Members of Congress who are calling on President Obama to \nmake a decision now. Well, I am one of them.\n  The majority leader, in trying to justify the administration's \nwavering, accused Republicans of abandoning their focus for the past 7 \nyears. I don't happen to think that is true. But whatever your opinion \non the matter is, it is simply no longer relevant. The actions of one \nadministration do not justify handing victory to terrorists through the \nindecisiveness of another administration. The battle before us in the \nAfghan/Pakistan region is today. General McChrystal has laid out an \nimplementation of the winning strategy for Afghanistan, which the \nPresident set out, and the President's decision is simple: Do we \nimplement it or not?\n  The answer should be simple. By announcing publicly his unequivocal \nsupport for General McChrystal's request, agreeing to send the troops \nthat are needed, the President can send a message of firm resolve to \nour enemies and to our allies. He can give our commanders on the \nground--the same military experts he chose for this mission--the \nresources they have requested. He can create a strategic communications \nplan that tells our enemies, our allies, and the American people of our \nintentions for the region.\n  The last point is particularly important. We are at a crossroads in \nPakistan. We can take the road of expedience and continue to listen to \nPakistani officials, who claim they have no control over the Taliban, \nhave no idea where Mullah Omar is, and have only limited capability to \ndecrease terrorist safe havens in their country or we can take the \nbetter path and encourage our Pakistani allies to reclaim their \nnational sovereignty in the tribal areas and provide the stability and \nsecurity that is the right of a people to expect from their government. \nI believe I speak for many of my colleagues when I say we should expect \nmore from our allies to whom we give so much. But they need to hear \nthat we are serious about our mission there as well. Pakistan has the \nright to be concerned when the United States appears to be faltering in \nits determination to remain in the fight. We failed in this region in \nthe past, so we should not be surprised if our continued wavering \ninstills heightened insecurity. I have spoken in this Chamber before \nabout the importance of including Pakistan in our efforts to defeat \nterrorism in the region. Afghanistan and Pakistan are inextricably \nlinked. More aggressive action may become a good thing in Pakistan, but \nsuch action should be in addition to, not as a substitute for, giving \nour troops in Afghanistan all the resources they need.\n  While denying al-Qaida and Taliban militants sanctuary in the border \nregions of Pakistan is critical, a fire-and- fall-back-only approach \nfocusing on one part of this regional conflict will ultimately hand \nvictory to the world's most violent and feared terrorists--the same \nterrorists whom our Nation witnessed firsthand attack so brutally, \nviolently, and with such deadly force on September 11.\n  We have seen polls that signal wavering support among the American \npeople for this war in Afghanistan. But I have faith in the American \npeople. They are resilient, they are proud of their country, and they \nunderstand the price of doing nothing. They are determined the \nsacrifices of their sons and daughters, husbands, wives, and children \nserving in Afghanistan will not be in vain. We owe them no less.\n  I call on President Obama to end this indecision and to show the \nAmerican people and our allies the same resolve and determination I \nheard in his words of last spring. It is time for him to speak out, to \nmake the decision, explain why it is important, and to carry that \nmessage not just to Americans but to allies and enemies throughout the \nworld. Last spring he said:\n\n       Our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot \n     outlast us, and we will defeat you.\n\n  General McChrystal has said we must act quickly to defeat the \nterrorists and insurgents. Now is the time for President Obama to \nsupport his commanders on the ground and silence the pessimistic \npolitical winds whispering defeat in Washington.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that \nthe time during the quorum be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that during debate \non the nominees, all time during quorum call and recess be charged \nequally to the majority and minority sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to bring to the attention \nof my colleagues the effect these holds--in most cases anonymous holds \nthat are being placed by Senators on judicial appointments--are having \non the lives of judicial officials and on the effectiveness of the \njudicial branch of government.\n  So far, President Obama has nominated four circuit court judges who \nare awaiting confirmation. One of those is Andre Davis to the Fourth \nCircuit of Maryland. I mention his name because he was appointed by \nPresident Obama early this year. The Judiciary Committee held a hearing \nin April of this\n\n[[Page S10604]]\n\nyear. In June, the Judiciary Committee recommended his confirmation by \na strong bipartisan vote of 16 to 3.\n  When we finally get a chance to vote on Judge Davis' confirmation to \nthe court of appeals for the circuit court, I am confident it is going \nto be a lopsided vote among the Members of the Senate. Yet we have been \ndenied the opportunity to confirm his appointment because some Senators \nput on a hold. Every time we tried to get a time agreement, which \neverybody says is reasonable, there was an objection. I do not believe \nit is aimed at Judge Davis; I believe it is a strategy by my Republican \ncolleagues to slow down the confirmation process of judges. I don't \nknow why. I really do not understand. When we have a judge who is \nqualified, who is not controversial, why would we deny the judicial \nbranch of government the judge it needs in order to carry out its \nresponsibility? Why would we put people through this process of waiting \nfor the Senate to confirm when it is clear the overwhelming majority is \nin support of the confirmation? I think Judge Davis presents an \nexample. Let me try to put a face on it. You hear the numbers, you hear \nthe statistics, but each one of those holds represents another person \nbeing denied the opportunity to serve as a judge.\n  Judge Davis has an extremely long and distinguished career in the \nMaryland legal community. He graduated from the University of \nPennsylvania cum laude and with a JD degree from the University of \nMaryland School of Law, where he still teaches classes as a faculty \nmember. He has been a judge on the District Court of Maryland since \n1995 when he was confirmed by the Senate. He has had a long career--22 \nyears--as a district court judge. He has presided over literally \nthousands of cases. Many of these have gone to verdict and judgment. \nHis record is one which lawyers and his colleagues on the bench praise \nas being well balanced, as that of a judge who understands the \nresponsibilities of the judicial branch of government. He tries to call \nthe cases as the law dictates, and there is absolutely no blemish on \nhis record as a trial court judge. He has been praised by lawyers in \nMaryland as smart, evenhanded, fair, and openminded. He has received a \n``well qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association Standing \nCommittee on the Federal Judiciary. He will add diversity to the Fourth \nCircuit. When confirmed, he will be the third African-American judge to \nserve in the Fourth Circuit.\n  I bring to your attention and to the attention of my colleagues Judge \nDavis because we have to bring an end to these holds where a judge is \nbeing held not because he is controversial, not because there is a \nproblem, not because you want additional information, but just to slow \ndown the process. That is wrong. That is an abuse of the \nresponsibilities of each one of us, of the power each Senator has. I \nthink it is important that we all speak out, whether Democrats or \nRepublicans. It is just wrong. It is time to move these nominations to \nthe floor of the Senate and to have votes up or down on these nominees.\n  I urge my colleagues to let us get on with the business we were \nelected to do, to advise and consent to the President's appointments. \nIf we have a problem with an appointment, let's speak out against it \nand let's have that type of debate. But delay for delay's sake is not \nbefitting the Senate. I urge my colleagues to allow these appointments \nto go forward with up-or-down votes on the floor of the Senate.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the final 30 \nminutes prior to the 2 p.m. vote be reserved for the chair and ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee or their designees, with Senator \nLeahy controlling the final 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                    Medicare Physician Fairness Act\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a motion we \nwill be voting on after the nomination that is currently before the \nSenate, and that is the motion to proceed to a very important bill for \nseniors on Medicare coverage, for the disabled, for those who are in \nour military and their families. It relates to the way we reimburse \nphysicians under Medicare and under TRICARE. It is called the Medicare \nPhysician Fairness Act.\n  This is an effort to eliminate what has become a very flawed formula \nfor determining the payments for physicians under Medicare.\n  We, in fact, know it is flawed because in the last 7 years, the last \nseven times that proposals have come forward from this formula to cut \nphysician pay under Medicare and TRICARE, this Congress has chosen to \nreject that recommendation, that cut.\n  We want to make sure seniors can have access to their doctors, that \nMedicare is a quality system that allows the kind of reimbursements so \nwe can continue to have the quality of providers, physicians, and \nothers we have today.\n  This bill, S. 1776, would allow us to do away with what has become a \nvery flawed process. Every year we postpone the cuts that have been \nproposed because we know they are flawed. We know this time of year, if \nwe do not take action, there would be a 21-percent cut in Medicare for \nphysicians who serve our seniors and people with disabilities. Because \nMedicare and TRICARE are tied together, that cut would also affect our \nmilitary men and women and their families and retirees from the \nmilitary. So, of course, we do not want that to happen. We are not \ngoing to allow that to happen. But rather than every year--every year, \nevery year--deciding at the last minute we are going to stop these \ndevastating cuts, putting physicians in the situation where they are \nnot sure how to plan, worrying our seniors, worrying those in our \nmilitary and retired military personnel, now is the time to change the \nformula to stop it.\n  By doing that, by passing this legislation, we then set the stage for \nhealth care reform where, in fact, under health care reform, we have a \ndifferent set of incentives. We focus on strengthening Medicare in a \nway that improves quality access for seniors. We focus on incentivizing \nprevention. We focus on incentivizing primary care doctors with a \ndifferent system that will provide bonuses and payments for our primary \ncare doctors.\n  So we have a new system. We have a new vision for strengthening \nMedicare, strengthening our health care system. But right at the \nmoment, we also have this failed system in place that we are kind of \nstuck with unless we can say: We are done. We are going to start again. \nWe are going to start from a different budget baseline, and then move \nforward on health care reform.\n  That is exactly what I have been wanting to do with this legislation. \nThat is why I am so appreciative of the fact that our majority leader, \nSenator Reid, understands and is committed to making this change. His \ncommitment to Medicare, his commitment to our seniors, our military \npersonnel, and to our physicians is the reason we are here today. So I \nam so grateful to him for all of his commitment and all of his work. \nBut this needs to be changed right now.\n  As I indicated, we have a system that supports our Medicare system, \ncovers seniors, the disabled. We also tie it to our military health \ncare system, members of the U.S. military, surviving spouses, families, \nmilitary retirees, and their families. All of them are extremely \nsupportive. In fact, it is not an exaggeration to say this is a top \npriority, if not the top priority, of the AARP and those who advocate \nfor seniors right now to give seniors the peace of mind to know they \nare going to be\n\n[[Page S10605]]\n\nable to have access to their doctors and that their doctors are going \nto have the resources they need to be able to treat them.\n  This bill would make sure that happened by rejecting what has been a \nfailed system. We can go right on down the list. We not only have \nstrong support from the American Medical Association and other \nphysician groups but those who represent our military. Military \nofficers and their families and retirees are extremely supportive.\n  I am very proud of the work that over 20,000 physicians in Michigan \ndo every day providing to more than 1.4 million seniors and people with \ndisabilities in Michigan the quality care they need and deserve.\n  We have over 90,000 TRICARE beneficiaries, men and women in our \nmilitary, retirees who are receiving high-quality medical services in \nconjunction with the Medicare system. We are very proud of that, and we \nwant to make sure we are maintaining that as well.\n  Let me go through again what we are trying to make sure we can fix. \nOne, this legislation would repeal the current broken system. It would \nstop a 21-percent cut to our physicians under Medicare and TRICARE, \nwhich would be devastating. It would stop what is a Band-aid approach \nevery year. We know we are going to fix it. We fix it every year \nindividually for that year, always at the last minute.\n  It is time to change that process. I believe this is honest budgeting \nbecause we know we are not going to allow these cuts to take place. So \nwe should do away with this process that even proposes these cuts every \nyear and lay the foundation for real physician payment reform, which is \nin the legislation.\n  Let me share with you a letter from a medical clinic in southwest \nMichigan where physicians wrote to me.\n\n       Every year we have to wait to the last minute to see if the \n     rates will get cut or fixed. This makes it impossible to \n     budget and project for the next year. Especially for \n     practices like ours, with nearly 50 percent of our patients \n     are Medicare patients. With the uncertainty and the increases \n     that we do get not keeping up with the cost of living, we \n     have to err on the side of caution, which leads us to job \n     cuts. Though we need the staff to provide the best patient \n     care between Medicare and Medicaid we can't afford to keep \n     them and stay in business. If the uncertainty continues we \n     will be forced to re-evaluate our patient population as well, \n     leaving the Medicare patients with no choices for the care \n     that they need.\n\n  This is really the bottom line. We want to make sure physicians are \nfully participating in caring for our senior citizens, for people with \ndisabilities in this country. We want to make sure Medicare is strong. \nWe want to make sure we are protecting it going forward. In order to do \nthat, we have to start from the premise that we will not be allowing \nthese cuts or the possibility of these cuts to go forward year after \nyear after year.\n  The vote we are going to have in front of us is a vote to proceed to \nthe bill. I know there are those with amendments they would like to \noffer. I would hope that we would see a strong bipartisan vote to \nsimply go to this bill. I think the seniors of this country deserve \nthat.\n  I think all of those who care about health care for our senior \ncitizens and the disabled, our families, our military personnel deserve \nthat; to have the opportunity to go to this bill, to be able to work on \nit together, and to be able to pass this bill and permanently solve \nthis problem.\n  I am very grateful for the fact that the President of the United \nStates not only supports this effort, his administration's budget, the \nbudget he gave us at the beginning of this year, his very first budget, \nhe put forward a budget that did not include going forward with the \ncuts in this flawed formula.\n  His budget baseline started from a premise that we would not be \nmaking these cuts going forward. I believe that is where we should be. \nWe should be making sure we stop the Band-aid approach. Stop this \neffort that has gone on year after year and create an honest budgeting \nprocess so that we can make sure our seniors have confidence in the \nfuture; that they are going to be able to see their doctor under \nMedicare, and that physicians have the confidence of knowing they are \nsupported by a strengthened Medicare system.\n  So I am very hopeful we will see a strong bipartisan vote to allow us \nto move to this very important measure to strengthen and protect \nMedicare of the future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to declare to my colleagues that \nI intend to vote against cloture to proceed on the motion to proceed to \nthis measure regarding the sustainable growth rate.\n  I want to explain why. I thank Senator Stabenow for her leadership, \nand to say this is one of those moments where substantially I agree \nwith just about everything she had to say about the inadequacies of the \nsustainable growth rate formula which was put in in the late 1970s as \npart of what turned out to be a very effective attempt to bring fiscal \nresponsibility, budget balancing, even a surplus.\n  Believe it or not, at the end of the Clinton administration, \nhistorians may note, perhaps people will forget, we actually had a \nFederal Government surplus. But it turned out that this sustainable \ngrowth rate formula for the reimbursement of doctors was not workable \nand unfair and has resulted in the refusal of a lot of doctors to treat \npatients under Medicare.\n  So why would I not vote for cloture to proceed to take up this \nmatter, and then vote for it? It is because there are larger questions \ninvolved. In some sense, I think this is a precautionary tale, the vote \non this matter. It is a precautionary tale of what we will face in \nsucceeding votes in the Senate and most immediately in the health care \nreform debate we will soon take up on the Senate floor.\n  We did not get into this terrible situation with our Federal deficit \nand debt because there were people in the House or in the White House \nover the last several years who had bad motives or bad values. In fact, \nin most of the cases, such as this, when money has been allocated, \nappropriated for programs, it has been done with the best of \nintentions. But the ultimate effect has been bad for our country and \nour future because it has put us into a position of national debt that \nis unsustainable, that threatens to cripple our economic recovery and \nburden our children and grandchildren and beyond so that they do not \nlive in a country with the kind of economic dynamism and opportunity in \nwhich we were blessed to be raised.\n  In some sense, if I would be allowed to paraphrase, I would say the \nroad to an unsustainable, damaging, American national debt is paved \nwith good intentions, with votes for good programs. It just is time for \nus together, across party lines, to sound the alarm, blow the whistle, \nand make choices regarding priorities.\n  We cannot have, no matter how good or worthwhile, programs for which \nwe are not prepared to pay. The numbers are stunning. I am privileged \nto be serving my 21st year in the Senate. The numbers of our Federal \nindebtedness today are so shockingly high that if you told me that 21 \nyears ago or 10 years ago or even 5 years ago, I simply would not have \nbelieved it.\n  The fiscal year that ended on September 30, fiscal year 2009, we now \nknow, learned about a week ago, America ran a deficit of $1.4-plus \ntrillion. We know America now has an accumulated long-term debt of $12 \ntrillion.\n  We know the Congressional Budget Office has projected that over the \nnext 10 years, we will run deficits that will add $9 trillion to the \nlong-term debt. So $12 trillion now, add $9 trillion, and that is $21 \ntrillion of debt. It is unbelievable. We say it is unsustainable. That \nis a big word. What does ``unsustainable'' mean? It means that at some \npoint this size debt is going to cripple the economic recovery that is \njust beginning. It is going to create hyperinflation because at some \npoint people are going to stop buying our debt and we will have to \nraise interest to get more people to do so. At some point, if we don't \nfix this, the government is going to be left with no alternative but to \nprint more money. That is the road to inflation, to lost jobs, and to a \nlower quality of life.\n  All these things we have done, which seemed necessary at the time, \nwhich are good, we have to pay for them or else this will not be the \ncountry we want it to be for succeeding generations. We are going to \nreach a point where we will not have the money to\n\n[[Page S10606]]\n\ndo the first thing the Federal Government is supposed to do, which is \nto defend the security of the country, to provide for the common \ndefense in what is, obviously, a dangerous world.\n  This is a precautionary tale, a precautionary vote. We are coming to \na big debate on health care reform. I am for health care reform, but it \nis not the only thing I am for. In fact, at this moment in our history, \nit seems there are two things that matter more to our country than \nhealth care reform, although I wish we could do them all. One is to \nsustain the recovery from the deepest recession this country has had \nsince the Great Depression of the 1930s. We are just beginning to crawl \nour way out of it. Gains in gross domestic product look as though they \nare coming, but it is fragile. It is not robust. Of course, almost 10 \npercent of the American people are out of work. In fact, it is higher \nthan 10 percent. To me, the top priority we all should have--and I \nspeak for myself--is to sustain the economic recovery to get people \nback to work, to keep our economy strong.\n  The second--and it is related to the first--is to begin to deal with \nthe terrible imbalances in our Federal books that will compromise the \neconomic recovery and cripple our economic future and the opportunity \nour children and grandchildren will have in the future. It means we \nhave to make choices. In the coming health care debate, we have to make \nsure, as the President said, that there is not one dime added to the \ndeficit as a result. We have to make sure that what we do within the \ncontext of health care reform not only doesn't increase the deficit and \nthe long-term debt but doesn't add cost and increase premiums, for \ninstance, on working people, middle-class families to pay for their \nhealth insurance and on businesses for which we need to provide every \nincentive to add workers, to grow, to sustain the recovery as it exists \nnow.\n  Those are the standards I will apply to my own action on the health \ncare reform proposal. I want to be for health care reform. I am for \nhealth care reform. I know the system needs to be changed. But this is \na precautionary vote coming up because while the Medicare Physicians \nFairness Act, which would repeal the sustainable growth rate formula, \nis substantively just, it is not paid for. It adds almost $250 billion \nto the debt for the coming years. I don't think we can do that anymore.\n  I am relieved to know, in terms of the immediate impact of my vote \nagainst cloture on this matter, that if cloture is not obtained, the \nhealth care reform bill that came out of the Senate Finance Committee \ndoes take care of the problem with the sustainable growth rate for \nanother year. That gives everybody--doctors and, most important, \nMedicare recipients--breathing room. We can't go on spending without \npaying for what we are spending, no matter how good or right it is, \nbecause there is a greater harm being done to our country.\n  The speed with which this Medicare Physician Fairness Act has come to \nthe floor and taking it out of health care reform where it certainly \nbelongs is also a precautionary tale.\n  I have said I am against the public option for health care insurance, \nessentially a government-owned health insurance plan, one, because we \nbelieve in a market economy and a regulatory government. We believe a \nmarket economy is the best way to create economic growth and wealth. It \nserves the American people very well. We also know that a market \neconomy of itself doesn't, as somebody long ago said, have a \nconscience. So the government sets rules. We have oversight. We have \nregulatory rules. We have antitrust laws, for instance. That is the way \nwe maintain fairness in the economy, in the marketplace. I don't \nremember another case where our answer to a concern about fairness in \nthe marketplace--in this case, whether there is real competition in the \nhealth insurance business, whether the health insurance companies are \nbeing fair in their rates, et cetera, which are all reasonable \nquestions--I don't remember another case where the answer was to create \na government-owned corporation to compete with the private sector.\n  I spent 6 great years serving as attorney general of Connecticut. We \nsued a lot of businesses for unfair trade practices, for bid rigging, \nfor price fixing. We appeared before regulatory commissions on behalf \nof the people of the United States, all sorts of businesses. But nobody \never had the idea that instead of us doing that, we should create a \ngovernment oil company, a government car company, a government company \nto sell automobiles, a government company to take care of roof \ncontracting. I could go on and on. One of the reasons is, particularly \nnow, I don't have confidence that we can discipline ourselves from \nmaking it into another cause of the skyrocketing Federal deficit.\n  This bill is evidence of that. Here is a good cause, a group we all \nrespect, the doctors, saying: We need this 10-year fix to the problem. \nAnd we just did it. This really ought to be done as part of overall \nMedicare reform. We have to have a commission. We have to have some \nsystem to deal with the great threats to our economic future. Medicare \nis going to run out of money in 2017, 8 years from now. Social Security \nis already dipping into the trust funds, taking more out than we are \ngetting in. It may change in a year or two, but that is the way it is.\n  With respect to the sponsors of this proposal, the Medicare Physician \nFairness Act, the doctors' associations that I know would like us to \nvote for it, I think 1 year is enough; 1 year paid for is enough. To do \nmore than that now is wrong and irresponsible, and therefore I will \nvote against the cloture motion on the motion to proceed to the \nMedicare Physician Fairness Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I will vote against the motion to proceed. \nBefore Senator Lieberman leaves the floor, I want to say again, of all \nthe people I have met in the Senate, he constantly amazes me, because \nthere is no doubt he is doing this because he believes passionately \nthat America is at a crossroads and this is making the problem worse, \nnot better. I am on a bill with him--there are seven Republicans and \nseven Democrats--that is a comprehensive solution to our health care \nneeds. It is the Wyden-Bennett bill. It mandates coverage, but we do it \nthrough the private sector.\n  I want colleagues to know that Senator Lieberman has been \nconstructive in trying to find a bipartisan compromise that will allow \nus to deal with health care inflation, which is a problem in the \nprivate sector. He practices what he preaches, trying to solve \nproblems. As he explained it, the Senator from Mississippi and I were \nsitting here talking. There is not much of that around here in politics \nnow, where one would come out and take on an issue that is being pushed \nby leaders of the Democratic Party. He is an independent Democrat, but \nhe articulated the reason in a way most Americans really appreciate.\n  Doctors have a problem. In 1997, we tried to balance the budget with \nPresident Clinton, the Balanced Budget Act of 1997. When we looked at \nhow we could sustain a balanced budget, we had to go to where the \ngrowth was in the budget. The big programs were Medicaid and Medicare, \nthe entitlements. Eventually, those two programs will cost the \nequivalent of the entire Federal budget today in 20 or 30 years. If we \nwant to balance the budget, we have to slow down entitlement growth.\n\n  Medicare is one of those programs that have grown dramatically. When \nit first came about, it was a $4 billion safety net. They projected \nthat Medicare would cost $37 billion in 1990. It was like $90-something \nbillion. It is $400 billion today. Those who designed the Medicare \nProgram as a safety net for senior citizens without health care did a \ngood thing, but from then until now, it has become a $400 billion item \nthat is eating up the entire budget.\n  In 1997, we recalculated the growth rates to be paid to doctors and \nhospitals. Since then, doctors and hospitals have been saying that we \ncut reimbursements to the point that they can't take Medicare and \nMedicaid patients and it is hurting their ability to stay in business. \nAbout 60 percent of their income comes from the Federal Government. I \ndon't doubt that is true. What we did is just nickel and dime doctors \nand hospitals and never reform Medicare.\n  So Senator Lieberman is right. To help doctors and hospitals and the\n\n[[Page S10607]]\n\ncountry achieve a balanced budget, we will have to fundamentally reform \nMedicare, and the doctor fix should be part of that effort.\n  What we are doing here is making a promise we can't afford to pay. We \nare going to tell the doctors: Don't worry ever again about Medicare \nreimbursements being cut because for a 10-year period, we are going to \nhold you harmless.\n  That is beyond cynical. We need to look at the doctor fix in terms of \ncomprehensive Medicare reform. It is a $245 billion item designed to \nget the medical community to support the leadership version of health \ncare. It is transparent. It is wrong. It is bad politics. It is bad \npolicy. I hope my colleagues will reject it.\n  The bill coming out of the Finance Committee--and I congratulate \nSenators who are trying to fix health care because it needs to be \nfixed--is about an $800 billion expenditure, a little bit more. It is \nrevenue neutral over a 10-year period because it is going to be paid \nfor. Four hundred billion in Medicare cuts are part of the payoff, the \npay-fors.\n  How do we take $800 billion of expense and make it revenue neutral? \nWe offset it. One of the offsets is a $400 billion-plus reduction in \nMedicare spending over a 10-year window. I argue that not only is that \nnot going to happen because the Congress hasn't reduced Medicare \nspending anywhere near that, it is just politically not going to \nhappen. Two years ago, we tried to slow down the growth of Medicare to \n$33.8 billion over a 4- or 5-year period and got 24 votes. If \ncolleagues think this Congress is going to have the political will and \ncourage to reduce Medicare by $400 billion over 10 years, show me in \nthe past where we have had any desire to do that.\n  The doctors fix is the best evidence yet of what will come in the \nfuture. We are contemplating doing away with the reduction in physician \npayments that was part of the balanced budget agreement because our \nmedical community has been hit hard and is complaining. Look at the \n$400 billion. Do we think if people are going to be on the receiving \nand of a $400 billion cut over a period of time, they are going to \naccept it happily? Do you think they are not going to complain? What do \nyou think we are going to do when one group of the medical community or \nthe insurance community says, ``You are putting me out of business.''\n\n  These $400 billion cuts are never going to happen because, you see, \nwith the doctors fix, where every year we relieve the doctors from the \nimposition of that agreement in 1997--and in many ways we should \nbecause the 1997 agreement was not comprehensive--but to those who \nbelieve we are going to cut $400 billion in Medicare, have the courage \nto tell the doctors we are going to do to them what we said we would do \nback in 1997. Nobody wants to do that, and I am sympathetic as to why \nwe do not want to do that because we are asking too much of doctors and \nhospitals and we did not reform the system as a whole.\n  Mr. President, $245 billion added to the debt is no small thing. What \nI hope will happen is we can find a bipartisan pathway forward on \nhealth care reform that deals with inflation, deals with better access \nto preventive medicine, has some medical liability reform, is truly \ncomprehensive, with give-and-take, and mandates coverage. I am willing \nto do that as a Republican. But if we go down the road our leadership \nhas set for us here and basically tell the doctors ``Don't worry \nanymore, you are going to be held harmless for the next 10 years,'' \nthen what group will follow who will want the same deal and to whom \nwill we begin to say no? I do not know. I do not know to whom we will \nhave the ability to say no if we do this. And if you say no to them, \nwhat the heck do you tell them--``You are not a doctor, so it does not \nmatter what we do to your business.''\n  If we do this, we have lost the ability, in my view, to provide the \nnecessary solutions to the hard problems facing the country. We will \nhave given in to the most cynical nature of politics. We will have \ndestroyed our ability to engage with the public at large in a credible \nway to fix hard problems. And when it comes time to ask people to \nsacrifice, they are going to look at us and say: What do you mean \n``sacrifice?'' Aren't you the people who just basically wiped out what \nthe doctors had to do because you were afraid of them?\n  I am not afraid of doctors. God bless them. I am glad we have them. \nWhat we have done in the name of reform has been unfair because we \npicked on them and not the system as a whole. So to the doctors out \nthere, Lindsey Graham gets it, that your reimbursement rates as they \nexist today under Medicare make it very difficult for you to do \nbusiness. But I hope you will understand that my obligation is beyond \njust to the doctors in South Carolina; it is to what Senator Lieberman \nsaid: the next generation as well as to the here and now.\n  Every politician has a problem: How do you affect the here and now, \npeople who can vote for you, and how can you secure the future? Well, \nyou just have to ask the people who are here and now to be willing to \nmake some changes for the benefit of the country long term. I am \nconfident that if we ask and we do it in a smart way, people will join \nwith us. I want to give the doctors better reimbursement rates, and the \nonly way we can achieve that is to reform Medicare from top to bottom \nand make it more efficient.\n  One of the things I am willing to do is ask a person like myself to \npay more. As a Senator, I make about $170,000 a year. I am not saying \nwe are worth it, but that is what we pay ourselves. I would like to \nthink we earn our money because it is not an easy job, but there are a \nlot of jobs harder than being a Senator, I can assure you. But right \nnow, the system we have to fund Medicare, the trust fund, will run out \nof money in about 4 years. But basically I am paying the same amount \nfor Part B premiums that cover doctors and hospital payments out of \nMedicare as my aunt and uncle who worked in the textile mill and made \n$25,000 a year. I am willing for people like myself to have to pay more \nto keep Medicare solvent.\n  We are making some changes but not nearly enough. Mr. President, $3 \nout of $4 of Medicare spending comes from the General Treasury, the \ntaxpayers. One-fourth of the money to cover Medicare expenses comes \nfrom the patient population being served. There are plenty of Americans \nwho are paying about $100 a month once they get into retirement who can \nafford to pay $450 a month for the Medicare services they receive. \nNobody is asking them to do it. I am willing to ask, and I am willing \nto do it myself. It is those types of changes that will lead this \ncountry to a brighter future and will correct the imbalance we have.\n  Finally, Medicare is $34 trillion underfunded. If you had $34 \ntrillion sitting in an account today, it would earn interest over 75 \nyears. You would need all the money--the $34 trillion plus the \ninterest--to make the payments we have promised people in the future.\n  When I was born in 1955, there were 16 workers for every retiree. \nToday there are three, and in 20 years there will be two. There will be \ntwo workers paying into the Social Security and Medicare trust funds \nwhere there used to be 16 when I was born. There are more baby boomers \nretiring every day than anyone ever anticipated. We are living far \nbeyond 65.\n  The question for the country is, Will people in my business go to \nyou, the public, and say change is required? We cannot run the system \nassuming things that do not exist. We have to come to grips with the \nfact that we have an aging population, we live longer, there are more \nretirees than ever, and there are fewer workers. Once we come to grips \nwith that dynamic and ask those who can afford to give, to give--hold \nthose harmless who cannot afford to give--America's best days are \nahead.\n  If we do not reform these systems and we continue to do what is being \nproposed today--try to buy a constituency off: Doctors, we will fix \nyour problem if you will support our bill; the $254 billion it will \ncost to get you onboard, do not worry about it.\n  To the doctors who may be listening, you better worry about it. You \nneed to worry about not only the viability of your medical practice but \nthe ability of your government to make payments it has promised to the \nnext generation, the ability of your government to be able to continue \nto operate, the ability of our country to pass on to the next \ngeneration a sound and secure America.\n\n[[Page S10608]]\n\n  We are about to borrow ourselves into oblivion. There is a theory out \nthere, long held, that democracies are doomed to fail because \ndemocracies over time will lose the ability to say no to themselves; \nthat we in the government will continue to grow the government based on \nthe needs of the next election cycle and make promises that make sense \nfor our political future but really over time are unsustainable. We \nhave reached that point, and we are about to go over the edge.\n  The only way America can self-correct is to make sure our political \nleadership is rewarded when we ask for change we can believe in. This \nis not change we can believe in. This is the old way of doing business. \nThis is buying off a constituency that is important for the here-and-\nnow debate of health care and not giving a damn about the consequences \nto the country down the road. This is how we got in this mess.\n  If we pass this bill, not only have we destroyed this new hope from a \nnew President of ``change we can believe in,'' we will have reinforced \nthe worst instincts of politics, sold the country short, and made it \nimpossible to say no to the next group we want to sacrifice who needs \nto help us solve this problem.\n  With that, I yield back.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Medicare Physician Payment System Reform\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, reforming the Medicare physician payment \nsystem is one of the most difficult issues we face in Medicare today. \nThe name of the formula is the sustainable growth rate. Generally \naround here we refer to that as the SGR. It is the formula for the \nreimbursement of doctors under Medicare. It was designed in the first \ninstance to control physician spending and to determine annual \nphysician payment updates by means of a targeted growth rate system. \nThe SGR is not the only problem with the Medicare physician payment \nsystem. Everyone who knows anything about physician payments and \nMedicare knows that this SGR formula is not working. It is a fee-for-\nservice system that rewards volume instead of quality or value. This \nmeans that Medicare simply pays more and more as more and more \nprocedures and tests and services are provided to patients. Providers \nwho offer higher quality care at a lower cost get paid less. Somehow, \nit is a backward system, a perverse system. It is one of the driving \nforces behind rising costs and overutilization of health care, \nparticularly in some parts of the United States.\n  In addition, the sustainable growth rate formula itself is flawed. \nThe SGR is designed to determine annual physician payment updates by \ncomparing actual expenditures to expenditure targets.\n  The purpose of the SGR was to put a brake on runaway Medicare \nspending. The SGR was intended to reduce physician payment updates when \nspending exceeded growth targets. In recent years, Medicare physician \nspending has exceeded those SGR spending targets. That has resulted, \nnaturally, in physician payments being cut. As the magnitude of these \npayment cuts has increased over time, Congress has stepped in to avert \nthese scheduled cuts in reimbursement to doctors.\n  In a roundabout way, the SGR has been serving its purpose. Numerous \nimprovements in Medicare payments in other areas have been implemented \nover the years to offset or to pay for the various so-called doc fixes \nwe have had to do and generally do them on an annual basis. Presently \nthey are done on an 18-month basis, expiring December 31 this year.\n  We should, in fact, be reforming physician payments. That is why I \nsupported the SGR amendments offered by my colleague, the Senator from \nTexas, during the Senate Finance Committee markup that concluded 8 days \nago. Those amendments would have provided a fully offset, positive \nphysician update for the next 2 years. And if we erroneously take up a \ndebate on this flawed Stabenow bill, I will have an alternative to \noffer with my good friend, the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, \nSenator Conrad. A Conrad-Grassley amendment would be a bipartisan \napproach to this.\n  Realigning incentives in the Medicare Program and paying for quality \nrather than quantity of services is, of course, an essential part of \nphysician payment reform. But as fundamentally flawed as the physician \npayment system is, S. 1776, the bill before us, is just as \nfundamentally flawed. S. 1776 would add--can my colleagues believe \nthis--a $\\1/4\\ trillion cost to the national debt. A quarter of a \ntrillion, obviously, is $250 billion. But worse yet, it does not fix \nthe problems we have with the physician payment system. It simply gives \na permanent freeze to those payments. The American Association of \nNeurological Surgeons and the Congress of Neurological Surgeons oppose \nthe Stabenow bill for precisely that reason, and I applaud them for \nhaving the courage to say so.\n  My esteemed colleague, the majority leader, claims this bill has \nnothing to do with health reform. I think it has everything to do with \nhealth reform. He says the $247 billion cost of this bill is just \ncorrecting, in his words, ``payment discrepancy;'' merely, in his \nwords, ``a budgetary problem,'' a problem that needs to be fixed. But I \ndon't believe anybody is going to buy that argument, not even the \nWashington Post. I have here a recent editorial. They said:\n\n       $247 billion . . . is one whopper of a discrepancy.\n\n  S. 1776 isn't being offered to fix a budget payment discrepancy, it \nis being offered as one whopper of a backroom deal to enlist the \nsupport of the American Medical Association for a massive health reform \nbill that is being written behind closed doors.\n  Nobody is being fooled about what is going on in this body, the most \ndeliberative body in the world, the Senate.\n  When President Obama spoke to a joint session of Congress last \nmonth--the week after we came back from our summer break--he made a \ncommitment to not add one dime to the deficit now or in the future. \nThose are his words, not mine. But as this Washington Post editorial \nnotes, S. 1776 would add 2.47 trillion dimes to the deficit.\n  We go to chart 2 now. That would be 2.47 trillion dimes, enough to \nfill the Capitol Rotunda 23 times.\n  Now we have chart 3. I wholeheartedly agree with the editorial's \nconclusion. The Post editorial said:\n\n       A president who says that he is serious about dealing with \n     the dire fiscal picture cannot credibly begin by charging \n     this one to the national credit card . . .\n\n  This quote is highlighted out of that same editorial.\n  The Office of Management and Budget and the Treasury Department \nannounced that the fiscal year 2009 deficit hit a record of $1.4 \ntrillion. According to the Government Accountability Office, public \ndebt is projected by the year 2019 to surpass the record that was set \nin 1946, 1 year after the end of World War II. That debt was \nattributable to the war, which was the war to save the world for \ndemocracies because of the dictatorial governments of Italy, Germany, \nand Japan, as we recall from history.\n  There is no doubt that fixing the flawed physician payment system is \nsomething that must be addressed. But the problem--this problem--with \nthe physician payments is one of the biggest problems in health care \nthat needs fixing. But at a time when the budget deficit has reached an \nalltime high of $1.4 trillion, this situation demands fiscal \ndiscipline.\n  As the Washington Post has correctly pointed out, S. 1776 is, indeed, \na test of the President's pledge to pay for health care reform.\n  Repealing the SGR without any offsets, as S. 1776 would do, is a \nflagrant attempt to try and hide the true cost of comprehensive health \ncare reform.\n  Let me suggest to the American people that bill, comprehensive health \ncare reform--at least the one that came out of the Senate Finance \nCommittee--is thick, at 1,502 pages that we all are committed to \nreading before it goes to the floor. That bill, of course,\n\n[[Page S10609]]\n\nwill not go to the floor because now it is being merged in secrecy with \nthe Senate HELP Committee bill, and so it may come out thicker. Who \nknows. We are talking about a great deal of cost connected with that \nand the SGR fix being connected with that as well.\n  We have in the Senate Finance Committee bill, that was reported out, \nsignificant payment system reform. That bill takes savings of almost \n$\\1/2\\ trillion to fund a new entitlement program outside Medicare. The \npriority for Medicare savings should be fixing Medicare problems, and \nthe physician payment issue and the SGR is the biggest payment system \nproblem in Medicare today. It should get fixed in health care reform \nwith those Medicare savings.\n  I must, therefore, object not to fixing the SGR and improving the \nsystem for physician payments--which clearly must be done--but to this \nvery flawed bill. It is only a permanent payment freeze. It does not \nfix the problem. It is not paid for. It should be a part of health care \nreform. It adds $\\1/4\\ trillion to the deficit. It is one whopper of a \ndiscrepancy. It is not credible.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose cloture on this train wreck of a bill.\n  I yield the floor and, since I do not see any of my colleagues \nwaiting to speak, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate will finally consider the \nnomination of Roberto A. Lange to the District of South Dakota. It has \nbeen 3 weeks since Mr. Lange's nomination was unanimously reported by \nthe Judiciary Committee to the Senate. It should not take 3 weeks to \nconfirm a consensus nominee. I will be interested to hear from Senate \nRepublicans who have stalled this confirmation for the last 3 weeks why \nthey did so.\n  There are 10 other judicial nominations reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee to the Senate that remain pending without consent \nfrom Senate Republicans to proceed to their consideration. These are 10 \nother judicial nominations on the Senate Executive Calendar awaiting \naction and being stalled by Republican holds. All 10 were reported \nfavorably by the Senate Judiciary Committee. Two were reported in June \nand have been waiting for more than 4 months for Senate consideration. \nThese are things that we have always done by voice vote when there is \nno controversy.\n  It is not only a dark mark on the Senate for holding us up from doing \nour work, but it means that the nominees have their lives on hold. They \nhave been given this nomination, and everything has to come to a stop. \nThey know they are going to be confirmed. They know that whenever the \nRepublicans allow a vote, it will be virtually unanimous. It makes the \nSenate look foolish, and I wish my colleagues would allow these people \nto move quickly.\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary reported that its peer review of the President's nomination \nof Mr. Lange resulted in the highest rating possible, a unanimous \nrating of well qualified. His nomination has the support of both home \nState Senators, Senator Johnson, a Democrat, and Senator Thune, a \nRepublican, and was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by \nunanimous consent on October 1. I expect the vote on the President's \nnomination of Mr. Lange to be overwhelmingly in favor, as was the 99-0 \nvote for the only other district court confirmation so far this year, \nthat of Judge Viken. I will be listening intently to hear why then \nSenate Republicans--despite the support of Senator Thune, the head of \nthe Republican Policy Committee and a member of the Senate Republican \nleadership--have stalled this confirmation needlessly for 3 weeks.\n  This is one of the 13 judicial nominations reported favorably by the \ncommittee to the Senate since June to fill circuit and district court \nvacancies on Federal courts around the country. Ten of those \nnominations were reported without a single dissenting voice. This is \nunfortunately only the third of those judicial nominations to be \nconsidered all year.\n  It is October 21. By this date in the administration of George W. \nBush, we had confirmed eight lower court judges. By this juncture in \nthe administration of Bill Clinton, we had likewise confirmed eight \ncircuit and district court nominations. The Senate has confirmed just \nthree circuit and district court nominees this year less than half of \nthose considered by this date during President Bush's tumultuous first \nyear in office and confirmed by this date during President Clinton's \nfirst year. This is despite the fact that President Obama sent nominees \nwith bipartisan support to the Senate two months earlier than did \nPresident Bush. Moreover, President Clinton's term also began with the \nneed to fill a Supreme Court vacancy.\n  The first of these circuit and district court confirmations this year \ndid not take place until September 17, months after the nomination of \nJudge Gerard Lynch had been reported out of committee with no dissent. \nFinally, after months of needless delay, the Senate confirmed Judge \nLynch to serve on the Second Circuit by an overwhelming vote of 94 to \n3. That filled just one of the five vacancies this year on the Second \nCircuit. The Second Circuit bench remains nearly one-quarter empty with \nfour vacancies on its 13-member bench.\n  Judge Viken, the first of just two district court judges the Senate \nhas been allowed to vote on this year, was confirmed on September 29, \nby a unanimous 99-0 vote. Today, the Senate is finally being allowed by \nRepublicans to vote to confirm Roberto Lange, who was reported by the \ncommittee on October 1. It took 3 weeks to proceed to Mr. Lange's \nnomination despite the fact that he, like Judge Viken, had the support \nof both his home State Senators, one a respected Democratic Senator and \nthe other a Republican Senator who is a member of the Republican Senate \nleadership.\n  South Dakota has had its two vacancies filled this year but vacancies \nin 35 other States remain unfilled and the Senate's constitutional \nresponsibilities are going unfulfilled. There was--there is--no reason \nfor the Republican minority to impose these unnecessary and needless \ndelays to judicial confirmations. When will Senate Republicans allow \nthe Senate to consider the nominations of Judge Hamilton to the Seventh \nCircuit, Judge Davis to the Fourth Circuit, Judge Martin to the \nEleventh Circuit, Judge Greenaway to the Third Circuit, Judge Berger to \nthe Southern District of West Virginia, Judge Honeywell to the Middle \nDistrict of Florida, Judge Nguyen to the Central District of \nCalifornia, Judge Chen to the Northern District of California, Ms. Gee \nto the Central District of California and Judge Seeborg to the Northern \nDistrict of California?\n  In a recent column, Professor Carl Tobias wrote:\n\n       President Obama has implemented several measures that \n     should foster prompt appointments. First, he practiced \n     bipartisanship to halt the detrimental cycle of accusations, \n     countercharges and non-stop paybacks. Moreover, the White \n     House has promoted consultation by seeking advice on \n     designees from Democratic and GOP Senate members, especially \n     home state senators, before official nominations. Obama has \n     also submitted consensus nominees, who have even temperaments \n     and are very smart, ethical, diligent and independent.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of Professor Tobias's column be \nprinted in the Record following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. When I served as chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee during President Bush's first term, I did my best to stop the \ndownward spiral that had affected judicial confirmations. Throughout my \nchairmanship I made sure to treat President Bush's judicial nominees \nbetter than the Republicans had treated President Clinton's. During the \n17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee during President Bush's \nfirst term, we confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees. At the end of \nhis Presidency, although Republicans had chaired the Judiciary \nCommittee for more than half his tenure, more of his judicial nominees \nwere confirmed when I was the chairman than in the more than 4 years \nwhen Republicans were in charge.\n  In spite of President Obama's efforts, however, Senate Republicans \nbegan\n\n[[Page S10610]]\n\nthis year threatening to filibuster every judicial nominee of the new \nPresident. They have followed through by dragging out, delaying, \nobstructing and stalling the process. The result is that 10 months into \nPresident's Obama's first term, the Senate has confirmed only three of \nhis nominations for circuit and district courts while judicial \nvacancies skyrocket around the country. The delays in considering \njudicial nominations pose a serious problem in light of the alarming \nspike in judicial vacancies on our Federal courts.\n  There are now 96 vacancies on Federal circuit and district courts and \nanother 24 future vacancies already announced. These vacancies are at \nnear record levels. Justice should not be delayed or denied to any \nAmerican because of overburdened courts. We can do better. The American \npeople deserve better.\n  Professor Tobias' observations about the Second Circuit hold true \nthroughout the country and with respect to this President's efforts to \nwork cooperatively with respect to judicial nominations. President \nObama made his first judicial nomination, that of Judge David Hamilton \nto the Seventh Circuit, in March, but it has been stalled on the \nExecutive calendar since early June, despite the support of the senior \nRepublican in the Senate, Senator Lugar. The nomination of Judge Andre \nDavis to the Fourth Circuit was reported by the committee on June 4 by \na vote of 16 to 3, but has yet to be considered by the Senate. The \nnomination of Judge Beverly Baldwin Martin to the Eleventh Circuit has \nthe support of both of Georgia's Senators, both Republicans, and was \nreported unanimously from the committee by voice vote on September 10 \nbut has yet to be considered or scheduled for consideration by the \nSenate. The nomination of Joseph Greenaway to the Third Circuit has the \nsupport of both Pennsylvania Senators, and was reported unanimously \nfrom the committee by voice vote on October 1, but has yet to be \nconsidered or scheduled for consideration by the Senate. All of these \nnominees are well-respected judges. All will be confirmed, I believe, \nif only Republicans would consent to their consideration by the Senate. \nInstead, the President's good efforts are being snubbed and these \nnominees stalled for no good purpose.\n  President Obama has been criticized by some for being too solicitous \nof Senate Republicans. As Wade Henderson, the executive director of the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights, said to The Washington Post \nrecently: ``I commend the President's effort to change the tone in \nWashington. I recognize that he is extending an olive branch to \nRepublicans on the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate overall. But \nso far, his efforts at reconciliation have been met with partisan \nhostility.'' As usual, Wade has it right. The efforts the President has \nmade have not been reciprocated.\n  The Senate can and must do a better job of restoring our tradition of \nregularly considering qualified, noncontroversial nominees to fill \nvacancies on the Federal bench without needless and harmful delays. \nThis is a tradition followed with Republican Presidents and Democratic \nPresidents. We should not have to overcome filibusters and spend months \nseeking time agreements to consider consensus nominees.\n  In addition, four nominations to be Assistant Attorneys General at \nthe Department of Justice remain on the Executive calendar, three of \nthem for many months. Republican Senators have also prevented us from \nmoving to consider the nomination of respected Federal Judge William \nSessions of Vermont to be Chairman of the United States Sentencing \nCommission for over 5 months, even though he was twice confirmed as a \nmember of that Commission. The majority leader has been forced to file \na cloture motion in order to end the obstruction of that nomination.\n  Four out of a total of 11 divisions at the Department of Justice \nremain without Senate-confirmed Presidential nominees because of \nRepublican holds and delays--the Office of Legal Counsel, the Tax \nDivision, the Office of Legal Policy, and the Environment and Natural \nResources Division. Earlier this month, with the hard work of Senator \nCardin, we were finally able to move forward to confirm Tom Perez to \nhead the Civil Rights Division at the Justice Department. His \nnomination was stalled for 4 months, despite the fact that he was \napproved 17 to 2 by the Judiciary Committee. At the last minute, Senate \nRepublicans abandoned an ill-fated effort to filibuster the nomination \nand asked that the cloture vote be vitiated. He was finally confirmed \nwith more than 70 votes in the Senate.\n  During the 17 months I chaired the Judiciary Committee during \nPresident Bush's first term, we confirmed 100 of his judicial nominees \nand 185 of his executive nominees referred to the Judiciary Committee. \nAnd yet 10 months into President's Obama's first term, we have \nconfirmed only 2 of his nominations for circuit and district courts and \n40 of the executive nominees that have come through our committee.\n  I hope that, instead of withholding consents and filibustering \nPresident Obama's nominees, the other side of the aisle will join us in \ntreating them fairly. We should not have to fight for months to \nschedule consideration of the President's judicial nominations and \nnomination for critical posts in the executive branch.\n  I look forward to congratulating Mr. Lange and his family on his \nconfirmation today. I commend Senator Johnson for his steadfastness in \nmaking sure his State is well served.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n  Commentary: Second Circuit Appeals Court Openings Need To Be Filled\n\n                            (By Carl Tobias)\n\n       The country's attention was recently focused on the Senate \n     confirmation vote for U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals \n     Judge Sonia Sotomayor, President Barack Obama's initial \n     Supreme Court nominee and judicial appointment. This emphasis \n     was proper because the tribunal is the highest court in the \n     nation and decides appeals involving fundamental \n     constitutional rights.\n       Nonetheless, the same day that Justice Sotomayor received \n     appointment, Second Circuit Judge Robert Sack assumed senior \n     status, a type of semi-retirement, thereby joining his \n     colleague, Guido Calabresi, who had previously taken senior \n     status. Moreover, on Oct. 10, Judge Barrington Parker also \n     assumed senior status. These developments mean that the \n     Second Circuit will have vacancies in four of its thirteen \n     authorized judgeships.\n       Operating without nearly 25 percent of the tribunal's \n     judicial complement will frustrate expeditious, inexpensive \n     and equitable disposition of appeals. Thus, President Obama \n     should promptly nominate, and the Senate must swiftly \n     confirm, outstanding judges to all four openings.\n       The numerous vacancies can erode the delivery of justice by \n     the Second Circuit, which is the court of last resort for all \n     but one percent of appeals taken from Connecticut, New York \n     and Vermont. The tribunal resolves more critical business \n     disputes than any of the 12 regional circuits and decides \n     very controversial issues relating to questions, such as free \n     speech, property rights and terrorism.\n       Among the appellate courts, the Second Circuit needs more \n     time to conclude appeals than all except one, which is a \n     useful yardstick of appellate justice. The August loss of two \n     active judges and the October loss of a third will exacerbate \n     the circumstances, especially by additionally slowing the \n     resolution of cases that are essential to the country's \n     economy.\n       There are several reasons why the tribunal lacks almost one \n     quarter of its members. Judge Chester Straub took senior \n     status in July 2008, and President George W. Bush nominated \n     Southern District of New York Judge Loretta Preska on Sept. 9 \n     after minimally consulting New York's Democratic Senators \n     Charles Schumer and Hillary Clinton. September was too late \n     in a presidential election year for an appointment, and the \n     110th Senate adjourned without affording the nominee a \n     hearing.\n       Moreover, President Obama has nominated no one for the \n     Calabresi or Sack opening, although both jurists announced \n     that they intended to take senior status last March. In \n     fairness, Judge Calabresi did not actually assume senior \n     status until late July, while Judge Sack only took senior \n     status and Justice Sotomayor was confirmed in August.\n       President Obama has implemented several measures that \n     should foster prompt appointments. First, he practiced \n     bipartisanship to halt the detrimental cycle of accusations, \n     countercharges and non-stop paybacks. Moreover, the White \n     House has promoted consultation by seeking advice on \n     designees from Democratic and GOP Senate members, especially \n     home state senators, before official nominations. Obama has \n     also submitted consensus nominees, who have even temperaments \n     and are very smart, ethical, diligent and independent. The \n     Executive has worked closely with Senator Patrick Leahy (D-\n     Vt.), the Judiciary Committee chair, who schedules hearings \n     and votes, and Senator Harry Reid (D-Nev.), the Majority \n     Leader, who arranges floor debates and votes, and\n\n[[Page S10611]]\n\n     their GOP counterparts to facilitate confirmations.\n       Emblematic is the President's nomination of U.S. District \n     Judge Gerard Lynch, who served with distinction on the U.S. \n     District Court for the Southern District of New York since \n     2000. New York Democratic Senators Schumer and Kirsten \n     Gillibrand expeditiously suggested the superb trial judge to \n     Obama, who nominated Lynch on April 2. By mid-May, the panel \n     conducted Lynch's confirmation hearing, and on June 11, the \n     committee approved Lynch. In mid-September, the Senate \n     confirmed Lynch on a 94-3 vote.\n       Senator Schumer's Sept. 9 announcement that he had \n     recommended District Judge Denny Chin to the White House and \n     the jurist's Oct. 6 nomination are precisely the correct \n     approaches. The New York and Connecticut senators must \n     continue suggesting excellent candidates for the three Second \n     Circuit openings which remain. Obama must swiftly consider \n     their proposals and nominate outstanding prospects. The \n     Judiciary Committee should promptly afford hearings and \n     votes, while the Majority Leader ought to expeditiously \n     schedule floor debates and votes.\n       Judge Sotomayor's Supreme Court elevation, the assumption \n     of senior status by Judges Calabresi, Parker and Sack and \n     Judge Lynch's recent Senate confirmation mean there are four \n     openings in the Second Circuit's thirteen judgeships. \n     President Obama should cooperate with the Senate to quickly \n     fill the vacancies with superior judges, so that the tribunal \n     can deliver appellate justice.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that my further \nremarks be charged against my time in connection with this nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Leahy are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I wish to briefly make a few comments \nabout the confirmation vote we will soon be having on supporting this \nnominee. I saw him, as a member of the Judiciary Committee, and we made \ninquiry of him. I liked him. He handled himself well.\n  He has been a strong and ardent Democrat all his life--an active \nDemocrat. He was educated, I believe, at the University of South Dakota \nand has practiced law a long time there. I think he has the ability and \nthe commitment--he said he did and I believe him--not to allow his \npolitics to influence his decisionmaking once he puts on that robe; \nthat he will be objective and fair; that he will comply with the oath a \njudge takes to be impartial; that he will provide equal justice for the \npoor and the rich; and that he will serve the laws of the United States \nunder the Constitution. So we moved him forward, and I am glad he will \nbe confirmed.\n  I will note that some nominees I will not be able to support, and I \nwould expect some others may object as well. It is our responsibility \nto be careful and to be cautious in making decisions about judges \nbecause they are given a lifetime appointment. They can't be removed \nfor bad decisionmaking. I believe the President has submitted two more \nnominees to the district bench. There are 74 vacancies in the Federal \ncourts in America as of today. A few days ago, there were 9 nominations \npending--this is 1 of them--and now there are 11 nominations, I \nunderstand, pending.\n  As the President gets his machine up and running and starts \nsubmitting nominees, I think we will have good hearings. My view is \nthat if they are qualified, it doesn't make any difference to me if \nthey are an active, partisan, campaigning Democrat. That is fine. The \nquestion simply is, once they put on the robe and they are required to \ndecide cases, can they put aside their personal feelings, backgrounds, \nemotions, and partisanship? Most judges can.\n  I practiced in Alabama, where judges run on a party ticket. They run \nas Republicans and Democrats. Everybody knows which of them--very few--\ncarry those biases with them.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair, and I urge my colleagues to support \nthe nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The question is, \nWill the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Roberto A. \nLange, of South Dakota, to be United States District Judge for the \nDistrict of South Dakota?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am going to take a moment of my \nleader time. Americans are increasingly alarmed by the expansion of our \nnational debt and this spending binge we are putting on the national \ncredit card. They are asking us to do what they have been doing. They \nwant us to take out our scissors and cut the credit card. They want us \nto live within our means so their children and their grandchildren do \nnot wake up in the morning to find the American dream buried under an \navalanche of debt.\n  Our fiscal situation has simply spiraled out of control. Yet the \nproponents of this measure want to put another quarter of a trillion \ndollars on the Federal credit card. Republicans offered a series of \nfiscally responsible ways to prevent pay cuts to our physicians. That \nwas not agreed to.\n  Let me remind everybody, we are in very dangerous territory. I am \ngoing to vote against this deficit-expanding bill because enough is \nenough. I hope, on a bipartisan basis, we will send a message to the \nAmerican people that we do not intend to charge from $\\1/4\\ trillion to \n$300 billion on the nation's credit card by approving this measure.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have been aware of the fact that because \nof activities and actions of the Republican-dominated Washington for a \nnumber of years, that the doctors who take Medicare patients have been \nhammered so hard that not all doctors take Medicare patients.\n  We want senior citizens, Medicare recipients, to be able to go a \ndoctor. We do not want all of those folks going to Medicare Advantage. \nWe want Medicare to survive as a program.\n  Because people who ran this town for a number of years did not like \nSocial Security, tried to privatize that, did\n\n[[Page S10612]]\n\neverything they could to minimize and denigrate Medicare, we are now at \na point where we have, in the bill that has been reported out of the \nFinance Committee, a 1-year fix for the senior citizens, so that \nphysicians will not be dropping Medicare patients. Then all of the \nphysicians should know that we march to this position we are in now.\n  We were told by the American Medical Association and others that we \nwould get help from the Republicans to take care of senior citizens so \nthat they would have doctors to take care of them. It is very \ninteresting. One of the sponsors of this legislation, one of the \nRepublican leaders, is not supporting the legislation. How do you like \nthat? This is another effort of Republicans to slow down, divert, and \nstop what we are trying to do with health care and based on everything \nelse.\n  I just finished a meeting over here with my chairmen. We lamented the \nfact of how things have changed in this town, how in this new \nadministration we have had to file cloture on a significant number of \noccasions to get people who have jobs in this administration approved \nin the Senate. During the Bush first year, during this same period of \ntime, not a single nomination he requested had to be clotured; that is, \nto end a filibuster. We have numerous people to get approved.\n  We have essential legislation, such as legislation that deals with \ngiving people who are out of work unemployment benefits. It is not a \ngift. They pay into that fund or they thought it wasn't a gift.\n  I want everyone to know we are going to take care of Medicare. If the \nRepublicans in the Senate don't want to do it the way we have done it \nin the past by doing the doctors fix, then when we finish the health \ncare legislation, we will come back and take care of a multiple-year \nfix for the doctors and senior citizens.\n  I want everyone within the sound of my voice to understand that \nWashington is being driven by a small number of people on this side of \nthe aisle who are preventing us from doing things that help the \nAmerican people. We are not trying to run over people with the 60 votes \nwe have. We want to work with people. We want to get along. I think it \nis really too bad that suddenly they have got religion. They never \nworried in the past about all the tax cuts being paid for. They never \nworried about drug manufacturers getting all the free stuff they got. \nThey never worried about any of this. They now are suddenly being very \nfrugal when they find it is a way they can slow down what we do here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, if I might just add to what our \ndistinguished leader has said and thank him for bringing this vote to \nus. This is about strengthening and protecting Medicare.\n  The distinguished Republican leader is right: Enough is enough--\nenough of running physicians up to the brink every year, not knowing \nwhat is going to happen; enough for seniors not knowing whether they \nwill be able to continue to see their doctors. Seven different times we \nhave brought them up to the brink and then not made the cut and have \nmany times not paid for it. This legislation will wipe the slate clean \nand will for the first time bring honest budgeting to Medicare.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am proud to be a cosponsor of the bill we \nare considering today, the Medicare Physician Fairness Act, introduced \nby Senator Stabenow. This bill would permanently end the scheduled \nreductions in Medicare and TRICARE payments that physicians face each \nyear. This legislation is long overdue and an important step in making \nsure doctors will continue to serve Medicare patients and veterans in \nthe years to come.\n  This year marks the 8th year in a row that Congress will be forced to \nprevent scheduled physician payment cuts under the Medicare Program. \nThe scheduled cuts are based on a flawed formula, which cuts physician \npayments in the future if physician spending exceeds a target based on \nthe growth of the economy. Because the scheduled cuts are cumulative, \nnext year we could expect to see a 21-percent reduction in physician \npayments and a cumulative 40-percent cut scheduled by 2016. It is no \nwonder Congress has consistently acted to prevent these cuts and \nexperts have called for a repeal of this broken formula.\n  Without passing this bill and permanently ending the schedule of \nphysician payment cuts, doctors will continue to struggle to budget for \nthe future without knowing with absolute certainty that Congress will \nact to prevent payment reductions. The uncertainty in payment rates has \nalready resulted in many physicians declining to accept Medicare making \nit hard for beneficiaries to find a doctor. In rural States like \nVermont, finding a doctor is challenging enough without looming payment \ncuts affecting doctors every year. In addition to seniors, the more \nthan 12,000 Vermont veterans and military personnel who participate in \nTRICARE will continue to feel their benefits are at risk so long as \nthis flawed formula threatens payment reductions to their doctors.\n  Some have argued that we cannot afford to make such an expensive fix \nto our health care system. I disagree. The President already assumed \nCongress will fix the payment cuts over the next 10 years in his budget \nproposal. We all know that without a permanent fix Congress will \ncontinue to act to prevent these debilitating cuts in payment rates to \ndoctors. The administration's budget gives a realistic estimate of \nprojected Medicare spending. Passing a permanent fix will allow us to \nhave accurate estimates of Medicare spending, a first step toward truly \nreforming the physician payment system to one that is based on quality \nand performance and not on arbitrary formulas.\n  This legislation is an important step toward making changes in the \nMedicare and TRICARE physician payment structure that will help our \nentire health care system. I regret that some misplaced partisan point-\nscoring threatens to prevent us from considering a bill we should have \npassed long ago. I hope we can proceed to this bill and pass it swiftly \nso we can begin our work toward improving our overall health care \nsystem.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, an old Chinese proverb says:\n  ``If you do not pay the doctor who cured you, beware of falling ill \nagain.''\n  We are here today because we need to fix the way that we pay the \ndoctors who cure us.\n  The way that we pay for health care today contributes to spiraling \nhealth care costs. It contributes to quality-of-care that is not as \ngood as it should be.\n  Today's payment system rewards providers for the quantity, not the \nquality, of the services that they provide.\n  Commonsense health reform must restructure the way that we pay for \nhealth care.\n  Because of its size and purchasing power, Medicare can lead the way. \nBut payment reforms won't be effective unless they're built upon a \nsolid payment foundation.\n  Unfortunately, the current Medicare payment system for doctors is \nfundamentally flawed. It does not provide stability and predictability \nfor our doctors. It is not a solid foundation for the future.\n  That is so, because in 1997, Congress created the Medicare physician \npayment system that we have today. Congress created a thing called \n``the sustainable growth rate,'' or ``SGR.'' It was meant to control \nwhat Medicare spends on doctors.\n  But the SGR is not working. It never really has.\n  Had Congress not intervened, the SGR would have produced steep cuts \nin physician payments every year since 2002. And if Congress does not \nintervene now, the SGR will continue to produce steep cuts for the \nforeseeable future.\n  Without action, next year, physician payments will be reduced by 21 \npercent. And the cuts will continue for the foreseeable future. The \ntotal cut over the next decade will approach 40 percent.\n  Every year since 2003, Congress has intervened. Congress regularly \nacts to avert these cuts. And given the magnitude of the impending \nreductions, Congress will continue to intervene. The stakes are just \ntoo high.\n  Allowing these draconian cuts to go into effect would jeopardize \naccess to doctors for 40 million seniors--including 160,000 Montanans--\nwho rely on Medicare for their health coverage. That is why AARP \nunequivocally supports the repeal of the flawed SGR formula.\n\n[[Page S10613]]\n\n  But the damage would not end there. Because TRICARE--the health care \nsystem for active military personnel--bases its reimbursements on \nMedicare rules, 9 million members of the armed services and their \nfamilies could also be left without physician care.\n  The SGR must be repealed.\n  But don't just take my word for it. The Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission--or MedPAC--reported to Congress in 2007 that the SGR should \nbe replaced with a more stable, predictable system. MedPAC recommended \na system that rewards doctors based on the quality and efficiency of \nthe care that they deliver.\n  The Medicare Physician Fairness Act is the first step toward a 21st \ncentury physician payment system in Medicare.\n  The Medicare Physician Fairness Act repeals the flawed SGR formula \nthat has done nothing to promote more appropriate, evidence-based \nphysician care.\n  Repealing SGR will lay a solid foundation. And on that foundation, we \ncan build delivery system reforms that fundamentally restructure the \nMedicare payment system. We can change it from one that focuses on the \nvolume of services delivered to one that rewards doctors for the value \nof care that they deliver to patients.\n  The bill that the Finance Committee reported last week includes these \nreforms. Our bill includes better feedback reports to doctors, so that \nthey know how their utilization trends compare to those of their peers. \nOur bill includes incentives for physicians to work together with other \nhealth care providers in accountable care organizations that will share \nin savings they achieve for Medicare. And ultimately, our bill includes \na payment system that rewards every doctor based on the relative \nquality and costs of care they provide to their patients.\n  But first, we need to repeal the SGR, so that we can enact these \nmeaningful reforms.\n  Now, any honest discussion about repealing the current SGR system \nmust also address the elephant in the room: the CBO budget baseline. \nThe law requires CBO's budget baseline to assume that Congress will not \nsuspend the SGR.\n  The reality of the situation, however, is at odds with the CBO \nbaseline. Future congressional action on the SGR is certain. Seven \nconsecutive cuts have, for good reason, been averted.\n  Rather than continuing to enact short-term fixes that produce steeper \ncuts in the future, the Medicare Physician Fairness Act adopts the \nObama administration's more realistic budget baseline. It does not \nincrease spending over recent trends or future action. It preserves \nspending at current levels.\n  Adjusting the SGR baseline without an offset is not something I \nendorse without hesitation. I believe in fiscal responsibility. And I \nam proud that the Finance Committee health reform legislation will \nreduce the budget deficit in the first 10 years and dramatically bend \nthe cost curve in the long run.\n  But by overturning each of the last seven SGR cuts, Congress has made \nclear that the current baseline is broken. And temporary band-aids have \nonly increased the size of future cuts and the cost of future \ninterventions.\n  Eliminating the SGR now will avert devastating payment cuts. And \neliminating the SGR now will create a more honest picture of our future \nbudgetary commitments.\n  And so, let us avoid merely putting another band-aid on the broken \nphysician payment system. Let us truly reform the way that we pay the \ndoctors who cure us. And let us enact the Medicare Physician Fairness \nAct.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, our Nation faces great challenges that \nrequire collective persistence and collective sacrifice to overcome. \nTwo of these challenges that I hear the most about from my constituents \nare the need to reduce the national debt and enact health care reform. \nTheir concerns come from a basic sense of responsibility and decency--\nand are true to Wisconsin's progressive tradition. They believe, as I \nbelieve, that the government should be required to balance their budget \njust as Wisconsinites balance their checkbook. They believe, as I \nbelieve, that every American--regardless of wealth, race, gender, or \nage--deserves good, affordable health care. These basic principles of \nfiscal and social responsibility have guided me throughout my 17 years \nin the Senate. And it is these principles that lead me to conclude that \nI cannot support S. 1776, the Medicare Physician Fairness Act, because \nit will substantially add to our national deficit.\n  I believe that the Medicare sustainable growth rate is a broken \npolicy and must be fixed. I also believe that requiring Congress to pay \nfor enacting new policies is critical to our long-term financial \nstability and strength as a nation. Waiving paygo requirements for this \nlegislation simply puts a different name on the same $247 billion \nproblem. It passes the buck, and that is not good enough for me.\n  Just this week, I introduced the Control Spending Now Act. This bill \nconsists of dozens of different initiatives that would collectively \nreduce the deficit by over $\\1/2\\ trillion over 10 years. Redirecting \njust a portion of the savings in my legislation would more than pay for \nthe Medicare Physician Fairness Act. We do not have a lack of funding \noptions; we have a lack of political will to make those tough \ndecisions. And lack of political will is not a good reason to add to \nthe national deficit.\n  For years, I have called for significant reform of the Medicare \nsustainable growth rate formula. I have heard from countless Wisconsin \nphysicians about how damaging these potential cuts are to their ability \nto provide health care. And I am seriously concerned that without a \ncomprehensive change, Medicare beneficiaries' access to the health care \nthey need will be limited. The Medicare SGR formula is a real and \ngrowing problem that deserves thoughtful and fiscally responsible \nreform.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, while it is important that health \nprofessionals in my State of West Virginia receive the compensation \nthey deserve, I will, however, vote against this measure. We are on the \neve of one of the most historic debates surrounding health care since \nthe inception of Medicare in 1965. To follow the many weeks of \nlaborious debate and amendments in the Finance and Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions Committees, with this legislation is unwise. It \nsends the wrong signal. The health committees have not reviewed it. It \naddresses only a single problem, to the benefit of one group of health \ncare providers, completely outside the context of broader reform. I \nbelieve piecemeal action on health care reform could be its undoing.\n  In the coming weeks, I look forward to voting on the motion to \nproceed to a comprehensive health care reform bill. Reforming our \nhealth care system for the betterment of all of our citizens is \nnecessary and vitally important. But we need to make certain there is a \nnational consensus behind any health care bill. In order to pass a \nmeaningful measure that will provide essential health care coverage for \nthose in dire need, the Senate must be entirely forthright in both \ndebate and intention. Mr. President, $247 billion is not an \ninsignificant amount of money, and the Senate should be up front about \nthe true costs of health care reform.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my vote against cloture on the motion to \nproceed to legislation that would cancel the scheduled physician \npayment cuts in the Medicare Program should not be read as opposition \nto the idea of canceling those cuts.\n  I support canceling the payment cuts for physicians. However, I think \nthat action should be paid for. As it stands, that legislation would \nhave increased the Federal deficit by $245 billion over 10 years. I \ncannot support that.\n  Congress has acted to prevent scheduled cuts for 6 of the last 7 \nyears, creating a very large debt burden that becomes harder and harder \nto eliminate each time a temporary fix is enacted.\n  Each year physicians face uncertainty as a result of not knowing \nwhether or not their reimbursement will be cut. I support developing a \nnew model that provides stability in Medicare payments.\n  I am working with my colleagues to find ways to address the Medicare \nphysician payment formula, and pay for the cost of doing so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10613-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10613-S10614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MEDICARE PHYSICIAN FAIRNESS ACT OF 2009--MOTION TO PROCEED\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               NASA and the Future of Human Space Flight\n\n  Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, I would like to take the opportunity to \nexpand upon some of my earlier comments, and those of other Members of \nthe Senate, in relation to NASA and the future of human space flight.\n  I am concerned with aspects of the Augustine Commission's report that \nadd credibility to far-reaching options for furthering our manned space \nflight program. If Congress and the public are to be asked to spend \nmore for change, then it should be change that will give us the best \nchance to succeed and to continue to lead the world in human space \nexploration.\n  The Chairman of the Review of U.S. Human Space Flight Plans \nCommittee, Norm Augustine, announced that safety would be paramount. \nYet, from reviewing the preliminary information, there is only one area \nwhere mission safety was examined in the report. The Augustine report \ncontained no safety comparison for the various vehicles considered by \nthe panel and no risk assessment based on each option. The only safety \nissue identified was an assessment of how ``hard'' the panel thought \neach overall mission would be to achieve--not the safest means to \ncomplete the mission successfully. Since safety is the most important \nissue, these omissions are starling to some of us.\n  When making comparisons on the safety and performance of the various \noptions, fundamental design differences cannot be lumped together and \nconsidered to be equal. Without an honest and thorough examination of \nthe safety and reliability aspects of the various designs and options, \nthe findings of this report are worthless. I would like to know why \nthis blue ribbon panel did not examine these safety aspects.\n  Constellation's vehicles have been planned and scrutinized by \nmultiple stakeholders, all with a single goal in mind: to provide a \nsafe and reliable human space flight system for our Nation.\n  Flashy PowerPoint presentations and boisterous claims by potential \ncommercial providers about their easy and simple science solutions to \nhuman travel into space sound like the answer to all of our problems. \nWhat sounds too good to be true usually is. Are these proposals subject \nto the same safety standards and testing that have resulted from the \nColumbia Accident Investigation Board, I would ask? Is there any \nevidence that the cargo rockets, promised to execute their first \nservicing mission sometime in 2010, are better than the manned rockets \nthat have been under development for over 4 years? What do the experts \nsay?\n  NASA's own Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel issued a report in April \nof this year that stated that ``Commercial Orbital Transportation \nServices vehicles are not proven to be appropriate to transport NASA \npersonnel.'' Will the current Administrator, Mr. Bolden, who helped \nwrite these words, now contradict his statement 6 months after putting \nhis name to them?\n  Further, I would ask, what happened to the April report findings in \nthe Augustine Commission recommendations? Have there been findings \nsince April that were available to the Augustine Commission that the \nAerospace Safety Advisory Panel was not privy to? If so, I would \ncertainly look forward to reviewing this new data.\n  The Augustine Commission states in its own report that while human \nsafety can never be absolutely assured, it is ``not discussed in \nextensive detail because any concepts falling short in human safety \nhave simply been eliminated from consideration.'' Yet we see the \nvehicles currently deemed unsafe for our astronauts being used in the \nAugustine Commission's report as a viable option to go to low Earth \norbit.\n  When asked on September 15, 2009, about the readiness of emerging \nspace contractors to provide manned space flights, former NASA \nAdministrator Mike Griffin said:\n\n       To confuse the expectation that one day a commercial \n     transport of crew will be there, to confuse that expectation \n     with the assumption of its existence today or in the near \n     term I think is--is risky in the extreme.\n\n  Current and former NASA Administrators are on record registering \ntheir doubts regarding the safety of these new commercial contractors.\n  Companies that are new contractors within the aerospace community \nhave been provided a pathway that could potentially lead to billions in \ngovernment funding to pursue opportunities to support International \nSpace Station operations, starting with cargo. I believe the \ncontractors wishing to pursue human launches to low Earth orbit should \nprove they can establish a reliable record of meeting the cargo and \ntrash hauling responsibilities to support the station before we turn \nover the Nation's human space flight future to them.\n  Pretty slides and unproven promises will not show us you have the \nright stuff to be entrusted with the lives of our astronauts. If these \ncompanies can be successful--and there is no reason to doubt that \neventually, someday, somehow they will be--then NASA, the Congress, and \nthe public might be willing to hand over launches to low Earth orbit. \nThat day is not today and it will not be for years to come.\n\n[[Page S10615]]\n\n  But until that day arrives, I believe we should follow the path that \nhas the safest manned vehicle, the vehicle furthest along in \ndevelopment, and, as mentioned several times by the Augustine \nCommission itself, the program that, given appropriate funding, will \nsuccessfully provide a system that can not only go to the space station \nbut to the Moon and beyond.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, yesterday, the Senate majority leader was \nrequired to file cloture to end a Republican filibuster against the \nDepartment of Defense authorization bill. We are in two wars. We are in \ntwo wars, and we are about to send, from my State of Vermont, 1,500 \nmembers of our National Guard to Afghanistan. We have all kinds of \nthings the Defense authorization bill is designed for, including to \nprotect Americans serving abroad in harm's way. Yet the Republicans \nhave filibustered against the Department of Defense authorization bill. \nThe Senate is going to vote on that tomorrow, pursuant to our rules. I \nhope we will have a bipartisan vote proceeding to conclude the debate \non the conference report which has been adopted by the House. I expect \nthe Senate, on both sides of the aisle, will vote to provide the \nauthorities necessary for our men and women in uniform.\n  I wonder what it would be like if you were a soldier, a marine out on \nthe front lines in Afghanistan, and you get some news back home that \none political party is holding up the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill--the authorization for your equipment, the \nauthorization for your body armor, the authorization for your \nammunition, the authorization for your going forward. What would you \nthink as the bullets are whizzing toward you? I know what I would \nthink. I know what I would have thought when my young son was in the \nMarine Corps and got called for service in the Middle East. I know what \nI would have thought of people holding up the authorization for the \nequipment he needed.\n  Also, as part of that conference report, we are going to be adopting \nthe Hate Crimes Prevention Act, including the provision added by the \nranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Sessions, \nto create a new criminal offense for attacks against servicemembers \nbecause of their service. I would hope we will be moving forward on \nthat.\n  After more than a decade, Congress is finally set to pass the Matthew \nShepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 as an \namendment to the Defense Authorization Act. I know the President will \nsign this, and I am proud the Congress has come together to show that \nviolence against members of any group because of who they are is not \ngoing to be tolerated in our country. I thank Senator Collins for \ncosponsoring the amendment with me. I commend Senator Levin for working \nso hard to ensure that this provision would go forward as part of the \nconference report, and I congratulate Senate Majority Leader Reid for \nhis essential role in this matter.\n  If I might, as I look over where my dear friend and colleague, \nSenator Kennedy, sat for decades on this floor, I wish to take the \nopportunity to remember Senator Ted Kennedy, who provided steadfast \nleadership on this issue for more than a decade. I wish he could have \nbeen here to see this bill, about which he was so passionate, finally \nget enacted. I wish he was here in any event, but I am honored to be \nable to see it through to the finish line for him. I know it meant a \nlot to him. I miss him, but I think this is a way we can say to Senator \nKennedy his good work goes on.\n  Earlier this month was the 11th anniversary of the brutal murder of \nMatthew Shepard. He was a college student who was beaten to death \nsolely because of his sexual orientation. Matthew's parents worked \ncourageously and tirelessly for this legislation, which aims to ensure \nthis kind of despicable act will never be tolerated in this country.\n  The bill was named for Matthew as well as for James Byrd, Jr. Mr. \nByrd was a Black man who was killed in 1998 because of his race--\nanother awful crime which I will not even describe because it was so \ngruesome--but it galvanized the Nation against hateful violence. We \nappreciate and honor the important contribution of James Byrd's family, \nas they have worked so hard for this legislation.\n  Unfortunately, the years since these two horrific crimes have made \nclear that hate crimes remain a serious and growing problem. Only a few \nweeks ago, we saw--just a few blocks from this Capitol--a shooting at \nthe Holocaust Memorial Museum, a place that should be sacred ground \nbecause of what it remembers. We saw a vicious hate crime, with a man \ndying trying to defend the Holocaust Memorial Museum. I think this \nbipartisan legislation will help law enforcement respond more \neffectively to this problem. It is a testament to the importance of \nthis legislation that the Attorney General of the United States, Eric \nHolder, came to the Judiciary Committee in June to testify in favor of \nit. We have been urged to pass this bill by State and local law \nenforcement organizations and dozens of leaders in the faith and civil \nrights communities. I wish, when I had been a prosecutor in the State \nof Vermont, that we had had such legislation so we could have called on \nit when we needed help.\n  This historic hate crimes legislation will improve existing law by \nmaking it easier for Federal authorities to investigate and prosecute \ncrimes of racial or ethnic or religious violence. Victims will no \nlonger have to engage in a narrow range of activities, such as serving \nas a juror, to be protected under Federal law.\n  It also focuses the attention and resources of the Federal Government \non the crimes committed against people because of sexual orientation, \ntheir gender, their gender identity or their disability, which are much \nneeded protections. In addition, the legislation will provide resources \nto State, local, and tribal law enforcement to address hate crimes.\n  President Obama has worked closely with us to facilitate the quick \npassage of this vital hate crimes legislation. In his first few months \nin office, he has acted to ensure that Federal benefits are awarded \nmore equitably, regardless of sexual orientation, and now to ensure \nthat this hate crimes legislation becomes law. Unlike previous years, \nthis bipartisan hate crimes bill does not face a veto threat. We have a \nPresident who understands that crimes motivated by bias are \nparticularly pernicious crimes and affect more than just the victims \nand the victims' families. They affect all of us. They affect us as a \nsociety. They weaken us and demean us as a society, and we should all \nbe opposed to such crimes. I expect the President to sign this \nlegislation without delay.\n  Hate crimes instill fear in those who have no connection to the \nvictim other than a shared characteristic, such as race or sexual \norientation. For nearly 150 years, we have responded as a nation to \ndeter and to punish violent denials of civil rights by enacting Federal \nlaws to protect the civil rights of all our citizens. The Matthew \nShepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2009 \ncontinues that great and honorable tradition--Matthew Shepard, who was \nmurdered because of his sexual orientation; James Byrd, who was \nmurdered because of his race. In passing this legislation, we can say \nto them and everybody else that at last we in the Senate, the body that \nshould be the conscience of the Nation, will show, once again, that \nAmerica values tolerance and protects all its people.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nBarrasso and I be permitted to speak as in morning business to offer \nsome comments about Senator Cliff Hansen, who passed away last night, \nand to agree to a resolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Enzi and Mr. Barrasso are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. ENZI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S10616]]\n\n                              Unemployment\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise to address the devastating jobs \ncrisis hitting my home State of Oregon. Last Monday, we got new job \nnumbers. On the face, it was good news. The rate of unemployment \ndropped from 12.2 percent to 11.5 percent. Of course, we would all \nexpect this is because there were more jobs.\n  As it turns out, that is not the case. Oregon lost 10,300 jobs in \nSeptember. The unemployment rate dropped simply because, in the face of \nso much unemployment, many Oregonians are giving up in their search for \na job. A year ago, 121,000 Oregonians were unemployed. This September, \n211,000 Oregonians were out of work. Jobs are hard to find in my home \nState right now.\n  The reasons for this are many. We are an export State that has seen \nour trading partners hit hard with their own economic problems, \ncountries such as South Korea whose GDP, year over year, dropped up to \n20 percent.\n  Mexican penalty tariffs have hit Oregon's agricultural sector, our \nfruits and our Christmas trees, particularly hard. One of our main \nindustries, the timber industry, which produces dimensional lumber for \nconstruction all across this great United States, has been wiped out by \nthe collapse of construction and housing sectors of our economy.\n  Allow me to zero in on the county where I was born, Douglas County. \nIn September, Douglas County had a seasonally adjusted unemployment \nrate of 16.1 percent. One out of every six adults was out of a job. \nDouglas County is a big timber county. There is no market for \ndimensional lumber right now. The recovery package has helped some by \ncreating jobs preventing wildfires in choked and overgrown second-\ngrowth forests, but that is not enough.\n  We need the housing markets to turn around. We need to diversify \nDouglas County's economic base by investing in clean energy technology \nthat will turn biomass from the forests into renewable fuels.\n  We are hard at work on both fronts, attempting to stabilize housing \nand crafting new clean energy legislation. But in the meantime, workers \nin Douglas County are hurting. There are not enough jobs. It is a \ncrisis for the Douglas County families.\n  In a crisis, we help our neighbors. One of the best ways we can help \nour neighbors and friends in Douglas County and other counties \nthroughout Oregon and other counties throughout the United States of \nAmerica is to pass an extension of unemployment benefits.\n  Let me be clear: Oregonians want jobs. That is our first and best \nanswer. If there are jobs out there, citizens will line up to get them. \nBut when there are no jobs, we need to have help. The extension of \nunemployment benefits is such help. It would extend benefits for 14 \nweeks for all States and 20 weeks for high unemployment States such as \nthe State of Oregon.\n  It is paid for through extending a fee employers are already paying. \nSo it puts no additional pressure on business but provides a critical \nsafety net to our out-of-work Americans.\n  Before I close, I wish to add one point: This bill will help these \nfamilies and workers get by, but it will also help our economy as a \nwhole by putting money into the hands of those who need it most. \nUnemployment benefits rapidly turn into bags of groceries, new and \nsecondhand school clothes, needed home repairs. All of that has a big \nimpact on small businesses in Douglas County and small towns such as \nRoseburg, Sutherlin, and Myrtle Creek.\n  That is why economists say extending unemployment insurance is about \nthe best job-creating step the Federal Government could take. I \nunderstand some of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are \nobjecting to consideration of this bill. They do not want that bill to \ncome to this floor.\n  I think we need to look more closely at this issue. A bill extending \nunemployment benefits to assist in shoring up the financial foundations \nof our working families while they are still searching for those jobs \nis essential. We need to have not partisan potshots but real help for \nworking families.\n  I appreciate that some Members of this Chamber may come from States \nthat are doing quite well right now. There may be some States in \nAmerica that are not in the middle of a jobs crisis, but far too many \nof our States are similar to Oregon, where families need assistance. \nThe delay of providing an extension of unemployment benefits will cause \nreal pain to families in those States and slow down the effort for our \neconomy as a whole to recover.\n  I urge my colleagues to join in supporting the working families of \nDouglas County, the working families of Oregon, the working families of \nthe United States of America, and support job creation by supporting \nthis extension of unemployment benefits.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Klobuchar pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n317 are located in today's Record under ``Submission of Concurrent and \nSenate Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to speak as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Medicare Physician Payment Fix\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, several weeks ago I came to the floor \nto remind my colleagues and all Americans about the fiscal realities in \nwhich we find ourselves. I promised I would continue these efforts \nuntil we did something to address this crisis, so my colleagues are \ngoing to see a lot of me between now and the end of the year. Hopefully \nsomething will get done on this issue before the end of the year.\n  Unfortunately, I return today to tell my colleagues that the bill to \nrepeal the Medicare physician payment formula the Senate considered \nearlier today is a step in the opposite direction, and I was very \npleased with the vote on that. There were 47 votes for cloture and 53 \nvotes in opposition, so we had more opposed than we had for cloture.\n  When I spoke here earlier this fall, I discussed one of my children's \nfavorite stories, ``The Emperor's New Clothes'' by Hans Christian \nAnderson. This little piece of artwork I have in the Chamber is in that \nfairytale.\n  In the tale, an emperor goes about the land wearing a nonexistent \nsuit sold to him by a new tailor who convinced the monarch the suit was \nmade of the finest silks. The tailors--two swindlers--tell the emperor \nthat the threads of his robes will be so fine that they will look \ninvisible to those dimwitted or unfit for their position. The emperor \nand his ministers, themselves unable to see the clothing, lavish the \ntailor with praise for the suit because they do not want to appear to \nbe dimwitted or incompetent.\n  Word spread across the kingdom of the emperor's beautiful new \nclothes. To show off the extraordinary suit, a parade was formed. \nPeople lined the streets to see the emperor show off his new clothes. \nAgain, afraid to appear stupid or unfit, everyone pretends to see the \nsuit. It is only when a child cries out ``the emperor wears no \nclothes'' does the crowd acknowledge that the emperor is, in fact, \nnaked.\n  Mr. President, much like the emperor in this story, America's elected \nleaders know we face a fiscal train wreck, but we are choosing to \nignore our current economic reality. The American people know ``we are \nnaked,'' and so does the rest of the world, and our credibility and our \ncredit are at risk, but we refuse to acknowledge what is obvious: When \nit comes to fiscal responsibility, ``the emperor wears no clothes.'' \nYet earlier today we had a vote on whether to proceed to a bill that \nwould have added $247 billion to our Nation's debt. The interest alone \nadds another $50 billion in debt over the next 10 years. We are just \ngoing to put it on the national credit card and let our children and \ngrandchildren take care of it. We are the biggest credit card abusers \nin the world, and the credit cards we are using are the credit cards of \nmy children and grandchildren and other Americans. I am pleased, as I \nsaid, that a majority of my colleagues joined me in opposing moving \nforward with this legislation.\n  The President has said the health care reform bill would not add one\n\n[[Page S10617]]\n\ndime to the deficit. Yet the bill we voted on earlier today should be a \nlarger part of reform legislation, and it is going to spend over $\\1/4\\ \ntrillion without paying for it--that is what would have happened.\n  I suppose it is easy to make claims about health care reform \nlegislation not adding to the deficit when Congress takes the parts \nthat cost money off the table, but to do so is fiscally irresponsible \nand morally corrupt.\n  The physician fix was left out of the Finance Committee, I suspect, \nnot because my colleagues do not agree it is a fundamental part of \nhealth care reform but because it would have cost money my colleagues \ndid not want to account for in the bill. If the Finance Committee would \nhave included the fix in their bill, the $81 billion surplus they say \nthe bill will create would have quickly turned into a deficit. That is \nunacceptable, and I am not the only one who feels that way. The \nWashington Post discussed the effort to take the fix for the \nsustainable growth formula--the formula that calculates reimbursement \nfor physicians under Medicare--out of the larger health care bill as a \n``shell game'' and ``budgetary smoke and mirrors.'' This is just \nanother illustration of our out-of-control spending that has caused our \nnational debt to skyrocket.\n  One of the reasons I ran for the Senate and came to Washington a long \ntime ago was to reduce the Federal debt and balance our budgets. That \nis what I did when I was mayor of Cleveland. That is what I did when I \nwas Governor of Ohio. When I arrived in the Senate in 1999, the gross \nnational debt stood at $5.6 trillion, or 61 percent of the GDP. Today, \nthe gross national debt is nearly $11.8 trillion, and the President \nwill be coming before us to raise the national debt to, I think, over \n$12 trillion. The 2009 deficit stands at about $1.4 trillion.\n  I just got back 2 weeks ago from Athens, Greece, and an Organization \nfor Security and Co-operation meeting in Athens. When I shared with my \ncolleagues that we borrowed $1.4 trillion to run the government--and \nthey were all asking for help--they were astounded. They just could not \nbelieve it. I also reminded them that debt was like the debt we racked \nup during the Second World War. In other words, that is the period to \nwhich you can compare it. So the 2009 deficit stands at $1.4 trillion \nand at $9.1 trillion over the next decade, which does not include the \nborrowing from the trust funds and which is three times the largest \ndeficit in our history.\n  It does not take an economist to realize our current course is \nunsustainable. The Medicare Program is scheduled to be bankrupt by \n2017. I cannot understand why we are not talking about that. That means \nthe supply of money coming in is not going to be enough to take care of \nthe demand--just what is happening now in Social Security. In the next \ncouple years, the money coming in is not going to be adequate to take \ncare of people who are on Social Security, so we are going to have to \nborrow that money in order to take care of their needs. We need to take \na comprehensive look at the program.\n  I will be the first to admit we must honor our commitment to our \nNation's seniors and ensure they have access to quality health care \nservices. I have heard it firsthand from family and friends that in \nsome places in Ohio, Medicare beneficiaries face delays for physician \nservices right now. In fact, 6.8 percent of Ohioans live in a \ndesignated primary care shortage area. We need more doctors and nurses. \nThe situation is only going to get worse. Thirty-nine percent of \nphysicians are over the age of 50 and considering limiting the amount \nof time they see patients.\n  For these reasons, I have been advocating for the past several years \nthat we need a permanent and commonsense fix for the flawed sustainable \ngrowth rate formula, which we refer to as the doc fix. I do not think \nthere is anyone on either side of the aisle who disagrees. We need to \ndo that. Yet this bill we just considered is not the way to do it. Any \nfix must be part of a larger conversation, and it must be done in a way \nthat does not simply add to the burden we are already placing on our \nchildren and grandchildren.\n  I am pleased that in a letter last week to Senator Reid, 10 Senate \nDemocrats joined me in this conclusion, asking the majority leader that \nhe get serious about the Federal debt and tax and entitlement reform. \nThey believe, as I do, that we cannot continue to keep spending without \nconsequence. As I have been advocating, we must give larger reform \nserious thought before it is too late. We must act on the tough issues \ntoday.\n  As Gerald Seib noted in the Wall Street Journal yesterday:\n\n       Administration officials also know they have little choice \n     but to start showing early next year that they take the \n     deficit seriously, for both political and economic reasons.\n\n  That is why Senator Lieberman and I have introduced legislation \ncalled Securing America's Future Economy, which basically creates a \nbipartisan commission that would deal with the deficit and deal with \ntax reform; that if a supermajority of those agree to the solution, \nthat would get expedited procedure on the floor of the Senate and move \nto an up-or-down vote, very much like we do with the BRAC process. We \nhave been trying to do this now for 4 years. We have talked to the OMB \nDirector, Peter Orszag. It is interesting. Two years ago he was with a \nlot of former CBO Directors and said, We have to have a commission. It \nis the only way we are going to deal with entitlements; it is the only \nway we are going to deal with tax reform, yet we are not able to \nconvince the administration to move forward with us to tackle this very \nheavy responsibility.\n\n  Time is running out. The dollar is going down. People are talking \nabout not using the dollar as an exchange anymore. Most of the economic \nexperts say if we keep going on this unsustainable course, we are going \nto see interest rates start to skyrocket in this country. Over half our \ndebt is in the hands of the Chinese and the Indians and the OPEC \nnations and Japan. We are in bad shape. The public understands it. They \nunderstand. They understand that the emperor has no clothes. We are not \ndoing anything about the problem, and they get it today.\n  I happen to believe that the undertow that is out there in the \ncountry today in terms of health care reform and in terms of climate \nchange is the fact that the American people understand that things \naren't right. The American people in the Presiding Officer's State, in \nmy State, do you know what they are doing? They are buying less. They \nare not putting it on their cards. They are trying to save some money. \nThey know they have been on a binge. They look to us and they say, What \nare you doing? What are you doing? We care about ourselves, but we also \ncare about our children and grandchildren. It is not fair to those \nindividuals to do what we are doing.\n  We have a moral obligation to do what we can to try to make sure this \ngeneration's standard of living will not be less than those who came \nbefore them. Many people believe that is going to be the case. The \npassage of the legislation to fix the physician payment formula by \nborrowing more money will only help guarantee that they are right.\n  We have a serious problem. I will be coming to the floor over and \nover to see if we can't do it. I am going to do what I can to convince \nthe President that he ought to participate in setting up this \ncommission, working with Senator Gregg and Senator Kent Conrad, to see \nif we can't get them together to agree on what this commission would \nlook like. We are hoping the President is alert enough to know that if \nhe doesn't deal with this problem, it is not only a substantive problem \nthat needs to be dealt with but a major political problem that he is \ngoing to have. The American public demands that we start talking about \ndoing something about this problem and they know we are running out of \ntime.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                          Internet Neutrality\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, tomorrow at the Federal Communications \nCommission there will be a vote on a proposed rulemaking. It is a \nrulemaking on something called net neutrality. Let me put that in \nEnglish, if I might. It is about Internet freedom. I wish to talk for a \nmoment about the importance of this.\n  One would think, given the reaction by some and dozens and dozens of \nletters that are now going to the FCC,\n\n[[Page S10618]]\n\nthat what is going to happen tomorrow is some unbelievable vote on some \ncontroversial proposal that has had no discussion. It is not that at \nall. It is a notice of proposed rulemaking. It is the beginning of a \nprocess to describe a rulemaking on what is called net neutrality or \nthe principle of nondiscrimination with respect to the Internet.\n  I wish to describe how important that is. The Internet is an \nunbelievable new invention in our lifetime. It was created by the \nFederal Government. A bunch of scientists and engineers in the Federal \nGovernment described this method of communicating one to another with \ncomputer technology and it became the Internet. The Internet developed \nover a number of years in a completely free and open architecture. That \nmeant that anyone could go to anyplace and see anybody on the Internet. \nSo the stories are legend.\n  It was, I believe, 11 years ago when Larry and Sergey, two young men \nin college in a dormitory room started a company. They moved it to a \ngarage that had a garage door opener, and it had eight employees, and \nthey had this idea, a new company, a new search engine. It had eight \nemployees and it was in a garage with a garage door opener 11 years \nago. Well, now it is called Google.\n  But it is not just Larry and Sergey having a dream and a vision. It \nis so many others as well. It is Jeff Bezos who drove to California \nwith an idea and that idea became Amazon.com, selling books, and then \nselling almost everything. Or it became someone with an idea about \nhaving an auction on the Internet, and it became eBay, and most of us \nknow about eBay. Or it became Mark Zuckerberg who had an idea of \nsomething called Facebook. Well, I am talking about huge successes. But \nfor every one of those--Facebook, eBay, Amazon, Google--for every one \nof those large companies that have now grown on the Internet, there are \nmillions of people out there who are conducting a business in their \nkitchen, in their dorm room, in their garage, because they are the next \nenterprising person to succeed on the Internet.\n  The question is this: If there is someone in my hometown--and let me \ndescribe that someone, because it happened to be someone who is now \noccupying the home that I grew up in; a very small, two-bedroom home in \na small town of 300 people. I had not been back for some long while to \nsee the home. So I knocked on the front door. When the woman answered, \nI asked if I could see the home that I grew up in, where I spent my \nfirst 17 years, and she said: Of course. Come on in. So I came in and \nshe was doing something that I found kind of interesting. She had in \nthe small kitchen on the table a camera, and the camera was pointed at \nan aperture with an arm and on the arm was hanging a bracelet, a little \ngold bracelet, and she was taking a picture of the gold bracelet.\n  I said: What are you doing?\n  Well, I have a business, she said.\n  I said: Well, what kind of business do you have?\n  Well, I sell on the Internet. I purchase jewelry and then I sell it \non the Internet.\n  Sure enough, in the little porch coming into the home she had \ncardboard boxes and tape and the kinds of things you would do to box \nsomething up and send it. Here in this little town in southwestern \nNorth Dakota, a town of 300 people, a woman, in the home I grew up in, \nwas running a business.\n  I said: How do you do?\n  She said: Pretty well. This income supplements my husband's income. \nShe said: I sell on eBay.\n  Well, you know what? In that little kitchen, anybody in the world can \nfind her business--anybody in the world can find that business. Why? \nBecause the Internet is open. The architecture has never been closed. \nThe whole notion of the Internet is this notion of freedom, of liberty \nto go anywhere you want to go. In the last 3\\1/2\\ years I have written \ntwo books and I have discovered in the writing of books how \nunbelievable the Internet is to be able to go to anywhere in the world \nand do research. If you want to know something, go there, and nobody is \ngoing to stop you from going wherever you wish to go. Put it in a \nsearch engine, go find it, and you will find it in some crevice on the \nInternet. Somebody out there has put it on the Internet for you to see. \nIt is the most unbelievable research tool I have ever found.\n  So, yes, it is Google, it is Amazon, it is eBay, it is the big \ncompanies, but much more than that, it is the backbone that allows \npeople all over this country and the world to do business. Yes, from \ntheir kitchen, from their garage. Some of those businesses will grow to \nbecome names we don't now know but will, because they will be \nsuccessful. They will be the next invention, the next opportunity on \nthis thing called the Internet.\n  Here is the question: The Internet was created under circumstances \nthat required rules of nondiscrimination. For the first portion of its \nbirth and then origin, it was an Internet that was described as a \ntelephone service and it was subject to rules that had \nnondiscrimination, so no one could discriminate. It was completely \nopen, completely free. Its architecture was available to anyone at any \ntime. Anybody can go anywhere at any time. Nobody has a toll booth, \nnobody is a gatekeeper. It is completely open and free. The biggest \ncompany over here and the smallest enterprise over here--big corporate \nexecutives wearing gray suits making lots of money, and two people in a \ndorm room or someone in a small kitchen in a small town--they are \nequal. Anybody has access to both sites, or all sites. That is called \nnondiscrimination and the nondiscrimination rules say no one can set up \na barrier. No one can set up a gate. No one can set up a toll booth. \nAnyone has freedom and access anywhere on the Internet.\n  That is the way the Internet was developed. That is its origin and \nthat is the way most of its life has existed. Then the Federal \nCommunications Commission came along and said, We are going to redefine \nthe Internet as an information service rather than a telephone service \nand the result is the nondiscrimination rules fell off the chart \nbecause they attached to the telephone service. So some of us have \nsaid, Well, we certainly want to maintain and continue \nnondiscrimination rules. I mean, who would be for discrimination, \nright? So we want to maintain the nondiscrimination rules. We want to, \nwith what is called network neutrality or net neutrality, restore the \nnondiscrimination rules and the basic freedom under which the Internet \ndeveloped in the first instance. That has been our effort. That is what \nthe Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission is attempting to \ndo. It is to begin tomorrow with a notice of proposed rulemaking. It \ndoesn't mean he is saying, Here is exactly what we are going to do; it \nis saying, Let's propose a rulemaking and that rulemaking process will \nallow everybody to weigh in, to make comments, to be involved with the \nquestion of exactly what kind of a rule they may or may not write.\n\n  I think what the Federal Communications Commission is doing tomorrow \nis exactly the right thing. I know there are some who are pushing back. \nIn fact, there are some who have said, We want to set up a toll booth. \nThere are some CEOs of some large companies who have suggested, You \nknow what. Those wires belong to us. We want to be able to have some \ntoll booths and so on.\n  I don't believe they should be able to set up any impediments. By \nthat I am not suggesting they don't have a right to have security for \ntheir networks; they certainly do. I am not suggesting they don't have \na right to do certain kinds of inspections to make sure that the kinds \nof things that are prohibited--child pornography and others--are \nstopped on the Internet. But what I am saying is the architecture under \nwhich the Internet itself was created is an architecture all of us \nshould aspire to continue, and that is nondiscrimination rules and \ntransparency. This is very simple. So tomorrow there will be a vote at \nthe FCC. I would say to the chairman of the FCC and to all of the \nCommissioners that you are doing the right thing by proceeding to make \ncertain that the future of the Internet is open and has free access \nwith nondiscrimination rules and transparency.\n  Here are a couple of letters I wish to have printed in the Record, if \nI might ask unanimous consent. One is a letter to Chairman Genachowski \nand this letter is dated October 19th:\n\n       We write to express our support for your announcement that \n     the FCC will begin a process to adopt rules to preserve an \n     open\n\n[[Page S10619]]\n\n     Internet. We believe a process that results in common sense \n     baseline rules is critical to ensuring that the Internet \n     remains a key engine of economic growth, innovation, and \n     global competitiveness.\n\n  Let me not read it all, but let me read the final paragraph of this \nletter:\n\n       America's leadership in the technology space has been due, \n     in large part, to an open Internet. We applaud your \n     leadership in initiating a process to develop rules that \n     ensure the qualities that have made the Internet so \n     successful are protected.\n\n  That is a letter from a large group of people who run Internet \ncompanies and applications, from Craigslist, EchoStar, Google, Mozilla, \nSkype, Amazon, Expedia, Netflix, Sony Electronics, XO Communications, \nFacebook, eBay, and so many others; Twitter, and Meetup, so many \ndifferent folks who know of what they are speaking. I support this \nletter and commend it to the Chairman of the FCC. Again, I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 19, 2009.\n     Hon. Julius Genachowski,\n     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Genachowski: We write to express our support \n     for your announcement that the Federal Communications \n     Commission will begin a process to adopt rules that preserve \n     an open Internet. We believe a process that results in common \n     sense baseline rules is critical to ensuring that the \n     Internet remains a key engine of economic growth, innovation, \n     and global competitiveness.\n       For most of the Internet's history, FCC rules have ensured \n     that consumers have been able to choose the content and \n     services they want over their Internet connections. \n     Entrepreneurs, technologists, and venture capitalists have \n     previously been able to develop new online products and \n     services with the guarantee of neutral, nondiscriminatory \n     access by users, which has fueled an unprecedented era of \n     economic growth and creativity. Existing businesses have been \n     able to leverage the power of the Internet to develop \n     innovative product lines, reach new consumers, and create new \n     ways of doing business.\n       An open Internet fuels a competitive and efficient \n     marketplace, where consumers make the ultimate choices about \n     which products succeed and which fail. This allows businesses \n     of all sizes, from the smallest startup to larger \n     corporations, to compete, yielding maximum economic growth \n     and opportunity.\n       America's leadership in the technology space has been due, \n     in large part, to the open Internet. We applaud your \n     leadership in initiating a process to develop rules to ensure \n     that the qualities that have made the Internet so successful \n     are protected.\n           Sincerely,\n         Jared Kopf, Chairman & President, AdRoll.com; Craig \n           Newmark, Founder, Craigslist; Charles E.

Mr. President, this is a letter from the largest venture \ncapital funds in the country that have made substantial investments in \nthese companies that have helped the Internet grow;\n\n       Dear Chairman Genachowski: We write to express our support \n     for the Commission's ongoing efforts to adopt rules to \n     safeguard the open Internet. As business investors in \n     technology companies, we have first-hand experience with the \n     importance of guaranteeing an open market for new \n     applications for services on the Internet. Clear rules to \n     protect and promote innovation at the edges of the Internet \n     will reinforce the core principles that led to its \n     extraordinary social and economic benefits. Open markets for \n     Internet content will drive investment, entrepreneurship and \n     innovation. For these reasons, Net Neutrality policy is pro-\n     investment, pro-competition, and pro-consumer.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter \nfrom the venture capital firms that know a lot about the Internet.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 21, 2009.\n     Hon. Julius Genachowski,\n     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Genachowski: We write to express our support \n     for the Commission's ongoing efforts to adopt rules to \n     safeguard the open Internet. As business investors in \n     technology companies, we have first-hand experience with the \n     importance of guaranteeing an open market for new \n     applications and services on the Internet.

Open markets for \n     Internet content will drive investment, entrepreneurship and \n     innovation. For these reasons, Net Neutrality policy is pro-\n     investment, pro-competition, and pro-consumer.\n       Permitting network operators to close network platforms or \n     control the applications market by favoring certain kinds of \n     content would endanger innovation and investment in an \n     investment sector which represents many billions of dollars \n     in economic activity. The Commission is absolutely correct to \n     propose clear rules that require competition. The promise of \n     permanently securing an open Internet will deliver consumers \n     and innovators a perfect free market that drives investment, \n     job creation, and consumer welfare. These principles should \n     apply across all Internet access networks, wired or wireless.\n       Investment and innovation at the edge of the network will \n     create not just jobs but also new tools and opportunities for \n     communication, education, health care, business, and every \n     other human endeavor.\n       We look forward to working with you in developing clear \n     rules to protect the open Internet, and in building together \n     a framework to secure its future and promote its continued \n     growth.\n           Sincerely,\n         Immad Akhund, Co Founder, Heyzap; Brian Ascher, Venrock; \n           Aneel Bhusri, Partner, Greylock Partners (and Co-\n           Founder and Co-CEO, Workday); Matt Blumberg, Chairman & \n           CEO, Return Path, Inc.; Brad Burnham, Union Square \n           Ventures; Stewart Butterfield, Co-Founder, Flickr; Ron \n           Conway, Founder, SV Angel LLC; John Doerr, Partner, \n           Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers; Timothy Draper, \n           Founder and Managing Director, Draper Fisher Jurvetson; \n           Caterina Fake, Co-Founder, Flickr & Hunch.\n         Brad Feld, Co-Founder, Foundry Group; Peter Fenton, \n           Benchmark Partners; Eyal Goldwerger, CEO, TargetSpot; \n           Jude Gomila, Co founder, Heyzap; Mark Gorenberg, \n           Managing Director, Hummer Winblad; Jordan Greenhall, \n           Founder of Divx; Bill Gurley, Benchmark Partners; Jed \n           Katz, Managing Director, Javelin Venture Partners; Dany \n           Levy, Founder, DailyCandy; Mario Marino, Member, \n           Executive Advisory Board, General Atlantic LLC.\n         Jason Mendelson, Managing Director, Mobius Venture \n           Capital; Michael Moritz, Sequoia Capital; Kim Polese, \n           CEO of Spike Source, Inc.; Avner Ronen, CEO of Boxee; \n           Pete Sheinbaum, Former CEO of Daily Candy; Ram Shriram, \n           Founder, Sherpalo; David Sze, Partner, Greylock \n           Partners; Albert Wenger, Union Square Ventures; Steve \n           Westly, Managing Director, The Westly Group; Fred \n           Wilson, Union Square Ventures.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, finally, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a letter from the folks who created the Internet. \nThe list is headed by Vinton Cerf, who is often called the ``father of \nthe Internet.'' I know Vint Cerf. He is an extraordinary man. Others \nsigning this letter include Stephen Crocker, David Reed, Lauren \nWeinstein, and Daniel Lynch: these are all Internet pioneers. They were \nthere at the beginning. They created this unbelievable engine of \nopportunity for the American people. They write a similar letter \nsaying:\n\n       As individuals who have worked on the Internet and it \n     predecessors continuously beginning in the late 1960s, we are \n     very concerned that access to the Internet be both open and \n     robust. We are very pleased by your recent proposal to \n     initiate a proceeding for the consideration of safeguards to \n     that end.\n\n  This is a letter to Chairman Genachowski from the folks I mentioned. \nI ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this letter.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 October 15, 2009.\n     Hon. Julius Genachowski,\n     Chairman, Federal Communications Commission, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: We appreciate the opportunity to send \n     you this letter. As individuals who have worked on the \n     Internet and its predecessors continuously beginning in the\n\n[[Page S10620]]\n\n     late 1960s, we are very concerned that access to the Internet \n     be both open and robust. We are very pleased by your recent \n     proposal to initiate a proceeding for the consideration of \n     safeguards to that end.\n       In particular, we believe that your network neutrality \n     proposal's key principles of ``nondiscrimination'' and \n     ``transparency'' are necessary components of a pro-innovation \n     public policy agenda for this nation. This initiative is both \n     timely and necessary, and we look forward to a data-driven, \n     on-the-record proceeding to consider all of the various \n     options.\n       We understand that your proposal, while not even yet part \n     of a public proceeding, already is meeting with strong and \n     vocal resistance from some of the organizations that the \n     American public depends upon for broadband access to the \n     Internet. As you know, the debate on this topic has been \n     lengthy, and many parties opposing the concept have \n     systematically mischaracterized the views of those who \n     endorse and support your position.\n       We believe that the existing Internet access landscape in \n     the U.S. provides inadequate choices to discipline the market \n     through facilities-based competition alone. Your network \n     neutrality proposals will help protect U.S. Internet users' \n     choices for and freedom to access all available Internet \n     services, worldwide, while still providing for responsible \n     network operation and management practices, including \n     appropriate privacy-preserving protections against denial of \n     service and other attacks.\n       One persistent myth is that ``network neutrality'' somehow \n     requires that all packets be treated identically, that no \n     prioritization or quality of service is permitted under such \n     a framework, and that network neutrality would forbid \n     charging users higher fees for faster speed circuits. To the \n     contrary, we believe such features are permitted within a \n     ``network neutral'' framework, so long they are not applied \n     in an anti-competitive fashion.\n       We believe that the vast numbers of innovative Internet \n     applications over the last decade are a direct consequence of \n     an open and freely accessible Internet. Many now-successful \n     companies have deployed their services on the Internet \n     without the need to negotiate special arrangements with \n     Internet Service Providers, and it's crucial that future \n     innovators have the same opportunity. We are advocates for \n     ``permissionless innovation'' that does not impede \n     entrepreneurial enterprise.\n       We commend your initiative to protect and maintain the \n     Internet's unique openness, and support the FCC process for \n     considering the adoption of your proposed nondiscrimination \n     and transparency principles.\n           Respectfully,\n     Vinton G. Cerf,\n       Internet Pioneer.\n     Stephen D. Crocker,\n       Internet Pioneer.\n     David P. Reed,\n       Internet Pioneer.\n     Lauren Weinstein,\n       Internet Pioneer.\n     Daniel Lynch,\n       Internet Pioneer.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me finally say this: I understand this \nissue has been controversial. I and Senator Snowe have worked on this \nissue for a long while. The only time it has been voted on in the \nCongress was an attempt by us to add an amendment in a Commerce \nCommittee markup. This was about 2\\1/2\\ years ago. We had an 11-to-11 \ntie. Why was there a tie vote? It is a controversial issue, although it \nshould not be.\n  The basic principle of freedom on the Internet, open architecture on \nthe Internet, the openness with which this Internet was created ought \nto persuade everyone to say: Yes, let's restore the conditions under \nwhich the Internet has always operated, up until recently; that is, \nnondiscrimination and transparency.\n  There are some interests in this country, I understand, some economic \ninterests that say: No, we don't want that. We want some opportunity to \nperhaps go a different direction. We had one CEO in this country say: \nYou know what. I want some of these companies on the Internet to pay me \nfor the right to move on my lines. Once that starts, once we go down \nthat road with those who have the muscle or the strength to decide who \nis going to cross and who is not, who can get by their toll booth and \nwho cannot, then I am telling you there are Larrys and Sergeys in a \ndorm room out there someplace or a woman in a kitchen with a small \nbusiness that is not going to succeed. And that innovation, that new \ncompany, that new business for this country, the expansion of the \nInternet and opportunity that comes with it will not exist. Why? \nBecause we failed to continue the open architecture and the basic \nfreedoms on which the Internet was created and on which we still ought \nto govern the future of the Internet.\n  What Julius Genachowski, the new chairman, is doing tomorrow at the \nFCC is exactly the right thing. He is not mandating some specific menu. \nHe is beginning a rulemaking process which, at the end, in my judgment, \nwill result in the restoration of two basic principles: \nnondiscrimination on the Internet and transparency. Is there anyone who \nbelieves those principles are not fair, are not reasonable? I don't \nthink so.\n  There has been a flurry of protests, an unbelievable dust created by \na lot of noise, a lot of crowd noise around this issue. I hope perhaps \nthe chairman and those on the Commission who believe we ought to move \nin this direction understand there is very substantial support for what \nthey are trying to do. That support exists in a letter I am sending \ntoday with some of my colleagues to say that support is here. Work that \nSenator Snowe and I have done on this issue will be reflected as well \nin a message tomorrow.\n  I just want the Chairman to know: Keep going. You are doing the right \nthing. Don't worry about some of the dust that is out there. Do the \npublic business, do the right thing, and this country will be best \nserved.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader.\n\n\n                          Supreme Court Appeal\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, yesterday the Supreme Court announced \nit would hear a case that has critical ramifications for our ability to \ndetain foreign nationals safely outside our borders during wartime at \nthe U.S. naval station at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The case also provides \ninsight into the question of the best place to detain and try foreign \nterrorists.\n  The case involves a group of ethnic Chinese Uighurs who are detained \nat Guantanamo Bay. The Uighurs won their habeas corpus petition to be \nreleased from custody. Many of these Uighurs, however, had received \nterrorist training in the Tora Bora Mountains of Afghanistan, including \nweapons training on AK-47 assault rifles at a camp run by the head of a \ngroup that our State Department has designated a terrorist organization \nand that the United Nations has listed as a group associated with Osama \nbin Laden, al-Qaida, or the Taliban.\n  Not surprisingly, it has not been easy to find countries eager to \naccept the Uighurs into their civilian populations. So the Uighurs sued \nto be released into the United States. Federal District Court Judge \nRicardo Urbina granted the Uighurs' request and ordered them released \nin our country. It did not matter to Judge Urbina that the Uighurs did \nnot have an immigration status or that they had received military-style \nweapons training or that they had associated with a terrorist group. He \nwas persuaded by their argument that justice required that they be \nreleased right here in the United States.\n  Fortunately, the DC Circuit Court reversed Judge Urbina. It ruled \nthat even though the Uighurs had won their habeas corpus petition, they \ndid not have a right to be released into the United States. In other \nwords, it ruled that even if the government had to release them, it did \nnot have to release them into Alexandria or Annandale or Falls Church \nor anywhere else in Northern Virginia that the Uighurs might like to \ngo.\n  The DC Circuit's ruling is important to national security in general \nand to the debate over where we should try foreign terrorists in \nparticular. The DC Circuit noted that the Supreme Court has held that \nforeign nationals, without property or presence in the United States, \nhave fewer legal rights than foreign nationals who are present on \nAmerican soil.\n  The DC Circuit also noted that the Supreme Court has repeatedly ruled \nthat a sovereign has a right to control its borders, and that means it \nhas a right to bar from being released into its territory foreign \nnationals whom it has not admitted onto its soil.\n  In short, because these detainees remain at Guantanamo outside our \nborders, they have fewer legal rights than they would have if they were \nbrought within our borders, including the right to be released into our \ncivilian population.\n  We don't know how the DC Circuit would have ruled if the Uighurs had \nbeen present on U.S. soil. But we do know a couple of things. First, \nthe DC\n\n[[Page S10621]]\n\nCircuit's reason for not releasing them into the United States was that \nthey had not been brought into the United States. Let me say that \nagain. The DC Circuit's reason for not releasing them in the United \nStates was that they had not been brought here. Second, other foreign \nnationals who have committed murder and other serious crimes who were \nin the United States have been released here when our government could \nnot transfer them to another country, either because they did not want \nto go to another country or because other countries did not want to \ntake them.\n  The administration and its defenders in the Senate say that because \nwe have tried terrorists in civilian courts before, we should do so \nagain. They say there is no problem with us doing so because the \nadministration would never release detainees into the United States, by \nwhich they really mean to say the administration would not \nintentionally release detainees into the United States. Both assertions \nmiss the mark.\n  First, whether we can try terrorists here is not the issue. The issue \nis whether we should try terrorists here. We can try them here, but \nshould we? Before he became Attorney General, Michael Mukasey was a \nnoted Federal trial judge who presided over civilian trials of \nterrorists such as the trial of the so-called Blind Sheik, Omar Abdel \nRahman, for the 1993 World Trade Center bombing. He has written that \nthere are very good reasons we should not try terrorists in a civilian \ncourt. This is a judge who presided over a terrorist trial in a U.S. \ncivilian court, and this is what he says: We should not try terrorists \nin civilian court, including the additional legal rights terrorists \nwill receive if they are brought here.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at the \nconclusion of my remarks General Mukasey's recent op-ed on the topic.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n  (See Exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, second, once the administration brings \ndetainees into the United States--right here in our country--it is no \nlonger simply a matter for the administration. In other words, once \nthey get here, the administration cannot entirely control the issue of \nwhether they are going to be released. It is no longer about what it \nwill or will not do. It is also about what a Federal judge will or will \nnot do.\n  As we saw with Judge Urbina and the Uighurs, a judge may very well \nagree with the legal arguments of Guantanamo detainees and order them \nreleased right here in the United States. In other words, no matter \nwhat the administration's intention may be, once we bring them here, \nthey do not control the situation; the courts do.\n  Those risks do not exist if the Obama administration does not bring \nthe Guantanamo detainees into the United States. That risk does not \nexist if it leaves them at Guantanamo and tries them at the modern, \nmultimillion-dollar courtroom at Guantanamo Bay under the very military \ncommission rules it has now rewritten to its liking and which we will \nsoon vote on when we consider the Defense authorization conference \nreport.\n  The Supreme Court should affirm the DC Circuit Court's decision and \nlet the political branches maintain control over our borders, including \ndeciding whether and how foreign nationals outside our borders may be \nadmitted within them.\n  If it does, it will bring clarity to the debate over whether \nterrorist detainees at Guantanamo Bay ought to be transferred to the \nUnited States. That clarity is this: If we want certitude that foreign \nterrorists detained at Guantanamo Bay are not released into the United \nStates, then do not bring them here in the first place.\n  Mr. President, I repeat. We could try terrorists in the United \nStates--we could do that--but the issue is should we do that. The \nanswer is no.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 19, 2009]\n\n             Civilian Courts Are No Place To Try Terrorists\n\n                        (By Michael B. Mukasey)\n\n       The Obama administration has said it intends to try several \n     of the prisoners now detained at Guantanamo Bay in civilian \n     courts in this country. This would include Khalid Sheikh \n     Mohammed, the mastermind of the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist \n     attacks, and other detainees allegedly involved. The Justice \n     Department claims that our courts are well suited to the \n     task.\n       Based on my experience trying such cases, and what I saw as \n     attorney general, they aren't. That is not to say that \n     civilian courts cannot ever handle terrorist prosecutions, \n     but rather that their role in a war on terror--to use an \n     unfashionable harsh phrase--should be, as the term ``war'' \n     would suggest, a supporting and not a principal role.\n       The challenges of a terrorism trial are overwhelming. To \n     maintain the security of the courthouse and the jail \n     facilities where defendants are housed, deputy U.S. marshals \n     must be recruited from other jurisdictions; jurors must be \n     selected anonymously and escorted to and from the courthouse \n     under armed guard; and judges who preside over such cases \n     often need protection as well. All such measures burden an \n     already overloaded justice system and interfere with the \n     handling of other cases, both criminal and civil.\n       Moreover, there is every reason to believe that the places \n     of both trial and confinement for such defendants would \n     become attractive targets for others intent on creating \n     mayhem, whether it be terrorists intent on inflicting \n     casualties on the local population, or lawyers intent on \n     filing waves of lawsuits over issues as diverse as whether \n     those captured in combat must be charged with crimes or \n     released, or the conditions of confinement for all prisoners, \n     whether convicted or not.\n       Even after conviction, the issue is not whether a maximum-\n     security prison can hold these defendants; of course it can. \n     But their presence even inside the walls, as proselytizers if \n     nothing else, is itself a danger. The recent arrest of U.S. \n     citizen Michael Finton, a convert to Islam proselytized in \n     prison and charged with planning to blow up a building in \n     Springfield, Ill., is only the latest example of that \n     problem.\n       Moreover, the rules for conducting criminal trials in \n     federal courts have been fashioned to prosecute conventional \n     crimes by conventional criminals. Defendants are granted \n     access to information relating to their case that might be \n     useful in meeting the charges and shaping a defense, without \n     regard to the wider impact such information might have. That \n     can provide a cornucopia of valuable information to \n     terrorists, both those in custody and those at large.\n       Thus, in the multidefendant terrorism prosecution of Sheik \n     Omar Abdel Rahman and others that I presided over in 1995 in \n     federal district court in Manhattan, the government was \n     required to disclose, as it is routinely in conspiracy cases, \n     the identity of all known co-conspirators, regardless of \n     whether they are charged as defendants. One of those co-\n     conspirators, relatively obscure in 1995, was Osama bin \n     Laden. It was later learned that soon after the government's \n     disclosure the list of unindicted co-conspirators had made \n     its way to bin Laden in Khartoum, Sudan, where he then \n     resided. He was able to learn not only that the government \n     was aware of him, but also who else the government was aware \n     of.\n       It is not simply the disclosure of information under \n     discovery rules that can be useful to terrorists. The \n     testimony in a public trial, particularly under the probing \n     of appropriately diligent defense counsel, can elicit \n     evidence about means and methods of evidence collection that \n     have nothing to do with the underlying issues in the case, \n     but which can be used to press government witnesses to either \n     disclose information they would prefer to keep confidential \n     or make it appear that they are concealing facts. The \n     alternative is to lengthen criminal trials beyond what is \n     tolerable by vetting topics in closed sessions before they \n     can be presented in open ones.\n       In June, Attorney General Eric Holder announced the \n     transfer of Ahmed Ghailani to this country from Guantanamo. \n     Mr. Ghailani was indicted in connection with the 1998 bombing \n     of U.S. Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania. He was captured in \n     2004, after others had already been tried here for that \n     bombing.\n       Mr. Ghailani was to be tried before a military commission \n     for that and other war crimes committed afterward, but when \n     the Obama administration elected to close Guantanamo, the \n     existing indictment against Mr. Ghailani in New York \n     apparently seemed to offer an attractive alternative. It may \n     be as well that prosecuting Mr. Ghailani in an already \n     pending case in New York was seen as an opportunity to \n     illustrate how readily those at Guantanamo might be \n     prosecuted in civilian courts. After all, as Mr. Holder said \n     in his June announcement, four defendants were ``successfully \n     prosecuted'' in that case.\n       It is certainly true that four defendants already were \n     tried and sentenced in that case. But the proceedings were \n     far from exemplary. The jury declined to impose the death \n     penalty, which requires unanimity, when one juror disclosed \n     at the end of the trial that he could not impose the death \n     penalty--even though he had sworn previously that he could. \n     Despite his disclosure, the juror was permitted to serve and \n     render a verdict.\n       Mr. Holder failed to mention it, but there was also a fifth \n     defendant in the case, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim. He never \n     participated in the trial. Why? Because, before it began, in \n     a foiled attempt to escape a maximum security prison, he \n     sharpened a plastic comb into a weapon and drove it through \n     the eye and into the brain of Louis Pepe, a 42-year-old \n     Bureau of Prisons guard. Mr. Pepe was blinded in one eye and \n     rendered nearly unable to speak.\n\n[[Page S10622]]\n\n       Salim was prosecuted separately for that crime and found \n     guilty of attempted murder. There are many words one might \n     use to describe how these events unfolded; ``successfully'' \n     is not among them.\n       The very length of Mr. Ghailani's detention prior to being \n     brought here for prosecution presents difficult issues. The \n     Speedy Trial Act requires that those charged be tried within \n     a relatively short time after they are charged or captured, \n     whichever comes last. Even if the pending charge against Mr. \n     Ghailani is not dismissed for violation of that statute, he \n     may well seek access to what the government knows of his \n     activities after the embassy bombings, even if those \n     activities are not charged in the pending indictment. Such \n     disclosures could seriously compromise sources and methods of \n     intelligence gathering.\n       Finally, the government (for undisclosed reasons) has \n     chosen not to seek the death penalty against Mr. Ghailani, \n     even though that penalty was sought, albeit unsuccessfully, \n     against those who stood trial earlier. The embassy bombings \n     killed more than 200 people.\n       Although the jury in the earlier case declined to sentence \n     the defendants to death, that determination does not bind a \n     future jury. However, when the government determines not to \n     seek the death penalty against a defendant charged with \n     complicity in the murder of hundreds, that potentially \n     distorts every future capital case the government prosecutes. \n     Put simply, once the government decides not to seek the death \n     penalty against a defendant charged with mass murder, how can \n     it justify seeking the death penalty against anyone charged \n     with murder--however atrocious--on a smaller scale?\n       Even a successful prosecution of Mr. Ghailani, with none of \n     the possible obstacles described earlier, would offer no \n     example of how the cases against other Guantanamo detainees \n     can be handled. The embassy bombing case was investigated for \n     prosecution in a court, with all of the safeguards in \n     handling evidence and securing witnesses that attend such a \n     prosecution. By contrast, the charges against other detainees \n     have not been so investigated.\n       It was anticipated that if those detainees were to be tried \n     at all, it would be before a military commission where the \n     touchstone for admissibility of evidence was simply relevance \n     and apparent reliability. Thus, the circumstances of their \n     capture on the battlefield could be described by affidavit if \n     necessary, without bringing to court the particular soldier \n     or unit that effected the capture, so long as the affidavit \n     and surrounding circumstances appeared reliable. No such \n     procedure would be permitted in an ordinary civilian court.\n       Moreover, it appears likely that certain charges could not \n     be presented in a civilian court because the proof that would \n     have to be offered could, if publicly disclosed, compromise \n     sources and methods of intelligence gathering. The military \n     commissions regimen established for use at Guantanamo was \n     designed with such considerations in mind. It provided a way \n     of handling classified information so as to make it available \n     to a defendant's counsel while preserving confidentiality. \n     The courtroom facility at Guantanamo was constructed, at a \n     cost of millions of dollars, specifically to accommodate the \n     handling of classified information and the heightened \n     security needs of a trial of such defendants.\n       Nevertheless, critics of Guantanamo seem to believe that if \n     we put our vaunted civilian justice system on display in \n     these cases, then we will reap benefits in the coin of world \n     opinion, and perhaps even in that part of the world that \n     wishes us ill. Of course, we did just that after the first \n     World Trade Center bombing, after the plot to blow up \n     airliners over the Pacific, and after the embassy bombings in \n     Kenya and Tanzania.\n       In return, we got the 9/11 attacks and the murder of nearly \n     3,000 innocents. True, this won us a great deal of goodwill \n     abroad--people around the globe lined up for blocks outside \n     our embassies to sign the condolence books. That is the kind \n     of goodwill we can do without.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                        Campaign Finance Reform\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am joined by my friend and colleague and \nfellow warrior, Senator Feingold. He and I both have some remarks to \nmake. I was chosen to go first, and then Senator Feingold, I know, will \nalso want to address what we think is a very important issue. This is \nthe issue of the U.S. Supreme Court case Citizens United v. Federal \nElection Commission.\n\n  On September 9, the U.S. Supreme Court heard oral arguments from both \nsides in the Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. The \nimplications of this case are very serious, and the Supreme Court's \ndecision could result in the unraveling of over 100 years of \ncongressional action and judicial precedent with respect to corporate \nspending in political campaigns. Senator Feingold and I were present in \nthe Supreme Court chamber for the arguments in this case. I commend \nboth sides for presenting their case in a thoughtful, intelligent \nmanner. However, there was one part of the argument I found \nparticularly disturbing.\n  While responding to a question from Justice Alito, the Solicitor \nGeneral was interrupted by Justice Scalia, who said:\n\n       Congress has a self-interest. I mean, we--we are suspicious \n     of Congressional action in the First Amendment area precisely \n     because we--at least I am--\n\n  Here is the interesting part, when Justice Scalia said:\n\n       I doubt that one can expect a body of incumbents to draw \n     election restrictions that do not favor incumbents. Now is \n     that excessively cynical of me? I don't think so.\n\n  Yes, I think it is excessively cynical. I take great exception to \nJustice Scalia's statement, as should every Member of both Houses of \nCongress. It is an affront to the thousands of good, decent, honorable \nmen and women who have served this Nation in these Halls for well over \n200 years. Not only was Justice Scalia's statement excessively cynical, \nit showed his unfortunate lack of understanding of the facts and \nhistory of campaign reform. Throughout our history, America has faced \nperiods of political corruption, and in every instance, Congress has \nrisen above its own self-interest and enacted the necessary reforms to \naddress the scandals and corruption that have plagued our democratic \ninstitutions over time and throughout our history. The Tillman Act in \n1907, the Publicity Act of 1910, the Federal Corrupt Practices Act in \n1925, the Public Utilities Holding Act in 1935, the Hatch Act in 1939, \nthe Smith-Connelly Act in 1943, the Taft-Hartley Act of 1947, the Long \nAct in 1968, the Federal Election Campaign Act in 1974, and the \nbipartisan Campaign Reform Act in 2002 are just some of the reforms \nenacted by Congress over the years to address corruption in our \ngovernment and in our campaigns.\n  Simply put, history has proven Justice Scalia wrong in his assessment \nthat Congress will not act in anything but a self-serving manner.\n  Justice Scalia's statement was also remarkable in that it exposed his \nbelief that when it comes to issues relating to campaign reform, he \nsomehow is a better arbiter of what is needed to reform the electoral \nprocess than the Congress or the American people. With all due respect, \nthat is not the job of the judicial branch. Judges who stray beyond \ntheir constitutional role to try and take Congress's place as \npolicymakers falsely believe that judges somehow have a greater insight \ninto what legislation is necessary and proper than representatives who \nare duly elected by the people and accountable to them every several \nyears.\n  Activist judges--regardless of whether it is liberal or conservative \nactivism--assume the judiciary is a superlegislature of moral \nphilosophers, entitled to support Congress's policy choices whenever \nthey choose. I believe this judicial activism is wrong and is contrary \nto the Constitution.\n  Our Constitution is very clear in its delineation and dispersement of \npower. It solely tasks the Congress with creating law, not the courts. \nI have a long history of opposing activist judges. Judicial activism \ndemonstrates a lack of respect for the popular will, and that is at \nfundamental odds with our republican system of government. I believe a \njudge should seek to uphold all acts of Congress and State \nlegislatures, unless they clearly violate a specific section of the \nConstitution, and refrain from interpreting the law in a manner which \ncreates new law. That is a fundamentally conservative position I have \nheld throughout my career. I wish Justice Scalia shared that position.\n  Let us be very clear. At stake in the Citizens United case are the \nvoices of millions and millions of Americans that could be drowned out \nby large corporations if the decades-old restrictions on corporate \nelectioneering are rescinded. Overturning Supreme Court precedent would \nopen the floodgates to unlimited corporate and union spending during \nelections and undermine election laws across the country. Those able to \nspend tens of millions of dollars, such as a Fortune 500 company or a \nbig labor union, are much more likely to be heard during an election \nthan the average American voter is. For this reason, I have always \nadvocated laws that would prevent big-moneyed special interests from \ndrowning out the voices of individual American citizens in elections \nand dominating the decisionmaking process of our government.\n\n[[Page S10623]]\n\nContrary to some of my critics, I am a firm believer in the first \namendment.\n  For more than 100 years, laws have stood to limit corporate donations \nto political candidates and campaigns--for more than 100 years. The \nconcern about corporate involvement in campaigns is not new in America. \nOn September 3, 1897, in a speech on government and citizenship, Elihu \nRoot, who would go on to become Theodore Roosevelt's Secretary of State \nand a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said:\n\n       The idea . . . is to prevent the great moneyed corporations \n     of the country from furnishing the money with which to elect \n     members of the legislature . . . in order that those members \n     of the legislature may vote to protect the corporations. It \n     is to prevent the great railroad companies, the great \n     insurance companies, the great telephone companies, the great \n     aggregations of wealth, from using their corporate funds, \n     directly or indirectly, to send members of the legislature to \n     these halls, in order to vote for their protection and the \n     advancement of their interests as against those of the \n     public.\n       It strikes, Mr. Chairman, at a constantly growing evil in \n     our political affairs, which has, in my judgment, done more \n     to shake the confidence of the plain people of small means in \n     our political institutions, than any other practice which has \n     ever obtained since the foundation of our government.\n\n  Remember, this was in 1897. He went on to say:\n\n       And I believe that the time has come when something ought \n     to be done to put a check upon the giving of $50,000 or \n     $100,000 by a great corporation toward political purposes, \n     upon the understanding that a debt is created from a \n     political party to it; a debt to be recognized and repaid \n     with the votes of representatives in the legislature and in \n     Congress, or by the action of administrative or executive \n     officers who have been elected in a measure through the use \n     of the money so contributed.\n\n  Additionally, one can make the case that the concern about corporate \ninfluence extends as far back as our Founding Fathers. In 1816, Thomas \nJefferson wrote:\n\n       I hope we shall crush in its birth the aristocracy of our \n     moneyed corporations which dare already to challenge our \n     government in a trial of strength, and bid defiance to the \n     laws of our country.\n\n  Kentucky was the first State to ban corporations from spending their \nfunds in State elections in 1891, and by 1897 Florida, Missouri, \nNebraska, and Tennessee had all enacted similar corporate spending \nprohibitions in their State elections. While some States began enacting \nlimits on the influence of money on politics during the Civil War era, \nCongress did not begin to pass major campaign finance regulations until \nsome decades later. By that time, political contributions by major \ncorporate interests and business leaders dominated campaign \nfundraising, and this development sparked the first major movement for \nnational reform.\n  Progressive reformers, such as President Theodore Roosevelt and \ninvestigative journalists, charged that these business interests were \nattempting to gain special access and favors; thereby, corrupting the \ndemocratic process. This reform movement, combined with allegations of \nfinancial impropriety in the 1904 Presidential election, resulted in \nthe enactment of significant reforms.\n  On October 1, 1904, Joseph Pulitzer published an editorial in the New \nYork World questioning President Roosevelt's ties to many of the large \ncorporations that had donated to his campaign. Those questions led \nRoosevelt's opponent, Judge Alton Parker, to describe the donations as \nblackmail and insinuated there was a quid pro quo involved. President \nRoosevelt responded angrily, calling the accusations monstrous and \nsaid:\n\n       The assertion that there has been any blackmail, direct or \n     indirect . . . is a falsehood. The assertion that there has \n     been made any pledge or promise or that there has been any \n     understanding as to future immunities or benefits, in \n     recognition from any source is a wicked falsehood.\n\n  President Roosevelt, not wanting to give the appearance of improper \ninfluence, directed his staff to return a $100,000 contribution from \nthe Standard Oil Corporation. In his memo he wrote:\n\n       We cannot under any circumstances afford to take a \n     contribution which can be even improperly construed as \n     putting us under an improper obligation.\n\n  The allegations of impropriety also led Roosevelt to call for an end \nto corporate donations to campaigns. In his fifth annual message to the \nCongress on December 5, 1905, Roosevelt said:\n\n       The power of the Government to protect the integrity of the \n     elections of its own officials is inherent and has been \n     recognized and affirmed by repeated declarations of the \n     Supreme Court. There is no enemy of free government more \n     dangerous and none so insidious as the corruption of the \n     electorate.\n\n  He warned:\n\n       If [legislators] are extorted by any kind of pressure or \n     promise, express or implied, direct or indirect, in the way \n     of favor or immunity, then the giving or receiving becomes \n     not only improper but criminal. All contributions by \n     corporations to any political committee or for any political \n     purpose should be forbidden by law; directors should not be \n     permitted to use stockholders money for such purposes; and, \n     moreover, a prohibition of this kind would be, as far as it \n     went, an effective method of stopping the evils aimed at in \n     the corrupt practices acts. Not only should both the national \n     and the several State legislatures forbid any officer of a \n     corporation from using the money of the corporation in or \n     about any election, but they should also forbid such use of \n     money in connection with any legislation.\n\n  Again, the following year, in his sixth annual message to Congress in \nDecember 1906, President Roosevelt tried to limit corporate influence, \nstating:\n\n       I again recommend a law prohibiting all corporations from \n     contributing to the campaign expenses of any party. Such a \n     bill has already passed one House of Congress. Let \n     individuals contribute as they desire . . .\n\n  I repeat what he said:\n\n       Let individuals contribute as they desire; but let us \n     prohibit in effective fashion all corporations from making \n     contributions for any political purpose, directly or \n     indirectly.\n\n  In January 1907, Theodore Roosevelt signed into law the Tillman Act. \nThis law prohibited nationally chartered banks and corporations from \ncontributing to campaigns. In the report to accompany the Senate \nversion of the legislation, dated April 27, 1906, the Senate Committee \non Privileges and Elections wrote:\n\n       The evils of the use of money in connection with political \n     elections are so generally recognized that the committee \n     deems it unnecessary to make any argument in favor of the \n     general purpose of this measure. It is in the interest of \n     good government and calculated to promote purity in the \n     selection of public officials.''\n\n  Following passage of the Tillman Act, Roosevelt again addressed the \nissue in his Seventh Annual Message to Congress in December, 1907. He \nsaid:\n\n       Under our form of government voting is not merely a right \n     but a duty, and, moreover, a fundamental and necessary duty \n     if a man is to be a good citizen. It is well to provide that \n     corporations shall not contribute to Presidential or National \n     campaigns, and furthermore to provide for the publication of \n     both contributions and expenditures.\n\n  Although the Tillman Act constituted a landmark in Federal law, \naccording to campaign finance expert Anthony Corrado, ``its adoption \ndid not quell the cries for reform. Eliminating corporate influence was \nonly one of the ideas being advanced at this time to clean up political \nfinance.'' In the years following the passage of the Tillman Act, \nreducing the influence of wealthy individuals and labor unions became a \nconcern and reformers pushed for further limits on donations.\n  Consequently, in 1947, Congress enacted the Taft-Hartley Act, which \nexplicitly banned corporate and labor union expenditures in Federal \ncampaigns. In doing so, Senator Robert Taft made clear that the purpose \nof the new language was simply to affirm what had been understood to \nalways be the case--that the 1907 corporate ban had prohibited \ncorporate expenditures, or indirect contributions, as well as direct \ncorporate contributions.\n  A ban on corporate expenditures in campaigns has been consistently \nupheld by the Supreme Court as constitutional and as ``firmly embedded \nin our law.''\n  The constitutionality of the ban on corporate campaign expenditures \nwas upheld by the Supreme Court in the Austin v. Michigan Chamber of \nCommerce decision in 1990 and reaffirmed by the Court in the McConnell \nv. Federal Election Commission decision in 2003. And the corporate \nexpenditure ban had been commented on favorably by the Court in earlier \ncases.\n  In 1990, in the Austin case, the Supreme Court acknowledged the \nimportance of maintaining the integrity of the political process. From \nthe Court's opinion:\n\n       Michigan identified as a serious danger the significant \n     possibility that corporate political expenditures will \n     undermine the integrity of the political process, and it has \n     implemented a narrowly tailored solution to that problem. By \n     requiring corporations to make all independent political \n     expenditures\n\n[[Page S10624]]\n\n     through a separate fund made up of money solicited expressly \n     for political purposes, the Michigan Campaign Finance Act \n     reduces the threat that huge corporate treasuries amassed \n     with the aid of favorable state laws will be used to \n     influence unfairly the outcome of elections.\n\n  In the McConnell case, the Supreme Court recognized its long-standing \nsupport for the constitutionality of bans on corporate campaign \nexpenditures going back to its Buckley decision in 1976. From the \nCourt's decision:\n\n       Since our decision in Buckley, Congress' power to prohibit \n     corporations and unions from using funds in their treasuries \n     to finance advertisements expressly advocating the election \n     or defeat of candidates in federal elections has been firmly \n     embedded in our law.\n\n  Additionally, in 1982, in the National Right to Work Committee case, \nthe Supreme Court, in an opinion authored by Chief Justice William \nRhenquist, stated regarding the Federal ban on corporate and labor \nunion expenditures:\n\n       The careful legislative adjustment of the federal electoral \n     laws, in a cautious advance, step by step, to account for the \n     particular legal and economic attributes of corporations and \n     labor organizations warrants considerable deference. [I]t \n     also reflects a permissible assessment of the dangers posed \n     by those entities to the electoral process.\n       In order to prevent both actual and apparent corruption, \n     Congress aimed a part of its regulatory scheme at \n     corporations. The statute reflects a legislative judgment \n     that the special characteristics of the corporate structure \n     require particularly careful regulation. Nor will we second \n     guess a legislative determination as to the need for \n     prophylactic measures where corruption is the evil feared. As \n     we said in California Medical Association v. FEC, the \n     ``differing structures and purposes; of different entities \n     `may require different forms of regulation in order to \n     protect the integrity of the electoral process . . .' ''\n       The governmental interest in preventing both actual \n     corruption and the appearance of corruption of elected \n     representatives has long been recognized, First National Bank \n     of Boston v. Bellotti, supra, and there is no reason why it \n     may not in this case be accomplished by treating unions, \n     corporations and similar organizations different from \n     individuals.\n\n  In 1986, in the Massachusetts Citizens for Life case, the Supreme \nCourt stated regarding the Federal ban on corporate expenditures in \ncampaigns:\n\n       This concern over the corrosive influence of concentrated \n     corporate wealth reflects the conviction that it is important \n     to protect the integrity of the marketplace of political \n     ideas . . . Direct corporate spending on political activity \n     raises the prospect that resources amassed in the economic \n     marketplace may be used to provide an unfair advantage in the \n     political marketplace . . . The resources in the treasury of \n     a business corporation . . . are not an indication of popular \n     support for the corporation's political ideas. They reflect \n     instead the economically motivated decisions of investors and \n     customers. The availability of these resources may make a \n     corporation a formidable political presence, even though the \n     power of the corporation may be no reflection of the power of \n     its ideas.\n       By requiring that corporate independent expenditures be \n     financed through a political committee expressly established \n     to engage in campaign spending, section 441b seeks to prevent \n     this threat to the political marketplace. The resources \n     available to this fund, as opposed to the corporate treasury, \n     in fact reflect popular support for the political positions \n     of the committee.\n\n  If anyone has doubts about the influence of big-moneyed special \ninterests on policy makers in this town, let me relay a personal \nobservation. During the Senate Commerce Committee's consideration of \nthe 1996 Telecommunications Act, every company affected by the \nlegislation had purchased a seat at the table with soft money. \nConsequently, the bill attempted to protect them all, a goal that is \nobviously incompatible with competition. Consumers, who only give us \ntheir votes, had no seat at the table, and the lower prices that \ncompetition produces never materialized. Cable rates went up. Phone \nrates went up. And huge broadcasting giants received billions of \ndollars in digital spectrum, property that belonged to the American \npeople, for free. They got it for free, billions of dollars worth of \nspectrum.\n  Information gathered from various sources in the press at the time \nindicated that the special interest groups involved spent nearly $150 \nmillion to lobby Congress on telecommunications reform--and they all \ncame out on top--at the expense of the American consumer.\n  Similarly, the pharmaceutical industry has spent millions of dollars \nto sway lawmakers against the idea of drug importation. In the 2008 \nelection cycle, pharmaceutical companies gave almost $30 million in \ncampaign contributions to Members of Congress. Just this year, \naccording to an article published in the June 3 edition of The Hill, \nthe prescription drug industry has given more than one million dollars \nto both Republicans and Democrats. And these contributions were from \nthe limited funds of corporate PACs--a fraction of the flood of money \nthat could be spent out of corporate treasuries if the Supreme Court \nchanges the law by judicial fiat.\n\n  As my colleagues know, for many years my colleague from Wisconsin, \nSenator Feingold and I fought to ban soft money--the large, unregulated \ndonations from corporations, labor unions, and wealthy individuals--\nfrom Federal elections. As the sponsors of the Bipartisan Campaign \nFinance Reform Act, we submitted, together with our colleagues from the \nHouse, Representatives Shays and Meehan, a brief for the court. In this \nbrief we stated:\n\n       More fundamentally, Austin and McConnell were correctly \n     decided. Unlimited expenditures supporting or opposing \n     candidates may create at least the appearance of corruption, \n     as Caperton v. A.T. Massey Coal Co. illustrates. The \n     tremendous resources business corporations and unions can \n     bring to bear on elections, and the greater magnitude of the \n     resulting apparent corruption, amply justify treating \n     corporate and union expenditures differently from those by \n     individuals and ideological nonprofit groups.\n       So, too, does the countervailing free-speech interest of \n     the many shareholders who may not wish to support corporate \n     electioneering but have no effective means of controlling \n     what corporations do with what is ultimately the \n     shareholders' money. Austin was rightly concerned with the \n     corruption of the system that will result if campaign \n     discourse becomes dominated not by individual citizens--whose \n     right it is to select their political representatives--but by \n     corporate and union war-chests amassed as a result of the \n     special benefits the government confers on these artificial \n     ``persons.'' That concern remains a compelling justification \n     for restrictions on using corporate treasury funds for \n     electoral advocacy--constraints that ban no speech but only \n     require that it be funded by individuals who have chosen to \n     do so.\n       The holdings of Austin and McConnell--that it is \n     constitutional to require business corporations to use \n     segregated funds contributed by shareholders, officers and \n     employees for express candidate advocacy or its functional \n     equivalent--remain sound today. The interests in preventing \n     actual or apparent corruption of the electoral process and \n     protecting shareholders provide compelling justification for \n     such requirements, which neither unduly burden nor \n     overbroadly inhibit protected speech.\n       The corporate PAC option, moreover, is ideally suited to \n     balancing the First Amendment interests of corporate entities \n     and their shareholders. It allows the corporation to direct \n     political spending only to the extent shareholders have \n     personally decided to contribute for that specific purpose. \n     It thus ensures that the corporation may have a voice, but \n     one that is not subsidized unwillingly by those who may \n     disagree with its electoral message. And there is no basis in \n     the record for concluding that PACs are inadequate or unduly \n     burdensome for business corporations, whatever may be true of \n     certain ideological nonprofit corporations. Indeed, PAC \n     requirements pale in comparison with the detailed \n     recordkeeping and accounting otherwise required of \n     corporations and unions.\n\n  The ability of corporate campaign expenditures to buy influence with \nFederal officeholders, and to create the appearance of such influence-\nbuying is sadly evident in nearly every aspect of the legislative \nprocess. This fact was recognized in the McConnell case.\n  The brief filed in the McConnell case by me and my colleagues stated:\n\n       Not surprisingly, the McConnell record provided strong \n     corroboration that corporate and union expenditures on ads \n     that were the functional equivalent of express advocacy \n     created the appearance of corruption. Based on that record, \n     Judge Kollar-Kotelly found that such expenditures ``permit \n     corporations and labor unions to inject immense aggregations \n     of wealth into the process'' and ``radically distort the \n     electoral landscape.'' She further found that candidates are \n     ``acutely aware of'' and ``appreciate'' such expenditures, \n     and ``feel indebted to those who spend money to help get them \n     elected.'' She concluded that ``the record demonstrates that \n     candidates and parties appreciate and encourage corporations \n     and labor unions to deploy their large aggregations of wealth \n     into the political process,'' and that ``the record presents \n     an appearance of corruption stemming from the dependence of \n     officeholders and parties on advertisements run by these \n     outside groups.''\n\n  According to the Solicitor General's brief, the record in the \nMcConnell case showed that:\n\n       Federal officeholders and candidates were aware of and felt \n     indebted to corporations\n\n[[Page S10625]]\n\n     and unions that financed electioneering advertisements on \n     their behalf or against their opponents.\n\n  The brief further stated:\n\n       [T]he record compiled in the McConnell case indicated that \n     corporate spending on candidate-related speech, even if \n     conducted independent of candidates, had come to be used as a \n     means of currying favor with and attempting to influence \n     Federal office-holders.\n\n  It is important for us to remember that this case does not affect \nsolely the integrity of Federal elections. The States also have a great \ndeal at stake in this case. In a brief filed in the Citizens United \ncase, 26 State attorneys general wrote that ``Courts have repeatedly \nupheld these State and Federal corporate electioneering restrictions \nfrom their inception.''\n  In their brief, the attorneys general wrote:\n\n       This case does not concern the traditional regulation of \n     corporate spending by State Laws. Instead it presents the \n     application of a recent Federal statute to a novel form of \n     political campaigning through the medium of video-on-demand \n     and the message of a ninety-minute film. These and other \n     political campaign innovations present an occasion to draw on \n     State law experiments, not end them. The court cannot reach \n     the validity of these laws under Austin without departing \n     from its conventional approach to constitutional avoidance \n     and as-applied review of campaign finance statutes, and \n     ignoring its cautions against facial challenges in election \n     law generally.\n       Austin follows a century of campaign finance law at the \n     State and Federal level honed by six decades of this Court's \n     holdings. Those decisions, and the State and Federal laws \n     that gave rise to and rely on them, delineate a workable \n     segregated-fund requirement for corporate electioneering that \n     is embedded in campaign laws and practice at the Federal and \n     State level. While imposing minimal burdens on corporations, \n     the segregated fund protects the integrity of the political \n     process from the corrupting influence of corporate executives \n     funding political campaigns that have no proven support from \n     the shareholders or customers whose money pays for the \n     advocacy. The flourishing of corporate speech through PACs, \n     and continued harms of direct corporate electioneering, has \n     vindicated rather than undermined Austin's approval of \n     segregated funds.\n\n  It is clear that the Austin and McConnell cases were correctly \ndecided on the merits and those decisions remain sound today. According \nto the brief filed by the U.S. Solicitor General:\n\n       The Court in Austin held that corporations may \n     constitutionally be prohibited from financing electoral \n     advocacy with funds derived from business activities. That \n     holding was correct when issued and should not be overturned \n     now. Use of corporate treasury funds for electoral advocacy \n     is inherently likely to corrode the political system both by \n     actually corrupting political officeholders and by creating \n     the appearance of corruption. Moreover, such use of corporate \n     funds diverts shareholders' money to the support of \n     candidates who the shareholders may oppose.\n       Congress's interest in preventing these pernicious \n     consequences is compelling, and Congress has chosen a valid \n     message of achieving it, requiring a corporation to fund its \n     electoral advocacy through the voluntary contributions of \n     officers and shareholders who agree with its political \n     statements.\n\n  The Solicitor General's brief further stated:\n\n       Corporate participation in candidate elections creates a \n     substantial risk of corruption or the appearance thereof. \n     Corporations can use electoral spending to curry favor with \n     particular candidates and thus to acquire undue influence \n     over the candidates' behavior once in office.\n       The record in McConnell, which is by far the most extensive \n     body of evidence ever compiled on these issues, indicates \n     that during the period leading up to BCRA's enactment, \n     Federal office-holders and candidates were aware of and felt \n     indebted to corporations and unions that financed \n     electioneering advertisements on their behalf or against \n     their opponents.\n       The nature of business corporations makes corporate \n     political activity inherently more likely than individual \n     advocacy to cause quid pro quo corruption or the appearance \n     of such corruption. Even minor modifications in complex \n     legislation have great potential to benefit or burden \n     particular companies, industries, or sectors. The economic \n     stake of corporations in the nuances of such matters as \n     industry-specific tax credits, subsidies, or tariffs \n     generally dwarfs that of any set of individuals.\n       And when those benefits can be obtained through a game of \n     ``pay to play,'' corporations are better suited than \n     individuals to afford the ante. Corporate managers need not \n     assemble a coalition of the like-minded; they can draw on the \n     firm's entire capitalization without seeking the approval of \n     shareholders. If only businesses can afford the investment \n     necessary to pursue rents in this way, only businesses can \n     reap the (even larger) reward. And the public perception that \n     businesses reap such rewards from legislators whom they \n     support in campaigns creates an appearance of corruption that \n     corrodes popular confidence in our democracy.\n\n  At the heart of the Citizens United case is a critical question: Do \nthe cherished individual rights protected by the Constitution extend in \nthe same manner to corporations? Corporations, after all, are \nartificial creations of law, provided for by acts of Congress and the \nState legislaturs, and endowed under these laws with perpetual \nexistence, special tax status, and other privileges, all for the sole \npurpose of economic gain. The resolution of this question in the \naffirmative will have wide-ranging and unpredictable results for our \nlegal system.\n  For example, if the Court determines corporations have first \namendment rights, it will be logical that corporations also have fifth \namendment rights against self-incrimination. Is a corporation ``endowed \nby its creator with inalienable rights''? Just last year the Court \nfound that the second amendment right to bear arms is a personal right. \nIf the Court were to determine that corporations had the same rights as \npersons, would corporations have the right to arm themselves? Would \nlobbies of Fortune 500 companies contain grand weapon caches? The \nabsurdity of the argument should be apparent to the members of the \nCourt.\n  John Marshall, former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, wrote in \n1819 that corporations were ``an artificial being, invisible, \nintangible.'' Therefore, he stated, ``Being the more creature of law, \nit possesses only those properties which the charter of its creation \nconfers upon it, either expressly or as incidental to its very \nexistence.''\n  Essential to a corporation's existence is a first amendment right to \nspeak about their products and services. Essential to a corporation's \nexistence is the right to sue for the theft of its intellectual \nproperty. Essential to a corporation's existence is the right to enter \ninto contracts. Not essential to a corporation's existence is the \nability to contribute unlimited funds to political candidates.\n  It is for this reason and others that the Supreme Court has \nrepeatedly and consistently upheld a ban on direct contributions to \npolitical candidates by corporations and unions. Chief Justice Roberts \nstated at one point during the argument in the Citizens United case \nthat: ``We do not put our First Amendment rights in the hands of FEC \nbureaucrats.'' I agree. And that is why the Court has repeatedly upheld \nbans passed by the Congress of the United States and by the State \nlegislators on unlimited corporate or union spending in elections.\n  Under current law, corporations are free to give to political \ncandidates through political action committees. In an editorial in the \nBoston Globe entitled ``Corporations Aren't People Yet,'' the editorial \nboard rightly states: ``Even under current financial restrictions, \nhealth care industry groups are pouring millions of dollars into \nCongressional campaigns in the hope of thwarting reforms that might \nconstrain their members.''\n  A September 10, 2009 editorial in the Philadelphia Inquirer stated:\n\n       Allowing corporations to flood elections with their \n     aggregate corporate wealth would place a heavy thumb on the \n     scales of democracy. If a certain industry did not like the \n     way a Senator voted on environmental regulations, for \n     example, there would be nothing to stop that industry from \n     dumping $200 million into the campaign of that Senator's \n     opponent.\n\n  The editorial goes on to say:\n\n       If the high court rules now that corporations have the same \n     political speech rights as individuals, average citizens will \n     have that much more trouble being heard . . . the distinction \n     between corporate speech and individual speech is clear \n     enough, and the importance of limiting the undue influence of \n     money and politics is significant enough that the court, in \n     all its wisdom, should leave well enough alone.\n\n  I agree.\n  In conclusion, the Court should not overturn precedent and Congress's \nclear intent to limit corporate contributions to political candidates. \nIn summary, there are three simple points raised by the Court's \nconsideration of the Citizens United case. First, whatever one thinks \nof a first amendment right for corporations, it is not appropriate for \na nondemocratic branch of government to raise a question of the \nbroadest scope at the last minute when\n\n[[Page S10626]]\n\nsuch a question was not raised in the trial court and there is no \nability to build a record.\n  Congress is the most democratically elected branch of government and \nshould be able to make laws that do not stand in the face of the \nConstitution whether or not the members of the Court would themselves \nsupport such legislation if they served in the elected branches of \ngovernment.\n  Secondly, the principle enshrined in law for many years was that \ncorporations, because of their artificial legal nature and special \nprivileges, including perpetual existence, pose a unique threat to our \ndemocracy. However, the current court seems poised to find that Thomas \nJefferson, Theodore Roosevelt, and others were wrong despite there \nbeing no record built on this point in this case. In McConnell, there \nwas a record built to support the decision. Here, the trial court never \nexamined the idea of corporations having broad first amendment rights. \nThe Court is reaching to find such a conclusion as part of the Citizens \nUnited case.\n  Lastly, I stress again to my colleagues the implications of the \ndecision the Court may reach in this case. The Court is considering a \nquestion that may lead to corporations being treated as ``persons'' \nunder the Constitution, would allow corporations to assert a fifth \namendment right to refuse to testify under oath and to keep documents \nfrom lawful investigations, and would allow corporations to be subject \nto individual tax brackets.\n  Are my colleagues prepared to provide such rights to corporations? \nAre my colleagues prepared to pass legislation that taxes corporations \nand persons at the same rate? If the Court provides full first \namendment rights to corporations, there is no reason that corporations \ncould not receive the benefits as well as the responsibilities of being \na person.\n  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote in the McConnell decision, and I \nthink with such accuracy, that ``money, like water, will always find an \noutlet,'' and that the government was therefore justified in taking \nsteps to prevent schemes developed to get around the contribution \nlimits. Again, Justice O'Connor knew better than most jurists, as a \nformer Arizona State Senator, and majority leader of the Arizona State \nSenate. I hope and wish that the current Court heeds the words of this \nbrilliant jurist who had real-life experiences in politics.\n  Needless to say, I am very concerned about the integrity of our \nelections should the Supreme Court rule to overturn the Austin \ndecision. I sincerely hope that the Justices will practice restraint \nand rule in a manner consistent with judicial precedent and the \nConstitution of the United States of America.\n  I again want to, as I have on many occasions, thank my friend from \nWisconsin, a man of courage and a man of integrity, and a man I have \nalways been proud to be associated with on issues such as these that \nare important to the integrity of the institution that we both try to \nserve with honor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Arizona for all \nthe work he has done over these many years to improve our campaign \nfinance system. We have been partners in this effort for over a decade. \nIn fact, it will soon be 15 years. Of course, there is no one in this \nbody whom I admire more than John McCain. \n  In early September, Senator McCain and I had the opportunity to walk \nacross the street to the Supreme Court and hear the oral argument in \nthe Citizens United case. It was a morning of firsts: The first case \nthat Justice Sonia Sotomayor has heard since the Senate confirmed her \nnomination to become only the third woman to sit on our Nation's \nhighest court. And the first oral argument that Solicitor General Elena \nKagan has done since becoming the first woman to hold that important \nposition in our government.\n  And it was the first time since the Tillman Act was passed in 1907 \nprohibiting spending by corporations on elections, and the Taft-Hartley \nAct in 1947 clarified and strengthened that prohibition, that a \nmajority of the Court has suggested it is prepared to hold that \nCongress and the many State legislatures that have passed similar laws \nhave violated the Constitution. Such a decision could have a truly \ncalamitous impact on our democracy.\n  Until a few months ago, as the Senator from Arizona pointed out, no \none had any idea that the Citizens United case would potentially become \nthe vehicle for such a wholesale uprooting of the principles that have \ngoverned the financing of our elections for so long. The case started \nout as a simple challenge to the application of title II of the law \nthat Senator McCain and I sponsored, the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act \nof 2002. The issue was whether the provisions of BCRA relating to so-\ncalled issue ads could constitutionally be applied to a full-length \nfeature film about then-Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The \nmovie was to be distributed solely as video on demand.\n  Yet somehow at the end of its last term, instead of deciding the case \non the basis of the briefs and arguments submitted by the parties early \nthis year, the Court reached out and asked for supplemental briefing on \nwhether it should overturn its decisions in McConnell v. FEC, the case \nthat upheld BCRA in 2003, and Austin v. Michigan Chamber of Commerce, a \n1991 decision that upheld a State statute prohibiting corporate funding \nof campaign ads expressly advocating the election or defeat of a \ncandidate. That set the stage for the recent special session to hear \nreargument in the case. And now we await the Court's verdict on whether \nthese longstanding laws will be in jeopardy.\n  I certainly hope the Court steps back from the brink. A decision to \noverturn the Austin decision would open the door to corporate spending \non elections the likes of which this Nation truly has never seen. Our \nelections would become like NASCAR races--underwritten by companies. \nOnly in this case, the corporate underwriters wouldn't just be seeking \npublicity, they would be seeking laws and policies that the candidates \nhave the power to provide.\n  We were headed well down that road in the soft money system that BCRA \nstopped. It may seem like a long time ago, but the Senator from Arizona \nand I remember that hundreds of millions of dollars were contributed by \ncorporations and unions to the political parties between 1988 and 2002. \nThe system led to scandals like the White House coffees and the sale of \novernight stays in the Lincoln bedroom. The appearance of corruption \nwas well documented in congressional hearings and fully justified the \nstep that Congress took in 2002--prohibiting the political parties from \naccepting soft money contributions.\n  Before BCRA was passed, corporations were making huge soft money \ndonations. They were also spending money on phony issue ads. That is \nwhat title II was aimed at. But what they were not doing was running \nelection ads that expressly advocated the election or defeat of a \ncandidate. That has been prohibited in this country for at least 60 \nyears, though it is arguable that the Tillman Act in 1907 prohibited it \n40 years before that. So it is possible that the Court's decision will \nnot just take us back to a pre-McCain-Feingold era, but back to the era \nof the robber baron in the 19th century. That result should frighten \nevery citizen of this country. The Court seems poised to ignite a \nrevolution in campaign financing with a stroke of its collective pen \nthat no one contemplated even 6 months ago.\n  While I have disagreed with many Supreme Court decisions, I have \ngreat respect for that institution and for the men and women who serve \non the Court. But this step would be so damaging to our democracy and \nis so unwarranted and unnecessary that I must speak out. That is why \nSenator McCain and I have taken the unusual step of coming to the floor \ntoday.\n  To overrule the Austin decision in this case, the Court would have to \nignore several time-honored principles that have served for the past \ntwo centuries to preserve the public's respect for and acceptance of \nits decisions. First, it is a basic tenet of constitutional law that \nthe Court will not decide a case on constitutional grounds unless \nabsolutely necessary, and that if there is no choice but to reach a \nconstitutional issue, the Court will decide the case as narrowly as \npossible.\n  This is the essence of what some have called ``judicial restraint.'' \nWhat seems\n\n[[Page S10627]]\n\nto be happening here though is the antithesis of judicial restraint. \nThe Court seems ready to decide the broadest possible constitutional \nquestion--the constitutionality of all restrictions on corporate \nspending in  connection with elections in an obscure case in which many \nfar more narrow rulings are possible.\n\n  The second principle is known as stare decisis, meaning that the \nCourt respects its precedents and overrules them only in the most \nunusual of cases. Chief Justice John Roberts, whom many believe to be \nthe swing justice in this case, made grand promises of what he called \n``judicial modesty,'' when he came before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee in 2005. Respect for precedent was a key component of the \napproach that he asked us to believe he possessed. Here is what he \nsaid:\n\n       I do think that it is a jolt to the legal system when you \n     overrule a precedent. Precedent plays an important role in \n     promoting stability and evenhandedness. It is not enough--and \n     the court has emphasized this on several occasions--it is not \n     enough that you may think the prior decision was wrongly \n     decided. That really doesn't answer the question, it just \n     poses the question. And you do look at these other factors, \n     like settled expectations, like the legitimacy of the court, \n     like whether a particular precedent is workable or not, \n     whether a precedent has been eroded by subsequent \n     developments. All of those factors go into the determination \n     of whether to revisit a precedent under the principles of \n     stare decisis.\n\n  So said then Judge Roberts. Talk about a jolt to the legal system. It \nis hard to imagine a bigger jolt than to strike down laws in over 20 \nStates and a Federal law that has been the cornerstone of the Nation's \ncampaign finance system for 100 years. The settled expectations that \nwould be upset by this decision are enormous. And subsequent \ndevelopments surely have not shown that the Austin decision is \nunworkable. Indeed, the Court relied on it as recently as 2003 in the \nMcConnell case and even cited it in the Wisconsin Right to Life \ndecision just 2 years ago, written by none other than Chief Justice \nRoberts. To be sure, there are Justices on the Court who dissented from \nthe Austin decision when it came down and continue to do so today. But \nif stare decisis means anything, a precedent on which so many State \nlegislatures and the American people have relied should not be cast \naside simply because a few new Justices have arrived on the Court.\n  Third, the courts decide cases only on a full evidentiary record so \nthat all sides have a chance to put forward their best arguments and \nthe court can be confident that it is making a decision based on the \nbest information available. In this case, precisely because the Supreme \nCourt reached out to pose a broad constitutional question that had not \nbeen raised below, there is no record whatsoever to which the Court can \nturn. None. The question here demands a complete record because the \nlegal standard under prevailing first amendment law is whether the \nstatute is designed to address a compelling State interest and is \nnarrowly tailored to achieve that result. My colleagues may recall that \nwhen we passed the McCain-Feingold bill, a massive legislative record \nwas developed to demonstrate the corrupting influence of soft money. \nAnd the facial constitutional challenge to that bill led to months of \ndepositions and the building of an enormous factual record for the \ncourt. None of that occurred here. And furthermore, the over 20 States \nwhose laws would be upended if Austin is overruled were given no \nopportunity to defend their legislation and show whatever legislative \nrecord had been developed when their statutes were enacted.\n  Instead, the Court seems to be ready to rely on its intuition, its \ngeneral sense of the political process. From what I observed at oral \nargument, that intuition is sorely lacking. One Justice blithely \nasserted that the 100-year-old congressional decision to bar corporate \nexpenditures must have been motivated by the self-interest of Members \nof Congress as incumbent candidates, ignoring the fact that the modern \nCongress prohibited soft money contributions even though the vast \nmajority of those contributions were used to support incumbents. \nAnother Justice opined that it was paternalistic for Congress to be \nconcerned about corporations using their shareholders' money for \npolitical purposes, even though most Americans invest through mutual \nfunds and have little or no idea what corporations their money has \nactually gone to.\n  For the Court to overrule Austin and McConnell in this case would \nrequire it to reject these three important principles of judicial \nmodesty. It would amount to the unelected branch of government reaching \nout to strike down carefully considered and longstanding judgments of \nthe most democratic branch. It would be, in my view, a completely \nimproper exercise of judicial power.\n  Let me discuss for a moment the consequences of this decision. A \nfundamental principle of our democracy is that the people elect their \nrepresentatives. Each citizen gets just one vote. Our system of \nfinancing campaigns with private money obviously gives people of means \nmore influence than average voters, but Congress over the years has \nsought to provide some reasonable limits and preserve the importance of \nindividual citizens' votes. One of the most important and longstanding \nlimits is that only individuals can contribute to candidates or spend \nmoney in support of or against candidates. Corporations and unions are \nprohibited from doing so, except through their PACs, which themselves \nraise money only from individuals. The Supreme Court may very well be \nabout to change that forever.\n  According to a 2005 IRS estimate, the total net worth of U.S. \ncorporations was $23.5 trillion, and after-tax profits were nearly $1 \ntrillion. During the 2008 election cycle, Fortune 100 companies alone \nhad profits of $605 billion. That is quite a war chest that may be soon \nunleashed on our political system. Just for comparison, spending by \ncandidates, outside groups, and political parties on the last \nPresidential election totaled just over $2 billion. Federal and State \nparties spent about $1.5 billion on all Federal elections in 2008. PACs \nspent about $1.2 billion. That usually sounds like a lot of money, but \nit is nothing compared to what corporations and unions have in their \ntreasuries. So we are talking here about a system that could very \neasily be completely transformed by corporate spending in 2010.\n  Does the Supreme Court really believe that the first amendment \nrequires the American people to accept a system where banks and \ninvestment firms, having just taken our country into its worst economic \ncollapse since the Great Depression, can spend millions upon millions \nof dollars of ads directly advocating the defeat of those candidates \nwho didn't vote to bail them out or want to prevent future economic \ndisaster by imposing strict new financial services regulations? I say \nthat because that is where we are headed. Is the Court really going to \nsay that oil companies that oppose action on global warming are \nconstitutionally entitled to spend their profits to elect candidates \nwho will oppose legislation to address that problem?\n  The average winning Senate candidate in 2008 spent $8.5 million. The \naverage House winner spent a little under $1.4 million. A single major \ncorporation could spend three or four times those amounts without \ncausing even a smudge on its balance sheet. This is not about the self-\ninterest of legislators who will undoubtedly fear the economic might \nthat might be brought against them if they vote the wrong way. This is \nabout the people they represent, who live in a democracy and who \ndeserve a political system where their views and their interests are \nnot completely drowned out by corporate spending.\n\n  At the oral arguments last month, one Justice seemed to suggest it is \nperfectly acceptable for a tobacco company to try to defeat a candidate \nwho wants to regulate tobacco and to use its shareholders' money to do \nso. This is the system the Supreme Court may bequeath to this country \nif it does not turn back.\n  Some will say that corporate interests already have too much power \nand that Members of Congress listen to the wishes of corporations \ninstead of their constituents. I will not defend the current system, \nbut I will say: Imagine how much worse things would be in a system \nwhere every decision by a Member of Congress that contradicts the \nwishes of a corporation could unleash a tsunami of negative advertising \nin the next election.\n\n[[Page S10628]]\n\n  In light of the immense wealth a corporation can bring to bear on \nsuch a project, I frankly wonder how our democracy would function under \nsuch a system. We are talking about a political system where corporate \nwealth rules in a way that we have simply never seen in our history.\n  So, once again, I certainly want to thank my friend from Arizona for \nhis friendship and his courage. We will continue to fight for a \ncampaign finance system that allows the American people's voices to be \nheard.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak in strong \nsupport of the Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act, \nintroduced by the senior Senator from Vermont, the chairman of our \nJudiciary Committee, Mr. Patrick Leahy. I believe this bill is an \nimportant part of health care reform, and I am hopeful it can be \nincluded in the final reform bill as it makes its way through this \nbody.\n  Our antitrust laws embody the proud American idea that democracy \nshapes capitalism and not vice versa; that vigorous economic \ncompetition is not an amoral, Hobbesian contest but disciplined by a \nstrong rule of law tradition; and that ours is not a society in which \nmight makes right and only the powerful write the rule book.\n  The great Supreme Court jurist and antitrust crusader William O. \nDouglas, wrote:\n\n       Industrial power should be decentralized. It should be \n     scattered into many hands so that the fortunes of the people \n     will not be dependent on the whim or caprice, the political \n     prejudices, the emotional stability of a few self-appointed \n     men. . . . That is the philosophy and the command of the \n     Sherman [Antitrust] Act.\n\n  The passage of the Sherman Antitrust Act and the Clayton Antitrust \nAct and the creation of the Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust \nDivision at the Department of Justice demonstrated a Federal commitment \nto a level economic playing field. Small businessmen and entrepreneurs, \nshouldering the enormous task of starting and sustaining a new \nenterprise, would know that powerful competitors could not collude to \nkeep them out of the market. Consumers could rest assured that prices \nwere not being fixed artificially high by scheming monopolists. Every \nindustry, ever vector of American business, was made subject to these \nrules of the road--except for one: the insurance industry.\n  In 1944, insurance companies challenged the Federal Government's very \nability to enforce antitrust laws against them, and the Supreme Court \nruled that the insurance business was subject to antitrust laws just \nlike everybody else. In response, insurance companies came to Congress, \nwhere they launched a massive lobbying campaign, pressuring Congress to \ninvalidate the Supreme Court's decision--not unlike the current \nlobbying barrage they are aiming at killing health care reform. That \ncampaign back in 1944 was successful. In March 1945, the McCarran-\nFerguson Act exempted insurance companies entirely from the reach of \nAmerica's antitrust laws. If that exemption ever made sense, it no \nlonger does, especially when it comes to health insurance coverage.\n  Today, Americans pay ever-higher premiums for less care because a \nsmall group of wealthy, powerful companies control the health insurance \nmarket. Just consider these numbers: A study by the American Medical \nAssociation shows that 94 percent of metropolitan areas--virtually \nevery one--has a health insurance market that is ``highly \nconcentrated,'' as measured by Department of Justice standards. This \nmeans that if the Department of Justice's Antitrust Division had \nenforcement authority over the health insurance industry, it would be \ncarefully scrutinizing this market for signs of anticompetitive conduct \nthat hurts consumers. But due to the antitrust exemption, the \nDepartment of Justice cannot do that job. That same study shows that, \nin 39 States 2 health insurers control at least half of the health \ninsurance market and in 9 States a single insurer controls at least 70 \npercent of the market.\n  Back in 1945, the insurance industry argued that it should be \nexempted from the antitrust laws because the market was heavily \nlocalized and not concentrated. Well, if that were true then, it is not \ntrue now.\n  Overhead for private insurers is an astounding 20 to 27 percent--\ncharges that consumers pay for in higher premiums. A Commonwealth Fund \nreport indicates that private insurer administrative costs increased \n109 percent from 2000 to 2006--109 percent in those 6 years--and the \nMcKinsey Global Institute estimates that Americans spend roughly $150 \nbillion annually on what the report calls ``excess administrative \noverhead'' in the private health insurance market. Mr. President, $150 \nbillion a year in ``excess administrative overhead.'' Clearly, this is \nnot a competitive market. If it were, companies would be driven to cut \nthese costs in order to compete effectively in the marketplace.\n  Without competition and without economic incentive to avoid massive \nadministrative costs, health insurance premiums have increased 120 \npercent--more than doubled--in one decade, while insurance industry \nprofits increased 428 percent in the same period--428 percent.\n  Doctors and other health care providers have been hurt as well. For \nmany years, United Health Care, a massive health insurance company, \nowned and operated a computerized pricing system that was used by \nalmost every other health insurer. The New York attorney general \nrecently found that the system was designed to systematically underpay \ndoctors for their services and that this had been going on for years. \nUnited Health paid $400 million to settle lawsuits by the State, but if \nthe Federal Trade Commission or the U.S. Department of Justice had \ntried to bring suit under the Federal antitrust laws, they would have \nbeen blocked by McCarran-Ferguson.\n  Finally, ironically, health insurers threaten and sue doctors all the \ntime under these same antitrust laws while protecting their own \nexemption from the laws they seek to impose on the providers and the \ndoctors whom they torment.\n  One might ask how this exemption has survived so long. A certain \nschool of political thought holds that the only proper relationship of \ngovernment to the market is hands off, that any government involvement \nin the marketplace is unnatural and unwelcome. But with respect to \nantitrust enforcement, we crossed that Rubicon long ago, and every \nindustry in the country is required to play by rules that support the \nmarket by increasing competition, again, except insurance. Experience \nin those other areas has shown that the government referee on the field \nof play creates a better environment for competition, and the public \nwins.\n\n  Think of the benefits of a competitive health insurance market. \nInsurers would have to compete on price, lowering premiums for \nindividuals and small businesses purchasing insurance, and work hard to \nlower those unnecessary administrative costs. New competitors would be \nable to enter more easily and offer better consumer service, quicker \nclaims processing, streamlined enrollment--competition that is \ndesperately needed in a market where 36 percent of physician overhead \nis consumed by fighting with the insurance industry over inappropriate \ndenial and delay of health insurance claims.\n  Senator Leahy's Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act \nwould repeal the unique and peculiar exemption for health insurance and \nmedical malpractice insurance companies. The bill ensures that these \ncompanies are no longer permitted to engage in the most egregious forms \nof antitrust violations--price fixing, bid rigging, and market \nallocations--while preserving insurers' ability to share statistical \ninformation with each other in a procompetitive manner, with \nappropriate approvals.\n  Let me conclude with the words of a distinguished Senator, one of the \ngreatest advocates for the elderly, ill, and disabled this Chamber has \nseen, Senator Claude Pepper. Senator Pepper, at the time, strongly \nopposed the McCarran-Ferguson antitrust exemption for the insurance \nindustry, and he\n\n[[Page S10629]]\n\nwarned of the ``carte blanche authority . . . which had been contained \nin no previous legislation . . . [and] which for the first time gives \nthe States carte blanche to legitimize the very vices against which the \nClayton Act and the Sherman Act were directed.''\n  It appears to me the exemption for the insurance industry was a \nmistake then, and it is assuredly unwise now. Let's repeal this unfair \nlaw and give health insurance consumers the same benefits of free, \nopen, and fair competition that all Americans enjoy.\n  Let me finally add that the state of the health insurance market \nreinforces the need to which I have spoken, and so many of my \ncolleagues have spoken before, for an efficient, nonprofit public \nhealth insurance option. The health insurance industry has been \nartificially sheltered by government for decades, building huge profit \nmargins, massive market share, and colossal overhead and administrative \ncosts. Now these same companies argue vehemently against the public \noption on the grounds that it would amount to government interference--\ngovernment interference with their government protection from \ncompetition. That irony just doesn't pass the laugh test.\n  According to the AMA study I quoted in the beginning of my remarks, \nRhode Island is the second most concentrated health insurance market in \nthe country. Just two insurers control 95 percent of the market. My \nconstituents desperately would like the chance to choose a public \noption and would benefit from a more competitive health insurance \nmarket, one in which vigorous competition brings down costs and \nimproves the quality of care and encourages health insurers to treat \npeople decently.\n  Mr. President, I have concluded the remarks on the McCarran-Ferguson \nexemption. I wish to turn to another topic, but I see the majority whip \non the Senate floor, and I would be delighted to yield to him if he \nwishes to take a moment.\n  I will continue, then. I thank the distinguished majority whip.\n\n\n                     Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act\n\n  Mr. President, I wish now to say a few words about the colloquy that \ntook place between Senator McCain and Senator Feingold on the Senate \nfloor a few moments ago over the need to protect our Nation's political \nsystem from the influence of corporate money.\n  For more than a decade, Senators McCain and Feingold have been \nstalwart defenders of the integrity of our political system, and they \nachieved a hard-fought victory in 2002 with the passage of the \nBipartisan Campaign Reform Act, which everybody around here knows as \nthe McCain-Feingold law. As they said in their remarks, we face a real \ndanger that an activist Supreme Court will strike down portions of that \nlaw, overturn the will of Congress and the American people, and allow \ncorporations to spend freely in order to elect and defeat candidates \nand influence public policy to meet their ends. The consequences of \nsuch a decision by our Supreme Court could be nightmarish.\n  Federal laws restricting corporate spending on campaigns have a long \npedigree. Back in 1907, the Tillman Act restricted corporate spending \non political campaigns. While various loopholes have come and gone over \nthe years, the principle embodied in that law that corporations aren't \nfree to spend unlimited dollars to influence political campaigns is a \ncornerstone of our American system of government. That principle now \nappears to be at risk as the Supreme Court may be poised to open the \nfloodgates now holding back corporate cash.\n  In September, the Supreme Court heard oral argument in Citizens \nUnited v. The Federal Election Commission. Citizens United is an \norganization that accepts, channels, and funnels corporate funding. It \nsought to broadcast a documentary attacking our former colleague, \nSenator Clinton, now Secretary of State Clinton, at the time a \ncandidate for President, on On Demand cable broadcasts. Current law \nprohibits the broadcast of this kind of corporate advocacy on the eve \nof an election. Citizens United filed a lawsuit arguing that the law \ninfringed on its first amendment rights.\n  Many observers expected the Court to rule narrowly on the case, \nperhaps focusing on whether McCain-Feingold applies to On Demand \nbroadcasts. Instead, after hearing oral argument, the Court asked for \nan additional briefing and a new round of oral argument, something the \nSupreme Court does very rarely, to consider whether the first amendment \nbans such restrictions on corporate campaign spending. There is some \nindication that the activist conservative wing of the Court believes it \ndoes. We may be on the verge of another effort by a Roberts court to \nadvance its ideologically charged view of the Constitution. In so \ndoing, the Court would overturn its own longstanding precedents, \nopinions such as Austin v. Michigan State Chamber of Commerce where \nJustice Thurgood Marshall warned of ``the corrosive and distorting \neffects of immense aggregations of wealth that are accumulated with the \nhelp of the corporate form and that have little or no correlation to \nthe public support for the corporation's political ideas.''\n  Should the Court upturn so much long-settled law, it would upend our \nentire political system and we could see a new era of corporate \ninfluence over politics not seen in the history of our Republic.\n  Imagine for a moment what our political system would look like if the \nCourt takes the fateful step of allowing corporations to unrestrictedly \nspend money to influence campaigns. Corporate polluters under \ninvestigation by the Department of Justice, running unlimited \nadvertisements for a more sympathetic Presidential candidate; financial \nservices companies spending unlimited money to defeat Members of \nCongress who have the nerve to want to reform the way things are done \non Wall Street; defense contractors overwhelming candidates who dare \nquestion a weapons program they build. It would become government of \nthe CEOs, by the CEOs, and for the CEOs.\n  Nothing in the history of the first amendment requires the protection \nof such activities. To the contrary, Congress long has been understood \nto hold the power to protect the electoral process from the corrupting \nflood of corporate money. This is because, as the Supreme Court long \nhas recognized, a corporation holds no inalienable right to participate \nin an election. Unlike the people from whom the sovereign power of the \nState is drawn, a corporation is created by and subject to the \nsovereign power of the State. Indeed, as Chief Justice John Marshall \nexplained in 1809, only 18 years after ratification of the first \namendment, a corporation is ``a mere creature of the law, \ninvisible, intangible, and incorporeal and certainly not a citizen.''\n\n  In 1906, a century later, the Supreme Court explained that:\n\n       The corporation is a creature of the state. It is presumed \n     to be incorporated for the benefit of the public. It receives \n     certain special privileges and franchises, and holds them \n     subject to the laws of the state and the limitations of its \n     charter. Its powers are limited by law.\n\n  Corporations are created by government charter. They are legal \nfictions, tools for organizing human behavior. Neither logic nor \nhistory justifies unleashing them from the bonds of government to \nmaster and control the very government that created them--new monsters \non the political landscape, bending public wealth to their peculiar \nprivate purposes.\n  How might they do that? Well, let's look at one recent case involving \nBank of America.\n  All of us remember in September of 2008, Bank of America announced \nthat it would buy Merrill Lynch for $50 billion. In August of this \nyear, the Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil suit against \nthe Bank of America alleging that it had made a misrepresentation to \nits shareholders that Merrill Lynch would not pay bonuses to its \nexecutives in 2008 when, in fact, Bank of America had agreed that \nMerrill Lynch could pay up to $5.8 billion in bonuses to its \nexecutives. That is the background.\n  Bank of America and the Securities and Exchange Commission submitted \na proposed final consent judgment proposing to resolve that case by \ngiving $33 million of shareholder money to the Securities and Exchange \nCommission. The U.S. District Court in New York took a look at this \nproposal and threw it out. The judge rightfully rejected it as neither \nfair nor reasonable nor adequate. The Court said it well; I can't \nimprove on the Court's decision:\n\n       The parties were proposing that the management of Bank of \n     America--having allegedly hidden from the bank's shareholders\n\n[[Page S10630]]\n\n     that as much as $5.8 billion of their money, shareholder \n     money, would be given as bonuses to the executives of Merrill \n     who had run that company nearly into bankruptcy--would settle \n     the legal consequences of their lying by paying the SEC $33 \n     million more of their shareholders' money.\n\n  As the Court noted, this was all done ``at the expense not only of \nthe shareholders, but also of the truth.''\n  That is a pretty stark example of corporate management trying to use \nshareholder money to serve its own ends, even against shareholder \ninterests. Well, guess whose interests corporate managers would pursue \npolitically if they could open the spigots of shareholder money in \nelections.\n  Longstanding statutes and judicial precedents that limit corporate \ninvolvement in campaigns rests on the well-established and long-\naccepted recognition that corporations and their corrupting self-\ninterests must be controlled. There is no reason now for a fundamental \nrethinking of such a plain and well-settled principle. The rightwing of \nthe Supreme Court will be hard pressed to justify departing from such \nsettled understandings of the first amendment, from the century-long \ntradition of controlling corporate spending, to invent new \nconstitutional rights for corporations against real human beings.\n  In closing, I stand with my colleagues, Senator McCain and Senator \nFeingold, in readiness to do what it takes to protect our system of \ncampaign finance laws from the danger of corporate corruption. I look \nforward to working with them and my other colleagues to ensure that our \nelections remain enlivened by a robust debate among human participants \nin which CEOs don't have favored princely status because they can \ndirect corporate funds to drown out people's voices.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, let me say at the outset the Senator from \nRhode Island has addressed two issues that are timely and important. I \ncertainly concur with him and cosponsor the legislation offered by the \nchairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Patrick Leahy, \nwhich would repeal the McCarran-Ferguson Act as it relates to health \ninsurance companies and medical malpractice insurers. The McCarran-\nFerguson Act, since the 1940s, if I am not mistaken, has exempted the \ninsurance industry from antitrust regulation, which literally means \nthose insurance companies, exempt from the supervision of the Justice \nDepartment, can engage in conduct absolutely illegal and unacceptable \nby any other corporation in America, save one. Organized baseball is \ngiven the same basic exemption for reasons that are lost in the pages \nof history. But I will say that under the current McCarran-Ferguson \nlaw, the health insurance companies have the power to fix prices, to \nallocate markets. In other words, they can make good on their threat 2 \nweeks ago that they are going to raise health insurance premiums if we \npass health care reform in America. There is nothing we can do to stop \nthem, short of creating a competitive model where they might have an \nactual competitor in markets such as Rhode Island and Illinois. It is \nknown as the public option. Some people brand it as socialism or some \nwild French idea, but what it comes down to is basic competition--\nsomething the health insurance companies loathe. Because of the \nantitrust exemption, McCarran-Ferguson, they have not been held to the \nsame standards as any other business in America.\n\n  I believe Senator Leahy is on the right track. It is part of the \nhealth care reform. I know he is supported by Senator Harry Reid, the \nmajority leader, that we should repeal the McCarran-Ferguson antitrust \nlegislation as it exists today.\n  I concur with Senator Whitehouse as well on the notion that the case \nwhich is now pending before the U.S. Supreme Court could, in my mind, \ncompletely destroy our political climate and campaigning in America. If \nwe allow corporations to be exempt from limitations in their \ninvolvement in this political process, it is virtually the end of \ncampaigns as we have known them.\n  It is time for us to not only endorse the position that has been \nexpressed by Senator McCain, Senator Feingold, and Senator Whitehouse, \nbut also step back and take an honest look at this system, which I \nthink is unsustainable and intolerable.\n  I have introduced legislation with Senator Specter calling for public \nfinancing of campaigns. When will we ever reach the conclusion that \nthis system, if it is not corrupt, is corrupting? In order to take the \nbig money out of politics, whether from corporations or from \nindividuals, we need to move to a model that has been embraced by \nStates that are more progressive in their outlooks. The States of Maine \nand Arizona have moved in this direction. We should as well.\n  I support public financing, and I hope our Rules Committee can \nconsider a hearing on this important measure soon.\n\n\n                    Unemployment Insurance Benefits\n\n  Yesterday, I came to the Senate floor to talk about a Republican hold \non our efforts to extend unemployment insurance benefits to millions of \nAmericans. These are people who have worked hard their entire adult \nlives and are struggling now to make ends meet. Some of them earned \nsix-figure salaries and others more modest incomes, and now they are \nstruggling to put food on the table. Some had high-ranking bank jobs, \nothers more mundane and routine jobs. But they are all in trouble, and \nthey are counting on us to let them have the money they put into a fund \nfor their unemployment.\n  These people worked for years on factory floors, building expertise \nin machines and equipment, and now have depleted their savings and do \nnot know where to turn, and they are frightened.\n  Listen to the words a husband and father from Joliet, IL, has written \nto me:\n\n       I am one of the millions who has become dependent on my \n     unemployment benefits to help carry our family from week to \n     week. I've been employed full time since I was legally old \n     enough to work and have always had a job.\n       I worked at the same company for 8 years before losing my \n     job due to lack of work. Confident that I'd find a job right \n     away, I didn't sweat it. But I haven't. Eighteen months later \n     and I'm still unemployed and terrified because I'm about to \n     receive my last unemployment check.\n       I have two young children, a modest house, one vehicle and \n     a lot of bills. I'm horrified at the thought that I won't be \n     able to pay my bills or put food on our table. We just got \n     hit with unforeseen medical bills that the insurance company \n     has decided not to cover (apparently vaccinating children \n     falls under the ``unimportant'' category), my truck needs \n     tires and brakes, but we can't afford to pay for either, and \n     my refrigerator is threatening to die on me.\n       My entire world feels like it's crumbing around me but I \n     was confident that the government, my government, would be \n     there to back us up and I'm appalled that this extension is \n     being held up.\n       Without this extension, things are going to get much worse. \n     I'm scared. Please don't let us fall through the cracks.\n\n  I say to the Senator from Rhode Island, I am sure he has received \nsimilar messages from his State, and I am sure our Republican \ncolleagues have received similar messages. They have held us up in our \nattempt to extend unemployment benefits to millions of people just like \nthe man who wrote to me from Joliet, IL.\n  Here is something I just learned. The Republicans say: We cannot go \nonto unemployment benefits because we want to offer some amendments. \nThis is a common plank we hear from them, that they don't have enough \nof a chance to offer amendments. I have not seen the amendments, but \nthey were described to me. I think the Senator from Rhode Island may be \nsurprised to learn that two of the amendments they want to offer--the \nreason they are holding up unemployment benefits is because they want \nto take another whack at ACORN. Think about that. The Republican Senate \nleadership has reached the point where they would consider amendments \non the organization of ACORN as an alternative or at least holding up \neven the most basic unemployment benefits for unemployed workers across \nAmerica.\n  ACORN is a controversial organization. I know that as well as anyone. \nI said the people who were disclosed on a video several weeks ago \nshould be held accountable. I know they have been fired. And if they \nhave broken laws, they should be prosecuted, period. I called for an \ninvestigation of ACORN's involvement with the Federal Government to \nfind out if there has been wrongdoing and misuse of Federal funds. We \nhave gone even further on the floor of the Senate to actually barring \nACORN from doing business with\n\n[[Page S10631]]\n\nthe Federal Government. But that is not enough on the Republican side \nof the aisle. In order to feed the mouths of the rightwing cable shows, \nthey keep pushing ACORN down our throats at the expense of unemployment \nbenefits for millions of Americans.\n  When you look at this, this is such a vacuous, frivolous, \nembarrassing outcome that we would say to people like the man who has \njust written to me: Sorry, we cannot give you the peace of mind you get \nwith an unemployment check; we have to take another whack at ACORN and \nwe have to hold up the bill for weeks until we satisfy a few Senators \nwho cannot get enough of this exercise. I don't think it is \nresponsible. I sure don't think it is fair. And I can tell you that the \npeople who are suffering because they lost their jobs and are feeling \nthe pain and frustration are not going to be satisfied to know a few \nRepublican Senators want to offer another amendment on ACORN.\n  Listen to the frustration and pain of a veteran from Cicero, IL. He \nwrites:\n\n       My age is 61. I have been unemployed since March 2008. I am \n     actively looking for work. It has been more than 6 months \n     since I've even had an interview.\n       When I've had interviews, I feel that once the interviewer \n     sees my gray hair, I am eliminated from competition, saying \n     I'm over qualified.\n       I'm realistic, and willing to take a cut in pay to [get a \n     job].\n       What I'm writing about is the extension of unemployment \n     benefits. I've received notices from the State of Illinois my \n     extended benefits and emergency benefits from the State of \n     Illinois have expired.\n       I understand that the House [of Representatives in \n     Washington] has voted to extend benefits by an overwhelming \n     majority. But the extension is being held up in the Senate.\n       Sir, I am facing losing my home and all my possessions that \n     I can't pack in my car.\n       I must urge you once again to look positively and in a \n     timely manner to a vote in the Senate. Now, I must also ask \n     you to consider extending relief to those who no longer \n     have benefits.\n       I have now applied for State welfare benefits. I am now \n     waiting for my scheduled interview to have my application \n     reviewed.\n\n  All of these people have been helped by unemployment insurance. All \nof them are at risk of losing that lifeline.\n  Since I spoke on the floor yesterday about the Republican \nobstructionism stopping us from bringing up unemployment benefits, \n7,000 people have lost their unemployment insurance, 7,000 more will \nlose it today and 7,000 more tomorrow. Why? So that several Senators \ncan have another amendment attacking ACORN. Does that make any sense? \nIs that fair or just? These Senators ought to go home to their States \nand tell the people who are out of work and not receiving unemployment: \nSorry, we can't help you yet because we have a few more political items \nto work on, an agenda.\n  Republicans in this body, unfortunately--some of them--are too \nconcerned about the political agenda and not concerned enough about the \nhuman agenda of hard-working Americans out of work. Mr. President, 1.3 \nmillion Americans will lose benefits by the end of the year if we do \nnot pass the Democratic extension of unemployment benefits; 1.3 million \nAmericans will suffer needless poverty and deprivation for their \nfamilies because of this obstructionism. These are working-class \nfamilies. These are families we value in this country. These are \nfamilies who deserve a fighting chance.\n  I say to my Republican colleagues who have stopped the Democrats from \nextending unemployment insurance benefits: What are you waiting for? \nDon't you receive the same e-mails, mail, and phone calls we receive? \nYou have unemployed people in your State. Clearly, they need help.\n  Mr. President, 50,000 families in Illinois will lose their \nunemployment insurance, while they look for work, by the end of the \nyear if the Senate does not act. Some seem to be worried about how to \npay for this extension, but we have paid into this for years. Workers \nput in a little bit of money out of their paychecks, and employers as \nwell. It goes right into a fund to cover unemployment. So it is not as \nif the money is not there; it is just the political will is lacking. \nUnfortunately, there are other things that are more important to some \npeople on the other side of the aisle.\n  I say to my colleagues in the Senate, it is time for us--in fact, it \nis over time for us--to pass extension of unemployment benefits.\n\n\n                        Hate Crimes Legislation\n\n  Mr. President, the Defense authorization bill includes hate crimes \nlanguage which for several years has been passed by both the House and \nthe Senate only to see it blocked by filibuster threats or by the \nthreat of a veto. What a difference a year has made. When Congress took \nup the hate crimes bill last Congress, President George W. Bush called \nit ``unnecessary and constitutionally questionable.'' He said he would \nveto it.\n  The American people said last November that they wanted a new \nPresident and a change. They wanted our country to move in a different \ndirection. President Obama is doing that. In this case, he is \nsupporting the hate crimes legislation.\n  This bill has another important champion who sadly is no longer with \nus. Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts was our leader on this issue \nfor over a decade. I only wish he were here to vote and join us on the \npassage of this important legislation. Nobody spoke to this issue with \nmore authority and clarity than Senator Ted Kennedy. He was the heart \nand soul of the Senate, and passing this bill will honor the great work \nhe gave in his public career to the cause of civil rights.\n  I generally believe Congress should be careful in federalizing crime, \nbut in the case of hate crimes, there is a demonstrated problem and a \ncarefully crafted solution.\n  There are two parts to this problem. First, the existing Federal hate \ncrimes law, which was passed over 40 years ago in 1968 after the \nassassination of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., only carries six narrow \ncategories of conduct. The hate crime has to take place, for example, \nwhile using a public accommodation. The hate crimes bill now being \nconsidered would expand coverage so that hate crimes could be \nprosecuted wherever they take place. Federal prosecutors would no \nlonger be limited to these six narrow categories.\n  Second, the bill would expand the categories of people covered under \nthe Federal hate crimes law. The current law provides no coverage for \nhate crimes based on the victim's sexual orientation, gender, gender \nidentity, or disability. Unfortunately, statistics tell us that hate \ncrimes based on sexual orientation are the third most common after \nthose based on race and religion. About 15 percent--one out of six or \nseven--of all hate crimes is based on sexual orientation. We cannot \nignore this reality.\n  Let me address one or two arguments made against this bill.\n  Many have written to me and said they believe this bill would be an \ninfringement on religious speech. Their concern is that a minister in a \nreligious setting could be prosecuted if he sermonizes against \nhomosexuality and then a member of his congregation assaults someone on \nthe basis of their sexual orientation. I certainly understand this, but \ntheir concern is misplaced.\n  The chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, held a \nhearing a few months ago with Attorney General Eric Holder. I attended \nthe hearing, and I asked the Attorney General of the United States \npointblank whether a religious leader could be prosecuted under the \nfacts I just described. This is what the Attorney General said in \nresponse to the hypothetical question I raised:\n\n       This bill seeks to protect people from conduct that is \n     motivated by bias. It has nothing to do with regard to \n     speech. The minister who says negative things about \n     homosexuality, about gay people, this is a person I would not \n     agree with, but is not somebody who would be under the ambit \n     of this statute.\n\n  This clear representation from the Nation's top law enforcement \nofficer puts to rest, in my mind and the mind of any reasonable person \nlistening to it, any misunderstanding people might have about how this \nlaw would work.\n  It is also important to note that the hate crimes bill requires \nbodily injury before prosecution. Words are not enough. It does not \napply to speech or harassment. It does not apply to those who would \ncarry signs with messages which exhibit their religious belief. \nAttorney General Holder assured the Senate that unless there is bodily \ninjury involved, no hate crimes prosecution could be brought. I don't \nknow how he could have been clearer and more definitive. People who \nlisten to his statement in good faith will understand it.\n\n[[Page S10632]]\n\n  I also note that 24 States, nearly half the States in our Nation, \nhave hate crime laws on the books that include sexual orientation, and \nreligious leaders are not being prosecuted in those States.\n  That is not the purpose of the hate crimes law. Prosecutors aren't \nlooking to put ministers in jail for their religious beliefs. To the \ncontrary, the hate crimes bill will actually help religious \ncommunities. Understand, 20 percent of all hate crimes that are \ncommitted in the United States are committed on the basis of religion. \nThis bill would eliminate the narrow requirements that currently \nprevent Federal prosecutors from bringing certain hate crimes cases \nmotivated by religious bias.\n  Another criticism of the legislation is there is no need to pass a \nFederal hate crimes law because some States are already doing it on \ntheir own. This argument is similar to one we faced before. Almost a \ncentury ago, when Congress debated an antilynching law between 1881 and \n1964, almost 5,000 people were lynched in the United States. The \nvictims were mostly--but not exclusively--African American. Yet \nCongress resisted addressing this problem for generations. Criminal law \nis primarily a State and local function. I understand that. An \nestimated 95 percent of prosecutions for crimes occur at that level. \nBut in some areas of criminal law, the Federal Government can and \nshould step in to help.\n  We have 4,000 Federal criminal laws, 600 of which have been passed in \nthe last 10 years. Hate crimes are a sad and tragic reality in America. \nThe killing this past summer of an African-American security guard at \nthe Holocaust Museum here in Washington, DC, was a reminder that hate-\nmotivated violence still plagues our Nation.\n  Earlier this year, in my home State of Illinois, two White men in the \ntown of Joliet used a garbage can to beat a 43-year-old Black man \noutside a gas station, while yelling racial epithets and stating: \n``This is for Obama.'' The victim sustained serious injuries, \nlacerations, and bruises to his head.\n  Just 2 weeks ago, in Springfield, in my hometown, three University of \nIllinois students were arrested for viciously beating and punching two \nmen while yelling antigay slurs at them.\n  These are incidents in my home State, a State I am proud to \nrepresent, but I am not proud of this criminal conduct, and I don't \nthink America should be proud of it.\n  According to FBI data, based on voluntary reporting, there are 8,000 \nhate crimes annually in America. Some experts think the number is \ncloser to 50,000. The hate crimes bill would not eliminate hate crimes, \nbut it will help ensure these crimes do not go unpunished.\n  In closing, I wish to quote the words of Senator Kennedy when he \nintroduced the hate crimes bill in April. This is what he said:\n\n       It has been over 10 years since Matthew Shepard was left to \n     die on a fence in Wyoming because of who he was. It has also \n     been 10 years since this bill was initially considered by \n     Congress. In those 10 years, we have gained the political and \n     public support that is needed to make this bill into law. \n     Today, we have a President who is prepared to sign hate \n     crimes legislation into law, and a Justice Department that is \n     willing to enforce it. We must not delay the passage of this \n     bill. Now is the time to stand up against hate-motivated \n     violence and recognize the shameful damage it has done to our \n     Nation.\n\n  We will honor the memory and legacy of Senator Edward Kennedy by \npassing this Defense authorization conference report, which includes \nthe hate crimes law language. We need to send this to President Obama, \nwho has promised he will sign it into law. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in support of this important legislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10632-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10632]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

AND MRS. MELVIN SANDERS\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor Rev. Melvin Sanders \nand his wife Emma Sanders for 40 years of service to the Las Vegas \ncommunity. Mr. Sanders and his wife moved to Las Vegas, NV, from \nArizona in 1954. Mr. and Mrs. Sanders entered the business field \nsuccessfully and have remained involved for over 40 years.\n  Reverend Sanders and Emma Sanders are known all over Las Vegas for \ntheir generosity and warmth toward their neighbors. He and his wife \nassisted multiple families in financial need and have also provided \nministerial and spiritual outreach to the people of the Las Vegas \nValley. The Sanders are known as Mom and Dad to literally hundreds of \nNevadans. Reverend Sanders and his beloved wife have been married for \n57 years and are the proud parents of six children, one of whom \ntragically preceded them in death. The Sanders' church has been in \nexistence for 40 years.\n  The House of Holiness Church has been open to its congregation for 40 \nyears, and may best be described as a vibrant and joyful place of \nworship. The church has Sunday school, afternoon service, evening \nservice, prayer and Bible band as well as Bible study. The House of \nHoliness may best be described by a verse of Scripture which attests \n``Holiness becometh thine house o Lord for ever.'' It is clear that \nReverend Sanders and his wife are holy people who try to live as lights \nfor God in our world.\n  President Obama once said ``Focusing your life solely on making a \nbuck shows a certain poverty of ambition. It asks too little of \nyourself. Because it's only when you hitch your wagon to something \nlarger than yourself that you realize your true potential.'' This ideal \nis exemplified by Reverend Sanders and Emma, as together they serve \nothers and help make Nevada a better place. Whether it be through their \nvolunteer efforts with the Salvation Army or by way of their many other \nselfless endeavors, the Sanders help to better their community.\n  The Sanders and the House of Holiness Church have a bright future on \ntheir horizon. I congratulate the Sanders on 57 years of loving \nmarriage and 40 years of saintly service to the Las Vegas community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10632-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10632-S10633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Captain Benjamin A.

He lived not only as a true \npatriot and defender of our Nation's principles of freedom and justice \nbut as a compassionate ambassador of good will and humanitarian \nassistance to thousands in need.\n  Though he was called ``Captain'' by those soldiers around him, he was \nknown as ``Moses Ben'' to thousands of Ugandans who now have clean \nwater thanks to Ben's efforts. After serving in Africa and being struck \nby the number of deaths and illnesses resulting from dirty drinking \nwater, he returned home and founded ClearWater Initiative. In the short \ntime since its inception, with the aid of his parents Laura and Gary, \nClearWater Initiative constructed wells for more than 6,500 people, \nprimarily in northern Uganda.\n  Captain Sklaver served as a messenger of high justice and idealism in \nthe best tradition of American principles and patriotism. Our Nation \nextends its heartfelt condolences to his mother and father, Laura and \nGary Sklaver, his brother Samuel, sister Anna, and fiance Beth, whom I \nhave known since she was a baby because she is the daughter of my dear \nfriends Jim and Barbara Segaloff.\n  To Ben's family and the people he touched during his life, we extend \nour\n\n[[Page S10633]]\n\ndeepest appreciation for sharing this outstanding soldier and \nhumanitarian with us.

Mr. President, I am deeply concerned by the \ndeteriorating humanitarian situation in the eastern and northeastern \nregions of the Democratic Republic of Congo. In the east, the FDLR \nrebels have deliberately and brutally targeted civilians in response to \na new military offensive, while the Congolese military--an \nundisciplined force now including several former militias--has also \ntargeted civilians with killings, rapes, and looting amidst ongoing \noperations. Last week, a coalition of 84 humanitarian agencies released \na report stating that more than 1,000 civilians have been killed and \nnearly 900,000 displaced in eastern Congo since January. In addition, \nthe United Nations reports that there have been over 5,000 cases of \nrape in South Kivu Province in the first 6 months of this year alone, \nand that number is increasing. With the offensive continuing and the \nonset of the dry season, the level of violence is likely to increase in \nthe months ahead.\n  Meanwhile, Doctors without Borders reported last week that hundreds \nof thousands of people in northeastern Congo are fleeing from renewed \nattacks by the Lord's Resistance Army. For two decades, the LRA \noperated in northern Uganda and southern Sudan, but they have shifted \ntheir base of operations in recent years into northeastern Congo. This \nyear, facing renewed pressure from a cross-border Ugandan military \noffensive, the LRA have scaled up their attacks on civilians, killing \nan estimated 1,200 Congolese and abducting 1,500 in the first 6 months \nalone. Ongoing Ugandan military operations have reportedly had some \nsuccess, but the LRA leader Joseph Kony continues to evade capture and \nhis forces exploit the region's porous borders. The Congolese military \nhas deployed new forces to the northeast, but their inability to \nprotect civilians from the LRA and their own abuses against civilians \nhave only made things worse.\n  Over the last decade, the people of eastern Congo have already lived \nthrough violent conflict and humanitarian crisis. According to the best \nestimates, more than 5.4 million people have been killed, making this \nthe single deadliest conflict since the Second World War. Millions have \nbeen displaced from their homes, forced to live in squalid conditions. \nWomen and girls and even some men and boys in the Congo have endured \nhorrific levels of sexual violence. Yet, rather than coming to an end \nof this nightmare, I am worried that Congo is now entering another \nchapter of it. Without a clear and viable plan for civilian protection, \ncontinuing military operations and deployments will likely lead to \nfurther reprisal attacks by armed groups and greater displacement. At \nthe same time, without real progress to demilitarize the economy and \nreform the Congolese military, any security gains are likely to be \nshort-lived.\n  I was very pleased that Secretary Clinton chose to travel to eastern \nCongo during her trip to Africa in August and pledged $17 million in \nnew funds to address the sexual violence there. I also know the State \nDepartment has been exploring ways to build on her historic visit. And \nlast week, the United States hosted meetings with our European and U.N. \npartners under the auspices of the Great Lakes Contact Group to discuss \nour collective efforts going forward. This is all well and good. I hope \nthe international community will take immediate steps to bolster \ncivilian protection and humanitarian access in both the east and \nnortheast. But as we go forward, we also need to finally get serious \nabout pressing regional governments to address the underlying causes of \nthe conflict: the continued plunder and militarized trade of eastern \nCongo's rich mineral base, the region's porous and unregulated borders, \noutside support of armed groups, and the lack of accountability and \ndiscipline in the Congolese army.\n  Addressing these issues will not be easy. But continuing to rely on \nhalf-measures and focusing on the symptoms offer little hope of ending \nCongo's crises. It is time for a comprehensive and concerted \ninternational effort toward the Congo and the Great Lakes Region of \nAfrica, and I am confident that there is no better administration in \nrecent history to lead such an effort. President Obama has already \ndemonstrated his commitment to and understanding of this issue with his \nwork on the DRC Relief, Security and Democracy Promotion Act of 2006. \nSecretary Clinton was reportedly the most senior U.S. Government \nofficial to ever visit eastern Congo. And finally, Johnnie Carson is \nperhaps the most experienced Assistant Secretary for African Affairs \nthat we have ever had. Together, we have an opportunity to reverse the \ntrends and address Congo's crises--both in the east and with the LRA--\nand I hope we will seize it. For Africa, few achievements could be more \nimportant for the sake of regional stability and saving lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10633-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10633]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n          100TH ANNIVERSARY OF UNION MISSIONARY BAPTIST CHURCH\n\n Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is my great pleasure today to \ncongratulate the Union Missionary Baptist Church on its 100th \nanniversary. This wonderful church was the first African-American \nBaptist church in Lansing, established by a small group of worshippers \nmeeting in a living room. In 2001, the congregation built a Family Life \nCenter, which ministers to the community with classrooms, a computer \nlab, a chapel, a prayer garden, and a commercial kitchen. The \ncongregation today consists of over 700 members.\n  The church has been blessed by excellent leadership over the years. \nThe first pastor was Rev. H.C. Randolph, who was succeeded by many \nother distinguished pastors over the years, including Rev. G.W. Carr, \nRev. J.G. Bruce, Rev. S.L. Johnson, Rev. Norris Jackson, Rev. Joel L. \nKing (uncle of Dr. Martin Luther King), Rev. Charles J. Patterson, and \nthe current pastor, a wonderful leader and a dear friend, Rev. Melvin \nT. Jones.\n  Throughout its great history, Union Missionary Baptist Church has \nenriched the lives of thousands of people who have come through its \ndoors to worship. It has been my privilege to work with Reverend Jones \nover the years. He and his church truly reflect what Paul urged of the \nGalatians: ``Whenever we have an opportunity, let us work for the good \nof all.'' I congratulate Reverend Jones and the congregation, and I \nlook forward to participating in the church's centennial \ncelebrations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10633-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10633-S10634]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:37 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 3319.

A bill to amend the Federal Water Pollution Control Act to \nestablish national standards for discharges from cruise vessels; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Clean Cruise \nShip Act of 2009. This bill would address a serious and growing threat \nto U.S. waters by placing limits on the dumping of wastewater by cruise \nships. Cruise ships generate millions of gallons of wastewater every \nday--much of it vile sewage. These ships can directly dump their waste \ninto the oceans with minimal oversight.\n  This bill would require cruise ships to obtain permits through EPA's \nNational Pollutant Discharge Elimination System in order to discharge \nsewage, graywater, and bilge water. It also would require cruise ships \nto upgrade their wastewater treatment systems to meet the standards of \ntoday's best available technology. This technology significantly \nreduces the pollutants that ships discharge and is already being used \nsuccessfully on cruise ships in Alaska, thanks to that state's forward-\nthinking regulations.\n  The problem is real. The number of cruise ship passengers has been \ngrowing nearly twice as fast as any other mode of travel. In the U.S. \nalone the numbers are approaching ten million passengers a year, with \nsome ships carrying 3,000 or more passengers. These ships produce \nmassive amounts of waste: one ship can produce over 200,000 gallons of \nsewage each week; a million gallons of graywater from kitchens, \nlaundry, and showers; and over 25,000 gallons of oily bilge water that \ncollects in ship bottoms.\n  I have nothing against cruise vacations. They can be a wonderful way \nto visit beautiful places. What my bill proposes to do is change the \nway the cruise ships manage the removal of waste. Here is the \nunpleasant reality. Within three miles of shore, vessels can discharge \nhuman body wastes and other toilet waste provided that a ``marine \nsanitation device'' is installed. The Environmental Protection Agency \nreleased a report in December of 2008, however, that concluded that \nthese systems simply don't work. These sewage treatment devices leave \ndischarges that consistently exceed national effluent standards for \nfecal coliform and other pathogens and pollutants. In fact, fecal \ncoliform levels in effluent are typically 20 to 200 times greater than \nin untreated domestic wastewater.\n  Beyond three miles from shore there are no restrictions on sewage \ndischarge. Cruise ships can directly dump raw sewage into U.S. waters.\n  The situation with cruise ship graywater also requires attention. \nWhile cruise ships must obtain permits to discharge graywater within \nthree miles of the coast, there is still a pollution issue. Graywater \nfrom sinks, tubs, and kitchens contains large amounts of pathogens and \npollutants. Fecal coliform concentrations, for example, are 10 to 1000 \ntimes greater than those in untreated domestic wastewater. These \npollutants sicken our marine ecosystems, wash up onto our beaches, and \ncontaminate food and shellfish that end up on our dinner plates.\n  Beyond 3 miles from shore there are no restrictions on graywater \ndischarge. Cruise ships can directly dump graywater into U.S. waters.\n  Following the lead of Alaska, the Clean Cruise Ship Act seeks to \naddress these oversights. No discharges would be allowed within twelve \nmiles of shore. Beyond twelve miles, discharges of sewage, graywater, \nand bilge water would be allowed, provided that they meet national \neffluent limits consistent with the best available technology. That \ntechnology works and is commercially available now. The recent \nEnvironmental Protection Agency study found that these ``advanced \nwastewater treatment'' systems effectively remove pathogens, suspended \nsolids, metals, and oil and grease.\n  Under this legislation, the release of raw, untreated sewage would be \nbanned. No dumping of sewage sludge and incinerator ash would be \nallowed in U.S. waters. All cruise ships calling on U.S. ports would \nhave to dispose of hazardous waste in accordance with the Resource \nConservation and Recovery Act. The bill would establish inspection and \nenforcement mechanisms to ensure compliance.\n  The protection of U.S. waters is vital to our Nation's health and \neconomy. The oceans not only support the life of nearly 50 percent of \nall species on Earth, but they also provide 20 percent of the animal \nprotein and 5 percent of the total protein in the human diet.\n  Some cruise ship companies already are trying to improve their \nenvironmental footprint. They also want to preserve the environment \nthat attracts their passengers. But the efforts between cruise ship \ncompanies are not uniform. A Federal standard would apply one set of \nrequirements to all companies.\n  It is time to bring the cruise ship industry into the 21st century. \nIt is time to update the laws that protect our oceans, and urge \nadoption of the best available wastewater treatment technology at sea.\n\n[[Page S10638]]\n\n  Working together, we can support the industry while protecting the \nnatural treasures that are our oceans. I think the approach taken in \nthe Clean Cruise Ship Act will achieve that goal. I encourage my \ncolleagues here in the Senate to work with me to pass legislation that \nwill put a stop to the dumping of hazardous pollutants along our \ncoasts. Together we can clean up this major source of pollution that is \nharming our waters.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1820\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Clean Cruise Ship Act of \n     2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) cruise ships carry millions of passengers through North \n     American waters each year, showcase some of the most \n     beautiful ocean and coastal environments in the United \n     States, and provide opportunities for passengers to relax and \n     enjoy oceans and marine ecosystems;\n       (2) the number of cruise passengers continues to grow, \n     making the cruise industry one of the fastest growing tourism \n     sectors in the world;\n       (3) in 2007, more than 10,000,000 passengers departed from \n     North America on thousands of cruise ships;\n       (4) during the 2 decades preceding the date of enactment of \n     this Act, the average cruise ship size has increased at a \n     rate of approximately 90 feet every 5 years;\n       (5) an average-sized cruise vessel generates millions of \n     gallons of liquid waste and many tons of solid waste;\n       (6) in just 1 week, a 3000-passenger cruise ship generates \n     approximately 210,000 gallons of human sewage, 1,000,000 \n     gallons of water from showers and sinks and dishwashing water \n     (commonly known as ``graywater''), 37,000 gallons of oily \n     bilge water, more than 8 tons of solid waste, and toxic \n     wastes from dry cleaning and photo-processing laboratories;\n       (7) in an Environmental Protection Agency survey of 29 \n     ships traveling in Alaskan waters, reported sewage generation \n     rates ranged from 1,000 to 74,000 gallons per day per vessel, \n     with the average volume of sewage generated being 21,000 \n     gallons per day per vessel;\n       (8) those frequently untreated cruise ship discharges \n     deliver nutrients, hazardous substances, pharmaceuticals, and \n     human pathogens, including viruses and bacteria, directly \n     into the marine environment;\n       (9) in the final report of the United States Commission on \n     Ocean Policy, that Commission found that cruise ship \n     discharges, if not treated and disposed of properly, and the \n     cumulative impacts caused when cruise ships repeatedly visit \n     the same environmentally sensitive areas, ``can be a \n     significant source of pathogens and nutrients with the \n     potential to threaten human health and damage shellfish beds, \n     coral reefs, and other aquatic life'';\n       (10) pollution from cruise ships not only has the potential \n     to threaten marine life and human health through consumption \n     of contaminated seafood, but also poses a health risk for \n     recreational swimmers, surfers, and other beachgoers;\n       (11) according to the Environmental Protection Agency, \n     ``Sewage may host many pathogens of concern to human health, \n     including Salmonella, Shigella, Hepatitis A and E, and \n     gastro-intestinal viruses. Sewage contamination in swimming \n     areas and shellfish beds poses potential risks to human \n     health and the environment by increasing the rate of \n     waterborne illnesses'';\n       (12) the nutrient pollution from human sewage discharges \n     from cruise ships can contribute to the incidence of harmful \n     algal blooms;\n       (13) algal blooms have been implicated in the deaths of \n     marine life, including the deaths of more than 150 manatees \n     off the coast of Florida;\n       (14) in a 2005 report requested by the International \n     Council of Cruise Lines, the Science Panel of the Ocean \n     Conservation and Tourism Alliance recommended that--\n       (A) ``[a]ll blackwater should be treated'';\n       (B) treated blackwater should be ``avoided in ports, close \n     to bathing beaches or water bodies with restricted \n     circulation, flushing or inflow''; and\n       (C) blackwater should not be discharged within 4 nautical \n     miles of shellfish beds, coral reefs, or other sensitive \n     habitats;\n       (15) that Science Panel further recommended that graywater \n     be treated in the same manner as blackwater and that sewage \n     sludge be off-loaded to approved land-based facilities;\n       (16) in a summary of recommendations for addressing \n     unabated point sources of pollution, the Pew Oceans \n     Commission states that, ``Congress should enact legislation \n     that regulates wastewater discharges from cruise ships under \n     the Clean Water Act by establishing uniform minimum standards \n     for discharges in all State waters and prohibiting discharges \n     within the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone that do not meet \n     effluent standards.''; and\n       (17) a comprehensive statutory regime for managing \n     pollution discharges from cruise vessels, applicable \n     throughout the United States, is needed--\n       (A) to protect coastal and ocean areas from pollution \n     generated by cruise vessels;\n       (B) to reduce and better regulate discharges from cruise \n     vessels; and\n       (C) to improve monitoring, reporting, and enforcement of \n     standards regarding discharges.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to amend the \n     Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 et seq.) \n     to establish national standards and prohibitions for \n     discharges from cruise vessels.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to protect seniors in the United States from elder \nabuse by establishing specialized elder abuse prosecution and research \nprograms and activities to aid victims of elder abuse, to provide \ntraining to prosecutors and other law enforcement related to elder \nabuse prevention and protection, to establish programs that provide for \nemergency crisis response teams to combat elder abuse, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am proud to join Senators Kohl, \nMikulski, and LeMieux to introduce the Elder Abuse Victims Act of 2009, \na bill to protect older Americans from abuse and exploitation. It is \nclear that we are not doing enough to combat crime against seniors, and \nthe Elder Abuse Victims Act will give us important tools to better \nprevent and punish this deplorable behavior.\n  I have long fought to improve and protect the lives of older \nAmericans. In 2000, I joined Senator Bayh in sponsoring the Protecting \nSeniors from Fraud Act, which was signed into law nearly nine years ago \ntoday. A key provision that I worked to incorporate into that \nlegislation required the Attorney General to conduct a study of crime \nagainst seniors and to include specific information about crimes that \ndisproportionately affect seniors in the National Crime Victimization \nSurvey. The information collected as a result of those provisions has \nbeen valuable in understanding the scope of crime perpetrated against \nseniors and how best to combat it. In 2003, I sought further \nprotections by introducing the Seniors Safety Act. That bill aimed to \nstrengthen enforcement of many of the most prevalent crimes perpetrated \nagainst seniors, including health care fraud, nursing home abuse, \ntelemarketing fraud, and pension fraud.\n  The Elder Abuse Victims Act builds on these earlier efforts and \nensures that fighting the abuse and exploitation of our seniors is a \ntop law enforcement priority. Specifically, the bill provides grants to \ntrain prosecutors and establish elder justice units within State and \nlocal courts and law enforcement offices. It also requires the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice to further study state and local enforcement of \nelder abuse laws and establish more uniform procedures to improve the \nidentification and handling of elder justice matters. Additionally, the \nbill provides funding for elder abuse victims advocacy groups to ensure \nthat vulnerable seniors have access to critical support services.\n  It is particularly important that we strengthen our ability to \nprotect older Americans because they are the most rapidly growing \npopulation group in our society, making them an ever more attractive \ntarget for criminals. The Department of Health and Human Services has \npredicted that the number of older Americans will grow from 13 percent \nof the U.S. population in 2000 to 20 percent by 2030. In Vermont, \nseniors comprise about 12 percent of the population, a number that is \nexpected to increase to 20 percent by 2025.\n  The growing number of older Americans demands that we have enough \nadvocacy programs and law enforcement services in place to protect our \nseniors. We all deserve to age with dignity, free of the threat of \nabuse or fraud. The Elder Abuse Victims Act can help by giving our \njustice system the tools it needs to prosecute offenders who prey on \nthe elderly. I look forward to working with Senators Kohl, Mikulski, \nLeMieux, and others to better protect seniors from crime and abuse.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself and Mrs. Boxer):\n  S. 1822. A bill to amend the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n2008, with respect to considerations of the Secretary of the Treasury \nin providing assistance under that Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee\n\n[[Page S10642]]\n\non Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I join today with Senator Boxer of \nCalifornia to introduce legislation that will help create jobs by \ngetting credit flowing to small businesses and consumers.\n  Small businesses employ half of the Nation's workforce and are key to \ncreating jobs. Sadly, they have been hit hard by the credit crisis. \nLess than one-third of small businesses report that their credit needs \nare being met today, and 59 percent of them now rely on credit cards to \nfinance their daily operations, up from 44 percent at the end of last \nyear. We urgently need to speed credit to small businesses so that they \ncan create jobs and grow the economy. The best way to do so is through \nthe thousands of community banks located across our Nation.\n  Community banks are essential to small business lending. Our Nation's \n7,500 community banks of under $1 billion in assets hold 11 percent of \nour Nation's assets, but they make 38 percent of our Nation's small \nbusiness loans by asset. Due to the current economic recession, these \nresponsible, well-regulated institutions have seen their capital bases \nshrunk and have been forced to reduce lending, which negatively impacts \nsurrounding businesses and communities. These institutions can help us \nturn our economy around if we give them the capital they need to \nincrease the flow of credit to small businesses and entrepreneurs.\n  The Bank on Our Communities Act will help get capital to community \nbanks--on the condition that they restart lending. The bill empowers \nthe Secretary of the Treasury to redeploy up to $15 billion in TARP \ninto a new Community Credit Renewal Fund. Community banks of $5 billion \nin assets or less can qualify for investment by the Fund if they \nconduct an internal stress test to determine the amount of capital they \nneed to remain well-capitalized during adverse economic conditions and \nrestart small business and consumer lending and raise at least 50 \npercent of that target recapitalization amount from private investors. \nOnce in receipt of their new capital, participating banks would be \nrequired to increase small business and consumer lending by at least \nthe amount provided by the Fund and to increase small business lending \nin particular by at least 5 percent over the lowest point in 2009. \nAdditional incentives are given to increase lending to credit-worthy \nbusinesses above the minimum levels required for program participation.\n  This bill is common sense legislation with common sense values. It \nwill give the folks on Main Street the same access and opportunity as \nthose on Wall Street and create much needed jobs in the process. I ask \nthat my colleagues join me in the effort to help small businesses \nthrive in our local communities and get our economy back on track.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mr. Lieberman, and Mr. Carper):\n  S. 1830. A bill to establish the Chief of Conservation Officers \nCouncil to improve the energy efficiencies of Federal agencies, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President I rise to introduce a bill that would \nimprove the Federal Government's efforts to become more energy \nefficient and ensure accountability within executive branch agencies \nfor meeting energy efficiency targets. The legislation would also amend \nFederal contracting rules to encourage energy efficiency across the \nFederal, State, and local governments by making energy-saving \ntechnologies more widely available and at lower costs to taxpayers. I \nam pleased to be joined by Senators Lieberman and Carper on this \nimportant bill.\n  As the largest institutional user of energy in the world, the Federal \nGovernment has ample opportunity to implement energy efficiency \npolicies and technologies. According to the U.S. Department of Energy's \nFederal Energy Management Program, the Federal Government consumes 1.6 \npercent of the Nation's total energy--about $17.5 billion in annual \nenergy costs. Electricity at Federal buildings accounts for almost half \nof this usage.\n  Improving energy efficiency is not only good for the environment; it \ncan also produce savings for taxpayers.\n  Agencies that have been more aggressive in implementing energy \nsavings initiatives and have fully complied with existing laws and \nregulations have also enjoyed significant cost savings. For example, \ntwo of the Department of Energy laboratories have developed \nenvironmental management systems, which have shown a total of $16.6 \nmillion in cost savings and avoidance within a 4-year period. \nEnvironmental management systems are a strategic approach to ensuring \nthat an organization's environmental priorities are integrated into \noperational, planning, and management decisions. The systems these \nlaboratories developed emphasized achieving full compliance, pollution \nprevention, and effective and focused communications and community \noutreach.\n  Over the last few decades, more than a dozen laws, regulations, and \nExecutive Orders have been implemented to encourage energy efficiency \nand reduce environmental impacts of government operations. \nUnfortunately, agencies have been inconsistent and sporadic in meeting \ntheir environmental goals. The lack of a unified effort and \naccountability with agencies has undermined the good intentions of \nthese policies.\n  A great variance exists across the government, both in terms of \ncompliance with energy efficiency laws and regulations, as well as with \ninitiatives individual agencies have developed to reduce energy usage.\n  Agencies should explore diverse and innovative ways to save money by \ndecreasing energy consumption, as well as have greater incentives to \nundertake initiatives to meet energy reduction mandates.\n  The Obama administration issued an Executive Order earlier this \nmonth, which makes strides in establishing a more integrated strategy \ntoward sustainability and energy efficiency.\n  This Executive Order, however, does not go far enough in providing \nagency officials with the authority and accountability necessary to \nenforce applicable efficiency mandates. The Executive Order directs \neach agency head to designate an ``Agency Senior Sustainability \nOfficer'' from among the agency's senior management officials. This \nposition is too similar to the agency environmental executives created \nby Executive Order in 2007, which did very little to improve agencies' \ncompliance with applicable laws.\n  Our legislation, however, would create a Chief Conservation Officer \nwithin each agency. The officer would be drawn from career Senior \nExecutives. These officers will help spur long-term leadership on this \nissue.\n  In contrast to the Executive Order, implementing energy efficiency \nand sustainability policies would also be the primary responsibility of \nthis individual. Dedicating a senior-level career official to energy \nefficiency policy would improve the government's focus on \nimplementation of existing laws and policies, enhance innovation, and \nhelp identify future initiatives.\n  The Chief Conservation Officer would also be responsible for \nincorporating environmental considerations into agency procurement \npractices. This involvement will encourage efficiency improvements in \nthe agency's procurement of goods and services.\n  To improve the availability of efficiency technologies and help lower \ntheir costs, the bill would make several improvements in government \nprocurement policies.\n  Specifically, the bill would allow state and local government to \npurchase ``green'' commodities and services off the General Services \nAdministration Schedule. This procurement authority would help State \nand local governments reduce the administrative costs of negotiating \ntheir own contracts and would increase competition and lower costs. \nFederal agencies should also reap the benefits of this program as more \ngoods and services become available at reduced costs.\n  Participation in the program would be voluntary for State and local \ngovernments, as well as vendors. The proposal would also provide small \nbusinesses with ``green'' products more efficient access to State and \nlocal markets, markets that geography and cost might otherwise \nforeclose. For comparison sake, 80 percent of GSA Schedule contracts \nare with small businesses.\n  Over the next 5 years, the legislation would also allow agencies to \nenter into power purchase agreements for electricity produced by \nrenewable energy\n\n[[Page S10643]]\n\nsources. These agreements could last not more than 20 years and \nagencies would need to assess that the agreement would be cost \neffective before entering into them.\n  We know from examples such as the solar power system at Nellis Air \nForce Base what a well-designed public-private partnership can \naccomplish, if executed correctly. This project cost the Air Force less \nthan $100,000 in capital costs, yet saved the government more than $1.2 \nmillion in its first year of operation by supplying \\1/4\\ of the total \npower used at the base, where 12,000 people live and work. \nAdditionally, the project is expected to reduce carbon emissions by \n24,000 tons annually.\n  Finally, the bill would expand the definition of renewable energy in \nFederal purchase requirements beyond electricity. Under the current \ndefinition, agencies cannot take advantage of ``green'' technologies \nlike geothermal energy because geo-thermal energy is not considered \nelectric.\n  By promoting accountability for meeting existing energy efficiency \nmandates and by encouraging initiatives to decrease energy usage and \nspur innovation, this bill would help ``green'' our federal operations. \nThe associated savings should improve our government's bottom line--to \nthe benefit of taxpayers.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 1831. A bill to amend the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 to \nreauthorize the venture capital program, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, our country's small businesses continue to \nstruggle with access to credit and capital for maintaining and growing \ntheir businesses. Small businesses are the engine of our economy and a \nkey factor in addressing unemployment. They employ more than half of \nall private sector employees and have generated approximately 64 \npercent of the net new jobs over the past 15 years. We should be doing \nmore to aid small businesses so they can not only stay on their feet \nbut also flourish to their full potential.\n  That is why I am reintroducing the Small Business Venture Capital \nAct, which reauthorizes the New Markets Venture Capital Program and \npromotes geographic equity so businesses across the country may benefit \nfrom the program. This program addresses the market gap in venture \ncapital for companies located in low- and moderate-income, rural, and \nurban areas--i.e., high unemployment areas--as well as the need for \nsmaller deals that neither traditional venture funds nor the SBIC \nProgram will make. It has proven successful so far, and we need more \ncommunity development venture capital to create sustainable, high-\nquality, local jobs.\n  Without this Government partnership, these investments are not going \nto be done. Particularly at a time when our economy is pressured and \nhurting, when we need to create jobs, I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport this bill. Last Congress, this bill came out of the Small \nBusiness Committee in a totally bipartisan fashion and it is my hope \nthat this time we complete the process.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Levin, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 1834. A bill to amend the Animal Welfare Act to ensure that all \ndogs and cats used by research facilities are obtained legally; to the \nCommittee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce the Pet Safety and \nProtection Act of 2009. The legislation amends the Animal Welfare Act \nto ensure that all companion animals such as dogs and cats used by \nresearch facilities are obtained legally. I am pleased to be joined by \na number of my colleagues, serving as cosponsors of the legislation \nincluding Senator Susan Collins, Senator Frank Lautenberg, Senator Carl \nLevin, and Senator Robert Menendez.\n  More than 40 years ago, Congress passed the Animal Welfare Act, AWA, \nto stop the mistreatment of animals and to prevent the unintentional \nsale of family pets for laboratory experiments. While the AWA has \nhelped to safeguard animals across the country, we still find that the \nAct does not adequately provide pets and pet owners with reliable \nprotection against the action of some unethical Class B dealers. Of the \neleven Class B dealers licensed by the Department of Agriculture, USDA, \nto sell live dogs and cats for experimentation, one has been issued to \na 5-year license suspension. and seven others are under investigation \nfor apparent violations of the AWA.\n  Despite new enforcement guidelines and intensified inspection efforts \nby USDA, it is nearly impossible to assure that stolen or lost pets \nwill not enter research laboratories via the Class B dealer system. \nEach year, hundreds of thousands of dollars are spent on regulating \nClass B dealers. Enactment of the Pet Safety and Protection Act helps \nreduce the Department of Agriculture's regulatory burden by allowing \nthe Department to use its resources more efficiently and effectively. \nIn order to combat any future violations of the AWA, this bill \nincreases the penalties under the Act to a minimum of $1,000 per \nviolation, in addition to any other existing penalties.\n  My legislation promotes humane treatment of animals and preserves the \nintegrity of research laboratories to obtain animals from legitimate \nsources, while complying with the AWA. Such legitimate sources include \nUSDA-licensed Class A dealers or breeders; municipal pounds that choose \nto release dogs and cats for research purposes; legitimate pet owners \nwho want to donate their animals to research; and private and Federal \nfacilities that breed their own animals. These four sources are capable \nof supplying millions of animals for research, far more cats and dogs \nthan are required by current laboratory demand.\n  A May 2009 study conducted by the National Academies, ``Scientific \nand Humane Issues in the Use of Random Source Dogs and Cats in \nResearch'' found that while some random-source dogs and cats may be \nnecessary and desirable for research that is funded by the National \nInstitute of Health, NIH, Class B dealers are not necessary to supply \nsuch animals for NIH funded research. Further this report makes clear \nthat there are sufficient, alternative sources to acquire animals with \ncharacteristics similar to animals provided by Class B dealers. As \nthere are legitimate sources of such animals, the report leave little \ndoubt that Class B dealers are no longer necessary.\n  In light of this recent report, this bill is an appropriate and \nfeasible action, as alternatives to Class B dealers do exist to meet \nresearch needs. This bill does not address the larger issue of whether \nanimals should or should not be used in research facilities. In fact, \nthis bill does not impair or impede research. Medical research is one \nof our primary tools in the discovery of new drugs and surgical \ntechniques that help develop cures for life-threatening diseases and \nanimal research has been, and continues to be, a fundamental part of \nscientific advancements. Instead, this legislation targets the \nunethical practice of selling stolen pets and stray animals to research \nfacilities by ending the fraudulent practices of Class B dealers, as \nwell as the unnecessary suffering of animals in their care. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a letter of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     Animal Welfare Institute,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 19, 2009.\n     Hon. Daniel Akaka,\n     U.S. Senate, Hart Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: We want to thank you for reintroducing \n     the Pet Safety and Protection Act. For too long, Class B \n     dealers who sell dogs and cats to research laboratories have \n     flouted the Animal Welfare Act, acquiring animals through \n     theft and fraud, lying about the origins of the animals, and \n     keeping them in inhumane conditions. Despite the hundreds of \n     thousands of tax dollars that the U.S. Department of \n     Agriculture spends trying to regulate Class B dealers, the \n     agency cannot guarantee that dogs and cats are not being \n     illegally acquired for use in experiments.\n       A May 2009 report from the National Academy of Sciences \n     supports the position that this bill will not have an adverse \n     impact on the conduct of research. In addressing the question \n     of whether Class B dealers are needed to supply NIH-sponsored \n     research with random source animals, the NAS concluded that \n     they are not. It found that animals with similar qualities \n     are available from alternative sources. ``The Committee \n     therefore determined Class B dealers are not necessary\n\n[[Page S10644]]\n\n     as providers of random source animals for NIH-related \n     research.''

Res. 316\n\n       Resolved,\n\n\n                              short title\n\n       Sec. 1.  This resolution may be cited as the ``Affirmation \n     of the United States Record on the Armenian Genocide \n     Resolution''.\n\n\n                                findings\n\n       Sec. 2.  The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) The Armenian Genocide was conceived and carried out by \n     the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923, resulting in the \n     deportation of nearly 2,000,000 Armenians, of whom 1,500,000 \n     men, women, and children were killed, 500,000 survivors were \n     expelled from their homes, and the elimination of the over \n     2,500-year presence of Armenians in their historic homeland.\n       (2) On May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers of England, France, \n     and Russia, jointly issued a statement explicitly charging \n     for the first time ever another government of committing ``a \n     crime against humanity''.\n       (3) This joint statement stated that ``the Allied \n     Governments announce publicly to the Sublime Porte that they \n     will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members \n     of the Ottoman Government, as well as those of their agents \n     who are implicated in such massacres''.\n       (4) The post-World War I Turkish Government indicted the \n     top leaders involved in the ``organization and execution'' of \n     the Armenian Genocide and in the ``massacre and destruction \n     of the Armenians''.\n       (5) In a series of courts-martial, officials of the Young \n     Turk Regime were tried and convicted, as charged, for \n     organizing and executing massacres against the Armenian \n     people.\n       (6) The chief organizers of the Armenian Genocide, Minister \n     of War Enver, Minister of the Interior Talaat, and Minister \n     of the Navy Jemal were all condemned to death for their \n     crimes, but, the verdicts of the courts were not enforced.\n       (7) The Armenian Genocide and these domestic judicial \n     failures are documented with overwhelming evidence in the \n     national archives of Austria, France, Germany, Great Britain, \n     Russia, the United States, the Vatican and many other \n     countries, and this vast body of evidence attests to the same \n     facts, the same events, and the same consequences.\n       (8) The United States National Archives and Record \n     Administration holds extensive and thorough documentation on \n     the Armenian Genocide, especially in its holdings under \n     Record Group 59 of the United States Department of State, \n     files 867.00 and 867.40, which are open and widely available \n     to the public and interested institutions.\n       (9) The Honorable Henry Morgenthau, United States \n     Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire from 1913 to 1916, organized \n     and led protests by officials of many countries, among them \n     the allies of the Ottoman Empire, against the Armenian \n     Genocide.\n       (10) Ambassador Morgenthau explicitly described to the \n     Department of State the policy of the Government of the \n     Ottoman Empire as ``a campaign of race extermination,'' and \n     was instructed on July 16, 1915, by Secretary of State Robert \n     Lansing that the ``Department approves your procedure . . . \n     to stop Armenian persecution''.\n       (11) Senate Concurrent Resolution 12, 64th Congress, agreed \n     to February 9, 1916, resolved that ``the President of the \n     United States be respectfully asked to designate a day on \n     which the citizens of this country may give expression to \n     their sympathy by contributing funds now being raised for the \n     relief of the Armenians,'' who at the time were enduring \n     ``starvation, disease, and untold suffering''.\n       (12) President Woodrow Wilson concurred and also encouraged \n     the formation of the organization known as Near East Relief, \n     chartered by the Act of August 6, 1919, 66th Congress (41 \n     Stat. 273, chapter 32), which contributed some $116,000,000 \n     from 1915 to 1930 to aid Armenian Genocide survivors, \n     including 132,000 orphans who became foster children of the \n     American people.\n       (13) Senate Resolution 359, 66th Congress, agreed to May \n     11, 1920, stated in part that ``the testimony adduced at the \n     hearings conducted by the sub-committee of the Senate \n     Committee on Foreign Relations have clearly established the \n     truth of the reported massacres and other atrocities from \n     which the Armenian people have suffered''.\n       (14) The resolution followed the April 13, 1920, report to \n     the Senate of the American Military Mission to Armenia led by \n     General James Harbord, that stated ``[m]utilation, violation, \n     torture, and death have left their haunting memories in a \n     hundred beautiful Armenian valleys, and the traveler in that \n     region is seldom free from the evidence of this most colossal \n     crime of all the ages''.\n       (15) As displayed in the United States Holocaust Memorial \n     Museum, Adolf Hitler, on ordering his military commanders to \n     attack Poland without provocation in 1939, dismissed \n     objections by saying ``[w]ho, after all, speaks today of the \n     annihilation of the Armenians?'' and thus set the stage for \n     the Holocaust.\n       (16) Raphael Lemkin, who coined the term ``genocide'' in \n     1944, and who was the earliest proponent of the United \n     Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \n     Genocide, invoked the Armenian case as a definitive example \n     of genocide in the 20th century.\n       (17) The first resolution on genocide adopted by the United \n     Nations at Mr. Lemkin's urging, the December 11, 1946, United \n     Nations General Assembly Resolution 96(1), and the United \n     Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \n     Genocide recognized the Armenian Genocide as the type of\n\n[[Page S10645]]\n\n     crime the United Nations intended to prevent and punish by \n     codifying existing standards.\n       (18) In 1948, the United Nations War Crimes Commission \n     invoked the Armenian Genocide, ``precisely . . . one of the \n     types of acts which the modern term `crimes against humanity' \n     is intended to cover,'' as a precedent for the Nuremberg \n     tribunals.\n       (19) The Commission stated that ``[t]he provisions of \n     Article 230 of the Peace Treaty of Sevres were obviously \n     intended to cover, in conformity with the Allied note of 1915 \n     . . ., offenses which had been committed on Turkish territory \n     against persons of Turkish citizenship, though of Armenian or \n     Greek race. This article constitutes therefore a precedent \n     for Article 6c and 5c of the Nuremberg and Tokyo Charters, \n     and offers an example of one of the categories of `crimes \n     against humanity' as understood by these enactments''.\n       (20) House Joint Resolution 148, 94th Congress, adopted on \n     April 8, 1975, resolved, ``That April 24, 1975, is hereby \n     designated as `National Day of Remembrance of Man's \n     Inhumanity to Man', and the President of the United States is \n     authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon \n     the people of the United States to observe such day as a day \n     of remembrance for all the victims of genocide, especially \n     those of Armenian ancestry . . .''.\n       (21) President Ronald Reagan, in proclamation number 4838, \n     dated April 22, 1981 (95 Stat. 1813), stated that, in part \n     ``[l]ike the genocide of the Armenians before it, and the \n     genocide of the Cambodians, which followed it--and like too \n     many other persecutions of too many other people--the lessons \n     of the Holocaust must never be forgotten''.\n       (22) House Joint Resolution 247, 98th Congress, adopted on \n     September 10, 1984, resolved, ``That April 24, 1985, is \n     hereby designated as `National Day of Remembrance of Man's \n     Inhumanity to Man', and the President of the United States is \n     authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling upon \n     the people of the United States to observe such day as a day \n     of remembrance for all the victims of genocide, especially \n     the one and one-half million people of Armenian ancestry . . \n     .''.\n       (23) In August 1985, after extensive study and \n     deliberation, the United Nations Sub-Commission on Prevention \n     of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities voted 14 to 1 \n     to accept a report entitled ``Study of the Question of the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide,'' which \n     stated that ``[t]he Nazi aberration has unfortunately not \n     been the only case of genocide in the 20th century. Among \n     other examples which can be cited as qualifying are . . . the \n     Ottoman massacre of Armenians in 1915-1916''.\n       (24) This report also explained that ``[a]t least \n     1,000,000, and possibly well over half of the Armenian \n     population, are reliably estimated to have been killed or \n     death marched by independent authorities and eye-witnesses. \n     This is corroborated by reports in United States, German and \n     British archives and of contemporary diplomats in the Ottoman \n     Empire, including those of its ally Germany''.\n       (25) The United States Holocaust Memorial Council, an \n     independent Federal agency, unanimously resolved on April 30, \n     1981, that the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum would \n     include the Armenian Genocide in the Museum and has since \n     done so.\n       (26) Reviewing an aberrant 1982 expression (later \n     retracted) by the Department of State asserting that the \n     facts of the Armenian Genocide may be ambiguous, the United \n     States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1993, \n     after a review of documents pertaining to the policy record \n     of the United States, noted that the assertion on ambiguity \n     in the United States record about the Armenian Genocide \n     ``contradicted longstanding United States policy and was \n     eventually retracted''.\n       (27) On June 5, 1996, the House of Representatives adopted \n     an amendment to House Bill 3540, 104th Congress (the Foreign \n     Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs \n     Appropriations Act, 1997), to reduce aid to Turkey by \n     $3,000,000 (an estimate of its payment of lobbying fees in \n     the United States) until the Government of Turkey \n     acknowledged the Armenian Genocide and took steps to honor \n     the memory of its victims.\n       (28) President William Jefferson Clinton, on April 24, \n     1998, stated: ``This year, as in the past, we join with \n     Armenian-Americans throughout the nation in commemorating one \n     of the saddest chapters in the history of this century, the \n     deportations and massacres of a million and a half Armenians \n     in the Ottoman Empire in the years 1915-1923.''.\n       (29) President George W. Bush, on April 24, 2004, stated: \n     ``On this day, we pause in remembrance of one of the most \n     horrible tragedies of the 20th century, the annihilation of \n     as many as 1,500,000 Armenians through forced exile and \n     murder at the end of the Ottoman Empire.''.\n       (30) Despite the international recognition and affirmation \n     of the Armenian Genocide, the failure of the domestic and \n     international authorities to punish those responsible for the \n     Armenian Genocide is a reason why similar genocides have \n     recurred and may recur in the future, and that just \n     resolution of this issue will help prevent future genocides.\n\n\n                         declaration of policy\n\n       Sec. 3.  The Senate--\n       (1) calls upon the President to ensure that the foreign \n     policy of the United States reflects appropriate \n     understanding and sensitivity concerning issues related to \n     human rights, ethnic cleansing, and genocide documented in \n     the United States record relating to the Armenian Genocide \n     and the consequences of the failure to realize a just \n     resolution; and\n       (2) calls upon the President in the President's annual \n     message commemorating the Armenian Genocide issued on or \n     about April 24, to accurately characterize the systematic and \n     deliberate annihilation of 1,500,000 Armenians as genocide \n     and to recall the proud history of United States intervention \n     in opposition to the Armenian Genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10645-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10645-S10647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 317--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL \n   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH AND EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE \n  SENATE THAT CONGRESS SHOULD CONTINUE TO RAISE AWARENESS OF DOMESTIC \n VIOLENCE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS DEVASTATING EFFECTS ON FAMILIES \n    AND COMMUNITIES, AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO END DOMESTIC \n                               VIOLENCE.\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. \nGillibrand, Mr. Crapo, Ms. Collins, Mr. Specter, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. \nStabenow, Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Burris) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 317\n\n       Whereas the President has designated October 2009 as \n     ``National Domestic Violence Awareness Month'';\n       Whereas domestic violence affects people of all ages as \n     well as racial, ethnic, gender, economic, and religious \n     backgrounds;\n       Whereas females are disproportionately victims of domestic \n     violence, and 1 in 4 women will experience domestic violence \n     at some point in her life;\n       Whereas on average, more than 3 women are murdered by their \n     husbands or boyfriends in the United States every day;\n       Whereas in 2005, 1,181 women were murdered by an intimate \n     partner constituting 78 percent of all intimate partner \n     homicides that year;\n       Whereas a 2001 study by the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention found that female intimate partners are more \n     likely to be murdered with a firearm than all other means \n     combined;\n       Whereas women ages 16 to 24 experience the highest rates, \n     per capita, of intimate partner violence;\n       Whereas 1 out of 3 Native American women will be raped and \n     6 out of 10 will be physically assaulted in their lifetimes;\n       Whereas the cost of intimate partner violence exceeds \n     $5,800,000,000 each year, $4,100,000 of which is for direct \n     medical and mental health care services;\n       Whereas \\1/4\\ to \\1/2\\ of domestic violence victims report \n     that they have lost a job due, at least in part, to domestic \n     violence;\n       Whereas the annual cost of lost productivity due to \n     domestic violence is estimated at $727,800,000 with over \n     7,900,000 paid workdays lost per year;\n       Whereas some landlords deny housing to victims of domestic \n     violence who have protection orders or evict victims of \n     domestic violence for seeking help after a domestic violence \n     incident, such as by calling 911, or who have other \n     indications that they are domestic violence victims;\n       Whereas 92 percent of homeless women experience severe \n     physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lifetimes;\n       Whereas approximately 40 to 60 percent of men who abuse \n     women also abuse children;\n       Whereas approximately 15,500,000 children are exposed to \n     domestic violence every year;\n       Whereas children exposed to domestic violence are more \n     likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away \n     from home, and engage in teenage prostitution;\n       Whereas one large study found that men exposed to physical \n     abuse, sexual abuse, and adult domestic violence as children \n     were almost 4 times more likely than other men to have \n     perpetrated domestic violence as adults;\n       Whereas nearly 1,500,000 high school students nationwide \n     experienced physical abuse from a dating partner in a single \n     year;\n       Whereas 13 percent of teenage girls who have been in a \n     relationship report being hit or hurt by their partners and 1 \n     in 4 teenage girls has been in a relationship in which she \n     was pressured by her partner into performing sexual acts;\n       Whereas adolescent girls who reported dating violence were \n     60 percent more likely to report one or more suicide attempts \n     in the past year;\n       Whereas there is a need for middle schools, secondary \n     schools, and post-secondary schools to educate students about \n     the issues of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating \n     violence, and stalking;\n       Whereas 88 percent of men in a national poll reported that \n     they think that our society should do more to respect women \n     and girls;\n       Whereas a recently released multi-State study shows \n     conclusively that the Nation's\n\n[[Page S10646]]\n\n     domestic violence shelters are addressing victims' urgent and \n     long-term needs and are helping victims protect themselves \n     and their children;\n       Whereas a 2008 National Census Survey reported that 60,799 \n     adults and children were served by domestic violence shelters \n     and programs around the Nation in a single day;\n       Whereas those same understaffed programs were unable to \n     meet 8,927 requests for help that day;\n       Whereas there is a need to increase funding for programs \n     aimed at intervening and preventing domestic violence in the \n     United States;

Mr. President, I rise to speak about an issue that has \nbeen very important to me for a long time, when I was a prosecutor as \nwell as a member of the Judiciary Committee with the Senate; that is, \ndomestic violence.\n  I am here because I am submitting a resolution supporting the goals \nand ideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. A number of \nour colleagues are cosponsoring the resolution. I am also here on \nbehalf of Pam Taschuk.\n  The police in Lino Lakes, MN, knew Pam Taschuk and they knew her \nhusband Allen. The police knew both of them because of the dozens of \n911 calls that had been made about Mr. Allen over the last 15 years. He \nbullied his wife, their sons, and other people so many times that local \npolice had set up a special tactical response plan just to respond to \ncalls at the Taschuk house.\n  Pam Taschuk was not your ordinary domestic violence victim, if there \nis such a thing. She was actually a juvenile probation officer and so \nmany police I know in Minnesota knew her. They worked with her. She was \na long-time probation officer and had worked in the field for years. \nShe was also a social worker. So it goes to show you anyone can be a \nvictim of domestic violence.\n  In January of 2008, Pam called the police and reported that her \nhusband had threatened to kill her, that Allen Taschuk had threatened \nto kill her. On August 25 of this year, Allen Taschuk bloodied Pam's \nnose, split her lip, and trapped her in their home overnight. He was \narrested, but he posted bail and was released.\n  On October 1, 2009, the Lino Lakes Police Department received the \nlast 911 call they would ever get about Allen Taschuk. On that day, \nAllen Taschuk called 911 himself to preemptively report a shooting at \nhis house. By the time the police arrived at his home, both he and Pam \nTaschuk were dead of gunshot wounds.\n  This happened last month in our State. This looks like a murder-\nsuicide. Of course, it looks like Allen killed Pam before finally \nturning the gun on himself. But we do not need to speculate about the \nfinal end order to focus on the sad prelude to this story--so many \nprevious 911 calls, so many earlier acts of violence, yet another \nvictim of what some domestic violence advocates have called the war at \nhome; a war that affected Pam, their children, and the community at \nlarge.\n  The most disturbing part of this story is Pam's death is not a tragic \nanomaly. Pam is one of 200 Minnesota women killed as a result of \ndomestic violence since 2000.\n  That is why I am submitting a resolution today to designate October \nNational Domestic Violence Awareness Month, because Pam Taschuk and too \nmany other women and children have to fight this ``war at home'' every \nday.\n  In the past several decades, thanks to the work of many individuals \nand organizations, there has been a sea change in the way our society \nlooks at the issue of domestic violence. Police, the courts, and the \npublic used to consider it a private family matter. Not surprisingly, \ndomestic violence was the No. 1 underreported crime in the country.\n  Today, there is much more awareness, and we have started to pass \ncritical legislation at both the State and Federal level to combat \ndomestic violence. So there has been a lot of progress, but there is \nstill a lot more to be done.\n  Last year, a survey done by the National Network to End Domestic \nViolence found that in 1 day, while more than 60,000 people received \nhelp from domestic violence programs, nearly 9,000 requests for help \nwent unanswered because the resources were not there.\n  The current statistics are staggering. Currently, one in four women \nwill experience abuse. More than three women are killed every day by \ntheir husbands or boyfriends. Millions of children witness abuse every \nyear, some studies say as many as 10 million children.\n  I remember the cases we had when I was county attorney for Hennepin \nCounty. When we looked at the records of someone who was an offender, \nwe would find way back in the records that they lived in a home where \nthere was domestic violence. In fact, statistics show that a child who \ngrows up in a home where there is domestic violence is 76 times more \nlikely to commit an act of domestic violence. That is why we had a \nposter framed in the hallway of our office. It was a picture of a woman \nwith a Band-Aid on her nose, holding a little baby, and the words under \nthe picture read: ``Beat your wife and your son will go to jail.''\n  We all must recognize as well that it doesn't take a bruise or a \nbroken bone for a child to be a victim of domestic violence. Kids who \nwitness this violence are victims too. Witnessing violence between \nadults in the home, especially when it is repeated and ongoing, \ninflicts a real trauma on kids that can have damaging effects for years \nto come. In many respects, ending the cycle of violence in communities \nbegins by getting violence out of the home because a violent home is, \nin fact, a factory for producing a new generation of violent offenders.\n  When I was a county attorney, I saw firsthand how domestic abuse \nharmed women and children, destroyed families, and challenged local law \nenforcement agencies, the court system, social service, and health care \nproviders. We actually had a recent shooting of a well-respected and \nlongtime police officer who was killed responding to a domestic abuse \ncall. Both the prevention and prosecution of domestic violence were \nalways among my top priorities when I was county attorney. We had one \nof the most landmark, cutting-edge domestic abuse service centers in \nthe country, and still do in Hennepin County.\n  Sheila Wellstone, whom we honored this month for Domestic Violence \nAwareness Month, would always point to the work in that center. It was \na one-stop shop. It is hard enough for lawyers to get through the \nredtape of a courtroom. This was a place where a victim of domestic \nviolence, man or woman, could get a protective order signed, fill out a \ncomplaint, talk to a police officer, with a play area for children. \nAlso--and this was unique for this center--there were representatives \nfrom domestic violence shelters there so they could find a place to \nlive.\n  The other challenge I found we had in these cases was working with \nthe victims so the case could be prosecuted after they filed the \ncomplaint. That is why it is so important we reauthorize the Violence \nAgainst Women Act. It was landmark legislation when it was passed over \n15 years ago. It has helped to train police so they do a better job \ndealing with victims and children of domestic violence. It also gives \nthem a sense, when they go to the scene, of the kind of evidence they \nshould look for. Many times victims get scared and decide not to \nprosecute. We have had many cases where we could prosecute with a \nreticent victim simply because of the evidence police were able to \ngather at the scene.\n  The Violence Against Women Act created a new culture for police \nofficers, judges, and those who work in the courthouse to treat this \ncrime as the serious crime it is. It is a very important tool, and it \nmust be reauthorized. As a member of the Judiciary Committee and one of \ntwo women on the committee, I look forward to working hard to \nreauthorize the Violence Against Women Act in 2010.\n  During tough economic times, we need to be extra vigilant against \ndomestic violence. Millions of Americans have already lost their jobs, \ntheir homes, or their retirement savings. Some have lost all three. \nThis kind of stress in the home and in the checkbook can lead to \nsubstance abuse and\n\n[[Page S10647]]\n\nacts of violence. We need to make sure law enforcement has the tools it \nneeds to protect families. That is why in the Economic Recovery Act, we \nincluded $225 million for Violence Against Women Programs and $100 \nmillion for programs that are part of the Victims of Crime Act. We also \nprovided critical funding for law enforcement to keep cops on the \nstreet and support law enforcement programs and services through the \nByrne Grant Program.\n  There is so much at stake, and there is so much each of us can still \ndo to make a difference. We have to remember that any act of domestic \nviolence hurts not only the individual victim, it hurts their family \nand hurts our community at large.\n  I will always remember a case we prosecuted when I was county \nattorney that brought home that point to me. It was a very sad case. \nThe victim was a Russian immigrant. She was very isolated from the \ncommunity, didn't have many friends, a victim of domestic violence, \nthey later learned, over the years. Her husband murdered her one day. \nThey had a little 4-year-old girl. I don't want to get into the gory \ndetails of what happened with her body, but he basically sickly brought \nher body to another State with the 4-year-old girl in the back seat. He \nlater confessed to the crime, and there was a little service. I say \n``little'' because the only people at the funeral service were her \nparents, who were from Russia, and her identical twin sister, the \nvictim's identical twin sister. I was there, and the victim witness \nadvocate was there. That was it. The little 4-year-old girl, I was \ntold, had been at the airport when the plane came in from Russia to \nmeet for the first time her grandmother and her now deceased mother's \nidentical twin sister.\n  When they got off the plane and came into the airport, this little \ngirl ran across the airport and hugged that identical twin sister and \nsaid: Mommy, mommy, mommy. She thought it was her mother who had come \nback.\n  That moment and that story always remind me that when we are talking \nabout domestic violence, it is not just one victim. It is the children \nand it is our entire community. That is why it is so important we \nrecognize Domestic Violence Month as well as reauthorize the Violence \nAgainst Women Act.\n  I thank Senators Leahy, Kohl, Feingold, Gillibrand, Crapo, Collins, \nSpecter, Landrieu, Stabenow, Kaufman, Durbin, Brown, and Senator \nBurris, the Presiding Officer, for being cosponsors. I invite all other \ncolleagues to join us.\n  I am proud to come from a State that has long been a leader in a \nnationwide effort to end domestic violence. We opened one of the first \nshelters in the country in 1974, and we started one of the first \nprograms aimed at addressing batterers in the early 1980s. The city of \nDuluth, MN, was the first city to mandate that its police officers make \narrests in domestic abuse cases. The city of Duluth in northern \nMinnesota recognized before the rest of the country that violence is \nviolence, whether it is perpetrated by someone you love or a stranger \non the street.\n  We can never stop working on behalf of women, children, and families \neverywhere to end domestic violence.\n  I ask unanimous consent to add Senator Burris as a cosponsor of the \nresolution.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10645-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10645-S10647]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 317--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF NATIONAL \n   DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AWARENESS MONTH AND EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE \n  SENATE THAT CONGRESS SHOULD CONTINUE TO RAISE AWARENESS OF DOMESTIC \n VIOLENCE IN THE UNITED STATES AND ITS DEVASTATING EFFECTS ON FAMILIES \n    AND COMMUNITIES, AND SUPPORT PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO END DOMESTIC \n                               VIOLENCE.\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR (for herself, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Feingold, Mrs. \nGillibrand, Mr. Crapo, Ms. Collins, Mr. Specter, Ms. Landrieu, Ms. \nStabenow, Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Burris) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I rise to speak about an issue that has \nbeen very important to me for a long time, when I was a prosecutor as \nwell as a member of the Judiciary Committee with the Senate; that is, \ndomestic violence.\n  I am here because I am submitting a resolution supporting the goals \nand ideals of National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. A number of \nour colleagues are cosponsoring the resolution. I am also here on \nbehalf of Pam Taschuk.\n  The police in Lino Lakes, MN, knew Pam Taschuk and they knew her \nhusband Allen. The police knew both of them because of the dozens of \n911 calls that had been made about Mr. Allen over the last 15 years. He \nbullied his wife, their sons, and other people so many times that local \npolice had set up a special tactical response plan just to respond to \ncalls at the Taschuk house.\n  Pam Taschuk was not your ordinary domestic violence victim, if there \nis such a thing. She was actually a juvenile probation officer and so \nmany police I know in Minnesota knew her. They worked with her. She was \na long-time probation officer and had worked in the field for years. \nShe was also a social worker. So it goes to show you anyone can be a \nvictim of domestic violence.\n  In January of 2008, Pam called the police and reported that her \nhusband had threatened to kill her, that Allen Taschuk had threatened \nto kill her.

Mr. President, it is with a great deal of sadness that \nSenator Barrasso and Representative Lummis and I inform our colleagues \nthat we have lost one of our good friends and a former Member of this \nbody, Clifford P. Hansen.\n  Cliff Hansen passed away on Tuesday night at the age of 97. His was, \nin every sense, a truly remarkable life. He was a man to match his \nmountains. He came from the shadow of the Tetons. If you have ever been \nthere, you know that when God made the Alps he had a couple left over \nand he took the biggest ones and he put them in Wyoming, and that is \nwhere Jackson Hole is.\n\n  Times such as these always draw me to the words of the Bible which \nremind us that ``to everything there is a season, a time for every \npurpose under heaven.'' So it is with all of us. Each role we play, \neach task we are called to perform is another time for us, another \nseason in our lives.\n  As has often been said, Cliff Hansen was Wyoming through and through, \na favorite son of the West who knew and understood our western way of \nlife better than anyone else. He knew it because he lived it and he \nlived it each and every day.\n  Cliff Hansen lived most of his life in the Jackson Hole area--all of \nhis life, except the time he was providing public service. He was born \nat the base of the Tetons and he lived a life in which he stood as tall \nand as proud in his support of Wyoming as those magnificent mountains. \nHis parents were homesteaders and from them he learned the importance \nof working hard for what you believe in and always giving it your best. \nIt was a philosophy that suited him well. A lot of people don't know \nthat as a child he was a stutterer, but he had a phenomenal teacher who \nworked with him, put rocks in his mouth. He attributed his success at \noratory to her help through those years.\n  A rancher by profession, Cliff spent the early part of his life \nworking the\n\n[[Page S10649]]\n\nland and learning to appreciate what a tremendously important resource \nit was. For him, the land was a precious gift, a legacy that helped him \nestablish himself as a rancher. As he tended the land, he also was \nworking at the local level to address the issues of the day. But that \nkind of success wasn't enough for him. Determined to find something \nelse he could do to help make a difference, he soon found his way to \nrun for public office. He was a county commissioner and, as a part of \nthat season, he served as Wyoming's Governor.\n  There was a lot to be done, so Cliff rolled up his sleeves and got \nright to the tasks at hand. To help the people of our State, Cliff \nworked to lower the voting age from 21 to 18. To make life a little \neasier for our senior citizens, he supported increasing retirement pay \nfor State employees. To help the next generation of our State's \nleaders, he helped increase funding for our schools and our education \nsystem.\n  At that point, Cliff could have called it a day and returned to the \nranch to sit back and enjoy reminiscing about all he had accomplished. \nOnce again, it wasn't enough for Cliff. He still had some good ideas \nand an interest in getting things done. That great heart of his \nwouldn't let him quit. So it was back to the campaign trail and an \noffer he once again made to the people of Wyoming to serve them again \nand began another season in his life. This one resulted in a run for \nthe Senate and a defeat of a very popular Democrat on the way, Teno \nRoncalio.\n  In the Senate, Cliff served on the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the \nFinance Committee, and the Special Committee on Aging. At each post, \namid every opportunity, Cliff always had his eye on Wyoming and how he \ncould best be of service to the people back home. He focused on issues \nsuch as reservoir projects, recreation and wilderness areas, and making \nsure we were good stewards of the Federal Treasury. He kept spending \nunder control.\n  He also made a major change for Wyoming. In the early days, the \nStates got about 37.5 percent royalty on minerals and he was able to \nraise that, with the help of a lot of his fellow Senators, working \nacross the aisle, to 50 percent. When he got that passed, it was at the \ntime that Gerald Ford was the President and the Chief of Staff was a \nWyoming boy named Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney had to initiate a call to \nCliff Hansen and let him know the President had some bad news for him.\n  At that point Dick Cheney put President Ford on the phone and the \nPresident said, I have some bad news for you, Cliff. I am going to have \nto veto that bill.\n  Cliff Hansen said, I have some bad news for you. I am going to find \nthe votes to override it, and he did.\n  It has been a great boon to our State.\n  While Cliff was serving in the Senate, I was serving as president of \nthe Wyoming Jaycees. Diana and I were in Washington to meet with him. \nHe invited us to the Senate dining room for breakfast. It was a great \nthrill for Diana and me to have a chance to meet with a Senator. We \nwill never forget how it was to be in that dining room with this good \nperson who turned out to be a trusted and valued friend. It was also my \nfirst encounter with grits. I found they taste as the name suggests.\n  Although Cliff had every reason to be proud of what he had achieved \nat every stage of his life, he would always be the first to say that he \ncould never have done it alone. Fortunately, he didn't have to, for \nwhen he returned to Jackson Hole after graduating from college he \nmarried a very special woman, Martha. I have to tell you, her dad was a \nlittle bit skeptical. He said, This guy comes from the valley that is \nknown as the safe harbor for horse thieves. Well, it happened, it \nstuck, and they started a wonderful love story that would last forever. \nIt is an adage that love is stronger than anything that comes to us in \nlife. Cliff and Martha will be forever great examples of that and their \nstory of life and love that lasted 75 years.\n  Diana and I always enjoyed seeing them together for they were the \nepitome of a great marriage. Cliff had a warm, engaging personality, he \nwas full of life, and he had a smile that reflected the genuine \nhappiness and contentment that he found in his life and in his family. \nMartha, by his side, was a kind and gracious woman. With her support \nand encouragement, Cliff had a tremendous asset in his life and in his \npolitical career. She also helped to keep him grounded. I remember one \nof the stories he often told of coming back from one of the Washington-\ntype gala events where he had been presented an award as legislator of \nthe year, one of 535 people to receive this award. As he was driving \nhome he was reflecting and saying, Martha, how many truly recognized \npeople are there in this world, she quickly said, One less than you \nthink. It is a lesson that he always kept.\n  I am pleased with the number of calls and e-mails we have had from \nformer staff members. His staff counsel mentioned the kindness he \nalways had, knowing the people who worked at the doors and the \nelevators, and at that time there were a lot of them who worked in the \nelevators. But one time he was waiting outside the Chamber door for him \nto come for a vote and he was getting a little worried that the vote \nwas going to run out, so he went looking for him and found that he was \nhelping a lady in a wheelchair up some of the steps so she could get \ninto the building. It was just the kind of thing he would do, go out of \nhis way to help out.\n  When I arrived in the Senate, Cliff and Martha became role models for \nDiana and me. They blazed a trail together and we learned a good deal \nfrom watching how they did it. Diana and I weren't the only ones to \nlearn from Cliff. One thing that so many of us will always remember \nabout him was his love for teaching the next generation about Wyoming's \nheritage and our land, our agricultural industry, an aspect so \nimportant to our State's economy that it is noted on our State seal.\n  Cliff was very proud of the training arena that was established at \nhis alma mater, the University of Wyoming, in his name. He went there \noften to visit the College of Agriculture and to meet with the \nstudents. Cliff knew full well that the future of our State could be \nmeasured by how well we took care of our State's land and he was \ndetermined that those who were to follow would have a sense of great \nresponsibility with which they had been entrusted.\n  Cliff understood the importance of everything he had been given in \nlife, from the greatest of resources to the smallest of everyday \nthings. I remember hearing a story from his grandson that I can't tell \nas well as his grandson, but I am going to make an attempt at anyway. \nHe was doing something called straightening nails with his grandson and \nsome of his grandson's friends. For those of you who don't know about \nstraightening a nail, you take a nail that is bent that you pull out of \nsome piece of wood and as you pull it, you bend it. He had a coffee can \nfull of those and he had an empty coffee can, and he would take one of \nthe bent nails, put it on a board and tap it with a hammer and then \nexamine it to see if it was straight. His grandson and the other boys \nwho were there said, Why are you going to all that work? Why don't you \njust go buy some new nails?\n\n  He said, How much is this costing me? The answer was, Nothing.\n  While he was doing this, this tapping away on these nails, Martha \ncame to the door of their house and said, You have a call, Cliff. You \nhave a call on the telephone here. Well, he kept tapping away on the \nnails, tapping away on the nails. Pretty quickly she came back and she \nsaid, Cliff, it is the President of the United States. So he got up and \nhe went in the house and took the phone call. A few minutes later he \nwas back out there tapping away on the nails, tapping away on the \nnails. His grandson was excited and wanted to know what that was all \nabout and asked him: What did the President want?\n  Cliff said, The President wanted me to be the Secretary of Interior; \ntap, tap, tap; tap, tap, tap. I said, No; tap, tap, tap; tap, tap, tap. \nHe was a man who knew what he wanted to do and what he needed to do and \ncould be totally absorbed in whatever he was doing.\n  There are a lot of stories like that one. Cliff cherished the simpler \ndays and the simpler ways of life. He also appreciated the benefits \nthat would come from technology and innovation and how they would \nimprove cattle and crop production. Technology and innovation, however, \ncould never replace\n\n[[Page S10650]]\n\nthe basic ideals of working hard, being of good character, and always \nkeeping your word. Those were things that could never be compromised. \nHe has left us all with a great legacy that will continue to inspire \nand encourage others to follow the path he leaves behind.\n  With the passing of Cliff Hansen, the political landscape and \neveryday life in Jackson Hole, WY, the West, and the United States has \nchanged. Wyoming has been blessed to have enjoyed a great history full \nof remarkable and colorful leaders in every sense of the word who have \nhelped to settle this Nation, tame the West, and bring the United \nStates to the position of greatness and power it enjoys today. We owe a \nlot to the great people of our past such as Cliff Hansen. Thanks to \nthem, our Nation and the world is a better place for us all to live.\n  Now this season of his life has come to an end. The season he was \nborn has led to this season when he has died. Everyone who knew him \nwill carry with them a special memory of his life and how the \nexperience of knowing Cliff changed them forever for the better. He was \na great gift in our lives and the lives of people all across the \ncountry who may never have known him but enjoyed the benefits of his \nlabors. His great calling was to be a teacher and he taught us all a \ngreat deal about life by how he lived his own. So much of my State \nbears his mark for his having passed by. He will be greatly missed for \nwho and what he was. He will never be forgotten for what he \naccomplished during his 97 years of life.\n  Diana and all the Enzis and our delegation send our deepest sympathy, \nour great appreciation, and our love to Martha and all the family. You \nwill be in our thoughts and prayers.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I join Senator Enzi today on the floor \nto share with our colleagues the profound sorrow that is felt all \nacross the State of Wyoming today as we mourn the death of a western \nAmerican icon and a former Member of this body, the Senate.\n  Cliff Hansen, Senator, Wyoming Governor, died last night, October 20, \nat home at his ranch in Jackson Hole, WY. He was 97 years old. He was \nat the time of his death the oldest living former Member of the Senate, \na career and a life that spanned nearly a century of American history. \nBut it wasn't the length of time he spent on this Earth that makes his \nlife so unique and so meaningful to all of us who knew him and who \nrespected him. It would be difficult to tell the story of Wyoming \nwithout also describing the life and the time of Cliff Hansen. They are \nintertwined, a pioneer State and its patriarch.\n  If it is true, as many people say, that Wyoming is what America was, \nCliff Hansen is the independent spirit, the rugged cowboy who made her \ngreat. My wife Bobbi and I wish to offer our deepest condolences to the \nHansen and the Mead families, to his beloved Martha, especially, his \nwife, as Senator Enzi said, of over 75 years. Just last month they \ncelebrated their 75th wedding anniversary. She was with him to the end.\n  Cliff Hansen is a legendary Wyoming figure, but to his family he was \na dedicated husband, father, a special grandfather and great-\ngrandfather, and someone who will be terribly missed.\n  He was born October 16, 1912. Prior to graduating from the University \nof Wyoming, he worked for his parents on a cattle ranch in Teton \nCounty. It was there we can presume that Cliff Hansen learned the \nmanner and the skills that would take him from Wyoming to Washington \nand back.\n  In 1962, Hansen was elected Governor of Wyoming. He served for 4 \nyears. He believed he could do more for the people of Wyoming in \nWashington than he could in Cheyenne. So he then ran and won a seat in \nthe Senate and was reelected by an overwhelming margin in 1972.\n  These simple dates hardly tell the story. Cliff Hansen was Wyoming's \nJohn Wayne--a proud, commonsense cowboy who spoke to the hearts and the \nminds of a great State.\n  As we have the opportunity to reflect more on Governor Hansen's \npassing, to hear, as well, from his family, there will be much more to \nsay and remember about his extraordinary legacy. But today, on the news \nof his passing to the Kingdom of Heaven--a phrase he used with great \nreverence--I want to make sure his friends and his colleagues know that \nGod accepts home a great man today.\n  To his wife Martha, his son Pete Hansen, his grandsons Matt and Brad \nand their families, his granddaughter Muffy, the Nation, and Wyoming \nsend you our heartfelt condolences. We hope you and your family are \ncomforted by his strength of character, his convictions, and his grace \nas a truly great man.\n  I speak today for thousands--for tens of thousands--of people who \nknew and who loved Cliff Hansen--all that he stood for, all that he \ntoday represents that is good about our Nation, the West, and Cliff's \nbeloved Wyoming.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today Senator Ensign and I are submitting a \nresolution designating October 22, 2009, Lights On Afterschool Day. \nLights on Afterschool brings students, parents, educators, lawmakers, \nand community and business leaders together to celebrate afterschool \nprograms. This year, more than 1 million Americans are expected to \nattend about 7,500 events designed to raise awareness and support for \nthese much needed programs.\n  In America today, 1 in 4 youth, more than 15 million children, go \nhome alone after the school day ends. This includes more than 40,000 \nkindergartners and almost 4 million middle school students in grades \nsix to eight. On the other hand, only 8.4 million children, or \napproximately 15 percent of school-aged children, participate in \nafterschool programs. An additional 18.5 million would participate if a \nquality program were available in their community.\n  Lights On Afterschool, a national celebration of afterschool \nprograms, is celebrated every October in communities nationwide to call \nattention to the importance of afterschool programs for America's \nchildren, families and communities. Lights On Afterschool was launched \nin October 2000 with celebrations in more than 1,200 communities \nnationwide. The event has grown from 1,200 celebrations in 2001 to more \nthan 7,500 today. This October, 1 million Americans will celebrate \nLights On Afterschool.\n  Quality afterschool programs should be available to children in all \ncommunities. These programs support working families and prevent kids \nfrom being both victims and perpetrators of violent crime. They also \nhelp parents in balancing the work and home-life. Quality afterschool \nprograms help to engage students in their communities, and when \nstudents are engaged, they are more successful in their educational \nendeavors.\n  In our work on the Senate Afterschool Caucus, Senator Ensign and I \nhave been working for more than 5 years to impress upon our colleagues \nthe importance of afterschool programming. It is our hope that they \nwill join us on October 22 to celebrate the importance of afterschool \nprograms in their communities back home.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Res. 318\n\n       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs provide safe, \n     challenging, engaging, and fun learning experiences that help \n     children and youth develop their social, emotional, physical, \n     cultural, and academic skills;\n       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs support working \n     families by ensuring that the children in such families are \n     safe and productive after the regular school day ends;\n       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs build stronger \n     communities by involving the Nation's students, parents, \n     business leaders, and adult volunteers in the lives of the \n     Nation's youth, thereby promoting positive relationships \n     among children, youth, families, and adults;\n       Whereas high-quality afterschool programs engage families, \n     schools, and diverse community partners in advancing the \n     well-being of the Nation's children;\n       Whereas ``Lights On Afterschool'', a national celebration \n     of afterschool programs held on October 22, 2009, highlights \n     the critical importance of high-quality afterschool programs \n     in the lives of children, their families, and their \n     communities;\n       Whereas more than 28,000,000 children in the United States \n     have parents who work outside the home and 15,100,000 \n     children in the United States have no place to go after \n     school; and\n       Whereas many afterschool programs across the United States \n     are struggling to keep their doors open and their lights on: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of \n     ``Lights On Afterschool'', a national celebration of \n     afterschool programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10651-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10651-S10652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    COMMEMORATING WOMEN MEMBERSHIP IN THE NATIONAL FFA ORGANIZATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of this \nresolution to commemorate 40 years of membership by women in the \nNational FFA Organization and to celebrate the achievements and \ncontributions of female FFA members.\n  It was 40 years ago, during the 1969 National FFA Convention, that \ndelegates voted to allow women to join the FFA.\n  Today, 41 percent of all members of the National FFA Organization are \nwomen, and more than 50 percent of leadership positions in the National \nFFA are held by women.\n  In my home State of Nebraska, more than 800 females have received \ntheir American FFA Degrees, the highest honor that can be awarded to an \nFFA member.\n  To be eligible for the American Degree, members must have earned and \nproductively invested $7,500 through a supervised agricultural \nexperience program where FFA members live out their motto of learning \nby doing.\n  American Degree recipients must also make it their mission to \ndemonstrate outstanding leadership abilities and community involvement.\n  More than 2,400 women in Nebraska have been awarded State FFA Degrees \nfor their accomplishments in their local chapters and agricultural \neducation classes.\n\n[[Page S10652]]\n\n  Nebraska also boasts more than 260 female State Proficiency winners \nand 5 female National Proficiency winners. These students represent the \nbest of the best, having achieved the highest level of excellence in \ntheir chosen fields.\n  Ninety women in Nebraska have served as State FFA Officers, with 8 \nserving as President. Four Nebraska females have served as National FFA \nOfficers. These leaders have invested their time and talents in \nbuilding influential relationships with members and growing the \nOrganization.\n  The contributions of female members have helped the National FFA \nOrganization to become a premier student leadership organization, \ncomprised of more than 507,000 members in all 50 states, Puerto Rico, \nand the Virgin Islands.\n  The FFA's mission is to make a positive difference in the lives of \nstudents by developing their potential for premier leadership, personal \ngrowth, and career success through agriculture education.\n  Today I am proud to offer a resolution to recognize the positive \ncontributions female members have made to achieve FFA's goals of \nproficient agricultural leadership and advocacy, community citizenship, \nvolunteerism, and cooperation.\n  I congratulate the National FFA Organization for 40 years of \nmembership by women and for its role in developing tomorrow's leaders.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent the resolution be agreed to, the \npreamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.

Sessions III\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, the Senate is taking action long \ndelayed by an anonymous Republican hold. That hold has extended for \nalmost 6 months without explanation. I have spoken repeatedly to the \nRepublican leader, the assistant Republican leader, and the ranking \nRepublican on the Senate Judiciary Committee. No one has given me any \nexplanation for the hold. When the Senate majority leader asked back in \nearly June to proceed to the nomination that was reported without \nobjection by the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 7, the Republican \nleader objected, saying ``we have not had an opportunity to get that \ncleared.'' They had had a month; another 4 months have now passed. In \nviolation of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act, no \nRepublican Senator has come forward in all this time to identify \nhimself and specify a reason for the hold.\n  Judge Sessions is an extraordinary public servant. Judge Sessions has \ntwice previously been confirmed unanimously by the Senate to serve on \nthe Sentencing Commission. He has served with distinction for 10 years, \nand has served as a vice chair of the Sentencing Commission. He is a \ndistinguished U.S. Federal judge who has served for 14 years and now \nserves as the chief judge for the District of Vermont. He is a member \nof the Judicial Conference of the United States, made up of the leaders \nof the Federal judiciary. He has also contributed to his local \ncommunity as a public defender, an adjunct law professor, and even as a \ncoach of the local Little League team. A lawyer's lawyer and a judge's \njudge, he has earned the praise of both the prosecution bar and the \ndefense bar.\n  Judge Sessions is eminently well qualified to serve as the chair of \nthe Sentencing Commission. I must say that in my numerous conversations \nwith Republican Senators and Republican Senate leaders during the last \n6 months, no one raised any dispute or criticism or reason for this \nobstruction and delay.\n  This is most unfortunate because some of us have worked very hard to \nmove beyond the era when delays in nominations to fill vacancies on the \nSentencing Commission got so bad and extended so long that it drew the \nattention of the Chief Justice of the United States in his annual \nreports in 1997 and 1998. I have worked with the Republican chairmen \nand ranking members on the Judiciary Committee and consistently \nprotected their rights and interests. I have treated their recommended \nnominees with respect and shown them support. I worked to break the \nimpasse in the Republican-led Senate by working across the aisle and \nwith the White House to develop a slate of nominees, Republican, \nDemocratic and independent, that was confirmed as a group. Thereafter, \nI have worked conscientiously with the lead Republican on the Judiciary \nCommittee to fill vacancies appropriately as they arose.\n  Most recently, I worked even during the last weeks of the Bush \nadministration to have the Judiciary Committee report and the Senate \nconfirm two nominees recommended and supported by Senate Republicans. \nWilliam Carr, a recommendation from the ranking Republican on the \nJudiciary Committee, was confirmed on November 20, 2008, weeks after \nthe Presidential election, and now serves as a vice chair. We also \nproceeded to confirm to another term Judge Ricardo Hinojosa, who I \nsupported when he was nominated to the Commission by his friend \nPresident Bush in January 2003, when he was nominated and confirmed as \nchair in\n\n[[Page S10653]]\n\n2004, and when he was renominated for another term and confirmed in \nNovember 2008. Judge Hinojosa has served as acting chair because \nRepublicans have held up the confirmation of Judge Sessions. \nApparently, Senate Republicans have chosen to respond to our having \nproceeded with those confirmations in November 2008 to the Sentencing \nCommission and to my years of cooperative efforts by resorting to delay \nand obstruction. They have refused to allow the Senate to consider the \nnomination of Judge Sessions to serve as chair of the Sentencing \nCommission for the last several months.\n  I commend Judge Sessions for his patience, determination and sense of \npublic service. I thank the majority leader for proceeding to file the \ncloture petition last night that is finally resulting in Senate action \non this important nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/21/senate-section/article/S10653-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.
