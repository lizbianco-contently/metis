Mr. President, I welcome my colleagues back to the Senate \nafter an August work period that saw passionate and profound sadness \nacross our country. Each of us has heard from our constituents over the \npast few weeks. In Nevada, I heard from citizens across my State who \nare ready for us to pick up where we left off. They are ready for us to \nget back to the hard work of legislating. They are ready for us to move \nforward on one of the most critical issues of our time and the life's \ncause of our late colleague, Senator Ted Kennedy, making it easier to \nafford a healthy life in America.\n\n\n    Moment of Silence in Honor of the Late Senator Edward M. Kennedy\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now observe a moment of \nsilence in memory of our friend and departed colleague, the late \nSenator Edward Kennedy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  [Moment of silence.]\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have to acknowledge that as I came into \nthe Chamber this afternoon, I came upon Senator Kennedy's desk, which \nis covered with the traditional black velvet, with the flowers and his \nfavorite poem on the desk. I read the poem and a tear came to my eye.\n  I cherish the time that I can spend with the people of Nevada when I \ngo home and talk with them and learn from them. The people in Nevada \ncare about the volatility of our turbulent economy.\n  Nevadans see as clearly as anyone in America that we are going \nforward. In fact, we are getting back on our feet after long years of \nneglect. They watched as Wall Street went wild, foreclosures reached \nrecord highs, and jobs vanished into thin air. But thanks to the \nleadership of President Obama, the hard work of the Congress, and the \nunwavering determination of our constituents, they now are seeing these \nwounds beginning to heal.\n\n  This Senate has risen to the challenges we inherited. In the face of \nunprecedented conditions, we responded\n\n[[Page S9102]]\n\nwith the most significant collection of accomplishments in recent \nhistory. We are proud of our important efforts to revive our economy, \nstrengthen our national security, protect our environment, demand \naccountability, and promote equality and ensure progress.\n  In the first months of this year, we passed an economic recovery plan \nthat is creating jobs as we speak, strengthening the middle class, and \ninvesting in our future. Just last week, the Wall Street Journal \nacknowledged that the plan we passed is helping us recover from the \nrecession faster than expected.\n  We also put people ahead of big business by protecting credit card \nusers, cracking down on mortgage scams, and rooting out corporate \nfraud.\n  We helped millions of children stay healthy by making it easier for \nthem to get the care they need; that is, the CHIP program, Children's \nHealth Insurance Program, and by making it harder for tobacco companies \nto prey on our kids.\n  We made it easier for Americans to serve their country like our \nheroes of generations past, and we protected our public lands for \ngenerations to come.\n  We passed overdue appropriations bills, new appropriations bills, and \nan honest, responsible budget that makes sound investments in every \npart of our country.\n  This Congress also made history by pursuing justice and ensuring \nequality for every single American. We stood up for those who are \nvictims of violence because of race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and \nfor those who are targets of discrimination in the workplace because of \ngender or background--Lily Ledbetter.\n  The Senate confirmed President Obama's outstanding nominee for the \nSupreme Court. Sonia Sotomayor will become the first Hispanic and only \nthe third woman to sit on the highest bench in the land. I think \ntomorrow the first argument she will participate in will take place.\n  This is an impressive record for any Congress. I am particularly \nproud that we have accomplished all of this in little more than 6 \nmonths.\n  How did we get there? We did each of these critical things because we \nfound ourselves in exceptional circumstances. We faced daunting tests \nand unparalleled problems.\n  As in any emergency, it is important to understand how we got here. I \nam not interested in looking backward to place blame on others or \npointing fingers. But it is important to learn from past mistakes so we \ndon't repeat them. As I see it, there are two primary reasons we found \nourselves in such a deep hole. The first is that for far too long we \nhave put off today's problems until tomorrow. Second is that too many \nfocus only on where we differ, not where we agree. We no longer have \nthe luxury of doing either. Only by working together--not as Democrats \nor Republicans but as Americans, not as partisans but as partners--can \nwe put the jobless back to work, make sure everyone can afford to stay \nhealthy, and create a new clean energy economy for this new century.\n  Health care. Learning those two lessons--that we can no longer put \noff today's problems until tomorrow and that we cannot afford to focus \nonly on where we disagree--will be the difference between reforming \nhealth insurance in a meaningful way or letting the status quo and \nscare tactics hold us back.\n  Thanks to Chairman Baucus and Senator Dodd, we have made progress \ntoward passing comprehensive health reform. Four out of five \ncongressional committees responsible for this issue have reported \nbills, and we will soon see the same from the Finance Committee.\n  While many important choices remain, we are as committed as ever to a \nplan that will protect what works, fix what doesn't, and help the \nmiddle class get ahead. We will stabilize health insurance for those \nwho have it and secure it for those who do not. We will keep the \ninsurance industry honest and lower costs to ensure that every American \ncan afford to stay healthy. And we are determined to pass a good, \nbipartisan bill this year.\n  I have listened to hard-working Nevadans across my State who know the \ndifference between fact and fiction. They know the difference between \nthe misinformation spread by opponents of progress and the reality that \nour vision of reform means patients and their doctors should be the \nonly ones making decisions about their medical care. Those decisions \nbelong to the people, not to the insurance industry or to government \nbureaucrats.\n  The American people know our vision of reform means keeping insurance \ncompanies honest and not letting them deny you care because you have a \npreexisting condition. The way things are now, if you have anything \nfrom heart disease to high cholesterol to hay fever, you might be out \nof luck. That is not right.\n  They know our vision of reform means not allowing health insurance \ncompanies to drop your coverage if you become seriously ill. It means \nensuring that if you change or lose your job, you will have affordable \noptions to cover your family.\n  They know we are fighting for reform that will make quality, \naffordable care available to every single American citizen.\n  It is easy to focus only on the part of the road we have yet to go, \nbut it is essential to remember the great distance we have traveled to \nget to this point, and the common ground we already share.\n  We have heard a lot from opponents of progress. One of their main \narguments is that they think we cannot afford health insurance reform. \nMy response is simply this: We cannot afford not to make it easier to \nlive a healthy life in America.\n  The American people have rejected those who pretend things are fine \nthe way they are. They know that unless we get this done, they could \nlose their health care, and so much more along with it. They know \nAmerica has no place for those who hope for failure.\n  Inaction is not an option. We have already seen what happens when we \ndo nothing. Over the past 8 years of inaction, the costs of health care \nrose to record levels and the number of Americans who cannot afford \ninsurance has done the same.\n  For the millions of families who file foreclosure because they cannot \nafford both their house and their health care, not acting is not an \noption.\n  For the millions of Americans who file for bankruptcy because their \nmedical bills grow higher and higher, not acting is not an option.\n  For the millions of Americans who skip doctor visits or treatments \nthey need to stay healthy or who never fill the prescriptions their \ndoctor gives them because health care is simply too expensive, not \nacting is not an option.\n  Our health care system is not healthy. Americans' physical health and \nAmerica's fiscal health are at stake, and not acting is not an \noption. We have to work in good faith. This past April, I sent my \nRepublican counterpart a letter outlining our priorities for the health \ncare debate. I wrote, of course, that Democrats are committed to \nlowering health care costs, expanding access, and improving the quality \nof care. I said in that letter we looked forward to a dialog about how \nto prevent disease, reduce health disparities, and encourage early \ndetection and effective treatments that save lives.\n\n  But in the letter of more than 4 months ago, I also said that in \norder to help struggling Americans, we cannot drown in distractions and \ndistortions.\n  I made clear bipartisanship depended on Republicans demonstrating a \nsincere interest in legislating, offering concrete and constructive \nproposals, and working together in our common interest rather than \nagainst each other and against the interests of the American people.\n  I stand by that assessment as strongly today as I did this spring, 4 \nmonths ago. It is painfully clear to everyone who heard this debate's \ndisturbing turns and dishonest tactics that, more than ever, we now \nneed people willing to work together in good faith.\n  Today is the first day since January 2, 1953, that a man named \nKennedy does not have a desk on the floor of the Senate or in the Oval \nOffice at the White House.\n  When I think of all the groundbreaking progress we have made over \nthose 56\\1/2\\ years--in civil rights, education, health care, America's \nglobal leadership--I know we have no choice but to keep going. Now is \nno time to let up.\n  Tomorrow night, the President of the United States will stand on the \nother side of the Capitol and tell a joint session of Congress his \nvision for the\n\n[[Page S9103]]\n\nhealth care debate that is ensuing. He will do that, and then over the \ncoming weeks and months, we will contemplate and think about what he \nsaid.\n  It is not insignificant that President Obama will be speaking to such \na gathering. We will come together in a joint session because we share \na joint future and a joint destiny. We are all in this together--\nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents, every American citizen and \neach of their representatives here, Members of Congress, Senators, and \nthe President of the United States.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy said last December, just months ago:\n\n       We know the future will outlast all of us, but I believe \n     that all of us will live on in the future we make.\n\n  This is a historic moment. This is our time to shape our future. We \nstand closer to real health insurance reform than ever before. We are \ncloser than ever to getting this right. We will not give up. We will \nnot bet on failure. We will not let fear obscure the facts. We will not \nlet the priorities of the partisan overpower those of the people.\n  We have goal lines ahead of us. I say to the Presiding Officer, a \nmember of the Finance Committee, we have to do everything we can to \njoin together to do health care reform that is meaningful to this \ncountry. I think I speak for everyone in Nevada and I think I speak for \neveryone on this side of the aisle and I am confident my friend, the \ndistinguished Republican leader, agrees with me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9103-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9103]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I previously had an opportunity to \nwelcome my friend, the majority leader, back and welcome all our other \ncolleagues from an active month in August. I know we always enjoy \nspending this time with our constituents and hearing their particular \nconcerns. This year, most of us got an earful, and I hope the \nexperience has an effect on our work as we move forward.\n  Health care reform is clearly a critical issue for many Americans, \nand I think we have an obligation to show them we have been listening \nclosely to their concerns.\n  At this point, there should be no doubt about where the American \npeople stand: The status quo is not acceptable but neither are any of \nthe proposals we have seen from the White House or the Democrats in \nCongress so far.\n  The White House has attempted to retool its message on health care \nmany times. It should be clear by now that the problem is not the sales \npitch. The problem is what they are selling.\n  Over the past several weeks, I have visited with a lot of doctors, \nnurses, seniors, hospital workers, small business men and women and a \nwhole lot of other citizens across Kentucky and, for that matter, \nthroughout the country. None of them would call our current health care \nsystem perfect. But all of them are worried about so-called reforms \nthat would undermine the things they like about the American health \ncare system.\n  The American people are asking us to start over. They want reforms, \nbut they want the right reforms, not some grand scheme that increases \nthe national debt, expands the Federal Government, raises taxes, cuts \nseniors' benefits, and forces Americans off the plans they currently \nhave and like. They want reforms that work within the system we have.\n  We have a lot of work to do in the weeks ahead, but these past few \nweeks have given us all something valuable. They have given us real \nclarity about the direction Americans want us to take and, as \nimportantly, the direction they do not want us to take. Now it is our \nturn to show them we have been listening and to act.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I believe I have 15 minutes, and I \nwould ask the Chair to let me know when 2 minutes remains.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9103-4", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9103-S9105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LISTENING TO THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, we have two speeches by the President \nof the United States today and tomorrow. The speech today is to the \nschoolchildren of America, and the one tomorrow night is to us--to a \njoint session of Congress and to the country.\n  For the last several days, there has been a small uproar about the \nPresident's speech to schoolchildren. In some ways, that is very \nunderstandable. The country is very wary right now of more Washington \ntakeovers. We have seen takeovers of banks and insurance companies and \ncar companies and student loans and even farm ponds and health care, \nand all of a sudden some people may have thought the President was \nintending to take over the classrooms of America as well. That was \ncompounded by the fact that the early lesson plans--probably drawn up \nby someone either in the White House or the Department of Education--\nmade the speech seem more about the President than about the children \nand inviting the children to help the President fulfill his goal of the \nway he wants to transform America.\n  Well, all that has been changed. The lesson plan has been altered. \nThe President has released a copy of his speech. I read it this morning \nin Tennessee on my way coming up. It is a good speech. It is about the \nimportance of studying and education. It is about how the President \ngrew up, which is an inspiring story, as is the case with almost all of \nour Presidents.\n  So I am glad the President has spoken to the schoolchildren of this \ncountry. Of course, the President of the United States ought to be able \nto speak to the schoolchildren of America. President Reagan did it. Not \nlong after he was elected, he talked about how our country was founded. \nWhen I was Education Secretary in 1991, the first President Bush did \nit. He talked primarily about drugs, with a warning about the dangers \nof drug use. Presidents should speak to our students, but, of course, \nparents and teachers should decide whether the children hear the speech \nand in what context they hear it.\n  Tomorrow night, when the President addresses the country, no one has \nto listen to him, except those of us, perhaps, who volunteered to serve \nin the Congress. We will be here. Millions will listen out of respect \nto the office, but some could turn off their televisions, some could \njust read about it, some could listen to the commentators talk about \nit, and some could watch it on the Web. Children have a different \nsituation. They are captive in their classrooms and they are \ninexperienced, so we rely on parents and teachers to use their good \njudgment to decide whether any speech is appropriate for children to \nhear and in what context.\n  If I were a teacher, I would jump at the chance to take advantage of \nthis speech. I believe I would put up a picture of Reagan and one of \nFDR and one of Abraham Lincoln, and I would talk about the Presidency \nand I would talk about how he is the agenda setter and how the \nPresident's election--this President and other Presidents--represents \nthe unique American characteristic that anything is possible for any \nAmerican of any background. I would point out that there is a Congress \nas well and the Congress often disagrees with the President. And then I \nwould put up a picture of the leader of North Korea, and I would say: \nThere is the dear leader of North Korea. If you criticize him, you go \nto jail. If you\n\n[[Page S9104]]\n\ncriticize the President of the United States, you have a constitutional \nright to do that.\n  I believe we need more teaching of U.S. history and civics in our \nclassrooms so our children can grow up to learn what it means to be an \nAmerican. The lowest scores high school seniors have in America are not \nin math, they are not in science, they are in U.S. history. So we ought \nto take advantage of opportunities for children to learn about history \nand about civics, but parents and teachers ought to be in charge of it. \nThey should decide in what context it is done, and I hope a great many \nhave taken advantage of that and will take advantage of that.\n  There is a second speech, tomorrow night, which the country is \nlooking forward to, and that is about health care. Here are my hopes \nfor that speech.\n  First, respectfully, I would say to the President, I hope he says: My \nfellow Americans, let's start over. It is obvious we need health care \nreform, but it is also obvious that most Americans, or at least a \nmajority, aren't comfortable with the direction in which we are going. \nSo since this affects 17 or 18 percent of our economy, since it affects \nthe 250 million Americans who have health insurance, let's start over. \nThis has gone from being an issue to being something personal, or as we \nsay in Tennessee, they have gone from preaching to meddling. That is \nwhy at the town meetings, which would normally attract 30 people, we \nhave had a thousand people show up, because their health is at issue \nand they want to know what is going on. So it is a very healthy thing \nfor people to show up and ask questions, and I hope that the President \nhas heard the American people and that we start over.\n  Next, I hope the President says: We will start with cost--the cost to \nyou, Mr. and Miss American, the cost to your government. Health care \ncosts too much for you to buy your policy, and it is about to bankrupt \nthe government unless we do something about it. So that is where we \nwill start.\n  Third, I hope the President will say: One of the lessons I think we \nhave learned--not just during the last several months while I have been \nPresident--if I were President Obama--but in President Bush's time and \nbefore that is that we don't do comprehensive very well. We found that \nout in immigration. We had a bipartisan effort here on immigration. We \ntried hard to solve a problem only the Congress can solve, and we \nfailed. By the time it came up for a vote, it just fell around our \nnecks. We have tried it with health care. We have tried to bite off the \nwhole thing at once, and I think it is more than we can chew. We have \nbeen trying it with economy-wide cap and trade for climate change, and \nit looks as if we are biting off more than we can chew there as well. \nThat should be no big surprise. This is a huge country--300 million \npeople--an economy that produces 25 percent of all the wealth in the \nworld, so diverse that if we were to put ourselves all in one room, it \nwould explode, which is why it is such a good reason we have such a big \ncountry.\n\n  So I hope the President will say we don't do comprehensive well. We \nhave heard the American people, so let's see if we can agree on a few \nthings. Let's go step by step in the right direction, which is one good \nway to get where you want to go--step by step to re-earn the trust of \nthe American people, starting with health care.\n  I can think of some things on which I believe we have bipartisan \nagreement in the Senate which would make a difference: Small business \nhealth insurance--allow small businesses to pool their resources. It \nhas been estimated that you could offer insurance to a million more \nworkers at a lower cost. That is one thing. Make it possible for people \nnot to lose their insurance. If they are able to buy insurance, make it \npossible for them to buy insurance if they have a preexisting health \ncondition--we could probably do that. Allow people to buy insurance \nacross State lines. The Presiding Officer and I were both Governors. We \nare jealously protective of States' responsibilities and rights. But \nmaybe we need to allow insurance to be bought more often across State \nlines to make it available to more people and less expensive. Junk \nlawsuits against doctors--that increases the cost of health care from 1 \npercent to 10 percent, depending on whom you believe. But we could take \nthat step. It is an important step in the right direction. As far as \nthose who are uninsured, about 20 percent of those who are uninsured \nare already eligible for existing programs. We could see if we could \nfind ways to help them sign up for programs that already exist. Step by \nstep in the right direction will help us get where we need to go in \nhealth care. Step by step will re-earn the trust of the American \npeople.\n  Fourth, I would hope the President would say: Let's do this in a \nbipartisan way. There is some talk of just ramming this through the \nSenate with a bare majority of votes. I hope that doesn't happen. It \nwould be bad for the country and it would be bad for the majority \nparty, if I may say so. The reason it would be bad for the country is \nit would be a bad bill.\n  The way our rules work, the Parliamentarian, who is a very wise \nindividual, would end up writing the health care bill because he would \nhave to make all these decisions about what was germane and about what \nfit in the bill. For example, he might have to say: Well, you can't put \na provision about preexisting conditions in the bill under the Senate \nrules. All you can vote on is whether to raise taxes or cut Medicare. \nNow, that would be a very unappetizing vote, I would think, for many \nMembers of the Senate, and it would be a very bad health care bill, \nwhich would cause me to think that such an unappetizing vote would be \nbad medicine for those who insisted on ramming it through. But it would \nbe bad medicine for another reason. It would be thumbing our nose at \nthe people of America who have been trying to say to us over the last \nseveral weeks: Whoa. Slow down. This is my health care you are talking \nabout. Let's make sure we do this right. Start over, and let's take it \nstep by step.\n  Health care is not the only issue. Health care is the entry into a \nlarger issue, which is too many takeovers, too much debt, too many \nczars, and the American people would like for us to settle down and \ndeal with this issue. Some of the people have said over the last few \nweeks that the American people didn't know what they were talking \nabout; that they thought there weren't any real issues out there. I am \nafraid that is wrong. When you have the Mayo Clinic and the Democratic \nGovernors and the Congressional Budget Office telling you that you are \nheaded in the wrong direction, maybe you are. When you read about a new \ntrillion-dollar debt added to a debt that is already going to double in \nthe next 4 or 5 years, maybe you are going in the wrong direction. When \nthe New York Times editorial says the new program is going to be paid \nfor about half by cuts in Medicare, that is a serious issue for the 40 \nmillion people on Medicare.\n  There are 177 million people with employer insurance, and they worry \nthey might lose that employer insurance. People are worried that they \nmight be dumped, if they are low-income, into a government program that \nalready exists called Medicaid, which 40 percent of the doctors won't \nserve because they are underpaid, or they are worried they might be \ndumped into a new government program, if they are middle income, and \nthey might not want to be dumped into a government program. There is \nworry, especially among older Americans, because someone might say: You \nare 70 years old and you can't have a hip replacement. And there are \nemployers who in a recession aren't interested in paying more of an \nemployer tax. And the Democratic Governors and the Republican Governors \nhave said: Don't send us more costs for Medicaid or we won't be able to \nafford it here. We will have to raise taxes. And Federal taxes would go \nup.\n  Those are real issues. Those aren't made-up issues. Those are all \npart of the bills that are making their way through Congress, and that \nis why people are saying: Whoa.\n  Finally, I hope President Obama will say: I am the President. I am \nthe agenda setter. I am going to take charge of this debate.\n  The President and his team are very smart. We admire them very much. \nBut in some ways, it reminds me of a Harvard Law Review meeting, with \neveryone sitting around the room thinking of very bright ideas and \nnobody getting anything done. When you are dealing with a big and \ncomplex issue such as health care, the President needs to\n\n[[Page S9105]]\n\nclear the decks, set the agenda, tell us what to do, and sit down with \nthe Democratic leader and the Republican leader and say: What can we \ndo? And then the President, I respectfully suggest, needs to say--as \nPresident Eisenhower did half a century ago when he said, ``I shall go \nto Korea''--that health care is the issue. I am the President, here is \nwhat I think we should do, and I am going to stay on this issue until \nit is done. Now, a Governor knows--and most Presidents know--that if \nthey say that and do that and stick to it for as long as it takes, they \ncan very usually wear everybody else out. The President may not get \nexactly what he wants. Of course, he probably won't. But there might be \nimprovements to the bill. When the Democratic majority in Tennessee \nused to improve my proposals, I could either attack them or say: You \nhave improved my proposals. I usually said: You have improved my \nproposals, gave them credit, and went on to the next issue.\n  So people all over America are alarmed, some are even scared about \nWashington takeovers, debt doubling and tripling, and I suggest the \nright course for us is for the President to say: Let's start over with \nhealth care. Let's go step by step to re-earn the trust of the American \npeople. Careful steps in the right direction are a very good way to get \nwhere we want to go, and I hope he tells us exactly what those steps \nshould be.\n  I made a statement at the 75th anniversary of the Great Smoky \nMountains National Park last Wednesday. It is our most visited national \npark. Secretary Salazar was there. He did a beautiful job, only \nexceeded by Dolly Parton, who was there and who made all the rest of us \ncompletely irrelevant by her performance. But to have that great park \nfor 75 years in the Eastern United States, where 9 million people \nvisit--three times as many visiting our great western parks--is a great \nadvantage for our country. I am grateful to the Secretary for coming, \nand I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of my \nremarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Statement of U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander at the 75th Anniversary of \n                the Great Smoky Mountains National Park\n\n       Newfound Gap, Tenn.--U.S. Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) \n     delivered the following remarks here today at the 75th \n     Anniversary of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park:\n       ``Governors Bredesen and Perdue, Secretary Salazar, Dolly \n     Parton, my colleagues in Congress, fellow friends of the \n     Smokies, in 1934 a ranger wrote a memo identifying the \n     wildlife he had found in this new park. There were 100 black \n     bears. Today there are 1,600. There were 315 wild turkeys \n     then. The other day I saw 21 outside my home two miles from \n     the park boundary. 75 years ago there were 12 whitetail deer \n     in Tennessee and six in North Carolina. Today they're \n     everywhere. Then there were no peregrine falcons, no river \n     otters, no elk in the Great Smokies, but they are all here \n     today.\n       ``25 years ago, as Governor, I spoke at the 50th \n     anniversary. There was no law then controlling acid rain and \n     no organization called `Friends of the Smokies.' Today, acid \n     rain laws are working and the `Friends' have contributed $28 \n     million.\n       ``So what should we hope for as we look to the 100th \n     anniversary? I hope we have finished cleaning the air so \n     that, instead of seeing smog, we can always see the blue haze \n     about which the Cherokee sang; and that we will have done \n     more to celebrate the way of life of families who lived here; \n     that we will have become better students of the remarkable \n     environmental diversity here--more different kinds of trees \n     than in all of Europe, new species discovered every year; \n     that we do a better jobs of creating picturesque entrances \n     and encouraging conservation easements along the park \n     boundaries to protect the wildlife and the magnificent views. \n     And I hope there are more private contributions and federal \n     dollars to protect and maintain one of the dozen most visited \n     places in the world.\n       ``India has its Taj Mahal, Italy has its art, England its \n     history, but we have the Great American Outdoors. Ken Burns \n     says our national Parks are `America's Best Idea.' Well, then \n     the Great Smokies must be the very best idea of all because \n     so many more people come here.\n       ``Just as remarkable, I believe, is how we who live here \n     feel about the park. We feel like we own it because our \n     families did. We love it because we grew up hiking here or \n     adopted it as home. And we are proud we gave this park to the \n     country for others to enjoy.\n       ``The psalmist wrote, `I will lift up mine eyes unto the \n     hills.' There are 151 cemeteries in the Great Smokies, \n     usually on a hilltop, closer to God. The headstones face east \n     because, as mountaineers will tell you, `You don't want to \n     have your back to Jesus when he comes again.'\n       ``There was a reverential feeling among the thousands who \n     came to Cades Cove on a beautiful Sunday afternoon in June to \n     hear fiddles imitate bagpipes as the Knoxville Symphony \n     played `Amazing Grace.' At the 50th anniversary, I tried to \n     explain that feeling this way: `These mountains . . . (Blount \n     County) . . . my home . . . are where I enjoy being, where I \n     swap people for nature and feel closer to God . . . when I am \n     here, it helps get the rest of my life in a little better \n     order.'\n       ``That is why I celebrate the 75th anniversary of the Great \n     Smoky Mountains National Park.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9105-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9105]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, 45 minutes ago exactly, history was made \nin America just across the street, not far from the steps of the \nSenate. If you go to those steps at this moment and look directly to \nthe east, you will see the U.S. Supreme Court building. At 2 o'clock \neastern time in that building the 111th Justice appointed to the U.S. \nSupreme Court received her official investiture. It was a moment of \ngreat historic significance because the elevation of Sonia Sotomayor to \nserve on the U.S. Supreme Court marks the first time in our history \nthat a person of Hispanic descent will serve on the highest Court of \nour land. In the course of our history, with 111 Supreme Court \nJustices, if my memory serves, only four have not been White males--two \nAfrican Americans, two women, and now Justice Sotomayor.\n  The ceremony was very short. The President of the United States was \nthere, the Vice President, a number of Members of Congress, and of \ncourse the other eight Supreme Court Justices and the retiring Justice \nSouter. There was a very stately, dignified, gracious presence as the \nCourt was convened. After Eric Holder, the Attorney General, read the \ncommission which authorizes the investiture of Justice Sotomayor, the \noath was administered to her by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, \nJohn Roberts. The entire ceremony took 4 minutes. One of the Senators \nstanding next to me, Mel Martinez, who will retire from the Senate this \nweek, said it would have taken longer if they had television cameras \nhere. Those of us who serve in the Senate and served in the House know \nof what he speaks.\n  But the fact is, in that 4-minute period of time a page was turned in \nAmerican history. We are offering an opportunity now for a person to \nserve on the Supreme Court--immensely qualified, a person with a great \nbackground in her life and her achievement to serve on the highest \nCourt of the land.\n  Across America, in neighborhoods and towns and communities and \nschools, perhaps a child will look up and, when they learn of the \nappointment and ascension of Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, \nrealize that the great promise of America continues, that this still is \na land of opportunity, and that door to opportunity was opened a little \nwider just across the street at the U.S. Supreme Court about 45 minutes \nago.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9105-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9105-S9106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RESPECTING THE PRESIDENTIAL OFFICE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, earlier today the President of the United \nStates went back to school. He went to a local high school in the DC \narea to give a speech. It turned out that this speech became \ncontroversial.\n  I thought about that over the weekend because my wife and I went down \nto Mount Vernon, in Virginia, to the home of George Washington. It was \na trip I promised my wife because the first time we went down there \nwhen I was a college student and drove down there in my little VW bug \nback in the 1960s, I got there to find out I did not have enough money \nfor admission so we had to turn around and leave. I always told her: \nLoretta, we are going to\n\n[[Page S9106]]\n\nget back down here someday. It took a few years, but we made it.\n  Touring the grounds there as well as the education and learning \ncenter, learning a little bit more about our first President, you \nrealize what an opportunity he had to define the institution of the \nPresidency. One of the first things they asked of George Washington, \nthe first President, was: What do we call you? Your Excellency? Your \nHighness? He said: Just call me Mr. President.\n  His decision at that moment created a tradition, not just a formal \ntradition of how we address the President of the United States, but, \nmore importantly, a tradition of how we view the President of the \nUnited States. He is not royalty nor is he to be treated as royalty. He \nis to be treated as another American, but one who at this moment in \ntime, by the will of the American people, serves in the highest office \nin the land. So George Washington established a standard, a standard of \nrespect but not awe, when it comes to the office of President.\n  I thought of that over the years. In my lifetime there have been \nPresidents I genuinely admired, their politics and personalities, and \nothers I was more critical of, but I always believed the office \ndeserved respect whoever occupies that office. If you believe in this \nform of government and you believe in this Nation, the election to that \noffice at the least--at the least--should gather the respect that each \nAmerican owes to the office.\n  This President announced he wanted to speak to the schoolchildren of \nAmerica today on what is roughly the first day of school across our \nNation. He was not the first President to make that suggestion. \nPresident Ronald Reagan offered a speech to the schoolchildren of \nAmerica; President George Herbert Walker Bush the same. I can't recall \nany controversy associated with the addresses by either of those \nprevious Presidents, but for reasons I cannot understand, critics came \nforward criticizing President Obama for wanting to speak to our \nschoolchildren. Even in my home State of Illinois, the President's home \nState, some school districts made a conscious decision that they would \nnot broadcast or make available the President's speech. Others allowed \nchildren to opt out if their parents didn't want them to hear the \nPresident's speech.\n  I think that is unfortunate. It is unfortunate and I am happy to say \nthere are those of both political parties who said that. Senator Lamar \nAlexander, from Tennessee, a Republican, was just on the floor--a \nformer Secretary of Education, former Presidential candidate. He spoke \nout and said of course the President should be allowed to speak to \nschoolchildren across America. Laura Bush, the former First Lady, said \nthat this morning. Others have said the same.\n  I think they understand two things: first, respect for the \ninstitution of the Presidency, and, second, the fact that the President \nspeaking may have some impact on young people across America. The \nPresident gave his speech. I hope his critics have been silenced \nbecause, as a parent and now as a grandparent, as I read his speech I \nwould like every kid in America to hear it. He explained his own \nbackground and the tough times he went through growing up, the \nsacrifices made by his single mom, the fact that his father left at an \nearly age, the fact that education became an important part of their \nlives even as they traveled around the world.\n  Barack, now President Obama, used to tell the story here in the \nSenate of his mother waking him up early in the morning when he lived \noverseas and saying: Let's get ready for school. When he would whine \nand cry about 5:30 in the morning and he is doing homework, his mom \nwould say: It's no picnic for me either, buddy. She was a parent who \ncared, a mother who cared, and he a son who profited and benefited from \nher caring.\n  When I read his speech and elements of it today, I am glad the \nPresident spoke these words to the students of Virginia, and those \nschool districts that decided their children should not hear this ought \nto stop and reflect on whether that was the right decision. When the \nPresident says:\n\n       But at the end of the day, the circumstances of your life--\n     what you look like, where you come from, how much money you \n     have, what you've got going on at home--that's no excuse for \n     neglecting your homework or having a bad attitude. That's no \n     excuse for talking back to your teacher, or cutting class, or \n     dropping out of school. That's no excuse for not trying. \n     Where you are right now doesn't have to determine where \n     you'll end up.\n\n  The President said:\n\n       No one's written your destiny for you. Here in America, you \n     write your own destiny. You make your own future.\n\n  He talked to these students not only about doing their homework and \nreading, getting involved in extracurricular activities, volunteering \nin their community, deciding to\n\n     . . . stand up for kids who are being teased or bullied \n     because of who they are or how they look, because you \n     believe, like I do, that all kids deserve a safe environment \n     to study and learn.\n\n  The President went on to say:\n\n       No one is born being good at things. You become good at \n     things through hard work.\n\n  And then he said:\n\n       And even when you're struggling, even when you're \n     discouraged, and you feel like other people have given up on \n     you--don't ever give up on yourself. Because when you give up \n     on yourself, you give up on your country.\n       The story of America isn't about people who quit when \n     things got tough. It's about people who kept going, who tried \n     harder, who loved their country too much to do anything less \n     than their best.\n\n  That speech by President Obama to the schoolchildren of America was a \npositive thing. It was a good thing. Some said it was a way to promote \nhis socialist agenda, it was political propaganda. I find nothing \npolitical about these comments. This is good advice to any child, any \nstudent across this country, and I am glad the President took this \nopportunity to use whatever influence he has over these young people to \nguide them in the right path as they start out in their school year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9106-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9106-S9108]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the last issue I wish to address for a \nmoment is the August recess. August is a blazing hot month in the \nMidwest, with high temperatures and high humidity--though they were \ntempered a little this year, a little cooler than usual, a little \nwetter than is usual, but we had our hot days. But the hottest days \nwere reserved for the political scene because in town meetings across \nthe Midwest and across the Nation many times tempers flared, people \nwere upset, there was shoving and shouting going on at these town \nmeetings. If you have been on the political scene you know there are \nmoments when the emotions of the American people are raised to a high \nfever pitch. Fortunately for us, the reason for this interest was \ngenuine. We are talking about an issue, the changing of the health care \nsystem in America, which literally affects every person in our country. \nIt is rare that we would tackle an issue that is that all embracing, \nthat touches everybody. It is understandable that people have \nlegitimate questions about what it means to their lives.\n  I found the same thing in Illinois. I traveled around the State. I \nmet with doctors and nurses and hospital administrators, small business \npeople, average folks, patients struggling with illness and disease, \nthose who had been turned down by health insurance companies, even \npeople coming up to me in restaurants and folks at the airport talking \nto me about their life's experience when it came to health care. It is \nan issue we all share in common and an issue we all care about.\n  But, sadly, there was an organized effort to disrupt many of these \ntown meetings. These were not people who wanted to express their \nopposition to any pending legislation so much as to end the meeting, to \ntry to raise their voices above all others and to stop the dialog that \nis so important as part of this. I don't think that point of view \nprevailed at the end of the day.\n  There are still legitimate, tough questions on health care reform, \nquestions that will have to be answered directly and honestly as we \nproceed in this debate. But there is no question in my mind that the \nmajority of the American people understand that we need to make some \nchanges in our health care system.\n  There are some things that are very troubling. The cost of health \ninsurance is going up three times faster than the wages of working \nAmericans. We know what this means. It will reach a point\n\n[[Page S9107]]\n\nwhere more and more of your take-home pay will pay for health insurance \nwhich sadly will not provide as much coverage next year as it did this \nyear. We also know that sometimes the people who have health insurance \nfind out it is not there when they need it.\n  I ran into that. I had a gentleman in Quincy, IL, at one of my \nmeetings the other day. He and his wife both lost their jobs. For 19 \nyears he had been at the local bank, with health insurance, and he lost \nhis job. Because he and his wife had a special needs child, they paid \nthe COBRA premium. If you understand how this works, once you have lost \na job you can keep your health insurance if you will pay the employer \nand employee portions. Even though we have made that more reasonable in \ncost, it is still very expensive, but because of the special needs \nchild he decided he and his wife had to dip into their savings to keep \nthe health insurance coverage for their kids and the family, even while \nthey are unemployed.\n  Sadly, during this period of time of unemployment his son fell down \nthe stairs and needed brain surgery. They shipped him across the river \ninto Iowa where he was successfully operated on. That is the good news \nhere. The father kept looking for a job, only to learn that the \ninsurance company was going to deny their claim for this brain surgery. \nIt would have been extremely expensive if the insurance company failed \nto pay. But now this man, unemployed, looking for a job, with a son who \ndoes have those special needs and a wife who is trying to find \nsubstitute teaching jobs to help out, has to spend a good part of his \nday fighting with the insurance company over whether his son is going \nto be covered for that emergency surgery.\n  It is not rare. In fact, it is too common that the average person, \nwhen they need the coverage of health insurance, finds out that they \nare in a battle, not with their doctor, a battle with someone who works \nfor a health insurance company who says no.\n  That has to change. One of the things I hope both sides agree on, \nRepublican and Democratic, is that people should not be denied health \ninsurance coverage because of a preexisting condition. You should not \nbe denied health insurance coverage when it turns out you are sick and \nyou need it. You should also be able to take your health insurance from \none job to another. You should not have a cap on the total amount of \ncoverage in your lifetime. Your children should not be high and dry at \n23 when they have to pay for their own health insurance or they are \ncompletely unprotected. These are things most people agree should be \npart of health insurance reform and I hope we can make it part of a \ncommon bipartisan effort when we talk about this issue.\n  There is another issue and it is one that I will address as I talk \nabout this issue later in the week, and I think it is a fundamental \nissue of social justice, that 47 million Americans today have no health \ninsurance. We have about 300 million people in our country. About 100 \nmillion of them are under some sort of government health plan-- \nMedicaid for the poor and disabled; Medicare for those in advanced \nyears, which I am soon approaching; people covered by veterans' health \ncare, and those who are covered in other forms, by children's health \ninsurance programs.\n\n  So take the 100 million under government health programs aside, and \nin the remaining 200 million people in America, about 1 out of 4 has no \nhealth insurance. They are not the poorest people in America because \nthe poorest people in America have Medicaid. They are not the fortunate \nlike those of us who already have health insurance. They are people who \nget up and go to work every single day and have no health insurance.\n  I met plenty of them as I traveled around the State of Illinois. I do \nnot understand--I do understand, but I certainly sympathize with the \nsituation where you wake up in the morning and look at those children \nin that bed as a father and realize they are one accident or one \ndiagnosis away from a medical catastrophe that could threaten their \nlives and wipe out your savings. That is what people without health \ninsurance face every single day.\n  So in addition to the cost, in addition to whether the health \ninsurance is there when you need it, is the fundamental question about \nwhether if everybody in America should be drawn in under the protection \nof health insurance. I believe they should. The people without health \ninsurance, when they reach a critical time in their lives and are \ndesperate, show up at a hospital, and our hospitals treat them and pass \nalong the expense of treating them to everyone else.\n  It would be far better in America for us to provide coverage and \nprotection for everyone and to help those in the lowest income \ncategories pay for that protection. I think that is fundamentally just. \nIt is American. It is good, sound policy so that this have and have-not \nsituation would not apply to circumstances of life and death, which is \nthe way it does today.\n  Finally, we have to find a way to change this health care system when \nit comes to incentives. Currently, we have something called fee for \nservice, which means if a doctor or hospital comes up with a new \nprocedure or a new service, they are paid more. It creates an extra \nincentive to do more than may be necessary. We have to change that. And \nI think we can. We have to try to stress preventive care and wellness. \nWe do not do enough of that, instead of just in rescue care and \nsickness, which is the hallmark of our current system.\n  Preventive care and wellness means having access to clinics and \nprimary care providers across the United States. And I want to salute \nthe Association of Family Physicians. They have joined me in every town \nin my State. They fully support this. They understand that health care \nreform is essential if families are going to have a fighting chance for \ngood health care.\n  Well, those are the basics in the debate. There are all sorts of \nseparate questions about a public option and individual mandates and \nmany other issues with which we are going to have to wrestle. Senator \nAlexander of Tennessee, whom I mentioned earlier in my comments, said a \nmoment or two ago: Well, it is time for us to start over when it comes \nto the health care debate and engage both sides of the aisle in the \ndebate.\n  I would say to Senator Alexander: We have spent a lot of time \nlearning a lot of things about the health care challenges in America \nand how to reach them, the way to deal with them. We have kept the door \nopen for those on the other side of the aisle who are willing to come \nforward and discuss it. Some have said, no; they are not interested for \na variety of reasons. Today, to date, only three have stepped into the \nbipartisan conversation, three Republican Senators. I hope more will. \nIt would be healthy and positive.\n  The worst thing we can do is to walk away from this issue, to say \nthat because some town meetings were disrupted or some people have \nstrong emotional feelings about this issue we need to walk away from \nit, because the current health care system in America is unsustainable. \nIt is too expensive. We spend twice as much per person for health care \nin America as any nation on Earth. Although there are positive things \nto point to in terms of our health care in our country, some countries \nspending far less, and get much better results in many areas. We can do \nbetter.\n  Secondly, who would oppose health insurance reform? I would hope \neveryone understands that at the end of the day what needs to be done \nshould be done on a bipartisan basis. I hope there are those who feel \nwe should create opportunities for those who are uninsured to have \nbasic health insurance protection.\n  Those who criticize the cost of health care reform overlook the \nobvious: If we do not help low-income families and individuals in \nAmerica pay for health insurance, they will not have it. If they do not \nhave that coverage, we will be right where we are today, with one-\nfourth of those not covered by government plans having no health \ninsurance protection whatsoever.\n  We need to change the system to focus on prevention and wellness. \nThat means encouraging more primary care physicians and health care \nprofessionals to reach out to families in communities across Illinois \nand across the Nation. If we do not do something about this, I am not \nsure we can sustain the system much longer.\n  Just a few years ago, one out of three people filing for bankruptcy \nin America did so because of medical costs--\n\n[[Page S9108]]\n\none out of three. Today it is two out of three. Two out of every three \npersonal bankruptcies are over medical costs. Listen to this: 78 \npercent of the people filing for bankruptcy because of medical costs, \n78 percent of them have health insurance. It is not very good. It does \nnot protect them when they need it. It leaves them high and dry when \nmajor medical bills come through.\n  So those who are watching this debate saying: I am sorry people do \nnot have health insurance, I am sorry some people are complaining, but \nI am OK, I am covered, they should pause and reflect for a moment that \nmany of the people in bankruptcy court today facing bankruptcy and the \nloss of virtually all of their assets are people who also had health \ninsurance and were also in the belief and security----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado.) The Senator's time has \nexpired.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me conclude by saying that we have a chance in the \ncoming weeks, after the President's speech tomorrow night, to come \ntogether on a bipartisan basis. I hope Republicans and Democrats who \nlisten carefully at home understand that despite the anger and the \ntemper and the emotions that we cannot leave the current system as it \nis. If we do not make a positive change, it is unsustainable.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Carolina.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9108-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9108-S9109]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TRAVEL PROMOTION ACT\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, if you were like me, you probably held a \nnumber of townhalls. I know a number of our colleagues over the \nholidays did. I saw a number of them on television and saw the many \nthousands of Americans who came to townhalls, as they did to mine, who \nwere very concerned about the direction of our country.\n  Frankly, in South Carolina, I had several thousand people come to \ndifferent townhall meetings, all with a very similar point of view. \nThey thought this government had gotten too big, was spending too much \nmoney, or taxing too much and taking over too much of our economy.\n  A lot of people were very concerned, not just about health care. I \ncannot agree with the Senator. There are many things we need to do, but \nthe last thing we should do is have this government take it over. There \nare many things we can do to make sure people get more insured. But the \npeople who came to my townhalls and across the country in many other \ntownhalls were not just concerned about one issue. They looked back \nover the last year, over a Republican and Democratic President, to see \ntwo failed stimulus bills, two bailouts--which many believe were \nunconstitutional--the proposed takeover of the energy and health care \nindustries, and the actual takeover of banks and insurance companies \nand carmakers.\n  People are fed up. The Federal Government is simply too big. The \ndebts we are looking at now for ourselves and our children and our \ngrandchildren are truly unsustainable. People do not know where the \nmoney is coming from. They wonder what we are thinking about.\n  The amazing thing is, after what we saw over the break, the genuine \noutrage and concern by the American people, the very first item of \nbusiness we are going to vote on in this Senate today after the August \nbreak is to vote to start another government program, to spend $400 \nmillion, to increase taxes, to get the Federal Government involved in \nanother private sector business.\n  What did we learn over our summer vacation? If we vote to pass this \nbill, we obviously learned very little. What I am talking about is the \nTravel Promotion Act. Many of you here in the gallery and around the \ncountry think I am probably making this up; that after what we saw \nacross America we would actually have the nerve to bring up a bill that \nforms a new government-sponsored enterprise, a la Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac, and it is going to be a government-sponsored enterprise \nthat promotes travel and tourism in America. I guess we can call it \nFannie Travel.\n  Well, now, let me tell you a little bit about the idea because the \nidea is that travel and tourism in America is a very important \nindustry, which it is. It is the No. 1 industry in South Carolina. It \nis actually one of the most prosperous. That is the main reason we do \nnot want the Federal Government to get involved.\n  But the idea is, that we are going to charge a $10 fee for everyone \nwho comes to visit America in order to pay for this advertising program \nthat will promote America to people all over the world. All these fees \nwould be pooled, and they would be matched by some of the major tourism \nindustries such as Disney, and we would have a government-sponsored \nenterprise that is promoting tourism.\n  But they are saying it will not cost Americans anything because this \nis a tax on foreigners coming to this country. But I have a letter in \nmy office from the European Union and other allies of this country that \nsays this is violating the agreements we have with them, and if we do \nthis they are going to add a similar fee to Americans visiting their \ncountry. We are going to start a war with some of our friends. It will \nultimately end up costing Americans money. It will create another \ngovernment entity.\n  Folks, it is not a crisis. This is not one of those emergencies that \nwe have to do ``this week.'' Why, when we have all of this debt, would \nwe create another program with another tax that this Federal Government \nis going to run? Maybe it is Fannie Travel, maybe it is Cash for \nTourism, but, folks, the problem with tourism in America is not that \npeople do not know we are here. The problem is we have one of the most \nnotoriously unfriendly customs and immigration services in the world. \nWe also are one of the most difficult countries to get a visa for.\n  I have a major international employer back in my home State who \nregularly needs to bring people from other parts of the world to train \nAmerican workers. But they cannot get visas, so they send American \nworkers to other countries to get the training they need because it is \nso much trouble to get the visas to get them here.\n  Major industries have trade shows outside of this country because \nthey cannot get the visas for customers coming in looking at our \nproducts. The problem is not that people do not know we are here, it is \nthat the government involvement that is already involved with tourism \nand travel in our country is not doing a good job.\n  When you have problems with the quality of your product, the last \nthing you do is raise your prices and increase advertising, which is \nwhat we are talking about doing with this bill. The first thing we need \nto do is make sure we have the most friendly and efficient customs \nsystem in the world and that people who want to come to our country can \nget a visa and a very quick background check so that we know the people \nwho are coming here are safe.\n  But we are not going to solve those problems with hundreds of \nmillions of dollars of advertising from a new government agency that is \nrun by major corporate sponsors in our country. Tourism is too \nimportant to turn over to the government.\n  A lot of people around the country are concerned, as they look at \nwhat we are spending and the level of debt we are creating, that we are \nignoring the constitutional principles we swore an oath to, and they \nare going to ask us when we vote on this bill: Where in the \nConstitution of the United States do we find the authority to run \ntravel promotion?\n  Major tourism companies such as Disney are not having trouble. In \nfact, I think Disney reported a $4 billion profit from last year, and \nthey bought Marvel Comics for $4 billion. Certainly, our economy has \nput a strain on tourism, but the Federal Government is the last entity \nthat needs to try to bail them out. We don't have any money. We are \ngoing to have to borrow money or tax someone to create this new \ngovernment program.\n  This is a debate that gets back to what does the Constitution allow \nus to do? One can't read the Constitution without seeing some very \nsevere limits on what is expected of the Federal Government. Certainly, \nthe bailout and cash for clunkers and this new travel and tourism \nagency they are starting has nothing to do with our constitutional \nfunctions.\n  We have over $11 trillion in debt already. We are projecting to \nalmost double that over the next 10 years with\n\n[[Page S9109]]\n\nwhat we already have on the books. With Social Security and Medicare \nalone, the unfunded liability out many years is like $100 trillion. We \nhave no idea where we are going to get all this money. How can we even \ndiscuss starting a new government entity when the ones we have started \nare at the heart of our economic problems. One can't understand our \neconomy without seeing that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac played a key \nrole in bringing the worldwide economy to its knees. We don't have to \nlook back but 1 month to see what the last government program we \ncreated in cash for clunkers did. It was going to be a $1 billion, 6-\nmonth promotion to sell a lot of cars. We were out of money in 1 week, \nand we voted to pass another $2 billion. A couple weeks later, they \ncanceled the program. We can't run the travel and promotion industry \nfrom Washington, DC.\n  I have to draw a very difficult conclusion. Any of my fellow Senators \nwho vote for this either don't understand the severity of our economic \nand fiscal problems or they don't care. They certainly didn't hear the \nmillions of Americans speaking over the August break and telling us \nthey want us to get back to the business of a constitutional form of \ngovernment and stop trying to win votes by bringing home the bacon--\nwasteful spending, earmarks, and new government programs, all the \nfalse, empty promises based on government solutions.\n  I encourage colleagues, let us get the rest of the year started off \nin a reasonable way. Let's talk about how to fix health care. Let's \ntalk about how to create jobs. For heaven's sake, let's not create a \nnew government program as the first vote we take in the Senate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9109-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9109-S9111]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, today Congress returns from the August \nrecess. Perhaps one of the most important issues of recent times \naffecting one-sixth of America's gross domestic product and rising to \nas much as one-fifth, the issue of health care and health care reform, \nwill be front and center, including a highly unusual appearance \ntomorrow night before a joint session of Congress by the President. The \nlast time such a joint session of Congress was called for, aside from \nthe regular one, was by former President Bush concerning the events \nsurrounding the attacks on the United States of 9/11.\n  During the recess, I had, similar to all my colleagues, a very busy \nschedule of meetings addressing various issues, including travel to \nIraq and Afghanistan. That visit will be the subject of other \nstatements on the floor. But in Arizona, I hosted townhall meetings \nwith my constituents. I also attended meetings and forums with health \ncare providers in Missouri, North Carolina, and Florida so I could, \nalong with my colleagues, better understand America's thoughts and \nideas on reforming our Nation's health care system. I have no doubt \nthere is a peaceful revolution going on out in America. I have not \nseen, in the years I have been a Member of Congress, such anger and \ndissatisfaction with the way the Congress and we in Washington are \ndoing business. We all know the President's approval numbers continue \nto fall.\n  The unruly and sometimes disruptive behavior at townhall meetings has \nbeen an exhibit of the anger and dissatisfaction Americans feel. I \nwould like to make it clear that I think the townhall meetings should \nbe conducted with respect. They should be conducted in a way that is an \nAmerican tradition, that all Americans can be heard from as well as \ntheir elected representatives. But there is no doubt people attended \ntownhall meetings that never before in their lives have been engaged in \nany debate in America. There is something going on out there. I \ncertainly got the message. I hope the majority of my colleagues did as \nwell.\n  It is more clear to me that we have to reform the way health care is \nprovided, but we have to do it in the right way, without a government \ntakeover of the health care system. The problem with health care is not \nthe quality of health care. The problem with health care in America is \nthe cost of health care and almost double-digit inflation that takes \nplace annually which deprives more and more Americans of their ability \nto acquire and keep health insurance.\n  Among other places I visited recently, one of them was a place called \nM.D. Anderson, a cancer treatment facility in Houston, TX. There were \npatients there from 90 countries around the world. Why? Because it is \nthe highest quality health care.\n  The fundamental difference we have here between those of us who want \nto reform health care to reduce the cost and maintain the quality is \nthe argument from the President and the other side of the aisle that \nthey want a government option. They refuse to address the issue of \nmedical malpractice reform. They refuse to allow someone to go across \nState lines and acquire the health insurance of their choice, and they \ncontinue to allow practices to go on that breed fraud, abuse, and waste \nin Medicare, which are well documented to the tune of hundreds of \nbillions of dollars a year.\n  We must reform health care. We can't do it with a government solution \nthat is advocated by the other side. That is why we have been unable to \nreach agreement--because we have two fundamental philosophical \ndifferences between ourselves and those who want to have a government \noption, who want to have greater and greater intervention in the health \ncare system.\n  On the way over I read this:\n\n       Washington (AP)--A top senator is calling for fines of up \n     to $3,800 on families who fail to get medical insurance after \n     a health care overhaul goes into effect.\n\n  Do we want to do that to the American people, a $3,800 fine? That is \nwhy we also need to step back and examine the 600-page bill passed \nthrough the HELP Committee, without a financing provision, the 1,000 \npages or so bill passed through the House before they left, and figure \nout what else we have added in this bill.\n  Why are Americans angry and upset? They are angry and upset because \nof this, because we spent $787 billion on the stimulus, which is $1.1 \ntrillion with interest; $700 billion on TARP; $410 billion with 9,000 \nearmarks in it on the Omnibus appropriations bill; $3.5 trillion on the \nbudget resolution; $83 billion to bail out the auto companies; $33 \nbillion to expand the Children's Health Insurance Program; and a $1 to \n$2 trillion cost associated with the HELP Committee's plan that went \nthrough the HELP Committee, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which would not bend the curve, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office.\n  What have we gotten for all this? We have gone to 9.7 percent \nunemployment. We have gone to 9.7 percent unemployment in this country, \nafter the President and all his economic advisers said that if we pass \nthis stimulus bill, unemployment will be a maximum of 8 percent. As \nthey say: You can look it up. It is now at 9.7 percent. The public debt \nis $11.7 trillion. Sometime in October, we are going to have to \nincrease the Federal debt limit which is going to go beyond $12.1 \ntrillion.\n  We are all responsible for what we say. In 2006, the current \nPresident spoke in opposition to raising the debt limit to $9 trillion \nsaying:\n\n       Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today on \n     to the backs of our children and grandchildren. America has a \n     debt problem and a failure of leadership.\n\n  That was from the then-Senator from Illinois, now President of the \nUnited States. Where did we go? Where did we go from 11 to 12 and now, \nof course, a few weeks ago, a small rounding error, the 10-year deficit \nwas raised $7 to $9 trillion, just a $2 trillion rounding error. That \nis what the American people are worried about, the commission of \ngenerational theft on our children and grandchildren. No one in the \nadministration has a plan for bringing the budget back into balance. I \nthink the American people at least deserve it.\n  Yesterday the President spoke in front of union allies in a partisan, \ncampaign-style speech, where he questioned the motives of those who \nraise concerns about too much government control over our health care \neconomy and instead wrongly criticized our side for having no ideas of \nour own. We have plenty of ideas. None of them have been considered in \nthe HELP Committee or by the Senate or by the House of Representatives. \nThe HELP Committee bill was written only by the Democrats. There was no \ninput from\n\n[[Page S9110]]\n\nthis side of the aisle. Every meaningful amendment proposed was \nrejected, including malpractice reform. How can we possibly look the \nAmerican people in the face and say: We are going to bring down the \ncost of health care without medical malpractice reform.\n  Ask any physician and they will tell you physicians are required to \npractice defensive medicine because of the fear of being sued. \nUnnecessary tests and procedures are performed time after time after \ntime. I was in Miami at the Palmetto Hospital, a fine institution. I \nasked one of the surgeons: How can you afford your health insurance \npremiums? He said: We don't keep insurance anymore. We can't afford it. \nWe will probably not get sued because they know we only have so much in \nassets.\n  Now we are putting physicians and care providers in a position where \nthey basically cannot afford, nor can they get, malpractice insurance \nbecause the premiums are so high, and they are targets for the trial \nlawyers.\n  We have a number of alternatives. Most of them are market based. Most \nof them have to do with preserving the quality of health care yet \nbringing down the cost, which should be our goal. Why don't we have \ninsurance reforms to improve access? That means someone can go across \nState lines. If a citizen of Arizona wants to go to North Dakota and \nget health insurance there, why can't they? Why can't that family do \nthat? Why can't they? They cannot today.\n\n  Why is it we cannot reform medical malpractice? Let's have tax \nreforms. Let's have incentives to purchase insurance either in the form \nof tax credits for families in America or--or--why don't we give the \nsame tax treatment to families that businesses get in the provision of \nhealth insurance? Why don't we have real competition in any State? Why \ndon't we set up the risk pools that are necessary to ensure those who \nwere previously uninsurable or for those with ``preexisting \nconditions''? Let's set up those risk pools. Yes, that will take some \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  Why don't we allow the insurance companies to compete so they can \nprovide insurance, so we can provide affordable and available health \ncare to all Americans? Why don't we look at cost reductions? Why don't \nwe look at incentives for wellness and fitness? One of the most famous \ncorporations in America recently is Safeway. We have heard from their \nCEO. They reward people financially for wellness and fitness. And--\nguess what--their costs for health care have gone down because there \nare incentives to do so.\n  Here is a small idea: Why don't we see what the school lunch program \nis in our local schools? Why don't we see what the physical education \nrequirements are in our local school districts? Why don't parents do \nthat? I was appalled, and I am sure my colleagues and all Americans \nwere, to see recently there is one State in America where one-third of \nthe population suffers from obesity. We know what obesity does to \nhealth care costs, not to mention the lives of individuals.\n  Why don't we also look at what has been tried and done before: an \noutcome treatment of patients. A patient has diabetes. You pay that \nprovider for 6 months or a year or 2 years and say: OK, here is the \namount of money, and if you keep that patient well, you will receive a \nreward at the end of that treatment period, rather than to pay for \nevery single test and procedure.\n  My friends, there are cases of abuse of Medicare that stretch into \nthe hundreds of billions of dollars. We have to go after these people \nwho abuse health care, Medicare, and Medicaid.\n  And a practical question: Suppose we adopted what passed through the \nHELP Committee and through the House. There are dramatic increases in \nState Medicaid payments. What States can afford the additional burden \nof Medicaid that is envisioned by this legislation? Not many. Not many, \nmy friends.\n  So we do have legitimate, workable, doable, viable alternatives to \nthe government option. When the President of the United States stands \nup and says we do not, he either is not paying attention to what we are \nsaying--which has been one of the big problems with this debate--or he \nwillfully ignores the fact there are solutions we can move forward with \nto reduce health care costs in America and preserve the quality.\n  I wish to make a comment about the so-called co-op approach. My \nfriends, you can call it the government option. You can call it a co-\nop. You can call it a banana. But the fact is, it is government \nintervention into the free marketplace, which will lead to crowding \nout, which over time will lead to government control of health care in \nAmerica.\n  A co-op can exist today. They do not have to wait for legislation. \nThey can exist today. Yet very few do. If there was a pressing need for \nmore co-ops, wouldn't more of them have been created? Under the co-op \napproach, the Federal Government would design, fund, and foster their \ncreation. But let's not kid ourselves. Creating a new, massive \ngovernment plan designed in Washington is still Washington involvement \nin health care. And if we did not learn any lessons from the Fannie Mae \nand Freddie Mac co-ops, nobody has been paying attention.\n  Let me talk about the ``trigger'' for a second. The trigger in the \nbill would implement the public option only if private insurance \ncompanies failed to meet certain benchmarks, such as lowering overall \nhealth spending or shrinking the number of the uninsured.\n  The Wall Street Journal stated yesterday:\n\n       Liberals should love the idea because a trigger isn't a \n     substantive concession; it merely ensures that the public \n     option will arrive eventually, instead of immediately. \n     Democrats will tweak the tests so that private insurers can't \n     possibly meet them, mainly by imposing new regulations and \n     other costly burdens.\n\n  Additionally, this trigger appears to blatantly and patently violate \nthe Constitution's delegation of lawmaking powers to Congress and not \nthe executive branch. We must decide whether to implement a \n``government option'' or not. I vote to not do so and oppose any \nsuggestion that abdicates my duties as a lawmaker and allows the \nexecutive branch to create a ``government option'' based on a trigger.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Wall Street Journal \ncolumn entitled ``Whoa, Trigger''--a good name--be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 8, 2009]\n\n                             Whoa, Trigger\n\n       President Obama has decided that another oration will \n     rejuvenate his health-care agenda--despite having given 27 \n     speeches entirely on health care, and another 92 in which it \n     figured prominently. We'll see how tomorrow night's \n     Congressional appeal works out, but the important maneuvers \n     are taking place in the cloak rooms, as the White House tries \n     to staple together a majority.\n       The latest political gimmick is the notion of a ``trigger'' \n     for the public option: A new government program for the \n     middle class would only come on line if private insurance \n     companies fail to meet certain benchmarks, such as lowering \n     overall health spending or shrinking the number of the \n     uninsured. This is supposed to appeal to Maine Republican \n     Olympia Snowe, who could end up as ObamaCare's 60th Senator, \n     while still appeasing the single-payer left.\n       Liberals should love the idea because a trigger isn't a \n     substantive concession; it merely ensures that the public \n     option will arrive eventually, instead of immediately. \n     Democrats will goose the tests so that private insurers can't \n     possibly meet them, mainly by imposing new regulations and \n     other costly burdens.\n       Keep in mind that every version of ObamaCare now under \n     consideration essentially turns all private insurers into \n     subsidiaries of Congress. All coverage will be strictly \n     regulated down to the fine print, and politics will dictate \n     the level of benefits as well as premiums, deductibles and \n     copays. Under the House bill, a ``health choices \n     commissioner'' will have the final say, no doubt with \n     Democrats Henry Waxman and Pete Stark at his elbow, if not \n     another part of his anatomy.\n       The same bill also rewrites the 1974 federal law known as \n     Erisa that lets large and mid-sized employers offer insurance \n     with little regulation. Many businesses--including Safeway, \n     General Mills and Marriott--are finding innovative ways to \n     drive down spending, largely with worker incentives to live \n     healthier and be more sensitive to the costs of care. Many \n     Democrats call this discriminatory.\n       In the individual insurance market, Democrats intend to \n     outlaw medical underwriting: Everyone must be charged the \n     same rate or close to it for the same policies, regardless of \n     health status or history. But this ``community rating'' tends \n     to price younger and low-risk consumers out of the market. In \n     a 2006 NBER paper, Bradley Herring of John Hopkins and Mark \n     Pauly of the University of Pennsylvania found that community \n     rating results in an overall increase in the uninsured in the \n     individual market, maybe as\n\n[[Page S9111]]\n\n     high as 7.4%. For that reason, 35 states have no community \n     rating at all, and another six allow very wide variations.\n       The larger reality is that private insurance won't be less \n     expensive until overall health-care costs go down. Democrats \n     may be confused on this point because government, which paid \n     nearly 47 cents of every medical dollar in 2007, simply sets \n     lower prices when Congress feels like it. On average, doctors \n     and hospitals are forced to accept 20% to 30% less for their \n     services in Medicare. That's another reason insurers wouldn't \n     meet a trigger's thresholds, given that providers shift costs \n     onto private under-65 patients to make up government \n     shortfalls.\n       Conceivably insurers could make their products more \n     affordable by cracking down on treatments and refusing \n     payment more often, much as HMOs held down spending in the \n     1990s. But both patients and doctors hated this ``managed \n     care''--and in any case, Democrats would find a new rationale \n     for the public option in the inevitable voter outcry about \n     private ``rationing.''\n       It's true that there was a trigger in the Medicare \n     prescription drug benefit and the world didn't end. But \n     recall the dynamics in 2003: The GOP decided that private \n     stand-alone or Medicare Advantage plans should manage the \n     benefit. As a concession to Democrats, they agreed to trigger \n     a ``public option'' for drugs--in which the government would \n     have bought them directly, with its typical ``negotiating'' \n     tactics--if seniors didn't have more than two plans in a \n     given region.\n       Today, there are 1,689 stand-alone and 2,099 Advantage \n     plans, and on average seniors have 50 to choose from--and \n     costs in 2007 were $26 billion lower than expected. For all \n     its problems, the Medicare drug plan created more choice for \n     seniors and more competition among providers to offer \n     packages that they found most attractive, holding down costs. \n     In short, it created the incentives for multiple ``private \n     options.''\n       ObamaCare doesn't bother with incentives, instead merely \n     increasing government command and control of private \n     insurance while making it more expensive in the process. \n     That's why a trigger will inevitably lead to the public \n     option, and also why ObamaCare will make all of our current \n     health problems worse.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. So, Mr. President, let me summarize. I come back from \nthis recess--and I see my colleague also from Arizona in the Chamber--\nboth of us come back, as a lot of my colleagues do, in the face of \nextreme unease, anger, and frustration on the part of the American \npeople, not just over the issue of health care but over the issue, as I \npointed out, of this massive spending and debt and deficit we have laid \non future generations of Americans.\n  They want us to act in their interests. So wouldn't it be appropriate \nfor the President, tomorrow night, if I may be so bold, to say: My \nfriends and colleagues, the citizens have spoken. They want us to sit \ndown together, and they want us to do what is doable. They want us to \nfix this cost escalation of health care in America, which is making it \nless and less affordable to all Americans. But the message we have \ngotten is, they are very skeptical about ``government-run health care'' \nor a ``government option.''\n  When the President says: If you like your health insurance policy, \nyou can keep it, that is not true either. It is not true either. \nBecause if you had a government option, and it looked more attractive \nto your employer, and your employer decided to select the government \noption rather than the health insurance policy you now have, then you \ncannot keep it. So it is simply not true that under the government \noption, if you like your health insurance policy, you can keep it.\n  But the real point is, why don't we sit down--which we did not do; we \ndid not do that at the beginning of this process--why don't we sit down \nwith the smartest people on both sides of the aisle and say: OK, what \ncan we get gone? What can we get done here together and go to the \nAmerican people and say we are going to make significant progress in \neliminating this problem of out-of-control costs in health care in \nAmerica.\n  I recall when I first came to the Congress of the United States--and \nit was pretty partisan then--Ronald Reagan had only been elected a \ncouple years before that time, and Social Security was about to go \nbroke. Social Security was going broke, and two old Irishmen--Tip \nO'Neill, a liberal Democrat from Massachusetts, and the conservative \nfrom California--sat down together and said: OK, we are going to sit \ntogether. We are going to fix Social Security. And they did. There \nAmerican people were not only proud and grateful but they benefited.\n  Let's go back to square one. Let's sit down together and get this \nissue resolved.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to speak to the same issue my \ncolleague Senator McCain spoke to in a couple minutes. But first I wish \nto make some brief comments about two of our colleagues who will no \nlonger be with us--of course, our friend and colleague, Senator \nKennedy, and Senator Martinez.\n  Let me, first of all, speak to Senator Kennedy's departure from this \nbody due to his untimely death.\n  During his five decades of public service, Senator Kennedy served \nwith diligence, tireless passion, and, of course, vigor--the word that \nimmediately evokes the Kennedy spirit.\n  Because of who he was, he could have gotten by without a lot of hard \nwork. But that was not his way. He believed deeply, so he worked hard--\nas hard as any Senator I have known.\n  One thing that has been commented on by many who worked with Senator \nKennedy was his willingness to compromise. I have characterized Senator \nKennedy as a legislator's legislator, often a results-oriented \npragmatist, who knew that clashes between the two parties are \ninevitable and, in fact, an integral part of our political system, and \nthat it was important to reach across the aisle if you wanted to get \nthings done. He believed that people with dramatically different points \nof view could usually find some common ground.\n  While Senator Kennedy and I did not share a perspective on very many \nissues, and he was always ready to make an ideological or political \npoint, my colleagues and I appreciated his efforts to actually \nlegislate as well. His dedication, his hard work, humor, and high \nspirit will always be remembered. My wife Caryll and I extend our \nthoughts and prayers to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9111-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9111-S9112]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO SENATOR MEL MARTINEZ\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I also want to say a couple words about our \ncolleague Mel Martinez from Florida who will be leaving the Senate on \nthis coming Thursday. He has been an admirable public servant, both in \nthis body and as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. To each \nposition he brought his considerable talent and devoted himself to \nsolving problems in a practical, thoughtful, and bipartisan way.\n  Senator Martinez never sought the limelight; he simply wanted to make \na difference. He was disappointed, I know, that he was unable to move \nimmigration reform forward. But we will try to apply what he has taught \nus about that issue. His positive influence here in Washington will be \ngreatly missed.\n  A farewell to Senator Martinez would not be complete without a note \nabout his compelling life story and about his wife Kitty. As a Cuban \nemigre who came to America with few ties, Senator Martinez represents \none of the most inspiring aspects of American life: that talent and \nhard work unlock the door to great success. He has not forgotten those \nwho helped him, just as all of us will not forget him. His wife Kitty \nhas, likewise, made many friends in Washington and will also be missed.\n  Although I know he will not need it, I wish him all the best in his \nfuture endeavors, and I know he will remain an\n\n[[Page S9112]]\n\nimportant voice in our party and on issues important to all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9112-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9112-S9115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, my colleague, Senator McCain, has spoken to \nthe issue that is on the minds of all Americans today and which the \nSenate and House of Representatives will again take up as we return \nfrom the August recess; that is, how to deal with the issues that \nconfront us in the delivery of health care today without doing damage \nto the care and the coverage that most Americans have and believe \nserves them well.\n  The approach I heard from my constituents over the recess was very \nsimilar to what Senator McCain has spoken about, which should not seem \nto be a big coincidence since we represent the same State. On one \noccasion we called about 50,000 Arizonans, had them on the telephone \nfor about an hour and a half, and asked for their views, and gave our \nthoughts in response to their questions.\n  What I have been struck by is the consistency of the views that have \nbeen expressed in the various forums I had around the State, consistent \nwith the townhall meetings Senator McCain had right in the heart of the \nPhoenix metropolitan area, views people expressed to me in every \nlocation, from the doctor's office I went to, to people meeting with me \nin my office, to folks at church. The message seems to be pretty much \nthe same. And I think Senator McCain articulated it well when he \ncharacterized it as anxiety and concern.\n  One of my colleagues said he denoted in his constituents, in these \ntownhall meetings, real fear. I think that is true. Because even though \nwe know there are some things that need to be done to improve health \ncare delivery in this country, most people, according to surveys, have \ninsurance and believe what they have serves them very well or at least \nwell. Our goal, therefore, is to try to solve the specific problems \nthat exist without doing harm to the system that treats the others.\n\n  As I said, a lot of our constituents were very fearful that they were \ngoing to have to pay much more in taxes; that their debt burden as a \npart of what this entire country owes would be increased significantly \nbecause of the costs of the health care reforms that have been \nproposed; that they wouldn't be able to keep the insurance they have \neven if they like it; that the way they receive care--the advice they \nget from their doctor about what their family's needs are--would not \nnecessarily be respected if the government has a large role in deciding \nwhat to pay for and what not to pay for; and generally that the \ngovernment's continued takeover piece by piece of the American economy \nwould not serve individual Americans well. To be sure, they agreed that \nsome health care costs are growing too fast and need to be controlled \nand that there are some Americans who don't have health coverage and \nreally don't have a way to get it without public health. Those are the \ntwo key areas in which they recognize there is a role for government to \nplay in reform.\n  But they also wonder why certain problems are not being tackled--the \nproblem, for example, of what one characterized as ``jackpot justice,'' \nwhere trial lawyers bring lawsuits and sometimes get big rewards but \nfrequently simply settle the cases, and the net result is that the \nmedical profession in this country--doctors primarily but hospitals and \nothers--spend an enormous amount of money, estimated to be at least \n$100 billion a year, on what is called the practice of defensive \nmedicine; that is to say, doing things--ordering tests, referring \npatients to other physicians and so on--all of which are really \nunnecessary for the care and treatment of the patient but which will \nprotect the doctor in the event there is a claim of medical \nmalpractice. This happens because the lawyers involved get so-called \nexpert witnesses who come to court and tell the jury that the standard \nof care in the community is that if the child falls down on the \nplayground and gets a bump on the head, you order a CAT scan. It \ndoesn't matter whether or not from the physician's observations he can \nsee that the child really, if the parents just watch him carefully that \nevening, should be just fine; no, to protect himself or herself against \nmedical liability or malpractice claims, they order a CAT scan or some \nother kind of test. The net result of that, as I said, is an expense of \nover $100 billion a year in unnecessary medical tests and procedures. \nThe cost of those items, of course, is passed on to all the rest of us.\n  Another estimate is that 10 percent of every health care dollar is \nspent on the premiums physicians spend for their malpractice insurance. \nAs lawyers, some of us know you have to pay some money for malpractice \ninsurance before you can start work on January 1. That is fair. But how \nabout $200,000 in medical malpractice premiums for a neurosurgeon, for \nexample. That is an awful lot of money if you are an OB-GYN, for \nexample. This estimate of 10 percent of health care dollars spent on \npremiums means that if we could reduce the incidence of malpractice \nclaims, we could reduce that premium cost, the physicians wouldn't have \nto pass it on to the insurance companies, who wouldn't have to pass it \non to us, and again, our health care could be cheaper.\n  So because of premium costs and because of the practice of defensive \nmedicine, this jackpot justice system has not served us well.\n  One would think that if we are interested in controlling costs, if we \nare making insurance more affordable for small businesses--for big \nbusinesses, for that matter--for their employees, and for us as \nindividuals, and if we want to encourage more physicians to stay in \npractice, then what we would do is tackle this problem. Is there one \nword about medical malpractice reform in any of the bills, the bill \nthat came out of the HELP Committee in the Senate, the bill currently \npending in the Finance Committee, or the bill that came out of the \nHouse of Representatives? The answer is no, not a word about medical \nmalpractice reform. Why? Well, Howard Dean, the former Democratic \nGovernor of Vermont and Democratic National Committee chairman, was \nvery honest about this on August 17 at a townhall meeting with \nRepresentative Moran in Virginia. He was asked that question, and he \nsaid: When you write a big bill, you don't want to take on too many \nspecial interests, and the people who wrote this bill simply didn't \nwant to take on the trial lawyers, and, he said, that is the truth. It \nis the truth.\n  The reality is that the President is going to ask everybody else to \nsacrifice. For example, seniors are going to have to take a $400 \nbillion to $500 billion cut in Medicare, which will mean less care for \nthem. If small businesses are going to have to pay a tax on every one \nof their employees in order to make sure they get covered with \ninsurance; if the pharmaceutical companies are going to have to pony \nup--I have forgotten how many hundreds of billions of dollars it was \nfor more drugs for seniors, for example; if everybody else is going to \nhave to sacrifice, why didn't we ask the poor trial lawyers to give up \njust a little bit here? We are not saying malpractice claims couldn't \nbe filed. That is the way doctors and hospitals and others are kept \nhonest. When you make a mistake, you are going to have to pay for it. \nBut we can make sure the system works to prevent the kind of jackpot \njustice I spoke about.\n  There are at least five different kinds of medical malpractice \nreforms that have worked. One was offered by Senator Enzi in the HELP \nCommittee; it is called health courts. The State of Texas and the State \nof Arizona have both adopted certain kinds of medical malpractice \nreforms. In Arizona, it has begun to work. In Texas, something like \n7,000 doctors have moved into the State, with premiums being reduced by \neither 21 or 23 percent. In other words, medical malpractice costs can \nbe reduced to provide care, and by reducing that cost, people's \npremiums can be cut, and that will make insurance more affordable and \nmore people will be able to get it.\n  My point here is simply to say this: What we found as we talked to \nour constituents was a fear that in order to solve two or three very \ndiscrete problems, there were people here in Washington who wanted to \nremake the whole system, throw out what we have, and impose on it a new \nregulatory regime. Whether there is a government option or government \ninsurance plan is only part of the issue. The problem is\n\n[[Page S9113]]\n\nthat there is government control of everybody irrespective of that, and \npeople are concerned as a result that their care will be rationed, that \ntaxes will go up, and that, in fact, their premiums will go up.\n  How could that be if we are going to try to make care less expensive? \nI will give one example. I talked to people who are relatively young \nand relatively healthy, and they are very aware that if they are put in \nthe same pool with everybody else, with the people who are sicker and \nolder, they are all put into one pot and you can't discriminate on the \nbasis of health condition--and we do believe people with preexisting \nconditions should be able to get insurance--then, naturally, the people \nwho are younger and healthier are going to be paying more for their \ninsurance than they would if they were in a category all by themselves, \nand that is what the actuarial data shows us. So it might make \ninsurance more affordable for somebody who is older and sicker, but it \nwill definitely raise the cost of insurance for those who are younger \nand healthier. There have to be ways to avoid that perverse result. \nThere are, in fact, and Senator McCain talked about a couple of those \nthat I will mention in just a moment.\n  There ought to be a way to ensure that everyone in this country can \nget affordable, quality health insurance without taxing all employers, \nespecially small businesses--the very entities we are counting on to \nbring us out of this recession. We know that almost all of the jobs \ncreated in this country in the last 2 or 3 years were created by small \nbusiness. Large businesses lost--in fact, we have lost about 3 million \njobs in this country. In this recession, 3 million jobs have been lost. \nHow are those jobs going to come back? It is going to be through small \nbusiness. That is where over 80 percent of the jobs are created, and \nthat is where they will be re-created to get us out of this recession. \nWhy, when we are in the middle of this recession, would we want to tax \npeople to say: If you want to hire somebody, it is going to cost you X \namount. Why don't we give them an incentive to hire more people, not \ngive them a disincentive through taxation. Why would we raise the taxes \nof all businesses, including, by the way, raising taxes on insurance? \nInsurance companies are fun to pick on, I grant. But does the insurance \ncompany just pass the cost of that tax that is going to be imposed on \nit to its premium holders? Of course. There is no free lunch. We end up \npaying the taxes. As everybody knows, corporations don't pay taxes, \npeople do.\n\n  The net result is that when people are concerned about the economy, \nNo. 1, about our rising debt, about the potential they are going to be \ntaxed, and about the need to re-create jobs, what they are telling us \nand what they told me when I was back home is: Solve those problems \nfirst. When you get that solved, then if you still want to look at \nhealth care, go ahead and do that. But in the process of doing that, \ndon't throw the baby out with the bathwater. Don't try to throw out a \nsystem that works for most people. If you have a specific problem, \ntarget solutions to that problem. You could cover the 12 million people \nwho can't afford insurance and who need to get it today, you could buy \nthem all insurance with the savings you get with malpractice reform. \nWhy don't we do that? The jackpot justice system is a problem in and of \nitself, and we have a problem because some people can't afford \ninsurance and we need to help them get it. The money we save from one \ncan help pay for insurance for the other. Why not do that? We don't \nneed to change the entire system of health in this country in order to \ndo that.\n  Since everyone knows Medicare is in trouble, why would we get it in \nfurther trouble by cutting it by $500 billion, and instead applying \nthat savings back in to help make Medicare solvent, provide coverage \nfor people with that money when, in fact, you could get the money \nelsewhere.\n  That is what people are concerned about. They see some problems, but \nthey see a solution that does not fit the problems, and they are afraid \nof it because it is too big, it is too much. People are trying to do it \ntoo fast. In fact, one asked why were they trying to rush this bill \nthrough before the end of August when it doesn't even take effect in \nmost aspects until the year 2013. Good question. It has been a good \nthing that the American people have had a chance to consider this, that \nwe have had a chance to read it and we have had a chance to talk about \nit.\n  Here is the bottom line. Republicans have a lot of alternatives. \nSenator McCain talked about them: the malpractice reform; getting rid \nof the waste, fraud, and abuse in programs such as Medicare; selling \ninsurance across State lines; providing association health plans so \nthat small businesses can compete with the insurance companies in the \nsame way the big businesses compete. These are ideas that can \ndiscretely be put into place to solve specific problems, and at the end \nof the day we will have achieved two things: We will have reduced the \ncost of health care premiums and the cost of health care for everybody, \nnot just a few, and at the same time we will have been able to, with \nthat savings, provide coverage for people who need it and cannot get \nit. To do that, it is not necessary to scrap everything we have and \ncreate a whole new system where the government takes over health care \njust as it has insurance and banking and automobiles and everything \nelse.\n  So that is what I am hearing from my constituents, and I hope, as we \nare reengaged in this debate, we will do the one fundamental thing our \nFounding Fathers had in mind when they set up the kind of system we \nhave here, and that is that we will listen to our constituents, never \nforgetting they are our bosses and we work for them.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \nup to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, why are we working so hard on health \ncare reform right now? Well, one reason is because the present system \nis out of control and unsustainable. This is the cost curve of our \nnational health expenditures. In 2009, it hit $2.5 trillion, and it is \ngoing to continue to go up to the point where right now it is estimated \nthat in the year 2016--which is not too far from where we are right \nnow--in the year 2016, a standard family policy on average in Rhode \nIsland will cost that family $26,000 a year. A middle-class family in \nRhode Island cannot afford $26,000 a year just for health insurance. \nSomething urgent has to be done.\n  During the 8 years of the Bush administration, it probably increased \nby nearly $1 trillion, and nothing got done. Our friends on the other \nside of the aisle were happy as clams with that state of affairs. Now, \nin the first year of the Obama administration, with more progress made \non health care than at any time since back when the Clintons tried it, \nwe hear once again the catcalls and the criticisms from our \ncolleagues--anything to stand in the way of progress. But that is why \nit is so important. We simply can't afford not to do so when we look at \nthe risks our country faces economically.\n  There has been some criticism of the stimulus bill, the Economic \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act. This is it right here: $0.8 trillion. \nFrom all the noise on the other side of this Chamber, one would think \nthis dwarfed, shadowed the fiscal health of the Republic, but, in fact, \nit is a tiny little sliver compared to the debt that was run up during \nthe Bush administration. We see that $8.9 trillion is the difference \nbetween what the nonpartisan CBO projected when President Bush took \noffice from President Clinton and when President Bush left us when he \nwas done--$8.9 trillion. This doesn't even count the Bush hangover of \nall the spending President Obama has had to do to help save the banks, \nto help save the financial system, and to help save the American auto \nindustry.\n  He campaigned on none of that. None of us wanted to do that. When \ncatastrophe asserted itself, we had to respond. The catastrophe took \nplace not on President Obama's watch but beforehand. He has led this \neffort to put out the fires. The big risk is the $38 trillion in \nunfunded liability for Medicare alone. That is part of that climbing \ncost picture that is driving us out of control.\n  Of that, the Lewin Group--a pretty respected group around these parts \nfor their opinions on health care--says the\n\n[[Page S9114]]\n\nexcess costs in the health care system add about $1 trillion a year: \n$151 billion for excess costs for incentives to overuse services; $519 \nbillion for excess costs from poor care management and lifestyle \nfactors; $135 billion a year for excess costs due to competition and \nregulatory factors; $203 billion a year from excess costs due to \ntransactional inefficiencies.\n  We can reform this health care system in a way that improves the \nquality of care, while addressing this $1 trillion in excess costs, \nwhich, according to George Bush's former Treasury Secretary, Paul \nO'Neil, who ran the Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative and knows \nsomething about health care, is associated with ``process failures.''\n  Process failures can be corrected. One of the ways you can correct \nthem is with a competitive public option. We have had a lock in the \nmain middle market of health care by the private insurance market for \nall these years. This is what we are left with--$1 trillion in waste \nfrom process failures. Obviously, they failed at the job. They have \ncatastrophically, indisputably failed.\n  All we ask is to put a public option in side by side to compete with \nthem--in the same way a public option in workers' compensation \ninsurance competes in Senator McCain's home State of Arizona with the \nprivate insurance providers in workers' compensation. I don't hear \ncomplaints from him about the business community and the workers' \ncompensation.\n  In the home State of Senator Ensign, Nevada, there is actually a \nsingle-payer public option for workers' compensation health insurance, \nand his employers seem absolutely fine with it. So it is not as if it \nis some strange, bizarre idea out on the fringes; it is a way of doing \nbusiness in some of the home States of the opponents of this.\n  Our colleagues and their predecessors in this Chamber opposed \nMedicare when it was first proposed. Now it is probably the most \npopular program in the country. We have seen them in this Chamber \nfighting against children's health insurance. It was only thanks to our \nbeloved colleague, Senator Kennedy, coming back from his sick bed to \ncast the tie-breaking vote, that we actually were able to win that \nagainst Republican opposition.\n  The ideas they have seem, to me, to be abject failures. One is to \ncontinue the lock for private health insurance companies so they are \nthe only place you can get coverage, unless you are old enough for \nMedicare or you qualify for Medicaid or you are in the military. That \nis clearly not a sign of success.\n  As Senator McCain indicated, it would be good to be able to cross \nState lines and buy insurance from out-of-State insurance companies. \nYes, look how well that turned out for us with the credit card \nindustry. We just had to pass legislation, thanks to Chairman Dodd, to \nrein in the abuse and practices of the credit card industry because you \ncan go to practically unregulated States and get credit cards that \ndon't have basic consumer protections.\n  We don't want to see that in health insurance. We want careful, \nthoughtful local regulation of health insurance. We have 100,000 people \nwho are killed every year by medical errors--and who knows how many \ninjured--and the solution our friends across the aisle see is to take \naway the damages that the worst injured Americans are entitled to. That \nis how the reform they proposed in the HELP Committee works. It cuts \ndamages, caps them, meaning it only would affect the people for whom \nthe damages are the highest, who are harmed the worst, who would \ndisproportionately be women because of the way it was organized, \nfocusing on economic damages. So if you take a system where you kill \n100,000 Americans every year because of medical errors--and injure who \nknows how many more--and your solution to the problem is to put the \ncost of it entirely on the backs of the worst victims of that error and \ninjury, I think that is a mistake.\n  We would prefer, as Democrats--and I think as rational people--to \nreduce the incidence of malpractice and error, reduce the errors of \nmalpractice claims by reducing the incidence of malpractice and error. \nWe put enormous effort in this bill into putting structures into place \nto allow that to happen.\n  In terms of the real fear people heard when they went back home, it \nwas a little disingenuous when that fear was whipped up by our \ncolleagues with false statements about death panels in the legislation, \nhow this was socialized medicine, and how a bureaucrat would jump in \nbetween you and your doctor if the bill passed. That is patently false. \nIt spread like wildfire. Who wouldn't be afraid of those things? Now \nthey observe there is real fear out there. I also had the opportunity \nto travel around my State during this break, similar to many \ncolleagues, and I sat down with my constituents and heard what they had \nto say about health care reform. I sat down with hospital executives; \npediatricians; OB/GYNs; family physicians; critical care doctors; the \nState medical society; health insurers; CVS, the pharmaceutical chain \nthat makes its home in Rhode Island; the Rhode Island MS chapter; \nbusiness community leaders; members of our Rhode Island quality \ninstitute, which is reforming health care at the State level and it \ngives great leadership to our country right now; and with members of \nall walks of life who have come together and are working tirelessly to \nhelp build our State's information technology infrastructure.\n  I learned a great deal from those individuals and institutions. I \nlearned a great deal also at two community dinners I held in West \nWarwick and in Johnston, RI, where hundreds of Rhode Islanders came out \nto join me and our senior Senator Jack Reed, not only for spaghetti and \nmeatballs--and they were good. I think I might be the only Senator to \nintroduce meatballs into the townhall formula, and it worked fine. They \nwere for a serious, civil, and constructive debate on the state of our \ncurrent health care system. It brought out some stories I wish to share \nquickly this afternoon.\n  The first story is about Christine, who is a wife and mother, from \nCoventry, RI. Her family's struggle to maintain health insurance has \nleft her and her husband with very difficult choices and few options. \nIn 2007, Christine was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis. Shortly \nthereafter, she lost her job. She was shifting the family's coverage to \nher husband's employer, when her husband was laid off as well. That \nleft Christine and her husband and their 6-year-old son with no health \ninsurance. Still reeling from those bits of bad news, Christine and her \nhusband were faced with decisions no one should be forced to make. \nWithout medical insurance, with no affordable options for health \ncoverage because of Christine's preexisting condition, they faced a \nchoice now of leaving their home--think about that. You have a 6-year-\nold son who might lose his home--or paying for health insurance. At the \nmoment, they cannot see a way to manage both.\n  As Christine told me:\n\n       I don't want any handouts. Unfortunately, life has handed \n     me and my family a difficult path, and right now my family \n     needs a little help. We should not have to make a decision \n     between our health and our financial stability.\n\n  Until her husband finds a job, Christine says that every day they \nhold their breath and pray nothing will happen because that is all our \nbroken health care system now has to offer them.\n  I also met Anna from Johnston, RI, who shared the story of her sister \nTina. As is the story of so many today, Tina's husband lost his job. \nTheir only option for health insurance was through COBRA. At $1,500 a \nmonth, on top of mortgage and car payments and groceries, Tina knew, \nfinancially, this coverage was unsustainable. Finally, she had to give \nit up.\n  Shortly after dropping coverage, Tina began to lose weight. Anna \nexplained that, at first, she thought her sister's weight loss was a \nreaction to the stress of the family's financial situation. But then \nthe weight loss continued, and they realized something was seriously \nwrong. Despite urging from her family, Tina resisted going to the \ndoctor because she was afraid the medical bills would make a very \ndifficult financial situation unbearable.\n\n  Eventually, Tina felt so sick they called the ambulance, and she was \ntaken to the hospital. Tina died 3 days later of a heart attack, \ncomplicated by bone cancer and diabetes. When Anna talked to the doctor \nwho treated Tina, they asked the family why Tina had avoided coming to \nthe hospital for so\n\n[[Page S9115]]\n\nlong because, with proper early intervention, her sister's conditions \nwould have been treatable.\n  Anna told me she understands people get sick and die, but the manner \nin which her sister passed away was tragic because it didn't have to \nhappen.\n  Over the August recess, I also heard from Rhode Islanders through the \nhealth care storyboard I ran on my Web site. Two of the stories are \nremarkable.\n  The first is from Ken, a recent Rhode Island College graduate from \nGreenville. He worked hard, dreaming he would be the first in his \nfamily to achieve a college degree. A year after graduation, Ken has \nthat college degree, but he cannot find a full-time job with health \ninsurance benefits. In this difficult economy, he works two part-time \njobs at minimum wage, and he has no health benefits.\n  Ken wasn't looking to make a six-figure salary after graduation, but \nhe was looking to be able to get by. On his current income, he has \ndifficulty making ends meet with his day-to-day expenses, and he says \nit will take years to pay off his student loans at this rate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent for 5 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Ken is having a hard time making ends meet with his \nday-to-day expenses, and it will take years to pay off his student \nloans. On such a limited income and in this situation, health insurance \nis simply not an option for Ken.\n  Ken is discouraged and frustrated. Despite his hard work and \nachievement, he knows that at any moment he is one sickness or injury \naway from thousands of dollars in debt or ruined credit that would \naffect his chances for a prosperous future. He has worked for \neverything he has earned, but health care costs are so high he is \nscared about his future, if nothing is done to fix our health care \nsystem.\n  Last is Beth, a small business owner in Providence. She and her \nhusband have two full-time and two part-time employees. They find \nthemselves at the whim of insurance companies. Because they don't have \nthe bargaining power to negotiate the terms of their health insurance \npackage, they have seen 41 percent increases in their insurance rates \nfor 2 years in a row.\n  Beth told me the cost of health insurance is breaking the backs of \nsmall entrepreneurs, those critical drivers of innovation and building \nblocks of our Nation's economy. She doesn't understand how or why \nanyone would start their own business under the deep financial burdens \nimposed on small business by our current health insurance system.\n  Beth also cannot afford health insurance coverage for her twin 3-\nyear-old girls. Beth admits she is terrified about what might happen to \nthem without the safety net that health coverage offers. She urges us \nto work quickly toward reform so others do not have to struggle with \nthe same fear and frustration as her family.\n  The Senate has been working hard on health reform legislation since \nthe very beginning of this year. The process is trying and tiring and \nextremely complex. As we turn up the heat even more the next few weeks \nand become mired in the intense process of drafting a final bill and \ngetting it to the floor, I urge my colleagues to remember health care \nreform is not about the interest groups, it is not about parliamentary \nprocedures, it is not about secret meetings, and it is not about CBO \nscores. Reforming our health care system in America is about Christine \nand Tina and Beth and Ken and thousands like them in every one of our \nStates across the country. And it means injecting some fairness and \nsome reason into a system that has punished the sick, rewarded the \ngreedy, and discouraged those who try to do the right thing.\n  For me, these stories reinforce the urgency of what we need to get \ndone in the Senate. I am fully committed to completing this task, as I \nknow the Presiding Officer is, and I look forward to getting it done \nover the next few weeks.\n  In closing, let me just say this is the first time I have spoken on \nthe Senate floor since our colleague, Senator Kennedy, has left us. His \ndesk is three down from me. I don't know if the camera shows it now, \nbut there is a black drape over it and some flowers and a copy of \nRobert Frost's ``The Road Less Traveled.'' I know this poem meant a lot \nto him, and he certainly meant a lot to me as a very gracious mentor \nwith vast experience who could easily have ignored a new colleague. But \nhe took an interest, and I will never forget his kindness to me.\n  We all will miss his booming voice. He could fill this Chamber with \nhis voice. We will miss his rollicking good humor. No one enjoyed life \nand enjoyed his colleagues more than the senior Senator from \nMassachusetts. We will miss his masterful legislative skills as we try \nto work our way through the obstructions the other side will be \nthrowing up against progress on health care reform. His wise voice and \ncounsel will be missed.\n  Finally, we will miss his lion's heart. He knew when the fight was \nright, he knew when it was worth fighting for, and he was in it to win \nit.\n  Ted, God bless you. We miss you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me follow on the remarks of my \ncolleague from Rhode Island as he discussed briefly at the end of his \nremarks the loss of our colleague and friend, Senator Ted Kennedy.\n  The desk that is now cloaked in black and adorned with flowers is a \ndesk that was once occupied by Senator John F. Kennedy, then occupied \nby Senator Robert Kennedy, and for many years occupied by Senator Ted \nKennedy.\n  He was an extraordinary friend to all of us, a remarkable legislator. \nThis is not a case of the Senate just losing one Senator. He was such a \nmuch larger presence than that in the public life of our country and \nparticularly in the workings of this Congress.\n  My thoughts and prayers have been with Ted Kennedy and his family \nover these many months as he has battled brain cancer. Now, since his \ndeath, we have all reflected on what he meant to us and to this \ncountry.\n  Today it seems inappropriate to take the floor of the Senate without \nat least acknowledging the absence of our friend, Ted Kennedy, and to \nsend our prayers to his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9115-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9115-S9117]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WASTE, FRAUD, AND ABUSE IN PUBLIC SPENDING\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, when Senator Kennedy would come to the \nfloor with a booming voice, full of passion about an issue, it was an \nextraordinary thing to watch and to listen to. He had that kind of \npassion. I do want to say there are a lot of things for us to be \npassionate about. One of the things I have talked about on the floor of \nthe Senate is the waste, fraud and abuse in public spending. All of us \nbelieve in investing in programs that work to try to help make life \nbetter in this country and advance the interests of this country. But \nit makes me furious to see the kinds of things I see from time to time \nthat represent waste, fraud, and abuse and unbelievable incompetence. \nLet me describe just one.\n  We know this not because of some extraordinary work by this body. We \nknow this because of some extraordinary work by C.J. Chivers and Eric \nSchmitt at the New York Times because they wrote a story about it.\n  Let me tell you the story, and I am sure it will make every American \nas angry as it makes me. This is a picture of Efraim Diveroli, a 22-\nyear-old CEO of a firm awarded $300 million in U.S. contracts to \nprovide armaments, bullets, and guns to the Afghan fighters. That is \nright. A 22-year-old man using a shell corporation established by his \nfather, working out of a building with an unmarked door in Miami, got \n$300 million in contracts from the Department of Defense. He was a CEO. \nBy the way, there is no evidence of any other employees except him and \nhis vice president. Yes, his vice president was older, 25 years old and \na massage therapist.\n  Let me say that again. The Department of Defense gave $300 million in\n\n[[Page S9116]]\n\ncontracts to a 22-year-old CEO of a company--a company that was run by \na 22-year-old CEO--and a 25-year-old vice president massage therapist.\n  Why do I tell you this today? Because a new story just recently \ndescribed the fact that Mr. Diveroli pled guilty to a fraud conspiracy \ncharge relating to the $300 million in U.S. contracts. He faces up to 5 \nyears in prison.\n  I have spoken about this man and this circumstance probably three or \nfour times on the floor of the Senate to ask the question: How on Earth \ncould this have happened?\n  Let me just show, if I might, what this was about. This was about \nproducts. No, not staplers or reams of paper. These were killer \nproducts, ammunition; ammunition that was supposed to be provided to \nthe Afghan fighters. As it turns out, ammunition that spills out of \nboxes. Here are some other examples.\n  In this chart, these are bullets, 40-year-old, Chinese-made \ncartridges they found somewhere in the world and sent them over to \nAfghanistan and the Afghan fighters.\n  Here we can see spilling out of boxes 42-year-old Chinese ammunition \nthat was delivered in Afghanistan from these two folks.\n  The 22-year-old CEO with whom both the Defense Department and the \nState Department did business, by the way had previous contracts with \nthe State Department. They were unsatisfactory, and despite that, he \ngot $300 million in contracts from the Defense Department. This \nphotograph is from 2007. That is when he got the $300 million in \ndefense contracts. This photograph happens to be a police photograph \nbecause he was arrested for assaulting a parking lot attendant. At the \ntime, he was found to have had a forged driver's license which made him \nout to be 4 years older than he really was. He said he forged the \nlicense and didn't need it any longer now that he is 21 because he only \nwanted to buy alcohol in the first place.\n  They ran the company, AEY--the 22- and 25-year-olds getting $300 \nmillion in defense contracts after they had gotten contracts with the \nState Department and judged to be unsatisfactory--out of a building in \nMiami. It was an unmarked door in a Miami Beach building. That is all \nyou could see. The only evidence that exists suggests that this was a \ncompany with just two people.\n  Mr. Packouz, the 25-year-old massage therapist, has also pled guilty. \nSo both have now pled guilty. I have shown examples of the arms they \nwere supposed to have procured for the Afghan fighters, and when they \nwere delivered, the Afghan fighters called them ``junk''--junk--stuff \nthat was made in the 1960s in China.\n  The way they purchased this so-called junk violated U.S. law in the \nfirst place. The New York Times originally published this story. That \nis when I saw it. That is when I came to the floor of the Senate and \nasked a very simple question: How did this happen? How on Earth could \nthis have happened? Who is minding the store? If the Army had made the \nslightest effort to look into the backgrounds of Mr. Diveroli and Mr. \nPackouz, they never would have granted contracts to them.\n\n  The award was made in January 2007 by the Army Sustainment Command. \nOn May 7, 2008, I met with Army LTG William Mortensen to find out why \non Earth they gave contracts in this circumstance. Mr. Mortensen was a \nthree-star general, Deputy Commander of the Army Materiel Command, \nwhich commanded authority over the Army Sustainment Command. They had \nawarded this contract. General Mortensen has since retired. He was \ncompletely unapologetic about this, by the way. He said the Army \ncontracts were with companies, not individuals, and on paper the \nDiveroli company looked just fine.\n  Of course it didn't because they had not looked at the paper. Had \nthey looked at the State Department with which that company previously \ncontracted, they would have found out this is nobody with whom to \ncontract. He told me nobody in the Army had thought to look through the \nbackground of Mr. Diveroli and Mr. Packouz, even though this was a \ncompany which consisted, as we know, of just two people. He told me, \nunder similar circumstances, the Army would probably make the same \ndecision again and give contracts to such people again. Then he told me \nif Mr. Diveroli and Mr. Packouz were acquitted, the Army would go back \nto doing business with them.\n  If General Mortensen had wanted to know a little bit about with whom \nthey were doing business to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars \nhe could have gone to MySpace. Mr. Diveroli had a page on MySpace. He \ndescribes himself as a super nice guy. He said on MySpace:\n\n       I had problems in high school so I was forced to I work and \n     probably grew up way too fast.\n\n  He said:\n\n       Basically I'm just chilling with my boys.\n\n  And he likes to go clubbing and see movies.\n  He could have checked, of course, more than MySpace.\n  He could have checked perhaps a criminal record and found he had been \ncharged with domestic violence and with drunk driving. He could have \nGoogled his name and discovered the vice president, in addition to \nbeing a massage therapist, was a professional song writer.\n  With these kinds of backgrounds, I am just wondering, where is there \naccountability? Where is the accountability? I understand that because \ntwo enterprising reporters for the New York Times broke this story, and \nwe probably would not know it now because this did not come from \noversight hearings, it did not come from a Truman committee we should \nhave in this Chamber investigating these things, but it was \nenterprising reporting that did this. I understand that. So because of \nthat, we have a couple of people charged criminally.\n  The question I ask is, where is the accountability in the Department \nof Defense for deciding they are going to move $300 million through the \nhands of these two? Who did that? Who is responsible? Were they asked \nto account for it and to answer for it to the American taxpayers and \nthe government for which they worked?\n  The answer is no, and that is what is wrong, and it is why I come to \nthe Senate floor to recite this again. There is some good news. \nFinally, we have criminal charges that have been adjudicated, and the \nfact is, two people have pled guilty. But will this be happening today \nsomewhere in the Pentagon? Will it? Did it happen with water that was \nsent by a contractor to all the military bases in Iraq, the nonpotable \nwater that has more contamination than raw water from the Euphrates \nRiver? Did it happen there? The Army said no. The inspector general, at \nmy request, investigated and said, yes, it did happen.\n  I can go on at length about dozens and dozens of similar \ncircumstances. The question is, who is accountable for the spending of \nthis money? Who has been made to be accountable? Who had to answer for \nit?\n  I ask the Secretary of Defense and others: Is there somebody made \naccountable for this situation? I understand there is criminal \naccountability for these two people. But is there accountability for \nthe people who decided to employ them, despite all the evidence that \nthis made no sense for our country?\n  I ask that question for a very important reason. We are going to have \na debate about Afghanistan. I have very strong feelings about that \nissue as well. What we are seeing now is more and more contracting \nbeing done in Afghanistan just as the ratcheting up of contracts \noccurred in Iraq. More and more and more contracting. Who is minding \nthe store? What kind of oversight can we expect? Or will we a week from \nnow, a month from now, or a year from now read another story by a \ncouple of good reporters who dug it out to say something happened that \nis unbelievable and the American people got defrauded to the tune of \nmillions of dollars or, in this case, hundreds of millions of dollars.\n  All of us have responsibility at this point to make accountable those \nwho allowed this sort of thing to happen and not just in this case. I \nhave done 20 hearings now as chairman of the Policy Committee, which \nhave helped to unearth a great amount of evidence of waste, fraud and \nabuse.\n  Well, I know my colleague in Oklahoma is patiently waiting, and I \nwish to give him an opportunity to speak. I only want to say this. This \nis a conclusion with criminal charges and guilty\n\n[[Page S9117]]\n\npleas with respect to this issue, which I think is a metaphor for a \nmuch larger set of problems that we in the Congress and in the \nadministration have a responsibility to address and to address soon. \nThis issue of big Federal budget deficits is very real. They are \nunsustainable and dangerous. One of the ways to deal with them is to \ntighten our belts and start cutting spending where spending is being \nwasted. This was an unbelievable waste of the taxpayers' money, and my \nhat is off to the reporters who discovered it. I have been following it \nnow for a couple years on the floor of the Senate, and at least I am \nable to say guilty pleas have been received.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have been here this afternoon and hope \nto get a little more time than we are getting. Right now we are into \nthe final debate on the vote that will take place at 5:30. The Senator \nfrom Nevada, Senator Ensign, has agreed to let me have 10 minutes, so I \nask unanimous consent to speak for 10 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, could we point out that we are to go to \nthe bill at 4:30. I discussed with my colleague that we have 30 minutes \non each side on the bill, and if we could go to the bill and then have \nmy colleague speak on that portion of the bill, I think that would be \nthe right approach.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized for 10 \nminutes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9117-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9117-S9118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ISSUES FACING THE SENATE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n  Well, first of all, I had a few stories I was going to tell about my \nvery good friend who is deceased now, Senator Kennedy, and if there is \ntime before my time expires I will get into that. I have a feeling more \nwill take place on that tomorrow or later on tonight.\n  Let me mention one thing because I think it is so fresh on our minds \nnow, having come back from the August recess. I did my town meetings in \nsmaller communities in Oklahoma. I was in Stigler, Coweta, Chickasha, \nGrove, Woodward, Guymon, McAlester, and Lawton. I did this because so \nmany times smaller communities are left out, and I wanted to know what \nkind of response they had. I made the comment when I was in Grove, OK, \nthat the very institutions that have historically set America aside \nfrom the rest of the world are the ones that seem to be under attack by \nthis administration. I am talking about free enterprise, talking about \nthe fact of little government, big people, and all these things.\n\n  Since the junior Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, is one of the two \nmedical doctors in the Senate, I decided to talk about the other \nissues. My fear is this: There was concern about socialized medicine. \nEveryone is concerned about what this President wants to do with the \nhealth issues in America, but we are forgetting there are other very \nserious issues. So I covered these, as opposed to the health problems, \nbecause these are things we are going to be dealing with in the Senate \nin the next few days or weeks, and they are very significant.\n  One of them is the cap-and-trade issue that we have talked about at \nsome length, and I will get into that in a minute; the other is the \nclosing of Guantanamo Bay Naval Station, or Gitmo as it is known to \nmost people, and the other is what has happened to our military. So let \nme, real briefly, get into these areas. These are three areas where I \nwill be providing leadership. These are the areas of specialty I have \nand I am very much concerned about.\n  First of all, I positioned myself in Afghanistan in February, when \nSecretary of Defense Gates came out with his announcement as to the \nportion of the President's budget dealing with defense because I knew I \nwas going to be opposed to it, and I thought that would give me a \nnational forum, and it did. I was concerned about such things as the F-\n22. Right now, the only fifth-generation fighter we have is the F-22. \nInitially, we were going to have 750 of them. We now have 187, and the \nPresident, in his budget, stopped it right there. He didn't say \nterminate, but I will use the word ``terminate,'' because when you \nsuspend something for an undetermined period of time, I think it is \nterminated.\n\n  At the same time that happened, we know that China is now working on \ntheir J-12s and Russia on their PAK-FAs. These are fifth-generation \nfighters they are going to be using to export to countries that could \nbe potential enemies of ours. I have looked at the C-17 program--\nstopping that program--the future combat system. We haven't had in \nAmerica a transition in ground capability in quite some time--about 60 \nyears. So we have been working on the future combat system. That system \nhas been terminated.\n  I think the one that probably has the greatest danger on the lives of \nAmericans could probably be the system we had negotiated with the \nParliaments of Poland and the Czech Republic. The Czech Republic was \nasked if they would agree to have a radar system to see any kind of \nincoming missile which might have been coming from Iran, and they \nagreed to do that. Then Poland agreed to have an interception \ncapability that would knock down such a missile coming from Iran. I \ndon't think there is anyone in America who doesn't realize that Iran is \ngoing to have their nuclear capability and delivery systems just as \nsoon as they can. For the sake of Western Europe and the Eastern United \nStates, I think it is critical we put ourselves in a position to have \nthat capability. Well, he stopped that. So we will be talking about \nthat for quite some time.\n  Gitmo. I think most people realize now that Guantanamo Bay is an \nasset we have had since 1903. It has all kinds of capabilities. It is \nthe only place in the world you can put terrorist detainees where you \ncan have a facility built for them--some seven degrees of security. We \nhave a system there where we use military tribunals. I will never \nunderstand why President Obama is obsessed with bringing these \ndetainees into the United States either for trial or for incarceration. \nFor a trial, it would be the worst plan in the world because, by \ndefinition, a terrorist trains people to become terrorists. We don't \nneed to have terrorists in our prison system teaching other people how \nto become terrorists.\n  Some of the places the President talked about sending them included \nmy State, at Fort Sill. We will talk about that maybe some other time. \nBut I do think, when we see just a matter of days ago, the release of \nMohammed Jawad from Gitmo, nobody knows--or at least I don't know, and \nI should know, being the second-ranking member on the Armed Services \nCommittee--why he would be released. We also know Mullah Zakir, who was \nkilling American marines in the Helmand Province for quite some period \nof time, was released and is now back. He went into Gitmo in 2006, they \nreleased him in 2008, and he is back. Now we have received evidence \nthat is conclusive that he is fighting on the side of the Taliban. So \nyou can't turn these guys loose.\n  The third area I was concentrating on is one I will go back to 8 \nyears ago. Redemption is kind of good for the soul, I think, because 8 \nyears ago I was looking at the science on the notion that manmade \ngases--anthropogenic gases, CO2, methane--caused global \nwarming. It was something everybody believed. Until I looked into the \nscience, frankly, I believed it too. Now we see the science is not \nthere. I made the statement 8 years ago that perhaps those liberals--\nmostly from Hollywood and that type of mentality--who want us to \nbelieve in the notion that manmade gases cause global warming is the \nmost significant hoax ever perpetrated on the American people. I think \nnow there are a lot fewer people today who are upset with the statement \nI made 8 years ago than there were then. This is something that is \ncritical.\n\n  I wish to conclude with that, but first of all I wish to mention that \nthere is a document that is too long to put in the Record. It is some \n65 pages. I will have it on my Web site. This is a brave paper done by \nRobert P. Smith. He has a Ph.D., he is a petroleum engineer, and he \ntalks about the energy crisis and what we can do in the United States \nto resolve that energy crisis--such commonsense things as continuing to \nconserve, to continue to support the free market, to oppose the cap-\nand-trade\n\n[[Page S9118]]\n\ntaxes--which I will talk about in a second--to oppose the alternative \nenergy subsidies because we have to continue to develop and to supply \nenergy for America while we are developing the technologies, so we need \nto continue coal-powered generation. We need to fast-track oil and gas \nexploration and use natural gas wisely. It includes nuclear plants.\n  I would suggest to anyone who is interested in getting into the best \npiece I have seen on this subject to go to my Web site--\ninhofe.senate.gov--and we have a lot of that information on this. But \nhe does have only 3 pages out of the 65 pages detailing the idea that \nglobal warming is caused by manmade gases, and I think it is done in a \nway that is very understandable by people who are not necessarily \nscientists or don't have a background in it. So I strongly recommend \nthis document--called ``Energy: Present and Future,'' by Robert P. \nSmith--to the reading list of the American people or anyone who is \nconcerned about that issue.\n  Lastly, prior to the Republicans losing the majority in the Senate, I \nwas the chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee. That \nchairman is now Senator Barbara Boxer. She took over the committee from \nmy leadership.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I was given an additional 5 minutes from our side, Mr. \nPresident.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair. I will conclude with this.\n  During the time that all the hearings--over 30 hearings--that Senator \nBoxer has had on the subject of global warming were taking place--and \nit was not just the Republicans but a total turnaround--the Democrats \nstarted to look into this and realized the Democrats, as a party--who \nalways supported cap-and-trade systems, such as the 2003 bill and the \n2005 bill and the 2008 bill--are now looking at it and they are cutting \nto the chase. I will give a few quotes here. These are all quotes from \nDemocrats.\n  President Obama said: Electricity prices would necessarily skyrocket. \nDemocratic Representative John Dingell from Michigan said: Cap and \ntrade is a tax and a great big one. Democratic Representative Pete \nDeFazio said: A cap and trade system is prone to market manipulation \nand speculation without any guarantee of meaningful GHG emission \nreductions.\n  The best is from my good friend from North Dakota, Senator Byron \nDorgan, when he said about cap and trade: The Wall Street crowd can't \nwait to sink their teeth into a new trillion-dollar trading market in \nwhich hedge funds and investment banks would trade and speculate on \ncarbon credits and securities. I totally agree with my good friend, \nDemocratic Senator Byron Dorgan.\n  Democratic Senator Cantwell from Washington: A cap and trade program \nmight allow Wall Street to distort a carbon market for its own profits.\n  We learned, of course, from Lisa Jackson, who is the new \nAdministrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, when I asked her \nthis question in a public hearing. I said: If we should pass the Markey \nbill in the Senate and it gets signed into law, will this reduce carbon \nemissions in the world?\n  She said: No.\n  Logically, obviously, she is right. If we drive our jobs overseas to \nplaces such as China and India, where they have no intention of having \nany kind of emission requirements, then that would have the effect of \nincreasing, not decreasing, the amount of emissions in the air.\n  Senator Kerry said: There is no way the United States of America \nacting alone can solve this problem. So we have to have China; we have \nto have India.\n  I say we are not going to have China and India.\n  Senator McCaskill said: If we go too far with this cap and trade, \nthen all we are going to do is chase more jobs to China and India, \nwhere they have been putting up coal-fired plants every 10 minutes.\n  Not quite true. I would say to my good friend, Senator McCaskill, it \nis about two coal-fired generation plants that are built every week in \nChina. We haven't done one in 12 years here. So we know what their \nintentions are.\n  So we have had all these hearings, and we have recognized that things \nhave changed now. You look at the groups now, and you have the \nagricultural community, the American Farm Bureau, and a vast majority \nof the agricultural groups who oppose it. The GAO says it will send our \njobs to China and India. The very eloquent chairman of the National \nBlack Chamber of Commerce did a great job of testifying before our \ncommittee and said it would destroy over 2 million jobs. The EPA and \nthe EIA--that is the Energy Information Agency--said it would not \nreduce our dependence on foreign oil. The EPA said it will do nothing \nto reduce global temperatures. So when all is said and done, the \nAmerican people will reject it. We are sure a lot further now.\n\n  I have to say this: This was a breath of fresh air, to listen to the \nAmerican people standing up at these townhall meetings all around the \ncountry. In my 12 or 14 meetings I had in my State of Oklahoma, people \nknow the right thing is going to happen. We are here to make that \nhappen.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from Nevada for allowing me to have 15 \nminutes of his time, and I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9118-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9118]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the time until 5:30 \np.m. will be divided or controlled between the leaders or their \ndesignees.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to begin the discussion, then I \nbelieve my colleague, Senator Ensign, who has worked hard on this \nlegislation, will follow. Then Senator Klobuchar who also has played a \nsignificant role in this will follow with comments. If others arrive, \nof course we want them to be able to involve themselves in the debate.\n  At a time when there is so much discussion about partisanship and how \nthings don't work so well, this legislation, the cloture motion we vote \non at 5:30 today, is bipartisan. Unlike some other discussions about \npartisanship, this is bipartisan. This legislation is called the Travel \nPromotion Act of 2009. It has 53 cosponsors. There are many Democrats \nand Republicans cosponsoring this legislation.\n  Just today the U.S. Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to all Members \nof Congress saying they strongly support this legislation. The Chamber \nurges Members to support the legislation and to vote for cloture.\n  Let me talk just for a moment about what this is. First of all, at a \ntime when we need jobs, this is about jobs. At a time when we need to \nfind ways to address budget deficits, this is one piece of legislation \nthat is not going to cost money. In fact, the Congressional Budget \nOffice scores it as actually a $425 million reduction in deficits over \na 10-year period. Let me say again, it is pretty unusual. It is \nbipartisan, doesn't cost money--actually saves money--and addresses one \nof the most critical areas of our need, and that is jobs.\n  What is the Travel Promotion Act and why the concern? Let me describe\n\n[[Page S9119]]\n\nit this way. We all know travel and promoting travel and tourism is job \ncreating. It creates jobs in many areas--yes, hotels and gas stations \nand restaurants and tourist attractions, but with visitors just \ntraveling across our country means people are spending money. It \ncreates a lot of jobs.\n  Let me talk especially about the issue of international or foreign \ntravel to the United States. Did you know foreign travel is up very \ndramatically in this world? There is a great deal of foreign travel--56 \nmillion more overseas trips were taken in 2008 than were taken in 2000. \nSo in 8 years the number of overseas trips increased by 56 million \npeople. But at the same time, overseas travel to the United States has \ndecreased. We had 634,000 fewer foreign visitors to the United States. \nIt means a lot of people are traveling, but since the year 2000 we have \nhad a loss in our share of international tourists.\n  Why is that important? Because when overseas travelers come to this \ncountry, on average they spend about $4,500. That supports a lot of \njobs and a lot of businesses in this country. So why do we have \n600,000-plus fewer visitors to the United States? In 2001, after the \nterrorist attack against our country, we tightened visa requirements \nand so on. The Iraq war occurred. There was a lot of concern by people \nthat maybe the United States didn't want them to come: They have \ntightened visa requirements.\n  All of a sudden we discover that more people are traveling overseas, \nbut they are not traveling here. Incidentally, the tourism that is \nhappening internationally is not accidental. Most other countries are \nvery aggressively going after the international traveler, saying: Come \nto our country.\n  Let me go through a list of just a few of those. Here is a big travel \npromotion campaign that talks about ``Come to Australia. Arrived \nlooking for an experience to remember, departed with an adventure we'll \nnever forget.''\n  The country of Ireland saying: ``Come to Ireland. Go where Ireland \ntakes you.''\n  The list goes on. Virtually every country is saying we want foreign \ntourists to come to our country. ``Sweet secrets from Japan.'' Come and \nvisit Japan.\n  We have all seen these. All of these countries are very aggressive. \nCome to France. I can't read the French piece down here, but I know \nwhat it says. It says come to France. Come here, be a part of what we \nare doing.\n  Belgium, here is the Belgian approach: ``Where fun is always in \nfashion. Visit Belgium.''\n  Finally, India. ``One special reason to visit India in 2009. Any time \nis a good time to visit the land of the Taj, but there is no time like \nnow.''\n  Virtually every country is saying: Come to our country; come visit \nus. But we are not, and we propose that we do promote our country \nbecause it will create a lot of jobs. Just as important, when people \ncome here and experience what this country is about, they leave with a \nwonderful impression about what America is.\n\n  So what we have put together is a piece of legislation that is \nbipartisan. It is funded by and large with an entry-exit fee--that is \nimposed by most other countries, by the way--a $10 fee on visa waiver \ncountries, the people who come from those countries who visit our \ncountry. It is a minimal fee compared to what many other countries are \ncharging. We establish with that fee a corporation for travel \npromotion, an independent nonprofit corporation governed by an 11-\nmember board of directors appointed by the Secretary of Commerce. It \nsets up this travel promotion fund financed by a public-private \nmatching program.\n  In short, this is a very simple proposition. It will not only create \na lot of new jobs in this country at a time when we desperately need \nnew jobs by saying to foreign travelers come to our country, be a part \nof what America has to offer you, come see our wonderful country, \nexperience what America is about, we know when they come to this \ncountry they have an unbelievably good impression of what they have \njust seen--the greatest democracy on the face of this planet by far, \nand they experience the magic and wonders of this country.\n  What we are saying to them is, at a time when travel around the world \nis up, that is visitors to other countries, and ours is down, let's \nsolve this problem and let's do it without breaking the bank. In fact, \nthis will not cost money; this will save money. Let's do it by working \nin a bipartisan way on one of the significant problems we face in \nAmerica, and that is the loss of jobs.\n  In case someone thinks perhaps there are just a few of us who think \nthis is a good idea, here are a few examples of others who think this \nis a great idea. The Dallas Morning News:\n\n       The travel promotion act is a sensible first step toward \n     putting the welcome mat back on America's doorstep.\n\n  What a wonderful way to put it.\n  The Los Angeles Times:\n\n       Considering the U.S. spends hundreds of millions of dollars \n     on public diplomacy with dubious results and nearly nothing \n     on promoting tourism, it might do well to invest a little \n     money in wooing travelers.\n\n  Sacramento Bee:\n\n       This country needs to reclaim its stand as a global magnet \n     for visitors even in this post-9/11 climate--and Congress can \n     help by passing the Travel Promotion Act by the end of this \n     year.\n\n  Duluth News Tribune:\n\n       Ideas to bolster economic recovery without plunging the \n     Nation any deeper into debt would be welcomed by taxpayers \n     from coast to coast.\n\n  The Detroit Free Press:\n\n       Doesn't it make sense to encourage, at no cost to \n     taxpayers, foreign visitors to come here and leave us some \n     money? There is no good reason not to pass this bill.\n\n  I needn't go on. This is not rocket science. This is something our \ncountry should do. If, in fact, in a smaller and smaller world, more \nand more people are traveling, then why should fewer people travel to \nthe United States of America? This ought to be one of the great \ndestination places on the entire planet. I expect and hope most people \nwant to come to this country and see what America has to offer. But I \nthink post-9/11 what we have done with visas and so on, which we are \nnow correcting and have corrected by and large--longer waiting times, \nwe have made them shorter and so on--I think there was a notion out \nthere somehow that the welcome mat doesn't exist. We are changing that. \nRepublicans and Democrats can work together to change that. This \nlegislation is good legislation, and I hope my colleagues will join me \ntoday in voting for cloture and moving this bill as soon as possible \nthrough the Senate, through the House, and to the President for \nsignature.\n  When we do, those people who have had to come home to say to their \nspouse: Honey, I have lost my job--some of those millions of people, \nare going to be able to come home someday and say: I have a new job. \nThere is some new activity going on in our State. I have a new job \nthat relates to the substantial increase in international tourism to \nthe United States.\n\n  That will be a good thing for our country. So as the principal \nauthor, along with Senator Ensign, of this legislation--and let me say \nalso the chair of the Tourism Subcommittee, Senator Klobuchar--I am \npleased to be able to work together with my colleagues to get this \nlegislation completed today.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, first let me thank the coauthor of this \nlegislation, Senator Dorgan, for his leadership on recognizing how \nimportant this legislation is to our country, especially at this \ncritical time when our country need jobs. All of us who just went back \nto our home States realize there are a lot of people who are truly \nhurting out there. It is not just people who have already lost their \njobs, but there are a lot of people who are afraid they are going to \nlose their jobs.\n  There are people who are afraid to invest to create jobs. I would say \nthe number one emotion I heard during the August recess was that of \nfear. It is fear of what is going to happen in this country. I think \nSenator Dorgan eloquently put it that this bill is about jobs. It is \nabout creating jobs without adding to the Federal debt.\n  Another thing I heard throughout the State of Nevada is that people \nare very concerned about Federal spending and the deficits this year we \nare facing. This looming Federal debt that people believe is a threat \nto the future of the United States. This bipartisan bill helps create \njobs without adding to the deficit. The bill is paid for through \ncontributions from the private sector plus\n\n[[Page S9120]]\n\n$10 entry fee into the United States. Countries are able to participate \nin what is called a visa waiver program. It is cheaper for those \ncountries who participate in the visa waiver program because $10 is \nactually cheaper than if you were to get a full visa. Most countries \ncharge more than $10 for such a program; the $10 entry fee will not \ndeter people from coming to the United States. As a matter of fact, the \nmoney is going to let people know that the United States is open for \nbusiness.\n  I am obviously from a tourist-driven State. We spend a lot of money \nadvertising, whether it is Las Vegas, Reno or Lake Tahoe, we spend a \nlot of money advertising to other places, including internationally. \nNevada does a lot of advertising. The Las Vegas Convention Authority \nand private businesses advertise because it works.\n  What we are saying in this bill is, let's do it as a country. Let us \nshow how many amazing places there are to see. Let's tell the rest of \nthe world about it.\n\n  You know the old saying: If you build it they will come? We already \nhave built it, or God built it with our natural resources we have, but \nyou have to let them know they are welcome and it is easy to travel to \nthe United States. That is what this legislation will do.\n  Plus, when you tell them about the United States, it will paint a \nmental picture in their minds when they are thinking about where to \nspend their next holiday or vacation. They say: You know what, I just \nsaw that ad. It is kind of in the back of my mind. I always wanted to \ngo to the United States.\n  Maybe they want to see some of our national wonders, whether it is \nYosemite, Yellowstone, the Grand Canyon, Alaska, or Hawaii. Nevada has \nLake Tahoe, one of the most beautiful Alpine lakes in the entire world. \nI would argue it is the most beautiful Alpine lake in the entire world.\n  There are so many places to see that are manmade in this country. \nWashington, DC is one of the most incredible cities in the world. If we \ntell people about it, and they come and learn about our history and our \ndemocracy, they may get a better view of the people and of the \nGovernment of the United States. The statistics are clear. People who \nvisit the United States have a much more favorable view of the United \nStates. There are plenty of other places to see, whether it is going to \nsee the amazing culture of New York City or some of the other amazing \ncities, such as Chicago.\n  My hometown of Las Vegas is a world-class destination with some of \nthe most amazing restaurants and entertainment on the planet. There are \ngreat beaches in California and on the East Coast. There are some of \nthe most amazing golf destinations, whether it is Hilton Head, SC, or \nthe Monterey Peninsula in California.\n  The United States has some amazing places to see. If we tell people \nabout it, they will come in greater numbers. The studies are fairly \nsignificant on this. If you spend money to bring people, they will \ncome. And when they come, they will bring their money.\n  Senator Dorgan talked about the average visitor who comes from \noverseas comes from a long ways away; not just Canada or Mexico. When \nthey come from a long way away, they spend, on average, $4,500 in the \nUnited States. If we can attract some of those 58 million new visitors \nwho are traveling worldwide now since the year 2000, even a small piece \nof that number, it is going to create tens of thousands of jobs in the \nUnited States. Who around here does not think we need jobs? The \nunemployment rate of Clark County, NV, which is where Las Vegas is \nlocated, is 14 percent now.\n  Tourism, when you total it all together, is the number one industry \nin the United States. We ought to do something to promote it. That is \nwhy this legislation, I believe, is so important. This country is \ncrying out for bipartisanship. This bill does not add to the deficit. \nThat is why this bill makes so much sense at this time in our country's \nhistory.\n  Over the next couple of days, we are going to be debating this bill. \nTonight is a procedural vote to get on the bill. I believe all Senators \nshould support it. When we get on the bill, we will have a lot more to \nsay about it, a lot more examples of why this is good legislation.\n  I appreciate the work that has been done. I will yield the floor to \nallow the Subcommittee Chairwoman to speak, Senator Klobuchar. She has \ndone great work on this bill. We appreciate her support as well. This \nis a bipartisan piece of legislation that this country needs right now. \nOur country needs anything that is going to create jobs and not add to \nthe deficit.\n  I yield the floor and I reserve the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I yield 10 minutes of our time to Senator Klobuchar.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, as the Senator from Nevada was \ndiscussing, all of us were home in the last month. I heard a lot about \nhealth care and I know we will be having an extensive debate and doing \nsome very important work in this area. I heard a lot about the economy.\n  Well, this bill is about an industry that one out of every eight \nAmericans is employed in--one out of every eight Americans. And if \nthere is something we know we can do, which we know we can do in this \nbill to help promote more jobs in this country without costing \ntaxpayers any money, this is the time to do it.\n  I first thank Senator Dorgan from North Dakota for his tireless work \nfor years on this bill. I was listening as Senator Ensign went through \nall of the wonders of Nevada. And we all know there is some great \ntourism there. But he failed to mention Teddy Roosevelt Park in North \nDakota, a place I have been visited myself. And, of course, I hope many \npeople have come to the Mall of America in Minnesota as well as a lot \nof our beautiful forests and lakes.\n  Every State has something to be proud of when it comes to travel. \nToday we have the opportunity to help this industry with the Travel \nPromotion Act. We should not let it go to waste. As was mentioned, I am \nthe Chair of the Commerce Subcommittee that deals with tourism. But I \nalso come from a State that values common sense. And supporting \nlegislation that will create jobs, generate spending, and reduce the \ndeficit, all at no cost to the taxpayer, is the definition of common \nsense.\n  Look at the numbers. This bill is expected to bring in 1.6 million \nnew international visitors each year--1.6 million. And you know how \nmuch they spend? They spend $4,500, on average, when they come here. \nYou can do the math: some 1.6 million new visitors times $4,500 every \nsingle year in this country. In fact, some economists expect the bill \nto generate $4 billion in new spending and $321 million in new Federal \ntax revenue.\n  It is estimated to create 40,000 new jobs. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates that this bill will reduce the budget deficit by $425 \nmillion over the next 10 years. Remember those numbers: $4,500 per \nperson for every new visitor; 1.6 million new people every year coming \nto our country; $4 billion in new spending, 40,000 new jobs. Costs to \nthe taxpayer: zero.\n  During these tough economic times, how could we not pass this bill \nright now when we know it would do so much good? This past summer I \nvisited, along with my family, many areas in our State and we did \ntourism hearings and various events around this bill.\n  In Northern Minnesota, I will be honest, at first I thought: Well, \nthey want tourism, it is a big industry in our State, but do they care \nabout this bill. That is when I found out that they do care about this \nbill. Because so many visitors traditionally have come down from \nCanada. And some of the barriers in getting the visas processed, and \nthe barriers at the border have affected tourism up in northern \nMinnesota, in places such as Grand Marais and International Falls, and \nBemidji, and the Brainerd Lakes area, home of the statue of Paul Bunyan \nand Babe the Blue Ox.\n  Minnesota shares this border with Canada. I was very surprised at how \nmuch interest there was in getting this bill passed. They understand \nthat we want to promote our country internationally, like other \ncountries which Senator Dorgan and Senator Ensign have pointed out have \ndone for so long. But they also want to make it easier to process these \nvisas.\n  As you know, this problem started way before the economy started \nhaving\n\n[[Page S9121]]\n\ntrouble. It occurred after 9/11 where, for very good reasons, there \nwere some tighter visa requirements put in place. The problem is, we \nhave gotten so behind that a lot of people who are living in, say, \nFrance think: Well, am I going to go to America where it is maybe going \nto take months to process my visa? Maybe I will go over to England or \nmaybe I will go to Japan. And so we need to speed up that process.\n  We know that tourism creates good jobs that cannot be outsourced. It \nincreases sales for local businesses and it brings in tax revenue for \nlocal and State economies. One of my favorite examples is Duluth. It is \nnot Las Vegas but listen to this story. Duluth is a port city that was \nhit hard by recessions of the 1970s and the early 1980s.\n  My dad is from northern Minnesota. We would go up there a lot. I \ncould see how much that community was hurting during that time. At one \npoint it was so bad that they put a famous billboard on the edge of \ntown that said: Will the last one out please turn off the lights.\n  Well, the lights are still on in Duluth; they are as bright as ever. \nA lot has to do with the promotion of tourism. The city has transformed \nitself on the beautiful shores of Lake Superior into a popular tourist \ndestination, welcoming nearly 4 million visitors each year with an \nannual economic impact of over $700 million.\n  We know that the tourism industry is feeling the effects of the \neconomic downturn. On top of that, as I mentioned, the United States \nhas seen its decline in the tourism industry in the past decade. As we \nsee here, the U.S. share of the world travel market has decreased by \nnearly 20 percent, costing us hundreds of thousands of jobs and \nbillions of dollars in revenue.\n  When a traveler decides to go somewhere else besides the United \nStates, there is a ripple effect throughout our economy. You think \nabout the hotels, of course; you think about the airlines. But you know \nwho else you should be thinking about? You should be thinking about \nthat person who is working making beds in the hotel or the waitress who \nis working in the restaurant where people would stop by on their drive \nor you think about the florist who is getting those flowers ready for \nthe business conference. These are all jobs, those are all jobs in this \neconomy.\n  Last year nearly 200,000 travel-related jobs were lost, and the \nCommerce Department predicts that we will lose another 247,000 jobs \nthis year. We can do something about this. We can bring in more \ntravelers, we can create more jobs, and we can boost our economy. That \nis why we need to pass the Travel Promotion Act.\n  First, this bill will create the Corporation for Travel Promotion, a \npublic-private partnership to promote the United States as an \ninternational travel destination, and finally establish a coordinated \nnational tourism program.\n  Senator Dorgan has some amazing blowups of some of the work that you \nhave seen in other countries. Just look. Indonesia has its own tourism \nprogram. The Bahamas entice people to go there; Scotland, Taiwan, South \nKorea; Australia with their kangaroo. What do we have right now? \nNothing. Individual cities are going out there, places such as \nNew York, places such as Las Vegas. It is not so easy for some small \nresorts in Minnesota or North Dakota or Vermont or New Hampshire to do \nthat.\n\n  But this is the chance where we can actually promote our country \ninternationally. And we are in major competition for international \ntravel, but we are not competing. In 2005, Greece spent more than $150 \nmillion on travel promotion; France spent $63 million. That is what we \nare up against. It is time for the United States to catch up to the \nrest of the world. It is time for us to play on an even playing field.\n  Second, the bill will establish the Office of Travel Promotion in the \nDepartment of Commerce to work with the Corporation for Travel \nPromotion and the Secretaries of State and Homeland Security to make \nsure that international visitors are processed efficiently. It is time \nto cut through the redtape so we can get the people who are going to \nthese countries to come to our country.\n  We have always been a country that has opened our arms to people who \nwant to come and visit. We have been proud of that, because we know \nthat it does not only have an economic benefit, it has also a \ndiplomatic benefit. People who visit the United States are 74 percent \nmore likely to have a favorable opinion of our country than those who \nhave not visited.\n  As we enter a new era in our international relations, travel can play \nan important role in building bridges between Americans and people from \nacross the globe.\n  Finally, as I mentioned earlier, this legislation will not cost \ntaxpayers a dime. I say to Senator Dorgan, it is a very good way to \nbegin this session, to begin it by looking at something that is paid \nfor by combination of private sector contributions and a small fee on \ninternational travelers, non-U.S. taxpayers, who are entering the \nUnited States. This is commonsense legislation.\n  When you think about the positive ripple effect that will happen as \nmore international visitors visit our country, it will increase sales \nfor businesses ranging from airlines to hotels, to those little flower \nshops. It will increase revenues in our local economy, and it will \nincrease jobs.\n  The United States is home to some of the world's wonders. And the \nTravel Promotion Act will give us the tools we need to promote the \nUnited States as a premiere travel destination.\n  As Chair of the Commerce Subcommittee that includes tourism, I have \nseen how important tourism is to communities, both small and large \nacross our country. We have the opportunity to boost travel and boost \nour economy. We cannot let that go to waste.\n  I am glad we are debating this bill today. I am looking forward to \nthis vote and the days that we have here to focus on this. But I urge \nmy colleagues to support this. They have been home. They know people \nare crying out for jobs. They know this is something at no cost to the \ntaxpayers, bipartisan support, which will help to get us there. Let's \nget this done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. How much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 8 minutes, 15 seconds.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, first, let me thank Senator Klobuchar for \nher work, and Senator Ensign. I think they have said what needs to be \nsaid.\n  If 48 million more people are now traveling internationally, foreign \ntravelers moving around the world, 48 million more, but 600,000 fewer \nare traveling in the United States as foreign travelers, then something \nis wrong and we need to fix it.\n  I want to market this country to foreign travelers, to say: Come to \nall of America. Yes, come to see the Statue of Liberty, and come to see \nNew York City and its vibrancy, and the Empire State Building, and Las \nVegas, and Universal Studios in Los Angeles, and the Golden Gate \nBridge. And in my State, the Pembina Gorge, the Red River Valley, and \nthe Badlands\n  I would love to have foreign tourists come to experience the history \nand the culture the values of all of our country. I have told the story \nbefore on the floor of the Senate about Theodore Roosevelt. Theodore \nRoosevelt was in his home in New York when on the same day, on \ndifferent floors of his home, his mother died and his wife died. In his \ndiary for that day, there is a big mark. It is just an X for that day. \nHe lost both his wife and his mother. Same day, different floors of his \nhouse.\n  A broken spirit, he went to what was then North Dakota and began to \nranch in the Badlands of North Dakota, in what is now the Theodore \nRoosevelt National Park.\n  I would love to encourage foreign tourists to come to the heartland \nof America, the northern Great Plains, and see what restored the spirit \nof Theodore Roosevelt. What a great way to understand and see the \nhistory and the culture and values of this country. Isn't it \ninteresting and alarming that 48 million more people are traveling \naround the world as foreign tourists and 600,000 fewer are traveling in \nthe United States? The United States, which should be the premier \ndestination for travel of anywhere on this Earth, and yet we have \n633,000 fewer foreign travelers than we had 9 years ago. There is \nsomething not connected here. We propose to connect it with something \nthat is bipartisan, something that doesn't cost money but\n\n[[Page S9122]]\n\nsomething that reduces the Federal budget deficit, something that \ncreates jobs when we have lost so many, to be able to do that working \ntogether, to say: Here is something on which we can agree. Here is \nsomething we think would boost America's economic strength, here is \nsomething we believe would contribute to building new jobs, and, most \nimportantly for me, here is something that when people come to our \ncountry and leave, it will allow them to leave America with a positive \nimpression about what this country is, who the American people are, \nwhat they believe, what they practice. This is a remarkable place. To \ncome here and then leave here after having visited America is to \nexperience one of the great travel opportunities on this planet.\n  When we look at a problem and see that something is not working \nright, the question is, How do we fix it? I have said so often before, \nbut I will say it again--because I know we have had some discussion \ntoday in opposition to this that I think mischaracterizes it--Mark \nTwain, when asked if he would engage in a debate, said: Of course, as \nlong as I can take the negative side.\n  They said: We haven't even told you the subject.\n  He said: It doesn't matter. The negative side will take no \npreparation at all.\n  So it is with legislation. It is so much easier with no preparation \nto come and say: I am opposed to this; I don't support this; this won't \nwork. The fact is, this is a problem that hurts this country. Losing \nour share of international tourism at a time when more people are \ntraveling around the world, finding fewer people traveling to our \ncountry, that is a problem. We can fix it in a way that doesn't spend \nmore, doesn't increase the Federal budget deficit, but attracts more \npeople to this country and creates more jobs. What a remarkable piece \nof legislation that is a good investment in the future.\n  We have a lot to be proud of in this country, all of us. We take it \nfor granted every day because we wake up in this country, but, boy, do \nwe have a lot to be proud of. We want to show it off to foreign \nvisitors.\n  Since 9/11, I understand there has been a notion somehow that it is \nharder to come to America. It is more hassle. What we want to say is: \nThat is done. It is not a hassle. We invite you to come here. Come here \nand be a part of our experience.\n  Here is what we see in the Sidney Morning Herald: ``Coming to America \nIsn't Easy''; in the Guardian, United Kingdom: ``America--more hassle \nthan it's worth?''; the Sunday Times of London: ``Travel to America? No \nthanks.'' These are all 2008 headlines. We want to say: This country \nhas a welcome mat out for you. Come here. Experience what we have to \nexperience in America. We invite you to be a part of our experience. We \nwant you to come to the United States when you are considering \ntraveling internationally.\n  That is what this legislation is about. This is not complicated. It \nis the right thing to do. It is the reason there are so many Democrats \nand Republicans who have joined together in something we think will \nstrengthen the country.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I wish to make a couple other points \nbefore the vote.\n  Some folks have questioned why we need the Travel Promotion Act. They \nsay that tourism will take care of itself and that this is not a role \nfor the Federal Government. One of the reasons I remember for years why \nI wanted to go to Australia was because they advertised in the United \nStates. The advertisements talked about the various places, whether it \nwas the Great Barrier Reef, some of the sites of Sydney, Australia, or \nthe gorgeous beaches they have. The United States and our resources \nhere are so vast for people to come and see, I think to not tell folks \nof the world what we have here or to remind them of what we have is a \ndisservice to our country. If we remind them, whether by brochures, \ninternet advertising, television advertising, or whatever the \nadvertising media we choose, we will attract people here.\n  There is no question that a lot of folks would love to visit the \nUnited States. It may just take a little spark to get them to realize \nthat is someplace they want to go. I have thought about that. Hey, \nlet's take the kids. Let's go to America. Let's see some of the \nincredible sites. We have heard about the Grand Canyon. We have heard \nabout some of the national parks. Let's go to Washington, DC, and see \nthe Capitol, that beacon of democracy throughout the world. Let's \nremind folks of the types of things we have here in New York City.\n  When people come here, not only will they bring their money and \ncreate jobs, but I believe, very importantly, people will come away \nfrom America with a different attitude about our country. They will \ncome away talking about an America that is different than what they get \ntold about in their news media. If you are in Europe and other places, \ntheir news media is not necessarily kind to the United States. When \npeople come here and meet Americans, they see our places that we have \nand learn some of the history of our country. They come away with a \ndifferent attitude. That is important today when America needs friends \nin the world. I believe this legislation is important not only for the \njobs it will create but for America's image in the world. This \nlegislation really is needed at this point.\n  In 1996, we eliminated a Federal program that was basically about \npromoting travel to the United States. We have had private programs and \nwe have had public programs. None of them worked very well on their \nown--privately, because they couldn't get the funding necessary; on a \npublic side, it was because the government doesn't run those things \nvery well.\n  This is a public-private partnership that I believe can work. That is \nthe reason I support this. It is the reason I think a public-private \npartnership, where some of the public funding is matched with private \nexpertise, can bring more tourists to the United States.\n  Senator Klobuchar mentioned that 1.6 to 1.8 million new visitors will \ncome to the United States because of this legislation. That creates \nmany jobs. That brings a lot of revenue. That also creates a lot more \npeople who have visited here and will go back to their countries and \ntalk positively about the United States. I believe in our country, and \nI believe in the goodness of our country. When people are exposed to \nthat goodness, I believe they will go home and talk about the goodness \nof the country and the goodness of the people in the United States.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I should also mention that Senator Reid, along with \nSenator Ensign, has played a significant role in working on this \nlegislation. That is very important to mention. Obviously, both come \nfrom a State that relies a great deal on tourism. My State's tourism \nindustry is second in the State. It plays a very large role in every \nState, even though most of us don't have a traditional tourist \ndestination city like Las Vegas, for example.\n  Early on Senators talked about how companies advertise because \nadvertising works. It is the case that companies advertise only on \nbehalf of their company. I just described circumstances of aggressive \nefforts for countries to advertise on behalf of their countries saying: \nCome to Italy, experience what Italy has to offer. Come to France. Come \nto India. The countries are very aggressive in saying: If you are \nthinking of traveling around this planet, take a look at this; come to \nsee the Eiffel Tower.\n  Our country is not doing that. We are not involved in trying to reach \nout to people to say: You are welcome in this country. We have so much \nto offer, so much for you to see. We want you to come here and \nexperience it, to understand it.\n  This legislation creates a public-private partnership in which our \ncountry will advertise to the world and say: Come to America. Isn't \nthat the case with respect to advertising of companies versus \ncountries?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. My friend is correct. It is absolutely the case. It has \nbeen proven time and time again. These countries wouldn't continue to \nspend the money if it wasn't working. Certainly, companies wouldn't \ncontinue to spend the money if it wasn't working to bring more people, \nfor instance, to Las\n\n[[Page S9123]]\n\nVegas. The individual companies, as well as the Convention and Visitors \nAuthority, spend a lot of money to bring people to Las Vegas. Most \nAmericans have heard the slogans: What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. \nThat became a very famous slogan. But it is the sights, the sounds, the \nsmells, everything together that attracts people to come.\n  If tourists come to the Grand Canyon, most people will also go to \nCalifornia, Las Vegas, New York City or someplace else. When folks come \nfrom overseas, they usually don't just visit one place, they visit \nseveral places. If we attract people using some of the iconic places we \nhave in the United States, other places around the country will \nbenefit. That is why a national advertising campaign is very important \nfor the country.\n  Mr. DORGAN. If the Senator will yield further, the fact is, we have \nlost a lot of jobs in the deepest recession since the Great Depression. \nAll of us are striving to find ways to put people back to work. There \nis not going to be some Big Bang theory by which everyone goes back to \nwork. We can do this incrementally. We need manufacturing to be \nrestored. We need tourism, a significant job creator. A lot of people \ndon't understand that it is not some big hotel that benefits from \ntourism. In most cases, it is a small business someplace struggling to \nmake a living. It is a lot of small businesses, rental car companies, \nand so on. That is why we have such faith that if we do what we say we \ncan do in this legislation, we will put a lot of people back to work.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Yes.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. As Senator Dorgan was discussing, it seems to me that \nthe people don't always think about the ripple effect. I know Nevada \nhas suffered because of some of the economic downturn with tourism. \nCould the Senator talk a little bit about what he has seen in terms of \nother businesses that have lost business when we don't promote tourism \nthe way we are supposed to? I think that is something people don't \nthink about. They think about the big airlines, the big hotels, but \nthey don't think about the ripple effect on some of the other jobs that \nmatter.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Tourism is such a huge part of our economy today. For \ninstance, somebody who cleans hotel rooms is out of a job, they don't \nhave that money to go down to a fast-food restaurant or go to a store \nto buy clothes. They have to tighten their belts. Many people also work \nfor tips.\n  Those tips have gone down, that ripple effect has happened through \nthe American economy today. Nevada has felt it probably more than any \nother.\n  But there is no question of the ripple effect. It affects \nrestaurants. I am a veterinarian; it affects the veterinary business. \nIt affects dentists. It affects the construction industry. It is almost \nlike a negative ripple effect when those jobs are being lost in the \ntourism industry. What we are trying to with this legislation is to \ncreate a positive ripple effect where we actually create tourism jobs \nthat will then help to create other jobs in other sectors. So I think \nthat is a great question on the ripple effect with the tourism \nindustry.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, let me mention again the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce has sent out a letter today in strong support of this \nlegislation precisely because of the job-creating nature of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I guess all time \nhas expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, the motion to proceed to the motion to \nreconsider the vote by which cloture was not invoked on amendment No. \n1347 is agreed to, the motion to reconsider is agreed to, and the \nSenate will vote on the motion to invoke cloture, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close the debate on the Dorgan \n     amendment, No. 1347, to S. 1023, the Travel Promotion Act of \n     2009.\n         Harry Reid, Byron L.

Mr. President, our colleague Frank Lautenberg has given so \nmuch to his country. Frank's parents settled as poor immigrants from \nEastern Europe. If there were ever an example of someone who has come \nfrom the most basic circumstances to a man of wealth, a man of stature, \nit is Frank Lautenberg. He has done it all. He fought bravely in World \nWar II, put himself through Columbia University with the GI Bill of \nRights, after having earned that with his service to our country in \nWorld War II.\n  As I have mentioned, he had great success in business. He has a mind \nthat is very insightful, and he sees the big picture. He was one of the \nfirst to succeed in a business that now a lot of people are succeeding \nin, but he was one of the first there.\n  After having done so well in the great free enterprise system, he \ndecided to turn to public service, and he was elected by the State of \nNew Jersey to the U.S. Senate. He left the Senate in 2000 but came back \nwhen the State asked him to serve again. We needed Frank Lautenberg. He \ncame back, and he has served with such remarkable stature since then.\n  When I first came to the Senate, I had the good fortune to serve with \nhim on the Environment and Public Works Committee. His love of the \nmatters within the jurisdiction of that committee is significant. He \nlegislates with his heart, but it is always backed up with his \nbrilliant mind. He has been chairman of the Budget Committee.\n  Just weeks ago, he set the record for casting the most votes by any \nU.S. Senator in the history of the State of New Jersey. Like any great \nlegislator, Senator Lautenberg is best understood not by the number of \ntimes he has said ``yea'' or ``nay'' but what those laws say about his \ncommitment to the people of New Jersey and all Americans.\n  He was a leader in establishing the threshold of drunk driving, \nsaving\n\n[[Page S9124]]\n\ncountless lives. His work has helped to clean up toxic sites in \ncommunities across his State and our country. It has kept our drinking \nwater clean and made our buildings more energy efficient.\n  The thing that I personally will always look at Frank Lautenberg for \nhaving done is taking care of one of my children. One of my boys was \nallergic to tobacco smoke. When we would fly across the country, they \nhad those artificial barriers where you could not smoke past a line. \nBut it didn't matter because the smoke went everywhere. On every trip, \nmy boy was miserable; it made him sick. Because of Frank Lautenberg, \nmillions of Americans are now protected from secondhand smoke. He wrote \nthe law banning smoking on airplanes.\n  In addition to his being such a good friend, I commend and applaud \nthe people of New Jersey for sending this good man to the Senate. He is \nsomeone who is deserving of all the accolades being given to him. I am \nproud to have known him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Tester). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I wish to say briefly that we are \nincredibly proud in New Jersey that Frank Lautenberg is our Senator. It \nis not just the number of votes he cast, it is what he has stood up \nfor. Senator Lautenberg has been known as standing up for New Jerseyans \nfirst, but he has also stood up for the Nation, millions of people, \nsince he passed the ban on smoking on airlines and what he has done \nwith Superfund sites and what he has done on domestic violence abusers, \nwho can no longer possess a gun, which means people are alive today as \na result of Senator Lautenberg's work in New Jersey and across the \nNation. The landmark legislation he has participated in over his career \nin the Senate is exemplary.\n  I wanted to join in the tribute because it is not just his number of \nvotes, it is the type of effect he has had on the lives of people in \nNew Jersey and across the country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his \nkind remarks and for the leadership he has provided for all of us. I \nnever dreamed I would be here this long. I had 30 years in business \nbefore I got to this place.\n  Harry Reid mentioned twice something about wealth. The wealth I \nacquired by being in this place--by being able to say to my country \nthat I have had a chance to give back for the wonderfully good fortune \nthat has occurred in the lives of myself, my children, my parents--if \nthey could see this. My mother was critical when I ran for the Senate. \nShe expressed a little disappointment. I said, ``Mom, how can that \nbe?'' She said, ``Because I thought you would be running for \nPresident.'' In any event, my dad would not have believed it, but he \nwould have encouraged it nevertheless.\n  I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for the patience \nsometimes that I exhaust on my friends, and I thank particularly my \nfriend and colleague, Bob Menendez, with whom I had the pleasure of \nserving while he was in leadership in the House, and especially since \nhe has been here in the Senate, with the important responsibilities we \nhave.\n  It is a good day, and I am glad to be back here to get on with the \npeople's business. I thank you all for your patience and friendship, \nand particularly our majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am very grateful we have moved forward on \na very important bill for the country--the Travel Promotion Act. I \ncommend and applaud Senator Dorgan for his good work on the \nlegislation. It is extremely important. He was a real advocate, as he \nis on issues which he sinks his teeth into.\n  Travel and tourism generate $1 trillion in the economy every year. \nWhether it is the State of Minnesota, Nevada--you can pick any of the \nStates--tourism is the No. 1, 2, or 3 most important driving economic \nfactor in the States. This year, tourism will create 40,000 new jobs. \nThe bill will also cut the deficit by $425 million over the next 10 \nyears. That is significant. We would be taking the strategies that have \nmade Las Vegas such a success and bringing them to our entire Nation's \ntourism industry.\n  Nevada's tourism has been hit hard by the slowing worldwide economy, \nand when tourism in Nevada hurts, the entire State suffers. Hard-\nworking people have lost their jobs. The State's budget has taken a \nmajor hit. Because that budget is largely funded by tourism, funding \nfor vital programs in our State is at risk.\n  Nevada is not alone. Tourism is one of the top industries in every \nState. That is why this bill is so important. It is an opportunity to \nnot only give American tourism a boost, but it is one of the many ways \nwe are working to create jobs and help our economy rebuild.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, over the last few months, I have stood in \nthe Chamber and read letters sent to me by Ohioans from all over my \nState, stories explaining how health insurance costs are threatening \nthe economic stability of middle-class families. These stories reflect \nthe many challenges facing our Nation's middle class and facing my \nState's workers.\n  The fight for health insurance reform is part of a larger effort to \nput our Nation on a new, progressive path that invests in our labor \nforce, honors our industrial and manufacturing traditions, and helps \nrebuild our middle class.\n  Yesterday, I joined President Obama in Cincinnati at the largest \nLabor Day picnic in the country to honor the achievement and \ncontribution of the American worker. Labor Day is an important American \ntradition that also recognizes the courage of generations of workers \nand activists who demanded a standard of living deserving of all \nAmericans.\n  In Ohio, the tradition of Labor Day began in 1890, when Cleveland's \nfirst African-American lawyer and Ohio's first African-American State \nsenator, John Patterson Green, introduced ``Labor Day in Ohio'' to \ncelebrate the contribution of workers. The bill passed the general \nassembly on April 28, 1890, 4 years before Congress declared Labor Day \na national holiday. It is easy to surmise that Labor Day began in Ohio. \nAs the ``father of Labor Day in Ohio,'' John Patterson Green, who \nbefriended captains of industry, civil rights pioneers, and sitting \nPresidents alike, exemplifies how simple recognition can give powerful \nmeaning to working men and women.\n  Yesterday, in Cincinnati, during the Nation's largest Labor Day \npicnic, the President spoke to thousands of workers gathered in support \nof policies that put American workers, and business, first. The \nPresident reminded us that:\n\n       Much of what we take for granted--the 40-hour work week, \n     the minimum wage, health insurance, paid leave, pensions, \n     Social Security, Medicare--all bear the union label. So even \n     if you're not a union member, every American owes something \n     to America's labor movement.\n\n  At Labor Day events across the State, workers and their families, \nfriends, and neighbors gathered together, regardless of profession--\nelectricians, communications workers, steelworkers, teachers, \ntruckdrivers, and laborers--to celebrate all working men and women. \nThat is what Labor Day is. The celebrations brought together the \nfamilies of union brothers and sisters who fight for each other.\n  That is what the labor movement is about--to recognize and speak out \nfor health care that works for workers. That is why this Labor Day is \never more meaningful.\n\n[[Page S9125]]\n\n  I recently--before Labor Day--visited Open M, a free health clinic in \nAkron, where I met Christine, who runs a small gift basket delivery \nbusiness by herself but cannot afford health insurance. Fourteen years \nago, while working, Christine was seriously injured in a car accident, \nleaving her with multiple knee surgeries, foot and back problems, and a \ncane to help her walk. She had to pay these expenses out of her pocket, \ndraining her savings and compromising her economic security.\n  Last week, I spoke at the Center for Working Class Studies at \nYoungstown State University, one of the Nation's first and certainly \none of the Nation's premier academic programs devoted to the many \nphases of the American worker--the factory worker in Lordstown or the \nhome care nurse in Niles, the teacher in Youngstown or the truckdriver \nin Boardman. The center tells the story of working-class communities to \na nation that it helped build.\n  Ohioans from across the Mahoning Valley showed up and listened while \nothers told the story of working-class families struggling with the \ncrushing costs of health care.\n  John from Champion, OH, described how his sick nephew lacks health \ninsurance and cannot afford the neurologist he is supposed to see. He \nsaid that if health reform doesn't pass soon, his nephew probably won't \nlive long enough to receive the care he so desperately needs.\n  Michelle from Youngstown asked the question at the root of all of the \nstruggles that define the progressive labor movement. In her early \nthirties, she is one of the nearly 50 million Americans who are \nuninsured. She asked:\n\n       Isn't health reform a moral issue, where people in need and \n     deserve care should have access to it?\n\n  The question of morality--whether coal miners' lives should be \nprotected or food safety should be essential or the right to fair wages \nshould be absolute--has long defined the labor movement's progressive \nmission.\n  The passing of Senator Kennedy, a champion of the American worker, \nreminds all of us what government can, and should, do on behalf of \nAmerican workers.\n  The history of our Nation shows that our workers helped transition \nour Nation from one industry to the next, driving innovation and \ncreating economic prosperity for workers, communities, and industries, \ncreating the middle class.\n  The history of our Nation shows that those who worked hard and played \nby the rules had something to show for it--a secure and good-paying job \nthat supported their family and gave meaning to their community.\n  But today the American worker is confronted with economic challenges \nthat threaten to undermine our economic security. Workers from Lorain \nto Wilmington, from Xenia to Zanesville, deserve a government that does \nmore and does better for them.\n  Today President Obama and many in Congress are working to ensure \nworkers be justly rewarded for their labor. As Ohioans understand, \nmanufacturing recognizes the value of an honest day's pay for an honest \nday's work. We know that manufacturing is a ticket to the middle class. \nWe know a strong middle class makes a stronger nation. That is why \nAmericans deserve a manufacturing policy that works for them.\n  Manufacturing accounts for more than 10 percent of our entire economy \nand nearly three-fourths of our Nation's industrial research and \ndevelopment. Manufacturing jobs pay 20 percent more on average than \nservice jobs. For every massive auto plant you see driving from east to \nwest along the Ohio Turnpike, from Youngstown past Toledo, there are \ndozens of manufacturers making component parts and services for \nemerging industries in clean energy, aerospace, and biotechnology.\n  I applaud the administration's decision to tap Ron Bloom to direct a \nnational strategy which will help manufacturers transition to the 21st \ncentury economy. It is not an easy task. It is one that requires hard \nwork and progressive vision.\n  But in no uncertain terms, our Nation must establish a national \npolicy to once again invest in our most important American asset--the \nAmerican worker.\n  In the Economic Policy Subcommittee that I chair, we have looked at \nthe elements of a national manufacturing strategy--investing in \ninnovation, strengthening our component parts supply line, connecting \nworkers with jobs in emerging industries, improving assistance for \ndistressed communities, and revamping how our Nation does trade.\n  Done right, we can reinvest in our workers' capacity to build the \nnext generation of technologies and rebuild our next generation of \nmiddle-class families.\n  Done right, we can create new industry, and we can create good-paying \njobs and secure jobs.\n  Done right, we can ensure the future of our Nation's global economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  Let us honor the story of the American worker who built this country, \nwho sustains our middle class by reinvesting in them. Labor Day is a \ntime to honor a movement that respects the dignity of work and reflects \nthe decency and dedication of our workers.\n  This year's Labor Day comes at a historic time in the progressive \nlabor movement's ongoing march toward economic security and a new era \nof productivity for our Nation.\n  Along with a national manufacturing policy, health insurance reform \nmust be part of this Nation's legacy of giving meaning to workers and \ngiving hope to the middle class.\n  The vote on health insurance reform will be, next to my vote in \nopposition to the Iraq war 6 years ago as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives, the most important vote I cast in this Chamber. I hope \nat this time next year I will be reading the stories of Ohio workers \nwho live with the health care they deserve and the dignity they have \nearned.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to call the attention of the Senate \nto the 130th anniversary of Reno High School. Located in Washoe County, \nNV, Reno High School is the first and oldest high school in the city.\n  Until 1879, all Reno students went to school in a one-room building. \nThat year they moved into a building officially named Central School, \nwhich gave high school-aged students their own floors. Though the \nschool accommodated students from elementary through high school, it \nwas often referred to as Reno High School throughout the community. In \n1912, Reno's high school students moved into their own building and \nthis school was properly dedicated as Reno High School.\n  I would like to take a moment to celebrate and cherish the rich \nhistory of Reno High School. It serves as a wonderful example of how a \nschool can succeed through the hard work of its community members. Over \nthe course of its history, Reno High School has educated thousands of \nbright individuals, cultivating their talent, and providing them with a \nnurturing environment in which to grow.\n  Notable alumni include U.S. Treasury Secretary Eva Adams, Pulitzer \nPrize winners Ann Telnaes and Warren LeRude, and Nevada State senator \nBill Raggio. Its ranks also include a long list of local leaders who \nhave made the Reno High School Alumni Association a robust \norganization, which now boasts the beautiful Link Piazzo Alumni Center \non campus. This freestanding building, completed in 2000, houses \nmemorabilia dating back to Reno's earliest academic beginnings.\n  This school year begins by bringing students and alumni together in \nnumerous events acknowledging the\n\n[[Page S9126]]\n\nschool's heritage. Festivities will honor the school's legacy by \nlooking at the past, the present, and the great memories in between. I \nam confident that Reno High School will continue to be a beacon of \nacademic excellence in the State of Nevada, as it has been during the \nlast 130 years.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in offering our heartfelt \ncongratulations to the faculty, staff, students, families, and proud \nalumni of Reno High School. The leadership, dedication, and enthusiasm \nyou possess and share with the community help continue the school's \nlegacy and make Nevada a better place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9126-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    NOMINATION OF CARMEN R.

KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I rise to bid farewell to Ted \nKennedy, a man who spent so many hours on this floor. It was here that \nhe engaged in the cause that shaped his life, and now shapes our \nmemories his commitment to everyday people in their pursuit of the \nAmerican dream.\n  It is hard for me, as it is for all my colleagues, to imagine this \nplace without Ted Kennedy. To serve here with him was a great honor. At \nthe age of 14, I was already wearing a Ted Kennedy for President \nbutton. Then when I arrived here, this man, this lion of the Senate, \nwas so friendly and funny and generous. He helped to teach me the ropes \nin the Senate, and I felt so fortunate to know him as a person, not \njust to admire him from afar.\n  He and his family are one of the reasons I stand here today. His work \nin the Senate, his brother John's call for a new generation to serve \ntheir country, and his brother Bobby's call for social justice all \nthese inspired me to run for office to in some way serve my country as \nSenator Kennedy and his family had. One of the greatest honors of my \nlife was winning the Profiles in Courage Award with Senator McCain, and \nbeing recognized by members of the Kennedy family for our work on \ncampaign finance reform.\n  Having Senator Kennedy there that day was part of what made that such \nan honor. There was no one else like him; he was truly one of a kind. \nWho else could be such a fierce advocate, and at the same time such a \nskilled negotiator? Who else could engage in such heated debate, but \nstill count so many of us, on both sides of the aisle, as devoted \nfriends? No one but Ted Kennedy could do that.\n  His qualities were legendary he was the hardest worker, he was the \nquickest debater, and he was the guy who lit up a room with his warmth \nand wit. It was all there in one extraordinary man, who became one of \nthe greatest United States Senators in our Nation's history. Even \nputting aside Ted's legendary personal qualities, his legislative \nrecord speaks volumes about how effective he was. It is a record for \nthe ages, with hundreds of his legislative efforts becoming law.\n  His achievements in civil rights, education, health care, and \nworkers' rights speak to the absolute commitment he had to the people \nhe saw who struggled to live the American dream; the dedicated people \nwho are the lifeblood of this country, but who struggle--especially in \ntimes like these--when they lose their job, or their health insurance \nor their home. In Ted Kennedy, those Americans found their champion, \nand we thank him for everything he achieved on their behalf.\n  I admired so many things Ted Kennedy did, but most of all I was \ninspired by his work on civil rights. His commitment, through his 47 \nyears in the Senate, to the cause of equality for every American, was \nperhaps his greatest achievement of all. In his very first speech on \nthe Senate floor, just 4 months after his brother John's assassination, \nhe called for the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. He played a \nkey role in the Voting Rights Act of 1965, was the chief sponsor of the \nVoting Rights Amendments Act of 1982, and just a few years ago was a \nkey cosponsor of the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, and Coretta Scott \nKing Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006. He \nwas one of the chief cosponsors of the Americans with Disabilities Act \nof 1990, the chief sponsor of the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988, \nand a key proponent of theCivil Rights Act of 1991. And the list goes \non, Mr. President. There simply is no doubt that he was the most \nimportant legislative architect of the expansion of civil rights in the \nlast half century. I am committed to helping to continue that work here \nin the Senate in his memory.\n  Ted was also someone who suffered many personal tragedies, but he \nbore those burdens with a quiet dignity that came from his tremendous \ninner strength. You couldn't know him without being awed by that \nstrength, and sensing it whenever he entered the room, or when he took \nup an issue. When he spoke, his words echoed not just in this Chamber, \nbut across the country and around the world. This was a man who could \nchange the momentum on a bill or an issue just through his own personal \nwill. He was a powerful person determined to help the powerless in our \nsociety, and we loved him for it.\n  I think ``beloved'' is the best word to describe how we felt about \nhim here in the Senate, and how so many Americans felt about him around \nthe country. We are grateful that he lived to achieve so much, and to \ninspire so many.\n  And now we wish, as he did when he laid his brother Robert Kennedy to \nrest, that ``what he wished for others will someday come to pass for \nall the world.'' And now we pledge, as he did at the Democratic \nConvention in 1980, that ``the work goes on, the cause endures, the \nhope still lives and the dream shall never die. `` And now, as we \ngrieve his loss, we say goodbye to our friend, Senator Edward M. \nKennedy. We thank him for his lifetime of service to our country, and \nfor his profound commitment to the cause of justice here in the United \nStates and throughout the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9126-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9126-S9127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEMBERING ALLAN TESCHE\n\n Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I wish to commemorate the life of a \nvery special friend from my home State of Alaska, Allan Tesche.\n  Former Anchorage Assemblyman Allan Tesche passed away July 14, 2009, \nafter complications from heart surgery.\n  Allan Tesche was the embodiment of a true Alaskan and an incredible \npublic servant. While I was mayor of Anchorage, Allan served on the \nAssembly. During this time, I got to know Allan and his family well. He \nwas committed to the residents of Anchorage, and his dedication to \nmaking our city a better place was second to none. He and his wife Pam \nwere active members of the community and raised their two children in \nAnchorage.\n  On behalf of his family, many friends, and colleagues, I ask today we \nhonor Allan Tesche's memory. I ask his obituary, published July 26, \n2009, in the Anchorage Daily News, be printed in the Record.\n  The information follows:\n\n             [From the Anchorage Daily News, July 26, 2009]\n\n       Allan Edward Tesche, 60, died in Houston, Texas on July 14, \n     2009, from complications from heart surgery. A memorial \n     service will be at 2 p.m. Monday at Central Lutheran Church. \n     Allan was born Aug. 3, 1948, to Marilyn and Frederick \n     Rutledge Tesche in Los Alamos, N.M. He graduated with honors \n     from the University of California at Davis in 1970. In the \n     Peace Corps, he spent two years in El Salvador supporting \n     Community Development projects. Upon his return, he enrolled \n     in law school at the University of California at Davis, where \n     he was an honorary member of The Chicano Law Students \n     Association. In his second year he was recruited by the \n     Greater Anchorage Area Borough to serve a six-month \n     internship in the Anchorage Borough Attorney's Office; thus \n     began his long association with Alaska government. Allan was \n     invited by Mayor Jack Roderick to return after graduation as \n     a staff attorney. Allan's work on borough-city unification in \n     1975-76 led Mayor George Sullivan to elevate him to deputy \n     municipal attorney, a position he held until his appointment \n     to lead the Mat-Su Borough Legal Department in 1980. In 1982, \n     Allan returned to Anchorage\n\n[[Page S9127]]\n\n     to head the Department of Property & Facilities. In 1988, he \n     left city employment to join law firm Russell & Tesche, where \n     he practiced until retiring in 2006.\n       In 1978, Allan married Pamela Dunham. Together they raised \n     two children, operated the G Street B and went on family \n     adventures. After seeing the community work of friend Nick \n     Aguilar in San Diego, Pam supported Allan's plunge into local \n     politics. Allan served nine years on the Anchorage Assembly. \n     He championed many progressive policies and is credited with \n     the adoption of property tax relief, liquor and tobacco \n     control measures and urban beautification initiatives. Allan \n     was a member of Central Lutheran Church, where he mentored \n     neighborhood youths and served as Church Council president. \n     After leaving the Assembly, Allan helped launch municipal \n     consulting firm RMA Consulting Group and served as acting \n     city administrator for the City of Akutan. He worked for \n     Akutan until his death, and his efforts supporting new \n     developments in Akutan are an ongoing testimony.\n       Allan is survived by his wife, Pamela; son, Frederick; \n     daughter, Mary; brothers, Frederick and wife Sharon of \n     Saluda, N.C., Thomas and wife Kim of Covington, Ky., and \n     Daniel of Clovis, Calif.; sister, Caroline of Tampa, Fla.; \n     father and mother-in-law, Richard and Carrie Dunham of \n     Whidbey Island, Wash.; brothers- and sisters-in-law, Paul and \n     Kathleen Dunham of Fresno, Calif., Larry and Susan Goodman of \n     Seattle, Cynthia and Eric Olsen of Spokane, Wash., and Linda \n     Wesson of Clovis, Calif.; and by his nieces and \n     nephews.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9127-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING J. THOMAS CALHOON\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, today I wish to speak about a \nmember of our country's greatest generation, the generation of my \nparents who selflessly served our Nation during a time of great turmoil \nin the world. This generation made countless contributions to our \nsociety and continues to give unselfishly today. I offer my warmest \nwishes to one of them--Mr. J. Thomas Calhoon, of Hilliard, OH--on his \n84th birthday, on this Friday, the eighth anniversary of the attacks of \nSeptember 11. I want to thank him for the many sacrifices he has made \nand continues to make for our great country.\n  Born on September 11, 1925, in Wellsville, OH, Tom Calhoon was raised \nin East Liverpool, OH, and graduated from Grandview High School, class \nof 1943.\n  On December 15, 1943, Tom enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. While \nserving in Japan during World War II, Corporal Calhoon sustained \nextensive combat injuries in Okinawa in June of 1945, including the \nloss of his right leg and a bullet in his left arm that remains there \ntoday. He spent over 2 years in hospitals throughout the United States, \nincluding Philadelphia Hospital, where he met his wife, Sarah Mae \nShoemaker, who was a volunteer.\n  He survived his injuries, and on August 29, 1947, Tom and Sarah were \nmarried and went on to have four sons, Thomas, Samuel, Donald, and \nRobert, and a daughter, Sarah. All five are children any parent would \nbe proud of. Today, the Calhoon family has expanded to include seven \ngrandchildren and two great-grandchildren due later this fall.\n  During his time in the Marines, Cpl Tom Calhoon received two Purple \nHearts and was a rifleman and an expert with the bayonet. After being \ndischarged, he enrolled, in the fall of 1948, at the Ohio State \nUniversity, of which he and all five of his children are alumni. It was \nat the Ohio State University that I first met two of his sons, one of \nwhom is a close friend to this day.\n  Corporal Calhoon worked in public relations and advertising for 50 \nyears in Columbus, OH. In addition to this full-time career, he spent \ncountless hours of his time volunteering. As a member of the Lions \nClub, he received three national awards, including a Life Membership \nfrom the International Association of Lions Clubs Award in 1998 for 50 \nyears of Outstanding Dedicated Service.

Mr. President, today I honor a woman who has \ncontributed so much to the fabric of my home State of Idaho. Doris \nWallace, the manager of the Eastern Idaho State Fair in Blackfoot, ID, \nwill retire at the end of this month, following the completion of the \n2009 Eastern Idaho State Fair. That will mark her 26th year with one of \nIdaho's most well-known fairs. The eastern Idaho State Fair covers 16 \ncounties in eastern Idaho. Each county holds their individual county \nfairs with the blue ribbon winners advancing to competition at the \nEastern Idaho State Fair.\n  Doris is a hometown girl, born in Blackfoot and raised in Bingham \nCounty. She married Ray Wallace. Together they have three children: \nNicole, Stephanie, and Todd.\n  She began her career at the Eastern Idaho State Fair in 1983 when she \nbegan working as the office secretary. She was the ``front desk'' for \nthe fair, and her personality, patience and friendliness represented \nthe entire fair to those who entered her office to ask questions and \ncomplain about situations.\n  In 1987, Doris became the assistant manager, where she became the \ncenter of the fair operations. Her responsibilities included the \nexhibitor's handbook, all financial transactions, commercial and \nconcession vendors and coordinator for spring, summer, and fall events \ntaking place on the fairgrounds.\n  In 2000, Doris was promoted to fair manager by a five-member Fair \nBoard. As manager, Doris used her years of experience to enhance an \nalready-thriving annual event. She has encouraged participation of 4-H \nand Future Farmer of America projects and activities including the 4-H \ndog show, 4-H horse show, and 4-H livestock, canning, cooking and \nsewing demonstration projects. Future Farmers of America leave their \nclassrooms on Friday to spend the day on the fairgrounds to personally \nexperience and participate in judging competitions.\n  In 2002, she was able to plan the celebration of the 100th \nanniversary of the Eastern Idaho State Fair. She produced an \nextravaganza of historical and colorful memories, which have made the \nfair a family tradition for those living in eastern Idaho.\n  Doris has competently managed fair operations of the Eastern Idaho \nState Fair, which attracts 250,000 fairgoers over the 8-day fair, \nbeginning each year on Saturday proceeding Labor Day. Events include \ntraditional horse pulling, pari-mutuel horse racing, Indian relay \nraces, junior and adult rodeos, professional entertainers, petting zoos \nand educational exhibits. The traditional tractor pull, demolition \nderby, and extreme bike riders are all part of Doris's management \nresponsibilities as she has provided a fair of diverse attractions for \na fairgoing audience of diverse ages, backgrounds and interests.\n  As manager, Doris supervises six full-time employees and \napproximately 400 employees during the fair week, including ticket \ntakers, car parkers, custodial services, ground crews, and security.\n  Throughout her life and particularly during her career at the Eastern \nIdaho State Fair, Doris has contributed enormously, both privately and \nprofessionally, to the fair community, the city of Blackfoot, and all \nof eastern Idaho. Please join me in congratulating Doris Wallace on her \nyears of service at the Eastern Idaho State Fair and wishing her well \nin her pending retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9127-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2009, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on August 10, 2009, during the adjournment \nof the Senate, received a message from the House of Representatives \nannouncing that the Speaker had signed the following bill:\n\n       H.R. 3325.

A bill to prevent the proliferation of weapons of mass \ndestruction, to prepare for attacks using weapons of mass destruction, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Lieberman in \nintroducing the Weapons of Mass Destruction Prevention and Preparedness \nAct of 2009. This legislation would increase our Nation's protections \nagainst an attack using WMDs.\n  The bill implements many of the recommendations of the Commission on \nthe Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction Proliferation and \nTerrorism. Congress established that Commission in 2007 in legislation \nthat Senator Lieberman and I coauthored.\n  Heading the WMD Commission were former Senators Bob Graham and Jim \nTalent. Last December, the Commission produced a comprehensive report \non the WMD threats to our Nation and provided recommendations to \nprevent further proliferation and acts of terrorism using these deadly \nweapons. The Commission's ``World at Risk'' report warned that it is \n``more likely than not that a weapon of mass destruction will be used \nin a terrorist attack somewhere in the world by the end of 2013.''\n  The Commission's report is a call to action.\n  The Commission reinforces the sense of urgency that the Homeland \nSecurity Committee has felt during its many hearings on deadly threats \nto the American people--threats that include terrorists dispersing \nanthrax spores, detonating a nuclear device in a major city, or \nstriking with other weapons of mass destruction.\n  In the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Congress \ncreated the Department of Homeland Security, reformed our intelligence \nagencies, strengthened FEMA, increased grants for State and local first \nresponders, and enhanced security at our seaports and chemical \nfacilities. As the Commission observes, however, ``the terrorists have \nbeen active, too,'' and we must continue our efforts. Nuclear \nproliferation and advances in biotechnology give terrorists new methods\n\n[[Page S9136]]\n\nto carry out their avowed intention to commit mass murder.\n  The mental images of nuclear blasts and mushroom clouds are powerful \nand frightening. As the WMD Commission rightly notes, however, the more \nlikely threat is from a biological weapon. In contrast to nuclear \nweapons, the technological hurdle is lower to develop and disseminate \nbioweapons, access to pathogens is more widespread, and pathogens are \nharder to contain. The spread of biotechnology, the difficulty of \ndetecting such pathogens, and terrorists' known interest in \nbioterrorism combine to produce an even greater menace.\n  Bio-weapons are appealing to terrorists in part because we are \nunlikely to realize that an attack has occurred before it begins to \nkill many of its victims.\n  Worldwide security has lagged behind the growth of this threat. Even \nwithin our own country, the Commission and GAO have found that we fail \nto secure potential biological weapons effectively. In July, the GAO \nfound significant deficiencies in perimeter security at biological labs \nthat handle the world's most dangerous biological agents and diseases, \nsuch as the Ebola virus and smallpox. Because no cure or treatment \nexists for some of the pathogens handled by these labs, this is \nalarming.\n  Thousands of individuals in the United States have access to \ndangerous pathogens. Currently there are about 400 research facilities \nand nearly 15,000 individuals in the U.S. authorized to handle the \ndeadly pathogens on the ``Select Agent List.'' Indeed, the FBI has \ndetermined that a cleared scientist who worked at a regulated research \nlab likely carried out the Anthrax attacks on the Senate and the U.S. \npostal system in 2001.\n  To counter this threat, the WMD Commission recommends increasing the \nsecurity of biological laboratories that handle dangerous pathogens. \nThis legislation would do so by establishing additional security \nmeasures for the most dangerous pathogens that terrorists are likely to \nuse in an attack. A negotiated rulemaking--with Federal agencies and \nresearch institutions at the table--would develop these enhanced \nsecurity standards. This would ensure that regulations, which make our \nNation's labs more secure, would not have the unintended consequence of \ndeterring legitimate research endeavors.\n  In order to help fund the security enhancements at the highest-risk \nbiolabs and avoid diverting research funding to security upgrades, the \nbill authorizes a grant program at $50 million for each of the next \nfour years. This is a sufficient level of funding to ensure that each \nof the labs registered to handle the most dangerous pathogens could \naccess funding.\n  In response to another Commission finding that many research \nfacilities that handle less strictly controlled, yet still dangerous \npathogens are not even known to the government, the legislation \nrequires registration of these labs. This system of enhanced security \nfor labs with the most dangerous pathogens and the registration of labs \nthat handle less dangerous pathogens will result in facility security \nrequirements that are tiered based on the risk that a pathogen at a \nparticular facility could be used in a biological attack.\n  To better prepare the American people for a bio-weapon attack, the \nbill improves the government's ability to distribute medical \ncountermeasures and requires actions to improve communications with the \npublic before and during a biological attack. As the Commission wisely \nadvised, citizens need to know what to expect during a biological \nattack and how they should respond.\n  While security controls must be improved within our own country, \nglobal security problems are daunting. Countries like Syria do not \nadhere to the Biological Weapons Convention, which is the multilateral \ntreaty that banned the development, production, and stockpiling of \nbiological weapons. Other countries that signed the treaty may not be \nliving up to these commitments.\n  To address these international biosecurity threats, the bill requires \nthat the Director of National Intelligence, DNI, report on countries \nthat have facilities with the highest-risk pathogens and the security \nmeasures in place at these facilities. The DNI also must develop a \nstrategy for improving the Federal Government's capabilities to \ncollect, analyze, and disseminate intelligence related to weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  In addition, the bill would direct the Secretary of State to provide \nassistance to enhance security at laboratories with dangerous pathogens \nworldwide and to use exchange programs to train foreign nationals. In \nthis way, foreign nationals can promote lab safety and detect disease \noutbreaks in their home countries.\n  This legislation, which would implement the WMD Commission's \nrecommendations, is an important and significant step forward in \naddressing the growing threat of weapons of mass destruction, and of \nbio-weapons in particular. Countering this threat is critical for the \nsecurity of our Nation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN:\n  S. 1651.

In accordance with \nthe land patent, the Great Lakes Shipwreck Historical Society \nestablished and has operated a museum that brings to life the strength \nand fury of the Great Lakes and the bravery of the U.S. Life Saving \nService who rescued thousands of people from Great Lakes shipwrecks.\n  This legislation modifies the land patent such that development of \nnew facilities and expansion of existing facilities or infrastructure \nwould be implemented in accordance with the 2002 Human Use/Natural \nResource Plan instead of the 1992 Whitefish Point Comprehensive Plan. \nThe 2002 plan was developed pursuant to a court-ordered settlement \nagreement regarding the 1992 plan.\n  The modification of the land patent is intended to further the \npurposes of the original patent, which is for preservation and \ninterpretation of maritime history, while maintaining the conservation \nof natural habitat and wildlife areas, since Whitefish Point is an \nimportant birding area as well. This bill would ensure that the vibrant \nstories of the Great Lakes can be preserved and interpreted for future \ngenerations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 1652. A bill to amend part B of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act to provide full Federal funding of such part; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague from \nKansas, Senator Roberts, in introducing the IDEA Full Funding Act. The \naim of this legislation is to ensure, at long last, that Congress makes \ngood on a commitment it made more than three decades ago when we passed \nwhat is now called the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. At \nthat time, in 1975, we told children with disabilities, their families, \nschools, and States that the Federal Government would pay 40 percent of \nthe extra cost of special education. We have never lived up to that \ncommitment and only recently came close because of the one-time \ninvestment through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n  As we introduce this bill, our children are beginning another school \nyear. Some are meeting new teachers and going to new classrooms. Some \nare starting at a completely new school with new opportunities for \nsuccess and new challenges. Yet we are still shortchanging children \nwith disabilities and their educational opportunities.\n  We tell our children all the time to keep their promises, to live up \nto their commitments, to do as they say they are going to do. We teach \nthem that if they fail to do so, other people can be hurt. Well, that \nis what Congress has done by failing to appropriately fund IDEA: We \nhave hurt school children all\n\n[[Page S9137]]\n\nacross America. We have pitted children with disabilities against other \nchildren for a limited pool of school funds. We have put parents in the \nposition of not demanding services that their child with a disability \ntruly needs, because they have been told that the services cost too \nmuch and other children would suffer. We have hurt school districts, \nwhich are forced, in effect, to rob Peter to pay Paul in order to \nprovide services to students with disabilities. We have also hurt local \ntaxpayers, who are obliged to pay higher property taxes and other local \ntaxes in order to pay for IDEA services because the Federal Government \nhas reneged on its commitment.\n  I was pleased that we were able to increase funding for the IDEA \ngrants to States program as part of the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act this year to $22.8 billion. That represents 34 percent \nof the additional funding needed to support special education. However, \nthe Recovery Act is a one-time investment designed to address a crisis \ncaused by the recession that could have resulted in the loss of \nthousands of teachers and programs students need to be successful. \nWithout the Recovery Act, IDEA grants are currently funded at around 17 \npercent of the cost of special education programs. So we have a long \nway to go to reach the 40 percent level. But it is time to do so. It is \ntime for the Federal Government to make good on its promise to students \nwith disabilities in this country.\n  The IDEA Full Funding Act is pretty straightforward. It authorizes \nincreasing amounts of mandatory funding in 6 year increments that, in \naddition to the discretionary funding allocated through the \nAppropriations Committee, will finally meet the Federal Government's \ncommitment to educating children with disabilities.\n  This bill is a win-win-win for the American people. Students with \ndisabilities will get the education services that they need in order to \nachieve and succeed. School districts will be able to provide these \nservices without cutting into their general education budgets. Local \nproperty tax payers will get relief.\n  Full funding of IDEA is not a partisan issue. We all share an \ninterest in ensuring that children with disabilities get an appropriate \neducation, and that local school districts do not have to slash their \ngeneral education budgets in order to pay for special education. We all \nshare a sense of responsibility to make good on the promise Congress \nmade to fully fund its promised share of special education costs.\n  In the 3 decades since Congress passed IDEA, and in the 8 years since \nwe passed the No Child Left Behind Act, we have dramatically increased \nopportunities for students with disabilities. Likewise, we are holding \nlocal systems accountable in unprecedented ways. It is time for us in \nCongress also to be held accountable. It is time for us to make good on \nour promise to fully fund IDEA. To that end, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation with \nSenator Harkin to fulfill a promise that we made over 30 years ago. We \nmade a commitment to pay 40 percent of the excess cost of educating a \nspecial needs child. However, we have not fulfilled that promise.\n  Our legislation annually increases funding for Part B of the \nIndividuals with Disabilities Education Act over a 6-year period. With \nthese increases, we will be able to fully fund Part B in 2015.\n  I encourage my colleagues to add their support to this needed \nlegislation. If the Federal Government would provide its promised share \nof special education funding, our schools could then use any state and \nlocal funds for other educational needs, such as art and music.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Schumer, Mr. \n        Whitehouse, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Franken, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Brown, Mr. Bayh, Mr. \n        Bennet, Mrs. Boxer, Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kerry, and \n        Mr. Akaka):\n  S. 1653. A bill to provide for the appointment of additional Federal \ncircuit and district judges, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am reintroducing a comprehensive \nbill to address the resource needs of the Federal judiciary by \nauthorizing additional courts of appeals and district court judgeships. \nThis good government bill will improve the effectiveness of our Federal \ncourts and provide Federal judges with the tools to promptly render the \njustice that Americans so desperately need.\n  The Federal Judgeship Act of 2009 establishes 12 new judgeships in \nsix courts of appeals and 51 new judgeships in 25 district courts \nacross the country. The legislation I introduce today is based on the \nrecommendations of the Judicial Conference of the United States, which \nidentified the judiciary's resource needs during the completion of its \nbiennial survey in March.\n  Last Congress, I joined Senator Hatch and 20 other Senators from both \nsides of the aisle to introduce this legislation. A bipartisan majority \nof the Judiciary Committee voted to report the bill to the Senate last \nyear. Unfortunately, the Senate did not act on the bill before the end \nof the last Congress.\n  We used to consider judgeship bills at six year intervals. It has \nbeen 19 years since the last comprehensive judgeship bill was enacted \nto address the growth in the workload of the Federal judiciary. That \nlegislation established 11 additional circuit court judgeships, as well \nas 61 permanent and 13 temporary district court judgeships. Since 1990, \ncase filings in the Federal appellate courts have increased by 42 \npercent, and case filings in the district courts have risen by 34 \npercent. Congress has authorized only a few additional district court \njudgeships and extended a few temporary judgeships. We should pass a \ncomprehensive judgeship bill in this Congress that will ease the strain \nof heavy caseloads that has burdened the courts and thwarted the \nadministration of justice.\n  Last year, the weighted number of filings in district courts, which \ntakes into account an assessment of case complexity, was 472 per \njudgeship. This figure is well above the Judicial Conference's standard \nof 430 weighted filings per district court judgeship. In the 25 \ndistrict courts that would receive additional judgeships under this \nbill, the weighted filings averaged 573 per judgeship, and 10 courts \nhad caseloads near or above 600 weighted filings per judgeship. Today, \nthe national average circuit court caseload per three judge panel has \nreached 1,104 filings. That statistic approaches the record number of \n1,230 cases recorded in 2005 and far exceeds the 773 average circuit \ncourt caseload filings recorded in 1991.\n  Federal judges are working harder than ever, but in order to maintain \nthe integrity of the Federal courts and the promptness that justice \ndemands, judges must have a manageable workload. To address the \nexcessive caseloads that burden Federal courts, the Federal Judgeship \nAct of 2009 would add nine permanent circuit court judgeships, 38 \npermanent district court judgeships, and convert five existing \ntemporary judgeships into permanent positions. These additional \njudgeships would help to alleviate the significant increase in \ncaseloads that the Federal courts have seen over the nearly two decades \nsince the last comprehensive judgeship bill was enacted.\n  The bill would also add 13 temporary district court judgeships, three \ntemporary circuit court judgeships, and would extend one existing \ntemporary district court judgeship. These additional temporary \njudgeships will allow Congress some flexibility with regard to future \njudgeship needs. If caseloads continue to increase, Congress has the \noption to introduce legislation making permanent or renewing these \ntemporary judgeships. If those caseloads do not increase, when the next \njudge in that circuit or district retires they will not be replaced.\n  After years of debate and Federal courts struggling to adjudicate \ncases despite the overwhelming burden of heavy caseloads, the time to \nenact a comprehensive Federal judgeship bill is long overdue.\n  The ability of Federal courts to effectively administer justice will \ncontinue to be challenged unless adequate resources are provided. The \nFederal Judgeship Act of 2009 responds to the increasing workload of \nthe Federal judiciary, and it is long overdue. I thank Senators \nFeinstein, Schumer, Whitehouse, Klobuchar, Kaufman,\n\n[[Page S9138]]\n\nFranken, Harkin, Bingaman, Murray, Brown, Bayh, Bennet, Boxer, Shaheen, \nInouye, Akaka, and Kerry for their support. I urge Senators on both \nsides of the aisle to give this legislation their serious consideration \nand support.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1653\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There are authorized to be appropriated such sums as may be \n     necessary to carry out the provisions of this Act, including \n     such sums as may be necessary to provide appropriate space \n     and facilities for the judicial positions created by this \n     Act.\n\n     SEC. 5. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act (including the amendments made by this Act) shall \n     take effect on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to state my strong support for \nthe Federal Judgeship Act of 2009.\n  I am an original cosponsor of this bill, and I think it is a critical \nbill for good government.\n  The bill would create new judgeships in circuit and district courts \nwhere they are badly needed.\n  In the U.S. Courts of Appeals, it would create 9 new permanent and 3 \nnew temporary judgeships.\n  In the U.S. District Courts, it would create 38 new permanent and 13 \nnew temporary judgeships.\n  When caseloads get too heavy, the quality of justice in our Nation \nsuffers.\n  Victims of crime are forced to endure long periods of waiting for \njustice to be done. Citizens are unable to resolve their civil disputes \npromptly; plaintiffs face long delays in getting damages or restitution \nfor harms they have suffered. Morale plummets for judges and other \ncourt staff.\n  I have seen this in my own state, where judges in three of the four \nFederal districts are overwhelmed with case filings.\n  Let me tell you about one district in particular.\n  In the Eastern District of California, each Federal judge carried a \ncaseload last year of over 1,000 weighted filings.\n  The Judicial Conference of the U.S. recommends that Congress create a \nnew judgeship anytime a district reaches a caseload of 430 cases per \njudge. But in the Eastern District, the number exceeds 1,000.\n  The situation has become so dire that the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Ninth Circuit has stepped in. Last summer, the Chief Judge of the \nNinth Circuit sent a letter asking every judge in the Circuit to \nvolunteer to hear approximately 25 cases from the Eastern District to \ntry to get the caseload down.\n  The court has literally brought in Federal judges from all over the \ncountry to help deal with the crushing workload. District judges from \nAlaska, Alabama, and Washington State, as well as from Los Angeles and \nOakland, handled hundreds of cases in Sacramento and Fresno last year. \nA senior Ninth Circuit judge from Los Angeles handled hundreds more.\n  The help is welcome but it is not nearly enough. You see, the problem \nin the Eastern District is not a temporary one.\n  The Eastern District is home to Sacramento, Fresno, and the Central \nValley. In 2008, the District included 18 of California's 25 fastest \ngrowing counties.\n  The District is also home to 19 of California's State and Federal \nprisons and to 100,000 of the State's 167,000 prisoners. Since Congress \nlast created a new permanent judgeship in the District in 1978, \nprisoner filings have skyrocketed 700 percent.\n  The result is that the judges are severely overworked and justice for \neveryone is delayed. Civil litigants in the District are facing delays \nof approximately 42 months--that's 3-and-a-half years--from filing to \nverdict.\n  The situation, put simply, is unacceptable.\n  In 1992, Congress did authorize a 10 year temporary judgeship for the \nDistrict, but that judgeship expired and despite repeated efforts by \nChairman Leahy, Senator Boxer, and myself, it has not been renewed.\n  In the meantime, for the last 12 years, every time the Judicial \nConference has surveyed the U.S. Courts it has said that the Eastern \nDistrict needs more judges, but new judgeships have not been created.\n  The Federal Judgeship Act of 2009 that Chairman Leahy has introduced \ntoday would finally provide a solution. It would authorize four new \npermanent judgeships and one new temporary judgeship in the Eastern \nDistrict.\n  This would almost double the number of judges in the District by \nchanging from 6 to 11 judges and would substantially reduce the \ncaseload and delays.\n  This is a necessary solution to a real problem.\n  But the Eastern District is only one example. There are plenty of \nothers. As I said, the Judicial Conference recommends that Congress \ncreate a new judgeship whenever there are 430 weighted filings per U.S. \nDistrict Judge. But according to the 2009 survey of the courts, in the \nNorthern District of California, the judges are handling 624 weighted \nfilings per judge; in the Central District of California, it is 551 per \njudge; in the Middle District of Florida, it is 569 per judge; in the \nSouthern District of Florida, it is 549 per judge; in the Southern \nDistrict of Indiana, it is 594 per judge; in the District of Minnesota, \nit is 743 per judge; in the Eastern District of Texas, it is 674 per \njudge; in the Southern District of Texas, it is 543 per judge; and in \nthe Western District of Texas, it is 650 per judge.\n  So this is a problem in courts across the country; and it is up to \nCongress to craft a solution.\n  The last time Congress passed a comprehensive bill to create new \njudgeships was in 1990. Since that time, case filings across the \ncountry in the federal appeals courts have increased by approximately \n45 percent, and filings in the district courts have increased by 27 \npercent.\n  The current situation in the courts is not sustainable.\n  Neither the Eastern District of California nor any other Court should \nbe forced to rely on temporary visits from colleagues who generously \noffer their help. Districts should have enough judges to handle their \ncaseloads on their own.\n  This Federal Judgeship Act of 2009 is based on recommendations made \nby the Judicial Conference after an extensive review of case filings \nand caseload trends in every federal circuit and district court across \nthe country.\n  It is time for Congress to act and give the federal courts the \nresources they need to ensure a fail and timely trial for every civil \nand criminal litigant.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n[[Page S9140]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/08/senate-section/article/S9140-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 253--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE THAT THE \nGOVERNMENT OF LIBYA SHOULD APOLOGIZE FOR THE WELCOME HOME CEREMONY HELD \n TO CELEBRATE THE RELEASE OF CONVICTED LOCKERBIE BOMBER ABDEL BASET AL-\n                                MEGRAHI.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Menendez, Mrs. \nGillibrand, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Casey, and Mr. Cardin) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n\n                              S.
