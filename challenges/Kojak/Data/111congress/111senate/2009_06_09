Mr. President, when it comes to health care, Americans \nare looking for answers. They don't understand why basic medical \nprocedures are so expensive. They don't understand why millions of \nAmericans have to go without basic care in a nation as prosperous as \nour own. Many are worried about losing the care they already have and \nlike.\n  So the need for health care reform is not in question. All of us want \nreform. The question is: What kind of reform will we deliver? And two \nvery different approaches are now beginning to come into view.\n  According to one approach, the government plays the dominant role by \ngetting into the health care business and leverages taxpayers' money to \nmuscle everybody else out of the way. Under this approach, the vast \nmajority of Americans who like the health care\n\n[[Page S6320]]\n\nthey have risk losing it when a government-run system takes over.\n  The other approach is to find ways of controlling costs, such as \ndiscouraging the junk lawsuits that drive up the cost of practicing \nmedicine and limit access to care in places like rural Kentucky; \nlifting barriers that currently diminish the effectiveness of \nprevention and wellness programs that have been shown to reduce health \ncare costs, like quitting smoking, fighting obesity, and making early \ndiagnoses; and, finally, letting small businesses pool resources to \nlower insurance costs--without imposing new taxes that kill jobs.\n  This second approach acknowledges that government already plays a \nmajor role in the health care system, and that it will continue to play \na role in any solution we devise. But this approach is also based on \nthe principle that government cannot be the solution. Americans want \noptions, not a government-run plan that drives every private health \nplan out of business and forces people to give up the care they \ncurrently have and like.\n  The Secretary of Health and Human Services acknowledged this concern \nabout a health care monopoly when she described those parts of the \ncountry where certain private health plans already have a monopoly. \n``In many areas in the country,'' she said, ``the private market is \nmonopolized by one carrier . . . You do not have a choice for \nconsumers. And what we know in any kind of market is a monopoly does \nnot give much incentive for other innovation or for cost-effective \nstrategies.''\n  Well, if this is true of private health plans, then it would be \nespecially true of a government-run health plan. If a government-run \nplan came into being, concerns about a monopoly would not just be \nregional, they would be national.\n  Another problem with a government plan is a feature that has become \nall too common in nations that have adopted one. Many of these nations \nhave established so-called government boards as part of their \ngovernment health plans that end up determining which benefits are \ncovered and which benefits are not covered. Our former colleague and \nthe President's first choice for HHS Secretary, Tom Daschle, envisions \njust such a board in his widely cited book on the topic. ``The Federal \nHealth Board,'' he writes, ``would promote `high value' medical care by \nrecommending coverage of those drugs and procedures backed by solid \nevidence.''\n  What this means is that the Federal Government would start telling \nAmericans what drugs they can and cannot have. We know this because \nthat is exactly what is happening in countries that have adopted these \ngovernment boards. They have categorically denied cutting-edge \ntreatments either because the treatments cost too much or because \nsomeone in the government decided the patients who needed it were \neither too old or too sick to be worth the effort. When these countries \nenacted health boards, I am sure their intention was not to delay and \ndeny care. But that is exactly what these government boards are doing.\n  The writer and commentator Virginia Postrel, who has written for the \nNew York Times and the Wall Street Journal recently wrote an account of \nher own first-hand experience with breast cancer and her ability to \ntreat it successfully with the drug Herceptin here in the U.S. Postrel \nsaid the availability of the drug increased her chances of survival \nfrom a coin flip to 95 percent. A year after beginning her treatments, \nPostrel wrote that she had no signs of cancer.\n  In the same article, Postrel points out that the situation is far \ndifferent in New Zealand, where a government board known as Pharmac \ndecided that Herceptin should not be made available to some cancer \npatients in that country. As one cancer doctor in New Zealand put it, \nNew Zealand ``is a good tourist destination, but options for cancer \ntreatment are not so attractive there right now.'' Bureaucrats in New \nZealand finally relented and allowed coverage for Herceptin, due in \npart to a public outcry over the limited availability of the drug.\n  New Zealanders have also been denied access to drugs that have proven \nto be effective in reducing the risk of heart disease and strokes. \nAccording to an article from 2006 in The New Zealand Medical Journal, \nthe restrictions placed on statins by New Zealand's government board \nsignificantly hampered the preventative approach to heart disease. As \nthe authors of the article put it, ``[it is probable that . . . this \none decision] has caused more harm and premature death to New Zealand \npatients than any of their other maneuvers.''\n  Americans want health care reform. But they do not want reform that \ndestroys what is good about American health care in the process. They \ndo not want a government bureaucrat making arbitrary decisions about \nwhich drugs they or their loved ones can or cannot take to treat an \nillness. And they do not want to be told they have to give up the care \nthey have. Americans do not want a government-run health plan. And they \ncertainly do not want a government board to dictate their health care \ncoverage. They want real reform that solves the problems they face \nwithout sacrificing the benefits they enjoy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6320-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for the last month, the Republican leader \nfrom Kentucky has come to the floor and argued that we should not move \ndetainees currently in Guantanamo into the United States, even for \ntrial. Luckily, the President, the Attorney General, and the head of \nthe joint military chiefs of staff have come to the conclusion that it \nis in the best interest of the safety and security of the United States \nthat one of these notorious terrorists be brought to the United States \nfor trial. So it has been announced today that Mr. Ahmed Khalfan \nGhailani is being brought to the United States, to New York, for trial.\n  Luckily, this administration is not following the advice and counsel \nof Senator McConnell and some on his side. It is time for this man to \nface trial. What is he being charged with? He is being charged as one \nof those involved in the 1998 embassy attacks in Africa. This Tanzanian \nnational has been held in Cuba since September of 2006. He was captured \nby our forces, and others, in Pakistan in 2004 and transported to \nGuantanamo. He is being charged with his involvement in the 1998 \nbombings of U.S. Embassies in east Africa, which killed 224 people, \nincluding 12 Americans.\n  The position being taken by the Republicans in the Senate is that \nthis man should not be brought to the United States for trial. I think \nthey are wrong. I think it is time that he answered for the crimes \nbeing charged against him. Twelve Americans died as a result of what we \nbelieve was his conduct. He needs to be held accountable. This argument \nthat he cannot be brought to the United States and tried would \nvirtually allow this man to escape punishment for the crime that we \nbelieve he committed. The Republicans' position that he should not be \nbrought to the United States because somehow, if he is being held in a \nprison in the United States, it is a danger to the rest of us cannot be \nsupported in fact.\n  There are 347 convicted terrorists presently being held in U.S. \nprisons--not one has escaped--in supermax facilities and no one has \never escaped. For the Republicans to argue we cannot bring this man to \nthe United\n\n[[Page S6321]]\n\nStates for trial for killing a dozen Americans leaves him in a position \nwhere we may lose our ability to prosecute him. The speedy trial \nrequirements of our Constitution and the laws of the United States \ncould virtually end up with the United States being unable to prosecute \nthis man if the Republican position on Guantanamo detainees is \nfollowed.\n  GEN Colin Powell is right, Guantanamo needs to be closed. It is a \nrecruiting tool for al-Qaida. We know these individuals can be brought \nto the United States and tried and safely imprisoned. We have never had \nan escape from a supermax facility. We know that to turn these \nprisoners over to some other country runs the risk that they will be \nreleased.\n  Dangerous people who threaten the United States should be dealt with \nby our Constitution and laws. The administration has made the right \ndecision that this man be brought to trial in the United States, held \naccountable for any wrongdoing on his part that led to the deaths of so \nmany hundreds of innocent people at our Embassies in Africa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6321-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6321-S6323]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this morning we heard the Republican \nleader come to the floor again--this is not the first time--to address \nthe health care situation in America. I have read his previous speech, \nand I listened to his speech today. It is clear to me he does not \nbelieve we are facing a crisis when it comes to health care. I think we \nare. I think it is a serious crisis. It is a crisis where 47 million \nAmericans have no health insurance. Imagine, if you will, being a \nparent and having children with no health insurance coverage. Imagine \nyourself in a position where an accident or a diagnosis at a doctor's \noffice could literally mean you would lose every penny you have ever \nsaved in your life for expensive medical care when you do not have \nhealth insurance. Imagine that as a crisis that affects Americans, too \nmany of them today.\n  Then imagine those who have health insurance and worry that tomorrow \nthe costs will go up to the point where they cannot afford it, that \nthere will be medical procedures necessary uncovered by their health \ninsurance. Cost is an issue. It is an issue which is driving us to look \nat reform of the health care system.\n  I heard Senator McConnell this morning, and what he is arguing about, \nfrankly, is not even in the debate on Capitol Hill. He said \nrepeatedly--said it yesterday, said it again today--that our debate \nover health care reform means Americans run the risk of losing the \nhealth insurance they want. Exactly the opposite is true. What \nPresident Obama has said and what we are saying is that if you have \ngood health insurance, you can keep it. You like the health insurance \nyou have? You can keep it. No one has ever argued the opposite \nposition, which the Senator from Kentucky referred to this morning.\n  He also spent a lot of time talking about government-run health care \nplans. It is interesting that he would raise that as an issue when we \nare not suggesting a government-centered health insurance reform. We \nthink it should be a patient-centered health insurance reform.\n  But we also know that when you ask Americans across the board--\nfamilies and patients--what do you think about the health care system \nin America, what are its greatest shortcomings in the current health \ncare system, do you know what No. 1 is? Almost half, 48.9 percent, of \nthe people say not having health insurance. The second, 43 percent say \nthe greatest shortcoming of America's health care system is dealing \nwith health insurance companies; 30.9 percent, inflexibility of health \ncare plans; 30.9 percent, insurance companies' refusal to cover \npreexisting conditions.\n  When the Senator from Kentucky comes to the floor and argues against \nchanging the current situation, he is arguing for allowing these health \ninsurance companies to continue to dominate. As long as they dominate, \nAmericans and their families will be vulnerable--vulnerable to \nincreases in costs they cannot manage, vulnerable to new policies with \nmore exclusions, vulnerable to preexisting conditions not being \ncovered. That is the vulnerability of Americans we have today that we \nhave to seriously address.\n  The Senator from Kentucky argues we do not want a Canadian plan, we \ndo not want a British plan, we do not want a New Zealand plan. He is \nright. We want an American approach--an American approach that \ncombines, yes, private health insurance companies when they are held to \nstandards that are fair to American families but also holds open the \noption that we will have a plan which is run by the government--as an \noption, a voluntary option--for people to choose. If they like what \nthey have in their current plan, they can keep it. If they want to move \nto another private health insurance plan, they can do so. If they want \nto choose a government plan, they can do that as well.\n  According to the Senator from Kentucky, if the government is involved \nin it, it must be bad. Tell that to 40 million Americans under \nMedicare, many of whom never had health insurance in their life and now \nhave the protection of Medicare. Medicare has worked for senior \ncitizens and the disabled for a long period of time.\n  The Senator from Kentucky should also tell the people in the \nVeterans' Administration that when the government is involved, it does \nnot work. They know better. Veterans and their families across America \nknow our veterans health care system provides quality care for them. We \nentrust to them, the men and women who risk their life for America and \ncome home injured--we know they are going to get quality care. To argue \nthat if there is any government involvement at all in health care it is \nto the detriment of America argues against Medicare, argues against the \nVeterans' Administration.\n  The Senator went on to say, if the government gets involved, the \ndelays will be intolerable. We do not want delays. We want timely \ntreatment of people. If a doctor believes either I or my family members \nneed to have a surgical procedure, some help, some diagnostic test, we \nwant it done in a timely fashion.\n  What the Senator from Kentucky, the Republican leader, ignores is \nthat there are delays within the current system. An article in \nBusinessWeek highlights a case of a woman in New York, Susan, who \ncalled for an annual mammogram appointment in April, knowing she would \nhave to wait 6 weeks. In 2007, her first scan at the end of May was not \nclear. A followup scan detected an abnormality which the doctor wanted \nto address with a needle biopsy and outpatient procedure. The first \navailable date was mid-August, more than 2 months later. This lady who \nhad an abnormality in her mammogram was forced to wait months under the \ncurrent private health insurance system.\n  We have a similar problem in Chicago, Cook County, IL. At the local \npublic hospital, wait times for speciality services can range from 6 \nmonths to 1 or 2 years under the current system.\n  We know that when it comes to delays, unfortunately, they are \noccurring in the current system. We also know that for a lot of people, \nthis current system has become unaffordable and intolerable.\n  I think back to one of my friends in Springfield, Doug Mayol. Here is \na fellow who tells a story. He owns a small business in my hometown of \nSpringfield, a shop that sells cards and gifts. His only worker has \nMedicare coverage, so she is taken care of. But Doug has to buy private \nhealth insurance. Unfortunately, Doug has a problem. He was diagnosed \nmany years ago--30 years ago, in fact--with a congenital heart valve \ndefect. He has no symptoms. Without regular health care, he runs the \nrisk of developing serious problems.\n  In the year 2001, Doug, in Springfield, IL, paid $200 a month for \nhealth insurance. By 2005, even though he had not turned in any claims, \nhis cost of health insurance was up to $400 a month. The next year, \nwhen he turned 50, the rate nearly doubled to $750 a month. He made \nsome changes in coverage so he would pay more out of pocket, choose a \nsmall network of providers, and have a higher deductible. He got his \npremium down to $650 a month.\n\n  This man owns a small shop. He sells greeting cards. He was up to \n$650 a month. Two years later, his premium\n\n[[Page S6322]]\n\njumped to over $1,000 a month. Again, he made some changes. By opting \nfor the highest possible deductible, he was able to bring his premiums \ndown to $888 a month. Think about that: He is paying 300 percent more \nthan he paid for health coverage 8 years ago and getting a lot less for \nit.\n  He isn't a costly patient. His valve condition is asymptomatic. He \nhas never made a claim for illness or injury. He receives routine \nmedical care. His high deductible rarely kicks in. Here is the problem. \nBecause of his high deductible and expense of health insurance, he is \nafraid to go to a doctor, that it will create another red flag for the \nhealth insurance company to raise his premiums even more.\n  It is unfair to him, Doug Mayol, working in Springfield, IL, as a \nsmall business owner, a man whose insurance company has never paid a \nclaim, to watch his costs explode from $200 a month to $1,000 a month \nin just a few years. Sadly, if we follow the advice of the Senator from \nKentucky, it will get worse.\n  President Obama has challenged us to take on this reform. This is not \neasy, believe me. There are health insurance companies that are going \nto fight us every step of the way. Anytime we step in to try to protect \nDoug and other families to make insurance affordable and to make sure \nit is quality, they are going to argue it is too much government, such \nas we heard from the Senator from Kentucky this morning. What he had to \nsay is what we hear from the health insurance companies: Leave it \nalone, leave the system alone.\n  Can we afford for Doug Mayol and millions of Americans to leave this \nalone? We have to make sure we move toward a situation that recognizes \nwe face a crisis. It is a crisis of cost and a crisis when it comes to \navailability of health insurance. We have to hold the health insurance \ncompanies accountable to provide us affordable quality care. We have to \nchange the system so we have early detection of problems--preventive \ncare. We have to ring some of the costs out of the system.\n  One of the persons who has made a comment on this regularly whom I \nrespect very much is a doctor in Boston named Atul Gawande. He \nrecently, in a June 1 article in the New Yorker, talked about the \ndisparity in cost around the United States for Medicare. It is clear \nthat in some parts of the country--and he was speaking of McAllen, TX, \nat this point--the cost for Medicare patients is dramatically higher \nthan they are in other places. We can bring costs down to a reasonable \nlevel and try to take control of a system that is currently out of \ncontrol, but we cannot do it if every day we are reminded of problems \nthat do not exist. That is what we have heard from the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  They are arguing that we want to take away people's health insurance. \nAbsolutely false. We said: If you like your health insurance, you can \nkeep it. They argue the government will take over the health care \nsystem. I have not run into anybody who has suggested that. What we \nwant to do is have public health insurance and have a private option, \nwhich the Senator from New York is going to address in a moment when I \nclose.\n  This is an important debate for every single American. It is time to \nput together reform that assures quality and affordable health care for \nall Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nIllinois for his strong and forceful words, meaningful, bringing it \nhome, as he always does, in a very strong and good way about \nindividuals and how they are affected.\n  I would like to talk a little bit about where we are in health care \nand where we have to go. Let me say that about 10 years ago--I cannot \nremember the exact time--one of the major issues we faced was called \nthe Patients' Bill of Rights. Doctors and patients felt--everyone \nfelt--that HMOs were taking undue advantage of them. Doctors, if a \npatient desperately needed a prescription, would call some accountant \nin a faraway city and could not get approval and the patient would not \nget the medicine. It sort of hit home.\n  There was a movie called ``As Good As It Gets,'' with Jack Nicholson, \nand I cannot remember the name of the woman who starred in it. The \nfamily could not get the health care they needed because the HMO turned \nthem down. I believe it was her child who was hurting. When she and \nJack Nicholson made remarks about how somebody has to keep an eye on \nthese HMOs, in theaters across America, the audience got up and \ncheered.\n  That is, again, what we are talking about when we talk about public \noption. Every one of us has a friend, a family member--maybe it is \nourselves--who has experienced the basic intransigence of insurance \ncompanies in providing--even when you have a package of benefits--the \nkind of care you or a loved one, a member of your family, needs.\n  It is clear in America the insurance companies--and they are doing \ntheir job maximizing their profit to their shareholders. Of course, our \ncapitalist system says they have to maximize it by trying to sell as \nmany policies as possible. So there is some check on them. But it is \nclear America is not happy with insurance companies.\n  My good friend from Kentucky, the minority leader, keeps saying we do \nnot want the government involved. Well, let me ask him: Who is going to \nprotect the individual and even some of the individual providers--the \ndoctor in a small town or in an inner city--from an insurance company \nwhen the insurance company either charges too much or tries to get rid \nof the small businessman--such as in the case of the gentleman from \nSpringfield whom my friend Dick Durbin talked about--or when they deny \ncoverage or when they tell you because you have a preexisting condition \nthat you can't get coverage or they are not renewing your proposal or \nwhatever?\n\n  We understand there needs to be a check on the insurance companies. \nLeft alone, they will not provide the kind of low-cost, full health \ncare many Americans need. And when we propose a public option, we are \nproposing someone to keep a check on them. That is the only point. If \nwe had complete faith in the insurance companies, we wouldn't be \ndebating a public option. If we had complete faith that, left on their \nown, when an individual had the situation of an illness and their costs \nwent way up, they would say: Sure, we are going to take care of you, \nyou signed the contract when you were healthy and now you are sick--and \nsometimes that happens. I am not saying it never happens, not for sure. \nBut what about all the instances when it doesn't? What about the worry \nthe rest of us have? And praise God, we are healthy, but it might \nhappen. There has to be a check on the insurance companies, and that is \nwhat the so-called public option does.\n  Insurance companies are part of the free enterprise system, and it is \na great system, but the goal of the insurance company--it is probably \nin their charters, but it is how our system works--is to maximize \nprofits to their shareholders by producing a good product. But we all \nknow, particularly when it comes to health, that system has major \nflaws. It sometimes works and it sometimes doesn't work.\n  If we thought only the private sector should provide health care, we \nwouldn't have Medicare. And I know there are some--way over on the \nright side--who would like to get rid of Medicare. If we thought \nprivate insurance on its own worked just fine, we wouldn't have fought \nfor years for a patients' bill of rights. So this idea coming from the \nminority leader that we should have no check on the insurance \ncompanies, which is what we would have if we had no form of public \noption, isn't where the American people are, and it is certainly not \nwhere I am.\n  Some bring up--and I think it is a valid argument--well, if the \ngovernment is involved--and by the way, what we are proposing here is \nnot that the government take over health care. We are proposing that in \nthis exchange where all kinds of insurances companies compete, there be \nat least one that doesn't put the profit motive above all else but has \nto put patients above all, a public option. It doesn't make a profit. \nAnd what we are saying is, if you believe in competition, why not let \nthe public option compete? We do this in State governments. In State \ngovernments, if you are a State worker in some States, you can \nsometimes get a public plan or a private plan. The consumer chooses. \nAnd that is how it\n\n[[Page S6323]]\n\nshould be. We are simply saying that, just as there are some who might \nsay: I don't think there should be any private sector involved in \nhealth care, it should all be public--and many people think that is not \nthe right view, as I know my friend from Kentucky does--many of us \nthink it is just as wrong to say it should only be the private sector. \nLet's see who does a better job. Let them compete in the marketplace.\n  My view is this: There has to be a level playing field. You cannot \ngive the public option such advantages that it overwhelms the private \nsector. The proposal that I have made and that others are looking at--\nSenator Bingaman is one; my friends in the House, Congressmen Welch and \nBrady and Murphy--is to try to make the playing field level. The \ngovernment won't just keep pouring money into the public option. It \nsets it up and then it has to compete. If the private sector needs \nreserves--God forbid there is catastrophic illness everywhere--then so \nwill the public option. I am certain those of us who are interested in \na public option are very interested in suggestions as to how to make \nthe playing field level. But make no mistake about it, the public \noption is a different model. The public option will not have to make a \nprofit. That is about 10, 12 percent. That money will go to health care \nfor the patients. The public option will not have to merchandise and \nadvertise. That is often 20 percent. So right off the bat, the public \noption has the same level playing field but has 30 percent of its \nrevenues that can go to patient health care.\n  My friends on the other side say: Well, the public option isn't very \nefficient; it doesn't give enough direction, and direction to the right \nperson, to cure this disease but lets people go all over. Well, if it \nis not, it is not going to work.\n  You know, if I were designing a health care system, I would even look \ncarefully at single payer. I believe we do need control mechanisms, and \nI think the insurance companies themselves, no matter how we try to \nregulate them, will figure out ways around them. That is almost their \nmandate because their goal is to maximize profit. There is nothing \nwrong with that. But we are not going to get single payer here. We know \nthat. And we are probably not even going to get something called \nMedicare For All, which would be a much more pure system that would not \nbe, frankly, a level playing field. But just as we have to compromise \nand move to the center a little bit to get something done, so do my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. Again, when they say no \npublic option, it is the inverse of saying no private insurance \ncompanies. Let's see who does better in this exchange.\n  My view is this: The public option will have certain advantages. It \nwon't have to make a profit, it won't have to advertise and \nmerchandise. But on the other hand, it is going to have certain \nresponsibilities. When Dick Durbin's friend from Springfield can't get \ninsurance from a private company, the public option will be there, and \nthat may be somewhat more expensive for them. Admittedly, we are going \nto try to pass laws to say the private insurance company has to keep \nDick Durbin's friend, the small businessman who is paying for his own \ninsurance, without a huge increase in cost. But if you believe, as I \ndo, and I think most Americans do, that the private insurance company \nis not going to embrace this and say: Gee, this is great, this is \ncosting us a ton of money and we have to report earnings for our \nshareholders, and we will try to find ways--there will be an intention \nof not covering people like that, and the public option will step into \nthe lurch.\n  So this is a different model, no question about it. It is not just \nanother insurance company that happens to be public. But it will be a \nlevel playing field. There will be a playing field where the private \ninsurance companies will be under certain rules and the public option \nplan will be under certain rules. If the private company has to leave \nreserves, the public company will have to leave reserves. No one is \nseeking to unlevel the playing field, but we are seeking to keep the \ninsurance companies honest. A public option will bring in transparency. \nWhen we know what the public option has to pay, we will say: Why isn't \nthe private insurer paying the same? A public option will keep the \ninsurance company's feet to the fire.\n  That is why President Obama feels so strongly about it. He said so in \nhis letter. My friend from Iowa, Senator Grassley, said he is just \nbeing political. I don't think so. He knows the public option will work \nwell. Maybe after 3 years, the public option fails and isn't needed. \nFine. Fine. But I don't believe that will happen. But we are not going \nto, in the public option, just keep putting more and more government \nmoney in until it wipes out the insurance companies. That is not the \nintent. The intent is to have a robust market, such as we have in other \nStates and some of the Federal systems, where many different plans \ncompete, and one is a public option. There might also be co-ops, such \nas my friend from North Dakota has been advocating, but there will be \nplenty of private insurance companies.\n  I would say one other thing. My friends on the other side of the \naisle say: Well, why can't we just have the private insurers compete \nand offer a whole lot of plans? We don't have that in the vast majority \nof States right now. We have a system where any private company can \nsell insurance. But in more than half our States--and I believe this \nstatistic is right, but I will correct the record if it is not--the top \ntwo companies have more than 50 percent of the market. There is usually \nnot unvarnished competition when you just leave it up to the private \ninsurance companies but, rather, an oligopoly. And we all know what \nhappens when there is not real competition: Price setting occurs. Price \nleadership is what the economists call it. Nobody tries to undercut on \nprice. We have seen this with the oil industry, for instance, with our \nfive big oil companies, and you don't get the kind of competition you \nwould from a public option, even if there were only one or two \ninsurance companies competing.\n\n  In conclusion, I would ask my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle to, A, be openminded. We haven't said no this or no that. When \nyou say no public option, you are saying we want to let the private \ninsurance companies, under the guise of competition, run the show. And \nif you believe that will work, fine, but then you also should believe \nthe public option won't be a threat to them. Some of us who are worried \nthat, left to their own devices, the private insurance companies will \nnot serve all or even most of the public as well as they should be \nserved, are saying let there be the competitive advantage or the \ncompetition of a public option in a level playing field that has no \nparticular built-in advantage but has a different model--no profit, no \nmerchandising, no advertising, serve the patient first.\n  This debate will continue, but I would just say to my fellow \nAmericans out there who might be listening to this, when you hear the \nother side say no public option, ask them: Then who is going to provide \na check on the insurance companies? And do you believe the insurance \ncompanies, even with some government regulation, won't find their way \nout of the regulations or avoid the regulations or walk around them?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. The debate will continue, Mr. President, and I \nappreciate the opportunity to address my colleagues.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican whip.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I understand the time for morning business \nhas now reverted to the Republican side; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6323-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6323-S6325]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. KYL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I would like to address two subjects. The first is the \nsubject my colleague from New York was just discussing, and that is \nwhat to do about health care issues we have in the United States. \nSpecifically, I would like to refer to some comments that both he made \nand the assistant majority leader made this morning.\n  The first point I wish to make is that when the assistant majority \nleader came to the floor this morning and in effect said: Unless you \nagree with our solution, you don't believe there is a problem, that is \na fallacy, of course. I\n\n[[Page S6324]]\n\nthink everybody agrees there are lots of problems. The question is, \nWhat is the right solution? So we can all agree there are problems, but \nlet's don't suggest that unless you agree with my solution or your \nsolution, somehow or other we don't appreciate that there are problems.\n  We are frustrated and a lot of Americans are frustrated because they \nmay work for a small business or they are unemployed and therefore they \ndon't have insurance. It is not easy to take your insurance with you. \nIt is hard to find quality, low-cost health care. This has to be a big \npriority for a lot of Americans. We all understand that.\n  Health care needs to be portable. It needs to be accessible. It needs \nto be affordable. I think all Americans want it to be quality care as \nwell. The question is, How do you accomplish these goals?\n  One of the problems is, what if you have insurance and you like it? \nThe President says, in that case you get to keep it. The problem is, \nunder the bill that is being discussed in the Finance Committee, you do \nnot get to keep it. If you are an employee of a small business, for \nexample, or you are an individual with your own insurance, when your \ninsurance contract runs out--and those contracts are usually 1 year, 2 \nyears, sometimes as long as 3 years; let's say it is 2 years, and you \nare through the first year of it--the bottom line is, even though you \nmay like it, at the end of next year when the contract runs out, you \ndon't get to keep it.\n  Under the bill being discussed there is a new regime of regulation \nfor the insurance companies about who they have to cover, how they \ncover them, what they can charge, and a whole variety of other \nregulations that mean that the policy you used to have, that you liked, \ndoes not exist anymore.\n  It may be you will be able to find coverage that you like, but it is \nsimply untrue to say that one of the mainstays of the legislation being \nproposed is that if you like your current plan, you get to keep it. \nWhen your current plan expires, it expires, and you don't get to keep \nit because it cannot be renewed in its current form. That is point No. \n1.\n  Point No. 2. We just had a discussion about government-run insurance. \nI find it interesting that some on the other side like to call this a \npublic option, as if the public somehow or other is operating its own \ninsurance company. Let's be clear about who would operate this \ninsurance company. It is the U.S. Government. It is not the public; it \nis the U.S. Government. That is why Senator McConnell has referred to \nit properly as government-run insurance.\n  The Senator from New York just got through saying: Who else is going \nto provide a check on the private insurance companies to make sure they \ndo things right? The President himself has spoken about the need for a \ngovernment-run plan to keep the other insurance companies ``honest.''\n  Insurance is one of the most highly regulated enterprises in the \nUnited States. Every State in fact regulates health insurance. This is \nan area that not only has some Federal regulation, but every State \nregulates health insurance. In fact, one of the reasons you cannot buy \na health insurance policy from the State you do not live in--you can't \ngo across State lines and buy a policy in another State--is because we \nare so jealous of the State regulation of insurance. So to the question \nof my friend from New York, who is going to provide a check, the answer \nis, your State. If you do not trust your State to properly regulate \nhealth insurance, then I don't know where we are. But you are not going \nto provide better regulation by commissioning a government insurance \ncompany to exist and compete right alongside the private insurance \ncompanies. How does that provide a check on the private insurance \ncompanies?\n  It is not as if there are not enough private insurance companies or \nthey are not providing enough different kinds of plans, so that can't \nbe the problem. It is not a matter of a lack of competition in most \nplaces. If the question is, who is going to regulate, the answer is, \nthe State is going to regulate. To the extent it does not, the Federal \nGovernment is going to regulate. That is why, A, it should not be \ncalled a public option if what they are talking about is creating a \ngovernment-run health insurance company, which is exactly what is being \nproposed in the only legislation put out there so far, the so-called \nKennedy legislation in the HELP Committee. That is precisely what he \nproposes. Republicans say: No, thank you. We are not for that.\n  My final point is that the assistant majority leader said there are \nlots of other government-run plans, and we are not afraid of them. He \nmentioned Medicare and the Veterans' Administration. First of all, \nthese are not government insurance companies, these are government-run \nprograms. But, second, the President himself said, and everybody I know \nof who has studied the issue agrees, Medicare is in deep trouble. The \nPresident has said its commitments are unsustainable, meaning we cannot \nkeep the promises we have made in Medicare to future generations \nbecause it is far too expensive. We have to find a way to get those \nexpenses under control.\n  How is adding another 15, 20 or 30 million Americans to an existing \nprogram that is not sustainable going to make it any better?\n  My colleague talked about waiting lines. It may well be true we can \nfind an example or two of people who have to wait in line in the United \nStates. That is something we should not permit in the United States. We \nknow that is what exists in other countries, and I will get to that in \njust a moment. Why does that justify having an expansion of a \ngovernment program? If we have a government program which causes \nwaiting lines today, does it solve the problem by adding a whole lot \nmore people to the rolls?\n  What is likely to happen? The waiting lines are going to get longer \nbecause more people are going to have to be waiting for care. Is that \nwhat we want in the United States of America? I submit not. So far from \nbeing a justification for a government-run program, I believe that \nargues for not having a government-run program, or at least not \nexpanding the government programs we already have. A government \ntakeover is not the answer. No country, even the United States, the \nmost prosperous country on Earth, has unlimited resources to spend on \nhealth care.\n  That brings up the third problem, which is the rationing, the \ninevitable delay in getting treatment or tests and frequently the \ndenial of care that results from that. When a government takes over \nhealth care, as it has, for example, in Britain and Canada and many \nplaces in Europe and other places, care inevitably is rationed. We all \nhave heard the stories.\n  One of the most direct ways we can ration care is one that the White \nHouse has already embraced, and it is part of the Kennedy bill that I \nspoke of earlier.\n  The White House has said comparative effectiveness research, which \nwould study clinical evidence to decide what works best, will help them \neliminate wasteful treatments. Wasteful to whom? A recent National \nInstitutes of Health project has a description of part of their plan \nthat states, and I will quote:\n\n       Cost-effectiveness research will provide active and \n     objective information to guide future policies that support \n     the allocation of health resources for the treatment of acute \n     and chronic conditions.\n\n  Allocation of health resources is a euphemism for rationing. \nAllocation means to allocate, and inevitably there will be denial based \nupon those things which are deemed to be too costly.\n  As discussions about health care reform have dominated the news \nrecently, stories have trickled out from individuals living in \ncountries that ration care whose medical treatment has been delayed or \ndenied due to rationing, and we are beginning to hear some of those \nstories. One that I came across was reported in the Wall Street \nJournal.\n  It was the story of one Shona Holmes of Ontario, Canada. When Miss \nHolmes began losing her vision and experiencing headaches, panic \nattacks, extreme fatigue, and other symptoms, she went to the doctor. \nAn MRI scan revealed a brain tumor, but she was told she would have to \nwait months to see a specialist.\n  Think about this. She goes home and tells her family: The MRI said I \nhave a brain tumor. I have all of these symptoms, including losing \nvision and the rest of it. But I have to wait months to\n\n[[Page S6325]]\n\nsee a specialist--I gather, to confirm the diagnosis. I don't know. As \nher symptoms worsened, she decided to visit the Mayo Clinic in Arizona. \nSo she left her home country, paid her way down to Arizona and paid for \nthe diagnosis and treatment that was called for in her case to prevent \nthe permanent vision loss and potentially death that could have ensued \nhad she not been treated in a timely fashion.\n  A Lindsey McCreith, also of Ontario, was profiled in the same article \nto which I referred. Mr. McCreith suffered from recurring headaches and \nseizures. When he went to the doctor, he was told the wait time for an \nMRI was 4\\1/2\\ months. Think about this. You are having seizures and \nthe test that will reveal what if anything is wrong is going to be \ndelayed 4\\1/2\\ months. One of the reasons, I am told, by the way, is \nthat there are very few places in Canada where MRIs are located, where \nyou can actually get the test. In any event, he decided to visit a \nclinic in Buffalo, NY--fairly nearby--in order to get the MRI. He did \nand it, too, revealed a brain tumor. Now Mr. McCreith is suing the \nCanadian Government's health care monopoly for jeopardizing his life.\n\n  I wonder if we want lawsuits to be the answer. When you can't get the \ncare you want, you have to file a lawsuit to get it? Is that what we \nwant in America? I don't think so.\n  There are also people whose care has been flatout denied. Britain's \nNational Health Service has denied smokers treatment for heart disease, \nand it has denied hip and knee replacements for people who are deemed \nto be obese. The British Health Secretary, Patricia Hewitt, has said it \nis fine to deny treatment on the basis of lifestyle.\n\n       [Doctors] will say to patients: ``You should not have this \n     operation until you have lost a bit of weight,'' she said in \n     2007.\n\n  That is easier said than done for some people. In any event, if they \nneed a health treatment and they need it now, there is a real question \nwhether they can accomplish the ``losing a little bit of weight,'' as \nMs. Hewitt said. All Americans deserve access to quality care, but \ngovernment-run insurance does not equate with access. Rationing will \nhinder access.\n  As I said, my colleague from Illinois, the distinguished majority \nassistant leader, says you can actually find some examples in the \nUnited States where there are long wait times. If that is true--and I \ndon't doubt what he said--that is not good; it is bad. We should try to \nfix that so we don't have wait times. We should not justify having more \nwait times on the fact that we already have some. We should not say \nbecause there are some people in America who have to wait, therefore we \nshould make it possible for everybody in America to have to wait; we \nshould be like Canada or Great Britain.\n  That is not the answer. If we have wait times here, we should stop \nit, not say that we, therefore, might as well be like Canada or Great \nBritain. Americans do not deserve or want health care that forces them \ninto a government bureaucracy with its labyrinth of complex rules or \nregulations.\n  Think about the hassles of dealing with the IRS or Department of \nMotor Vehicles or Social Security Administration when you have a \nproblem there and then imagine dealing with the same issues when it \ncomes to getting health care. We can't enable a panel of bureaucrats, \nthrough rules and regulations, to put the politicians in charge of \ndeciding who is eligible for a particular treatment or deciding when or \nwhere they can get it. It is wrong for America, wrong for the patients \nin America, and it is the wrong approach to health care reform.\n  Republicans believe there is a better way for health care reform. \nRather than empowering the government, empower patients. Rather than \nputting bureaucrats in between your doctor and yourself, try to remove \nthe constraints that physicians have and hospitals have for treating \npeople. Try to remove constraints on insurance companies.\n  One of the things I have asked for, for example, with all of these \nwonderful ideas about more government regulation of insurance is, how \nabout repealing some laws that currently prevent insurance companies \nfrom competing? I mentioned before you can't compete across State \nlines.\n  We all know if you want to incorporate as a corporation--why are all \nthe corporations incorporated in Delaware, ``a Delaware corporation''? \nIt doesn't matter whether you are in Illinois or Arizona, corporations \nare incorporated in Delaware. At least that is the way it used to be. \nOne of the reasons is Delaware had very benign laws regulating the \nincorporation of businesses. It was cheaper to do it, and there was \nless regulatory hassle. But if the distinguished Presiding Officer, for \nexample, looked across the river to the west and saw an insurance \ncompany in Iowa that could provide him with better coverage at less \ncost than the company that insures him in Illinois, why should he be \nrestrained from buying the policy from the company in Iowa? You could \nbuy your automobile insurance that way. You could buy your home \ninsurance that way. Why should you not be able to buy your health \ninsurance that way? Well, you can't.\n  I am going to conclude this discussion, but just one idea is to \nremove some of the barriers to competition that would make it more \nlikely that insurance companies could expand their coverage by \ncompeting, be required to compete with lower premiums and/or provide \nbetter access to care. It seems logical, and in this country, where \npeople move around all the time--my family just drove all the way \nacross the country from Washington, DC, out to Arizona to visit friends \nand family and go on to California. We travel all around this country \nall the time. We move families, unlike back in the old days. Why can't \nwe have an insurance regime that enables you to buy insurance from \nanother State? It does not make sense; it inhibits competition; it \nmakes prices higher; and it can have the effect of restricting care. \nThose are the kinds of things we need to do to reform our system, not \nput more government in charge and not put government between you and \nwhat your physician says you need, or even put some time delay between \nthe opportunity to visit your physician when you know you have \nsomething wrong with you.\n  We are going to have more discussion about this in the future, but I \nwant to back up what Senator McConnell from Kentucky has said. \nAmericans don't want government-run insurance companies any more than \nthey want government-run car companies. It seems as though the \ngovernment is starting to run everything now--from the banks, to the \ninsurance companies, to the car companies. Now we are going to run \ninsurance companies as well for health care. I do not think that is \nwhat the American people want.\n\n  I think the Senator from Kentucky is exactly right. I think he is \nright when he says no government-run care and that we should not be \nrationing care. Those are two of the most critical aspects of the \nlegislation Senator Kennedy has come forth with and among the things \nbeing discussed in the Senate Finance Committee as well. We need to \ndraw a line: Put patients first, not put the government first.\n  (Mrs. GILLIBRAND assumed the Chair.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6325-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6325-S6327]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GUANTANAMO\n\n  Mr. KYL. Now, Madam President, since I think I have a little bit more \ntime on the Republican side--though if I have colleagues who wish to \nspeak, I will be happy to finish for the moment--I will go for a little \nbit longer on another subject.\n  We have had kind of a running debate on the question of closing \nGuantanamo prison. This is a subject the Senate has spoken on by an \noverwhelming vote. I think 90-some Senators voted not to close Gitmo. \nThe American people are 3 to 1 opposed to bringing Gitmo prisoners into \ntheir State. They are 2 to 1, at least, in opposition to closing \nGuantanamo prison. This is not something on which there is a little bit \nof doubt. The American people are very much opposed to closing \nGuantanamo prison and bringing those people to their own States.\n  Nevertheless, the assistant majority leader and five other Democrats \nvoted for the appropriation of money--or the authorization of money--\nactually, the appropriation of money to close Gitmo and acknowledge \nthat would require bringing many of those people to the United States.\n  Well, I happen to agree with Senator McConnell that this is a bad \nidea, and\n\n[[Page S6326]]\n\nwith the other 89 Senators who agreed it is a bad idea, at least until \nwe have some kind of a plan to do it. So I was a little struck this \nmorning when the Senator from Illinois said: Well, here is the proof of \nwhy we should close the Guantanamo prison.\n  We just have had an announcement we are going to try a terrorist, \nwhose name is Ghailani, in the United States, and that proves we can \nclose Gitmo.\n  Well, it does not prove that. It does not prove anything. What it \nproves is, we can try somebody in U.S. courts. We have done that with a \nfew terrorists, and it is not a pleasant experience. The one that most \nof us recall in the Washington, DC, area was the trial across the river \nin Alexandria, VA, of Zacarias Moussaoui. That was extraordinarily \ndifficult for the government to do. It was very difficult for at least \ntwo main reasons.\n  First of all, much of the evidence that was gained to try him was \nclassified and could not be shared with him, and there were significant \nquestions of due process as a result. How can we try somebody for a \nserious crime and not show them the evidence against them? That is one \nof the main reasons it is very difficult to try these terrorists for \ncrimes.\n  The second problem is the security issue. The people in Virginia, in \nAlexandria--in the county there--will tell you, it was a costly and \ndifficult thing for them to be able to conduct this trial of Zacarias \nMoussaoui there. Nevertheless, it was possible. Although costly, it was \npossible. It was even possible to get a conviction, I would suggest, \nprimarily because of some decisions Moussaoui made. Nonetheless, it was \npossible to do so.\n  Everybody acknowledges there are some people who need to be tried for \nserious crimes, in effect, such as war crimes, and who should be tried \nin U.S. courts. It does not make it easy, but it can be done. What it \ndoes not prove is that it should be done for all of the people at \nGitmo. In fact, not even the President suggests that. The President, in \nhis speech a few weeks ago, acknowledged that many of the prisoners at \nGitmo now are never going to have a trial. They are simply being held \nuntil the termination of the hostilities that have caused them to be \ncaptured and imprisoned in the first place. They are like prisoners of \nwar who can be detained until the war is over.\n  Here, however, they do not even have the rights of prisoners of war \nunder the Geneva accords because they do not adhere to the rules of \nwar, they do not fight with uniforms for a nation state, and so on. \nThey, in fact, are terrorists. So they are still allowed humane \ntreatment, but they do not have the same rights as prisoners of war.\n  What that means is--as the President acknowledged, as the U.S. \nSupreme Court has acknowledged--we have a right to hold them until the \ncessation of hostilities so they do not kill any more people. We cannot \njust turn them loose.\n  The President, in his speech, made the point that at least 60--I \nthink is the number that was used--of these prisoners have been \nreleased and that they were released by the Bush administration. That \nis true. The Bush administration was under a lot of pressure to try to \nrelease as many of these people who were being held as possible, and so \nthey held determinations. They have a determination once a year and \ninitially as to what the status of the individual is and whether he is \nstill a danger. Eventually, in many of the cases, they decided the \nperson could be released back to their home country or to a country \nthat would take them and it would not pose a danger to the United \nStates.\n  The problem is, there is a very high rate of recidivism among these \nterrorists. One in seven are believed to have returned to the \nbattlefield. We have evidence of many of them, specifically by name, \nwho returned and who caused a lot of death. There are two in particular \nI recall who both eventually engaged in suicide bombing attacks, \nkilling, I think, 20-some people in one instance and at least a half \ndozen people in another instance.\n  So even when we try our best to make a determination that is fair to \nthe individuals, but we do not want to hold people beyond the time they \nshould be held--that they no longer pose a danger--we make mistakes and \nwe release people back to the battlefield who are going to try to kill \nus, and they are certainly going to try to kill others, including our \nallies; and, in fact, they do so. That is a risk, but it is not a risk \nthat we should lightly take.\n  The remaining 240-some prisoners at Guantanamo are the worst of the \nworst. These are people about whom it is very difficult to say: Well, \nthey do not pose a danger anymore. We have already been through those, \nand, as I said, one in seven of those people have not only posed a \ndanger, they have actually gone off and killed people.\n  So we have 240 of the worst of the worst, and the President correctly \nwent through the different things that can happen to them. Some of \nthem--a limited number--will be tried in U.S. courts, such as this \nterrorist Ghailani whom Senator Durbin spoke of earlier this morning. \nIt is hard to do. There are a lot of issues with it. But we will try to \ntry some of them.\n  Others can be tried with military commissions. Others will not be \nable to be tried. They will have to be held. There may be a few whom we \ndeem no longer a threat to us and they will have to be released but to \nwhom nobody knows because nobody appears to want--well, the French will \ntake one of them, and I think there may be another European country \nthat said--maybe the Germans will take one. That still leaves a lot to \ngo.\n  So the bottom line is, many are going to have to be detained. The \nquestion is, Where do we detain them? My colleague from Illinois says: \nWell, there are other people who agree we should close Gitmo. Even my \ncolleague from Arizona has certainly said that. But what he did not say \nis, before we have a plan to do so--and he himself has acknowledged \nthis is really hard to do. And while he would like to close it--as he \nhimself has said: I do not know how you do it--we certainly cannot do \nit without a plan, and we certainly cannot do it based upon the \ntimetable that the President is talking about.\n  So it is one thing to say it would be nice to close it. It is quite \nanother to figure out how to do it that would be safe for the American \npeople.\n  Finally, just a point I want to mention--well, two final points. The \nSenator from Illinois said this is a problem he, meaning the President, \ninherited. No. The President did not inherit the problem of having to \ncome up with a plan to close Gitmo by next January 20. The President \nmade that problem himself. When he was sworn into office, I think it \nwas within 3 days, he said: And we are going to close Gitmo within 12 \nmonths.\n\n  That is an arbitrary deadline that I submit he should not have \nimposed on himself or on the country because it is going to cause bad \ndecisions to be made. We may have to try more people, such as this \nterrorist Ghailani, in the United States than we want to or than we \nshould. In any event, we are going to have to try to find, I gather, \nfacilities in which these people could be held in the United States.\n  FBI Director Robert Mueller testified before the House of \nRepresentatives that that posed a lot of problems, real risks, for the \nUnited States. Nobody is saying it cannot be done. The question is, \nShould it be done? Most of us believe, no, it should not be done; there \nare better alternatives.\n  The final point I want to make is this: What is wrong with the \nalternative of the prison at Guantanamo? It is a $200 million state-of-\nthe-art facility in which, as I pointed out yesterday, people are very \nwell treated, humanely treated. They have gotten a whole lot better \nmedical and dental care than they ever got or could have hoped to have \ngotten in their home countries, fighting us on the battlefield of \nAfghanistan or somewhere else.\n  The bottom line is, this is a top-rate facility. The people there do \nnot mistreat prisoners. That is the myth. Somehow people conflate what \nhappened at Abu Ghraib with Guantanamo. This brings up the last point. \nIt is argued by my colleague from Illinois and others that, well, \nterrorists recruit based upon the existence of Guantanamo prison.\n  Think about that for a moment. Are we going to say because terrorists \naccuse us of doing something wrong--even though we did not--we are \ngoing to stop any activity in that area because we want to take away \nthat as a recruitment tool? We would have to basically go out of \nbusiness as the United\n\n[[Page S6327]]\n\nStates of America if we are going to take away all that terrorists use \nto recruit people to fight the West. They do not like the way we treat \nwomen with equality in the United States. They do not like a lot of our \nsocial values and mores. They do not even like the fact that we hold \nelections.\n  So because that is used as a recruitment tool, we are going to stop \ndoing all of that? What sense does this make? We treat people humanely \nand properly at Guantanamo. People were mistreated in another prison \ncalled Abu Ghraib. They are not the same. Abu Ghraib, therefore, does \nnot represent the example of what we should be doing with respect to \nGuantanamo.\n  We will have more debate on this subject. I note the time is very \nshort, and I meant to leave a little time for my colleague from Texas. \nI hope to engage my colleagues in further conversation about this \nissue. The American people do not want people from Gitmo put into their \nhome States.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I thank the Presiding Officer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6327-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6327-S6328]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Actually, Madam President, I intend to speak on the \nunderlying bill. But because the bill manager is not here, I think my \nremarks are just as appropriate in morning business.\n  I rise to offer my support as a cosponsor of the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act, the so-called FDA regulation of the \ntobacco bill that is currently before the Senate.\n  This is a rarity these days in Washington. It is actually a \nbipartisan bill--people of both parties working together to try to \nsolve a real problem--and I want to particularly thank Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Dodd for their leadership on the bill. I also want to thank \nthe Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids for organizing more than 1,000 \npublic health groups, faith-based organizations, medical associations, \nand other partners to support this legislation.\n  The House, as we know, passed the bill in April on a bipartisan \nbasis, and now it is time for the Senate to do its job this week.\n  This comes to us in a rather unusual historical and regulatory \nposture. The fact is, we know tobacco is a killer. It is a killer. It \nkills 400,000 Americans each year in the United States, including 90 \npercent of all deaths from lung cancer, one out of every three deaths \nfrom other types of cancer, and one out of every five deaths for \ncardiovascular disease.\n  The real tragedy is not just that adults choose to smoke and harm \ntheir health--and many of whom, unfortunately, die premature deaths as \na result--it is that many smokers begin their addiction to tobacco--the \nnicotine, which is the addictive substance within tobacco--when they \nare young, before they are able to make intelligent choices about what \nto do with their bodies and their health.\n  Every day about 1,000 children become regular daily smokers. Medical \nprofessionals project that about one-third of these children will \neventually die prematurely from a tobacco-related disease.\n\n  Not surprisingly, at a time when we are contemplating health care \nreform in this country, the huge expense of health care and the fiscal \nunsustainability of the Medicare program, it is also important to point \nout that tobacco directly increases the cost of health care in our \ncountry. More than $100 billion is spent every year to treat tobacco-\nrelated diseases--$100 billion of taxpayer money--and about $30 billion \nof that is spent through our Medicaid Program.\n  America has a love-hate relationship with tobacco, and Congress, I \nshould say, and State government does as well. My colleagues will \nrecall that tobacco actually presents a revenue source for the State \nand Federal Government. One of the most recent instances is when \nCongress passed a 60-cent-plus additional tax on tobacco in order to \nfund an expansion of the State Children's Health Insurance Program. So \ngovernment has become addicted to tobacco, too, because of the revenue \nstream it presents, and that is true at the Federal level and at the \nState level.\n  However, because of the political clout of tobacco companies years \nback, when the FDA regulation statute was passed, tobacco was \nspecifically left out of the power of the FDA to regulate this drug. \nThe active ingredient I mentioned is nicotine, which was not \nacknowledged to be an addictive drug for many years until finally the \nSurgeon General did identify it for what it was: an addictive drug that \nmakes it harder for people, once they start smoking, to quit.\n  Then, of course, we tried litigation to control tobacco and the \nspread of marketing tobacco to children and addicting them to this \ndeadly drug, which it is. Then, we found out it had basically no \nimpact, that massive national litigation through the attorneys general \nin the States. Basically, the only thing that happened as a result of \nthat is lawyers got rich, but it didn't do anything to deal with the \nproblem of marketing tobacco to children.\n  One might ask, as a conservative: Why would one support more \nregulation rather than less? Well, because of this split personality \nthe Federal Government has in dealing with tobacco--recognizing it is a \ndeadly drug, recognizing marketing often targets the most vulnerable \namong us, and recognizing the fact that it kills so many people and \nincreases our health care costs not only in Medicare but in Medicaid--\nwhy in the world wouldn't we ban it? I know the Senator from Oklahoma \nhas said maybe the world would be a better place if tobacco wasn't \nlegal. Well, we all know that is a slippery slope for the individual \nchoices we make. If we were to ban tobacco, we might as well ban fatty \nfood; we might as well ban alcohol. Obviously, the government would \nbecome essentially the dictator of what people could and could not do \nand consume, and I don't think the American people would tolerate it \nand I think with some good reason.\n  We have to accept individual responsibility for our choices. But, \nagain, when you target a deadly drug such as tobacco and nicotine--this \naddictive component of tobacco to children--that, to me, crosses the \nline where we ought to say the Federal Government does have a \nresponsibility to allow this legal product, if it is going to remain \nlegal, to be used but under a regulatory regime that will protect the \nmost vulnerable among us.\n  Many States have effective ways to deal with underage use of tobacco. \nI think the regime in my State of Texas works pretty well, but it is \nspotty and not uniform across the country; thus, I think, necessitating \na Federal response.\n  This bill--which, as I say, should be our last resort, and in many \nways it is--increases Federal regulation, I believe, in a responsible \nway, under an imperfect situation, where this legal but deadly drug is \nused by so many people in our country.\n  This bill gives the Food and Drug Administration the authority to \nregulate the manufacturing, marketing, and sale of tobacco products. It \nwould restrict marketing and sales to our young people. It would \nrequire tobacco companies to disclose all the ingredients in their \nproducts to the FDA. There have been various revelations over time that \nthere were actually efforts made by tobacco companies to provide an \nextra dose of the addictive component of tobacco, which is nicotine, in \norder to hook people at a younger age. I think by providing for \ndisclosure of all the ingredients of these products to the FDA, and \nthus to the American people, we can give people at least as much \ninformation as we possibly can to make wise choices with regard to \ntheir use of tobacco, or not, preferably. It would require larger and \nstronger health warnings on tobacco products.\n  This bill would also protect our young people and taxpayers as well. \nSmokers will pay for the enforcement of these regulations through user \nfees on manufacturers of cigarettes, cigarette tobacco, and smokeless \ntobacco products. Nonsmokers will not have to pay any additional taxes \nor fees as a result of this bill.\n  I hope this bill does some good. I think it will. But the key to \nreducing\n\n[[Page S6328]]\n\nsmoking is for individuals to make better choices and for our culture \nto change, as it has already changed, when it comes to consumption of \ntobacco products. I think about other examples over time where our \nculture has changed to where we now do things that are safer and better \ntoday than we used to when I was growing up. For example, when I was \ngrowing up, seatbelt use was very sparse. As a matter of fact, you \ncould buy a car, and if you wanted a seatbelt, you would have to have \nsomebody install it for you because it didn't come as original, \nmanufactured equipment. Today we know seatbelt use is not only much \nbroader and more widely spread, but you can't get into a car and turn \nit on without being dinged to death or otherwise reminded that you need \nto put your seatbelt on. The truth is it has made driving in cars a lot \nsafer. It has kept people healthier, even in spite of accidents they \nhave been involved in, and it has--not coincidentally--helped reduce \nmedical admissions and medical expenses as well.\n  We know there is also today a greater societal stigma against drunk \ndriving. That was not always the case. As a matter of fact, as a result \nof many years of public education and stricter law enforcement, now \npeople take a much smarter and well-informed view of drinking and \nparticularly the risks of drinking and driving. We know also that many \nAmericans, in dealing with energy, are dealing more responsibly by \nrecycling and conserving energy. Of course, millions of Americans are \ntrying to do better when it comes to eating right and exercising more \nfrequently so they can protect their own health and engage in \npreventive medicine, so to speak.\n  Government can't do it all because, as I said earlier, I think \nindividuals bear a responsibility to make good choices. One thing \ngovernment can do is help inform those choices. I think this regulation \nbill will help smokers make better decisions by knowing what is in the \ntobacco product and allowing the FDA to regulate this drug.\n  I believe the real drivers of change, though, are not just the \ngovernment, not the nanny State that will tell us what we can and \ncannot do, but cultural influences and, indeed, economic incentives \nwhich are more powerful than government regulations in influencing \nindividual behavior.\n  Some have said: Why in the world would we give tobacco regulation to \nthe Food and Drug Administration, a Federal agency with the primary job \nof determining safety of food and drugs and medical devices as well as \nefficacy. As a matter of fact, many people have been tempted to buy \nprescription drugs, let's say, over the Internet but not knowing where \nthey were actually manufactured, whether they were actually counterfeit \ndrugs. So there is not only the question of safety--in other words, if \nyou put it in your mouth, is it going to poison you--but it is also if \nyou put it in your mouth and you take it expecting it actually to be \neffective against the medical condition you want to treat. The FDA is a \nregulatory agency that is supposed to determine not only safety of food \nand drugs but also their efficacy.\n  There is a certain anomaly in giving the FDA regulatory authority for \nsomething we know will kill people--and does, in fact, kill hundreds of \nthousands of people--when used as intended by the manufacturer, but I \nthink this is a step in the right direction. I think the world would be \na better place--we would all certainly be healthier--if people chose \nnot to use tobacco, and many have made that choice due to the cultural \ninfluences we have mentioned, as well as some of the economic \nincentives that are provided by employers.\n\n  As we undertake the task of reforming our health system in America, \nsomething that comprises 17 percent of our gross domestic product, I \nthink we could well learn from some of the successful experiences and \nexperiments some employers have used and some workers have used when it \ncomes to drugs such as tobacco. For example, one large grocery company \nheadquartered out in California--Safeway--which also has many employees \nin Texas, as an employer, they noticed that 70 percent of their health \ncare costs were related to individual behavior, things such as diet, \nexercise, and, yes, indeed, smoking. They recognized that if they could \nencourage their employees to get age-appropriate diagnostic procedures \nfor cancer--colon cancer, for example--if they could encourage their \nemployees to quit smoking, if they could encourage their employees to \nwatch their weight and get exercise and to watch their blood pressure \nand take blood pressure medication where indicated, where they could \nencourage them to take cholesterol-lowering medication, if they had \nhigh cholesterol, that they could not only have healthier, more \nproductive employees, they could actually bring down the costs of \nhealth care for their employees as well as their own costs. I think \nSafeway is just one example of many successful innovators across this \ncountry, where people are encouraged to do the right thing for \nthemselves and for their employers and for their families. I think \nthese are the kinds of issues that ought to guide us as we debate \nhealth care reform during the coming weeks.\n  I believe this legislation fills the necessary gap in FDA's \nregulatory authority, an agency that regulates everything from food to \nprescription drugs, to medical devices. The only reason tobacco was \nleft out of it is because of the political clout of tobacco years ago. \nThis legislation fills that gap and I think presents the most pragmatic \napproach to try to deal with the scourge of underage smoking and \nmarketing to children, as well as informing consumers of what they need \nto know in order to make smart choices for their own health and for the \nhealth of their family.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I came to the floor to speak in support \nof the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act and also to \nexpress my gratitude to Senator Kennedy and my colleagues who have \npushed so hard for the consideration of this important bill. I am so \npleased about the vote last night which allowed us to move forward on \nthis bill.\n  This would be a historic accomplishment for this Senate, the House, \nand for the President. I am at a loss to understand how Senators could \nstand in opposition to this important legislation. To prove the point, \nI could ask a couple of questions:\n  What is the leading cause of preventable death in this country, \nkilling over 400,000 Americans a year? The leading cause of preventable \ndeath is tobacco.\n  What causes more deaths than HIV/AIDS, illegal drug use, alcohol use, \nmotor vehicle accidents, suicides, and murders combined? I guess if you \nask people out there, they may not know that the answer is tobacco.\n  What are the only products on the market that kill one-third of their \npurchasers? Madam President, if you had a health device or any product \nthat kills one-third of its purchasers, we would outlaw that product in \na heartbeat. We are not outlawing tobacco; we are simply saying tobacco \nneeds to be controlled by the FDA. Remember, the only product on the \nmarket that kills one-third of its purchasers is tobacco, if used as \ndirected.\n  I could go on and on with these rhetorical questions. Clearly, we \nknow tobacco is the only product on the market that is advertised and \nsold without any government oversight.\n  I don't understand how 35 or so of our colleagues think the answer to \nour pushing for this is no. But then again, that is the answer we get \nback from the other side of the aisle a lot. I am very grateful to the \neight or nine Republicans who joined us. Without them,\n\n[[Page S6329]]\n\nwe wouldn't be here today. As I did on the stimulus, thanking those \nthree who had the bravery to say yes, I thank the eight or nine who had \nthe bravery to say yes and move to regulate tobacco. Food is regulated. \nDrugs are regulated. Consumer products are regulated. Tobacco is not. \nWe know this bill could prevent 80,000 tobacco-related deaths every \nyear.\n  It makes me sad to think that over the years our failure to address \nthis issue is having the greatest impact on our Nation's children. \nNinety percent of all new smokers are children. I have spoken to the \ntobacco executives and watched them being interviewed. ``Oh, we just \ndon't want kids to get our products.'' Please. It is embarrassing that \nthey can say that with a straight face when they have invented all \nkinds of new products, including tobacco candy. You know, there is an \nold cliche that ``this is so easy, it is like giving candy to a baby.'' \nWe know kids love candy, and what happens if you lace that candy with \nan addictive product? The answer is that we get a lot of kids hooked on \ntobacco who cannot quit when they get older.\n  Claims by the tobacco industry that these products are safe \nalternatives to smoking and they are not designed to attract kids, \nfrankly, just don't add up. You know what they are doing. We know adult \nsmokers are finally saying no; they are quitting, thank goodness. It is \nvery difficult. I have watched it up close with family and friends, and \nsome of them who quit for 2, 3 years go right back again, and it is \nworse than ever. This isn't easy. Don't say you are creating a safer \nproduct when you create tobacco candy, a smokeless tobacco. We know \nsmokeless tobacco can lead to oral cancer, gum disease, heart attacks, \nheart disease, cancer of the esophagus, and cancer of the stomach. \nSmokeless tobacco products are only the latest effort by the tobacco \ncompanies to market tobacco products that they claim pose a reduced \nrisk.\n  Cigarettes contain 69 known carcinogens and hundreds of other \ningredients that contribute to the risk of all of the diseases I \nmentioned. Yet the tobacco industry is not required to list the \ningredients of its products as all food products have to do. We have a \nright to know the calories, sugar, protein, and all those things when \nwe eat food, but for cigarettes they don't have to list the \ningredients.\n  The bill will make it so that we finally know what is contained in \nthese products. The legislation will grant the FDA the authority to ban \nthe most harmful chemicals used in tobacco and even to reduce the \namount of nicotine.\n  A 2006 Harvard School of Public Health study revealed that the \naverage amount of nicotine in cigarettes actually rose 11.8 percent \nfrom 1997 to 2005. How can my colleagues on the other side, who voted \npretty much en masse against this bill, say we should just keep it open \nto amendment? How can they explain that even after all these years, now \nthat we know the risks of tobacco? There were reasons in the early \nyears when we didn't know how serious it was. That is one thing. But \nhere they have a situation where recently they raised the amount of \nnicotine. There is no rhyme or reason for that.\n  This bill will give the FDA the authority to require stronger warning \nlabels, prevent industry misrepresentations, and regulate ``reduced \nharm'' claims about tobacco products. If you die because you use \nsmokeless tobacco but say you die from a heart attack, you are still \ndead. This Congress and the President have committed to reducing health \ncare costs through comprehensive reform. This legislation is such an \nimportant step on the way because lung cancer is a preventable disease. \nIt is preventable, as well as the heart risks associated with smoking. \nInvesting in prevention and wellness will enable us to increase access \nto quality health care while reducing costs.\n  Tobacco use results in $96 billion in annual health care costs, and \nin California alone--my State--we spend $9.1 billion on smoking-related \nhealth care costs. Everybody who has a heartbeat and a pulse today \nknows that my State suffers mightily from a terrible budget crisis--$20 \nbillion. We don't know where to look, what to do. People never put \ntogether the fact that smoking is causing our health care costs to \nswell. If my State could save $9.1 billion on smoking-related health \ncare costs, that really saves the education system and a lot of other \nimportant things we do in our State.\n  Preventive medicine and giving the authority to the FDA to vigorously \nenforce some strict, new laws about cigarettes is going to make a \npositive difference. I am proud to be here in support of this important \nlegislation.\n  I wish to say again to Senator Kennedy, if he is watching this \ndebate, how much I respect, admire, and miss him and his presence here \non this bill. If he were here, he would be roaring from the back of the \nChamber about this, in the best of ways, and challenging us to move \nforward on this bill as quickly as we can.\n  The House has acted. Once the Senate acts, we can have a conference--\nor maybe the House will take the Senate bill--and this bill will be on \nthe President's desk before we do health care reform. Imagine what a \ngreat preamble this would be to health care reform--tackling this \nincredible problem in our society, tobacco use, an incredible problem \nin our society that causes so much suffering and dependence and so much \naddiction, so much cost--if we are able to tackle this as a preamble to \nour health care reform, I would be so proud. I know each and every one \nof us who will support this will be very proud. I know President Obama \nwill be very proud. He has struggled with tobacco addiction. He knows \nhow tough it is to say no to cigarettes. Clearly, the best way is to \nprevent someone from getting addicted in the first place.\n  I don't want my grandkids being lured into smoking by looking at a \nbox of candy cigarettes and trying one, two, three, and four. I don't \nwant that for anybody's grandkids. If people decide when they are \nolder, when they know all of the facts, that they are going to smoke, \nin many ways that is their problem. But it is our job to let them know \nthe risks and dangers. Very clearly, we have been dancing around the \nedges with these little warning labels, but we have not controlled \ntobacco. We need to do that.\n  I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle--again, \nthanking the eight or nine Republicans for joining us--to make an \ninvestment in the health of the American people and support this \nlegislation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, for the sake of my colleagues, I want to \ntalk about the timing of the Judge Sotomayor nomination.\n  I talked with the distinguished ranking member last week on this \nschedule, and I would note the concerns he raised, but I am announcing \ntoday that the Senate Judiciary Committee will hold the confirmation \nhearing on the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be Associate \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court on July 13.\n  I have talked and met with Senator Sessions, the committee's ranking \nmember, several times to discuss the scheduling of this hearing. I will \ncontinue to consult with Senator Sessions\n\n[[Page S6330]]\n\nto ensure that we hold a fair hearing. We were able to work \ncooperatively to send a bipartisan questionnaire to Judge Sotomayor \nwithin one day of her designation by President Obama. Last week the \ncommittee received her response to that questionnaire. We also received \nother background information from the administration, as well as the \nofficial Presidential nomination.\n  This is a reasonable schedule. It will be the middle of next month. \nIt is in line with past experience. It will allow several more weeks \nfor committee members to prepare for the hearing--several more weeks \nthan if I had held the hearing this month--and there is no reason to \nunduly delay the consideration of this well-qualified nominee. Judge \nSotomayor deserves the opportunity to go before the public and speak of \nher record, especially as some have mischaracterized and misstated it. \nThe only place she can speak of her record is in a hearing.\n  It is also a responsible schedule that serves the many interests \ninvolved. Of course, first and foremost is the American people's stake \nin a process that is fair and thorough but not needlessly prolonged. It \nserves the purpose of the institution of the Senate, where we need \nsufficient time to prepare for a confirmation hearing. We have a full \nlegislative plate of additional pressing business in the weeks and \nmonths ahead that is of great importance to our constituents and to the \nNation. Then, of course, it serves the need of the third branch of \ngovernment, which depends on the other branches of government to fill \ncourt vacancies in our independent judiciary. It serves the needs of \nthe President who has nominated Judge Sotomayor. And lest we forget, it \nserves the needs of the nominee herself, who as a judge will only be \nable to speak publicly about her record when the hearings are convened.\n  This is an extremely important obligation that we as Members of the \nSenate take on. There are only 101 people who get a direct say in the \nnomination and confirmation of a Justice of the Supreme Court. First \nand foremost, of course, the President of the United States--and in \nthis case, President Obama consulted with numerous Senators, \nRepublicans and Democrats alike--prior to making his nomination. Then \nonce the nomination is made, 100 Members of the Senate have to stand in \nfor 300 million Americans in deciding who will get that lifetime \nappointment. I voted on every single current member of the Supreme \nCourt, as well as some in the past, and I know how important an \nobligation that is.\n  The Justice who takes Justice Souter's place for the court session \nthat convenes October 5 also needs as much time as possible to hire law \nclerks, to set up an office, to find a place to live here in \nWashington, and to take part with the rest of the Court in the \npreparatory work that precedes the formal start of the session on the \nfirst Monday in October.\n  I mention that because I have put together a schedule that tracks the \nprocess the Senate followed, by bipartisan agreement, in considering \nPresident Bush's nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court in \n2005. At that time, I served as the ranking minority member of the \nJudiciary Committee. I met with our Republican chairman, and we worked \nout a schedule which provided for Chief Justice Roberts' hearing 48 \ndays after he was named by President Bush.\n  I might say that the agreement on time was reached even before the \ncommittee received the answers to the bipartisan questionnaire. And \nwhile Justice Roberts--then Judge Roberts--had not written as many \nopinions as Judge Sotomayor, he had been in a political policy position \nin Republican administrations for years before, and there were 75,000 \npages of documents from that time. In fact, some arrived almost on the \neve of the hearing itself. And, of course, that nomination replaced \nJustice O'Connor, who was recognized as a pivotal vote on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  If something that significant required 48 days, and Republicans and \nDemocrats agreed that was sufficient to prepare for that hearing, in \naccordance with our agreement on the initial schedule, certainly that \nis a precedent that says we have more than adequate time to prepare for \nthe confirmation hearing for Judge Sotomayor.\n  My initial proposal to Senator Sessions was that we begin the hearing \non July 7, following the Senate's return from the Fourth of July \nrecess. I have deferred the start date to July 13 in an effort to \naccommodate our Republican members. With bipartisan cooperation, we \nshould still be able to complete Judiciary Committee consideration of \nthe nomination during the last week in July, and allow the Senate to \nconsider the nomination during the first week in August, before the \nSenate recesses on August 7.\n  In selecting the date, I am trying to be fair to all concerned. I \nwant to be fair to the nominee, allowing her the earliest possible \nopportunity to respond to attacks made about her character. It is not \nfair for critics to be calling her racist--one even equating her with \nthe head of the Ku Klux Klan, an outrageous comment, and both \nRepublicans and Democrats have said it was outrageous--without allowing \nher the opportunity to speak to it, and she can't speak to it until she \nis in the hearing.\n  I also want to conclude the process without unnecessary delay so that \nshe might participate fully in the deliberations of the Supreme Court \nselecting cases and preparing for its new term. In his May 1 letter to \nPresident Obama, Justice Souter announced his resignation effective \n``when the Supreme Court rises for the summer recess this year,'' which \nwill happen later this month. Thereafter, the Supreme Court prepares \nfor the next term. To participate fully in the upcoming deliberations, \nit would be helpful for his successor to be confirmed and able to take \npart in the selection of cases as well in preparing for their argument.\n  I am merely following the timeline we followed with the Roberts \nnomination. The timeline for the Alito nomination provides no reason to \ndelay the hearing for Judge Sotomayor. It presented a very different \nsituation in many ways. For one thing, that nomination was made with no \nconsultation by President Bush. By contrast, President Obama devoted \nseveral weeks to consultation with both Republicans and Democrats \nbefore making his selection. The Alito nomination was President Bush's \nthird nomination to succeed Justice O'Connor. It followed 4 months of \nintense effort by the Judiciary Committee, beginning with Justice \nO'Connor's announcement on July 1. And finally, the Christmas holidays \nhelped account for the timing of those hearings. I do not believe \nBastille Day requires us to delay the confirmation hearings for the \nfirst Hispanic nominated to the Supreme Court for an additional 6 \nweeks.\n  Some may recall that Justice O'Connor's resignation in 2005 was \ncontingent on the ``nomination and confirmation of [her] successor.'' \nShe continued to serve on the Supreme Court when its new term began in \nOctober 2005, and until Justice Alito was confirmed at the end of \nJanuary 2006. In addition, proceedings to fill that vacancy involved a \nmore extended process, not only because Justice O'Connor represented a \npivotal vote on the Supreme Court on so many issues, but because \nPresident Bush first nominated John Roberts and then withdrew that \nnomination, then nominated Harriet Miers and withdrew her nomination \nwhen Republicans and conservatives revolted, and finally nominated \nSamuel Alito. The nomination of Judge Alito was the third Supreme Court \nnomination that the Senate was asked to consider, and followed the \nwithdrawal of the Miers nomination by only 3 days.\n  Given that sequence of events, and the then upcoming Christmas \nholiday, that hearing on the late October nomination of Samuel Alito \nwas appropriately scheduled by the Republican Chairman to begin after \nthe New Year. In addition, Judge Alito did not return his questionnaire \nuntil November 30. His hearing was held 40 days after his questionnaire \nwas returned, which includes the Christmas and the holiday period. That \nis substantially equivalent to the 39 days between the time receipt of \nJudge Sotomayor's questionnaire response and her hearing.\n\n  Of course, in the case of the current nomination, Judge Sotomayor had \nbeen reported to be a leading candidate for the vacancy as soon as it \narose on May 1, and her record was being studied from at least that \ntime forward. The right wing groups attacking her were doing so long \nbefore she was named by the President on May 26, and those attacks have \nintensified since her designation.\n\n[[Page S6331]]\n\n  I do not want to see this historic nomination of Sonia Sotomayor \ntreated unfairly or less fairly than the Senate treated the nomination \nof John Roberts. In 2005, when President Bush made his first nomination \nto the Supreme Court, Senator McConnell, who was the majority whip, \nsaid the Senate should consider and confirm the nominations within 60 \nto 70 days. We worked hard to achieve that.\n  The nomination of Judge Sotomayor should more easily be considered \nwithin that timeframe. Judge Sotomayor has been nominated to succeed \nJustice Souter, a like-minded, independent and fair Justice, not bound \nby ideology, but one who decided each case on its merits and in \naccordance with the rule of law. We have the added benefit of her \ncareer being one that includes her service on the judiciary for the \npast 17 years. Her judicial decisions are matters of the public record. \nIndeed, when my staff assembled her written opinions and offered them \nto the Republican staff, they declined, because they already had them \nand were reviewing them. We have the benefit of her judicial record \nbeing public and well known to us. We have the benefit of her record \nhaving been a subject of review for the last month, since at least May \n1, when she was mentioned as a leading candidate to succeed Justice \nSouter. We have the benefit of having considered and confirmed her \ntwice before, first when nominated to be a judge by a Republican \nPresident and then when elevated to the circuit court by a Democratic \nPresident. We have the benefit of not having to search through \nPresidential libraries for work papers of the nominee. By contrast, the \n75,000 pages of work papers for John Roberts required extensive time \nand effort to retrieve them from Presidential libraries and to overcome \nclaims of privilege. In fact, they were still being received just days \nbefore the hearing.\n  To delay Judge Sotomayor's hearing until September would double the \namount of time that Republicans and Democrats agreed was adequate to \nprepare for Judge Roberts' hearing. That would not be fair or \nappropriate. That would not be equal treatment.\n  Unlike the late July nomination of John Roberts, this nomination of \nJudge Sotomayor by President Obama was announced in May. Unlike the \nresignation of Justice O'Connor that was not announced until July, the \nretirement of Justice Souter was made official on May 1. Given that the \nvacancy arose 2 months earlier, and the nomination was made after \nbipartisan consultation 2 months earlier, by following the Roberts \nroadmap, we should be able to complete the process 2 months earlier. We \nshould be able to complete the entire process by the scheduled recess \ndate of August 7.\n  Of course, while the Roberts nomination was pending, Chief Justice \nRehnquist passed away and President Bush decided to withdraw the \ninitial nomination to be an Associate Justice, and proceeded to \nnominate John Roberts to succeed the Chief Justice, instead. We did not \ninsist that the process start over; rather, we continued to move \nforward. It was the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, with its \ndestruction and toll in damage and human life, that pushed the start of \nthe hearings back 1 week, by bipartisan agreement.\n  We were still able to complete Senate consideration and the Senate \nconfirmed John Roberts to be the Chief Justice 72 days after he was \ninitially designated to be an Associate Justice. We did this despite \nthe fact his initial nomination was withdrawn and only shortly before \nhis hearing he was renominated to serve as the Chief Justice of the \nSupreme Court. And we did this despite the terrible aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina, where everybody--Republicans and Democrats alike--\nagreed that we should hold back a week on the hearings so we could all \nconcentrate the Nation's resources on Hurricane Katrina. So that \nrequired a week's delay. If we followed the same schedule, 72 days \nafter Judge Sotomayor was nominated to the Supreme Court would be \nAugust 6--and we will not have to lose 7 of those days to Hurricane \nKatrina.\n  Her historic nomination should be treated as fairly as the nomination \nof John Roberts was treated by the Senate. Given the outrageous attacks \non Judge Sotomayor's character, I do not think it fair to delay her \nhearing. I cringed when I was told that, during the courtesy visit \nJudge Sotomayor paid to Senator McConnell, reporters shouted questions \nabout conservatives calling her a racist. She had to sit there silently \nand could not respond. She deserves that opportunity as soon as \npossible.\n  The hearing is the opportunity for all Senators on the Judiciary \nCommittee, both Republicans and Democrats, to ask questions, to raise \nconcerns, and to evaluate the nominee. As Senator Sessions' Saturday \nradio speech ably demonstrates, Republican Senators are already \nprepared to ask their questions. Last week, we were considering another \njudicial nomination at the meeting of the Judiciary Committee when \nSenator Kyl suggested that he may oppose all of President Obama's \nnominees given what he views as the criteria President Obama is \nconsidering in selecting them. Republicans have questioned whether her \nrecognition that she brings her life experience with her, as all judges \ndo, is somehow disqualifying.\n  Our Republican colleagues have said they intend to ask her about her \njudicial philosophy. It doesn't take a month to prepare to ask these \nquestions. In fact, most of them have already raised the questions. \nThey will surely be prepared to ask them more than a month from now. \nAnd during that month, we have a week's vacation from the Senate. I \nintend to be using that week--without the interruption of committee \nhearings, without the interruption of votes, without the interruption \nof the regular Senate business--to prepare for the hearings. I would \nadvise those Senators who feel they have to have extra time to forgo \nyour vacation and spend that week preparing for the hearing. Holding \nJudge Sotomayor's hearing on July 13 will, in effect, afford 10 weeks \nfor them to have prepared.\n  Because this is a historic nomination, I hope all Senators will \ncooperate. It is a schedule that I think is both fair and adequate--\nfair to the nominee, but also adequate for the Senate to prepare for \nthe hearing and Senate consideration. There is no reason to indulge in \nneedless and unreasonable delay.\n  I say this is a historic nomination because it should unite and not \ndivide the American people and the Senate. Hers is a distinctly \nAmerican story. Whether you are from the south Bronx or the south side \nof Chicago or south Burlington, VT, the American dream inspires all of \nus. Her life story is the American dream. And so, I might add, is the \njourney of the President who nominated her.\n  Some are simply spoiling for a fight. There have been too many unfair \nattacks, people unfairly calling her racist and bigoted. I know Sonia \nSotomayor, and nothing could be further from the truth. These are some \nof the same people who vilify Justice Souter and Justice O'Connor. \nAmericans deserve better. There are others who have questioned her \ncharacter and temperament. She deserves a fair hearing, not a trial by \nattack and assaults upon her character. So let's proceed to give her \nthat fair hearing without unnecessary delay.\n  I am also disappointed that some have taken to suggesting that after \n17 years as a Federal judge, including 11 as a member of the U.S. Court \nof Appeals for the Second Circuit, Judge Sotomayor does not understand \n``the judge's role.'' I know her to be a restrained and thoughtful \njudge. She has reportedly agreed with judges appointed by Republican \nPresidents 95 percent of the time. Let us respect her achievements, her \nexperience and her understanding. Let no one demean this extraordinary \nwoman or her understanding of the constitutional duties she has \nfaithfully performed for the last 17 years. I urge all Senators to join \nwith me to fulfill our constitutional duties with respect.\n  I have said many times on the floor of this great body over my 35 \nyears here that as Senators we should be the conscience of the Nation, \nas we are called upon to be. There have been occasions when this \nSenate--Republicans and Democrats alike--has united and shown they can \nbe the conscience of the Nation. I would say this is one time we should \nrise above partisanship and be that conscience.\n  When I met with Judge Sotomayor, I asked her about her approach to \nthe law. She answered that, of course, one's life experience shapes who \nyou are, but ultimately and completely--\n\n[[Page S6332]]\n\nher words--as a judge, you follow the law. There is not one law for one \nrace or another. There is not one law for one color or another. There \nis not one law for rich, a different one for poor. There is not one law \nfor those who belong to one political party or another. There is one \nlaw for all Americans. And she made it very emphatic that as a judge, \nyou follow that one law.\n  There is only one law. We all know that. She said, ultimately and \ncompletely a judge has to follow the law, no matter what their \nupbringing has been. That is the kind of fair and impartial judging \nthat the American people expect. That is respect for the rule of law. \nThat is the kind of judge she has been.\n  The purpose of the hearing is to allow Senators to ask questions and \nraise their concerns. It is also the time the American people can see \nthe nominee, consider her temperament and evaluate her character, too. \nI am disappointed that some Republican Senators have declared that they \nwill vote no on this historic nomination and have made that \nannouncement before giving the nominee a fair chance to be heard at her \nhearing. It is incumbent on us to allow the nominee an opportunity to \nbe considered fairly and allow her to respond to false criticism of her \nrecord and her character. Those who are critical and have doubts should \nsupport the promptest possible hearing. That is where questions can be \nasked and answered. That is why we hold hearings.\n  Judge Sotomayor is extraordinarily well equipped to serve on the \nNation's highest court. To borrow the phrase that the First Lady used \nlast week, not only do I believe that Judge Sotomayor is prepared to \nserve all Americans on the Supreme Court, I believe the country is more \nthan ready to see this accomplished Hispanic woman do just that. This \nis a historic nomination, and it is an occasion for the Senate and our \ngreat Nation to come together. This is the time for us to come \ntogether.\n\n  The process is another step toward the American people regaining \nconfidence in their judiciary. Our independent judiciary is considered \nto be the envy of the world. Though less visible than the other two \nbranches, the judiciary is a vital part of the infrastructure that \nknits our Nation together under the rule of law. Every time I walk up \nthe steps into the Supreme Court, I look at the words over the entrance \nto the Supreme Court. They are engraved in marble from my native State \nof Vermont. Those words say: ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' The \nnomination of Judge Sotomayor keeps faith with that model.\n  Her experience as a trial court judge will be important. Only Justice \nSouter of those currently on the Supreme Court previously served as a \ntrial court judge. Judge Sotomayor has the added benefit of having been \nin law enforcement as a tough prosecutor who received her early \ntraining in the office of the longtime and storied New York District \nAttorney, Robert Morgenthau.\n  I appreciate that she has shown restraint as a judge. We do not need \nanother Supreme Court Justice intent on second-guessing Congress, \nundercutting laws passed to benefit Americans and protect their \nliberties, and making light of judicial precedent.\n  President Obama handled the selection process with the care that the \nAmerican people expect and deserve, and met with Senators from both \nsides of the aisle. Senator Sessions suggested to the President that it \nwas important to nominate someone with a judicial record. Judge \nSotomayor has more judicial experience than any nominee in recent \nhistory.\n  I wanted someone outside the judicial monastery, and whose \nexperiences were not limited to those in the rarified air of the \nFederal appellate courts. Her background as someone who was largely \nraised by a working mother in the South Bronx, who has never forgotten \nwhere she came from, means a great deal to me. Judge Sotomayor has a \nfirst-rate legal mind and impeccable credentials. I think she combines \nthe best of what Senator Sessions and I recommended that the President \nlook for in his nominee.\n  The Supreme Court's decisions have a fundamental impact on Americans' \neveryday lives. One need look no further than the Lilly Ledbetter and \nDiana Levine cases to understand how just one vote can determine the \nCourt's decision and impact the lives and freedoms of countless \nAmericans.\n  I believe Judge Sotomayor will continue to do what she has always \ndone as a judge--applying the law to the case before her. I do not \nbelieve she will act in the mold of conservative activists who second-\nguess Congress and undercut laws meant to protect Americans from \ndiscrimination in their jobs and in voting, to protect the access of \nAmericans to health care and education, and to protect their privacy \nfrom an overreaching government.\n  I believe Judge Sotomayor understands that the courthouse doors must \nbe as open to ordinary Americans as they are to government and big \ncorporations.\n  President Obama is to be commended for having consulted with Senators \nfrom both sides of the aisle. I was with him on some of the occasions \nthat he did. I have had Senators come up to me, Republican Senators, \nand tell me they had never been called by a President of their own \nparty, to say nothing of a Democratic President, to talk about a \nSupreme Court nominee. But President Obama did call and reach out.\n  Now it is the Senate's duty to come to the fore. I believe all \nSenators, of both parties, will work with me to consider this \nnomination in a fair and timely manner.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, in 1945, President Truman delivered a \nspeech to a joint session of Congress, in which he declared:\n\n       Millions of our citizens do not now have a full measure of \n     opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health. Millions do not \n     now have protection or security against the economic effects \n     of sickness. The time has arrived for action to help them \n     attain that opportunity and that protection.\n\n  That was said by President Truman, 10 or 11 Presidents ago, perhaps \nsix decades ago, and 64 years later we are still fighting to provide \nthat opportunity and that protection.\n  A severely weakened economy, growing unemployment, rising health care \nand health insurance costs, and declining employment-based insurance \nare all factors contributing to the current health care crisis. Today, \n47 million Americans are uninsured. An additional 25, 30, 35, as many \nas 40 million Americans are underinsured and millions of Americans are \neither underinsured or uninsured and are saddled with catastrophic \nmedical debt.\n  Closing the health care gap will dramatically improve the public's \nhealth. It will also lead predictability to national health spending, \nwhich is essential if we are going to get health care costs under \ncontrol.\n  Closing the health care gap would dramatically reduce personal \nbankruptcies, more than half of which result from catastrophic illness \nand the huge bills that go with it.\n  Think about that for a moment. Most bankruptcies in this country are \nbecause people have had health care bills they simply cannot pay. Most \nof those people have those health care bills which they cannot pay \nwhich then force them into bankruptcy. Most of those people have health \ninsurance, but it is inadequate and has too many gaps in it.\n  Closing the health care gap is a short-term and a long-term \ninvestment in the health of Americans, the health of U.S. businesses--\nbusinesses whose premiums are inflated by the costs of uncompensated \ncare. It is an investment in the health of our economy, which benefits \nfrom the health care industry but not from already too high health care \ncosts, further inflated by needless red tape, needless duplication, \nneedless indifference to health care needs that become more serious and \nmore costly when they are not caught early.\n  Per capita health care spending in the United States is 53 percent \nhigher here than that of any other nation in the world, and we are the \nonly nation\n\n[[Page S6333]]\n\nin the world without an insurance system to cover everyone. In other \nwords, we are paying at least half again as much--at least--as any \nother country in the world per person. Yet millions, tens of millions \nof Americans, do not have health insurance. Life expectancy, infant \nmortality, maternal mortality, immunization rates--we are not among the \nworld leaders in any of those categories.\n  Interestingly, the only place we are a world leader is life \nexpectancy at 65. If you get to be 65 in this country, the chance that \nyou will live a longer, healthier life is greater than in almost any \nother country in the world.\n  In Ohio, $3.5 billion is spent each year by and on behalf of the \nuninsured for health care that meets about half their needs. For the \nfirst time, we are on the verge of meaningful health care reform that \nwill make a difference in the lives of Americans who have, for too \nlong, put up with less than they deserve when it comes to health care. \nOur health insurance system does some things very well, but we have let \nthe industry, the health care industry, forget its own core central \npurpose.\n  The insurance industry is supposed to bear risks on behalf of its \nenrollees, not avoid risk at the expense of its enrollees.\n  The insurance industry is supposed to protect the sick, not throw \nthem overboard.\n  The insurance industry is supposed to offer affordable coverage to \nevery American, not expensive coverage to some Americans and no \ncoverage to the rest.\n  The insurance industry is supposed to cover the reasonable and \ncustomary costs of health care, not a fraction of that.\n  The health insurance industry is supposed to cover the doctors you \nneed, not the doctors the insurer chooses for you.\n  The insurance industry is supposed to pay claims on a timely basis, \nnot as slowly as they possibly can.\n  Who can forget, when Senator Obama was talking about his mother in \nthe last months of her life, how as she suffered and was dying from \nterminal cancer, she spent much of her time on the phone trying to \nfigure out how to collect on insurance, how to pay, how to simply get \nby and not leave debt for her soon to be very famous son.\n  The health insurance industry does some things pretty well, but it \ngets away with too much. What do we do about it? First, we put stronger \ninsurance rules in place. Second, we introduce some good old-fashioned \ncompetition into the insurance market. That is the purpose of a \nfederally backed insurance option, one the Presiding Officer from New \nYork has spoken out for, as has the other Senator from New York and a \nmajority of people in this body. It is to set the bar high enough for \nprivate insurers that they can't slip back into their risk-avoiding \nways without taking a hit in the marketplace. In other words, we need \ninsurance company rules on preexisting conditions, on changing the way \nwe do community rating, on a whole host of rules to make insurance \ncompanies behave better and serve the public better.\n  We also need this federally backed insurance option because all too \noften insurance companies are a step ahead of the sheriff. They always \ncan figure out how to stay ahead of the rules that try to make them \nbehave in a way that is more in the public interest.\n  The purpose of establishing a federally backed insurance option--it \nis an option--is to give Americans more choices and to give the private \ninsurance industry an incentive to play fair with their enrollees, or \ntheir enrollees will look elsewhere, perhaps in the public plan.\n  Private insurers have helped to create a system of winners and \nlosers--a system in which insured Americans can still be bankrupted by \nhealth expenses and uninsured Americans can still die far too young \nbecause they cannot get the health care they need.\n  Insurance companies have always been one step ahead of the sheriff. \nThey have given us no reason to believe they will behave any \ndifferently. They have come to Congress this year and said: You can put \nsome new rules on us. But when we have done that in the past, we know \nthey have always found a way to avoid some of those rules that do not \nserve their bottom line. And it is their bottom line, and I do not even \nblame the insurance companies for acting the way they do. I just say we \nneed a set of rules to make sure they act in the public interest.\n  Private insurance market reforms, coupled with the creation of a \ncompetitive, federally backed health insurance option--it is an option, \njust as it will be an option, once we pass health insurance, that \nanybody today can stay in the insurance plan they have. Nobody is going \nto be forced to do anything they do not want to do. Private insurance \nmarket reforms, coupled with the creation of a competitive, federally \nbacked health insurance option represents our best hope at achieving \nthe health reforms so vital to the health of our citizens and the \nfuture of our Nation.\n  Last week, President Obama sent a letter to Chairman Kennedy of the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, on which I sit, and \nto Chairman Max Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, the other \nhealth care committee here, in which the President stated:\n\n       I strongly believe that Americans should have the choice of \n     a public health insurance option operating alongside private \n     plans. This will give them--\n\n  Will give American citizens--\n\n     a better range of choices, make the health care market more \n     competitive and keep insurance companies honest.\n\n  A public health insurance option--not administered by a private for-\nprofit insurance company but a public health insurance option--is one \nof the necessary components of health reform.\n  There is no better way to keep the private insurance industry honest \nthan to make sure they are not the only game in town. Historically, \npublic health insurance has outperformed private insurance in \npreserving access to stable and reliable health care, in reining in \ncosts, in cutting down on bureaucracy, and in pioneering new payment \nand quality-improvement methods.\n  A public health insurance option will not neglect sparsely populated \nand rural areas, as insurers too often do. The Presiding Officer \npreviously represented a rural congressional district in New York. She \nknows the problems of insurance availability in rural areas. It will \nnot disappear.\n  A public health insurance option will not disappear when an American \nloses her job, when a marriage ends, or when a dependent becomes an \nadult. And the pages sitting here in front of me, when they finish \nschool and go into the workplace, they would have an option. Once they \nare no longer dependent on their parents, they will have that public \noption, as other Americans will.\n  A public health insurance option will not deny claims first and ask \nquestions later, as insurance companies too often do. It will not look \nfor any and every loophole to insure the healthy and avoid the sick, as \nprivate insurance companies too often do.\n  These are the fundamental reasons why a public plan option is the \nkey--is the key--to arriving at a health insurance system that better \nserves every American, insured and uninsured alike. What is the point \nof health care reform if we do not do it right and make sure every \nAmerican citizen is better served than they are now in this health \ninsurance market?\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6333-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6333-S6334]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak briefly about two \nissues, and I know Senator Burr wants to continue his discussion of the \nFDA tobacco bill.\n  There are two issues which are very significant to the American \ntaxpayer, especially to those of us who are concerned about how much \ndebt this administration is running up on our children, and they need \nto be highlighted.\n  The first is good news. It looks as though a number of banks are \ngoing to repay a fair percentage of the TARP money that has been put \nout by the administration--potentially $65 billion. When TARP was \noriginally structured, the understanding was that we would buy assets \nin banks or from banks, and at some point we would get that money back \nas taxpayers. In fact, we would get it back with interest. This is what \nis happening now. The money is coming back, as these banks have \nrestored their fiscal strength, and it is actually coming back with \ninterest. About $4.5 billion on top of the money we have put out, is my \nunderstanding, as to what will be paid back on the interest side \nrelative to the preferred stock. So that is all good news.\n  First, the financial system was stabilized during a cataclysmic \nperiod in September and October, and the investments which remained in \npreferred stock, with taxpayers' money, is now being repaid.\n  The issue becomes, however, what are we going to do with this money \nthat is coming back into the Treasury? Well, it ought to go to reduce \nthe debt. This administration in recent days has been giving at least \nlipservice to the fact that the budget they put in place, with a $1 \ntrillion deficit over the next 10 years on average every year--$1 \ntrillion every year for the next 10 years, of doubling the debt in 5 \nyears, of tripling it in 10 years--they have been giving lipservice \nthat they understand that is not a sustainable situation. The Secretary \nof the Treasury, the Chief Economic Counsel, and even the President \nhave said the budget they proposed is not sustainable because the debt \nthat is being run up on the American public cannot be afforded by our \nchildren. It goes from what has historically been about 35 percent of \nthe gross national product up to over 82 percent of the gross national \nproduct. The interest on the debt alone at the end of this budget which \nthe President proposed will be $800 billion a year--$800 billion a \nyear--just in interest payments that the American people will have to \npay. That will actually exceed any other major item of discretionary \nspending in the budget. We will be spending less than that on the \nnational defense. We will be spending more on interest, in other words, \nthan we spend on national defense because of all of the debt that is \nbeing run up.\n  Well, if this administration is serious--and I am not sure they are; \nI think they are basically holding press conferences because they did \nsomething else today which implies that--if they are actually serious \nabout trying to address this debt issue, then they should immediately \ntake the $65 billion they are going to get back from the banks to which \nmoney was lent and that was put out by taxpayers and knew we would get \nback, they should immediately take that money and apply it to reducing \nthe Federal debt. It should not be spent on other programs. It \nshouldn't even be recycled through the financial system.\n  It should be repaid to the taxpayer by reducing the debt of the \nUnited States. That is the only reasonable way to approach it. It would \nbe a tremendously strong signal not only to the American taxpayers that \nthis administration is serious about doing something on the debt side, \nbut it would be a strong signal to the world markets that we were \nwilling, as a nation, to take this money and pay down the debt. \nIronically, it would also follow the proposal of the original TARP \nbill, which said that after the financial system was stabilized, any \nmoneys coming in should be used to reduce the deficit and debt of the \nUnited States. It certainly should not be used to fund new ventures \ninto the private sector, whether it is buying automobile companies or \ninsurance companies or anything else such as that. It should be simply \nused to reduce the debt.\n  I hope the administration will do that because that would follow the \nlaw, and it would be a good sign to the world markets, which are \nbecoming suspicious of our debt, as we have seen in a number of \ninstances--for example, the cost of 10-year bills, 30-year bills, and \nalso the fact that the Chinese leadership, in the financial area, \nexpressed concern about the purchase of the long-term debt of the \nUnited States. It would also be a positive sign to Americans that we \nare going to do something about this debt we are passing on to our \nkids.\n  It is unfair to run up a trillion dollars a year of deficit, double \nthe debt in 5 years, and triple it in 10 years, and send all those \nbills to our kids. These young students here today as pages, in 10 \nyears, will find the household they are living in has a new $30,000 \nmortgage on it, and it is called the bill for the Federal debt. They \nwill have a new $6,500 interest payment that they will have to make, \nwhich is called the interest they have to support on the Federal debt. \nIt is not appropriate to do that to these younger Americans and to the \nnext generation. Let's take the $65 billion and use it as it was \noriginally agreed it would be used, which is when it came back into the \nTreasury, with interest, which is pretty good, it would be used to pay \ndown the debt.\n  Why am I suspicious that this administration is giving us lip service \non the issue of fiscal discipline? There is a second thing that \nhappened today. The President today came out and held a big press \nconference about how he was for pay-go. I have not heard a Democratic \ncandidate for Congress, and now the President of the United States, not \nclaim they are going to exercise fiscal discipline here by being for \npay-go, because the term has such motherhood implications, that you are \ngoing to pay for what you do here. It is total hypocrisy, inconsistent \nwith everything that has happened from the other side of the aisle in \nthe era of spending and budgeting. Not only do they not support pay-go, \nthey punch holes in what we have for our pay-go law.\n  In the last 2\\1/2\\ years, this Congress--and now in the last 3, 4, or \n5 months--and this Presidency have passed--democratically controlled--\n10 bills that have waived or gamed the pay-go rules that are already on \nthe books to the tune of $882 billion. If you throw in the things they \nwanted to do that they weren't able to pass, because we on our side \nstood up and said, no, that is too much--and we did it on the rest, but \nwe got rolled--it is over a trillion dollars of instances where this \nCongress and this President have asked for initiatives that would \nwaive, punch holes in, go around the pay-go rules we already have. That \nis why I called it ``Swiss-cheese-go,'' not pay-go. Now we have this \ndisingenuous statement from the administration that suddenly they are \nfor pay-go. It already exists; we just don't enforce it around here. \nNot only do they claim they are for pay-go, even in their statement \nthey claim they are for it, and they game their own pay-go proposal by \nsaying it is not going to apply to the doc fix, the AMT fix, or even to \nthe health care exercise. There should be a pay-go point of order \nagainst the first 5 years, and they waived that on health care reform.\n  It is a good precedent. It will be picked up by the mainstream media \nas an effort by this administration to try to discipline spending \nbecause, of course, they are not going to acknowledge that it has been \ngamed to such an extraordinary extent that over $882 billion has been \nspent that should have been subject to pay-go rules. So it is a touch \ninconsistent and disingenuous for them to suddenly now find the faith \nof pay-go when, in fact, they have been ignoring pay-go rules and \ngaming those rules so they could spend money.\n  Again, what happens there? They run up the debt on the American \npeople in the United States, creating a system where our government \nwill not be sustainable or affordable for our children.\n  If this administration wants to do something meaningful in the area \nof reducing the debt and controlling spending, take the $65 billion \nthey are about to get in repayment of TARP money from the various banks \nand apply it to reduce the debt. That would be real action versus the \nprecedent.\n  I yield the floor and appreciate the courtesy of the Senator from \nNorth Carolina.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina is \nrecognized.\n\n[[Page S6335]]\n\n  Mr. BURR.

Mr. President, I came to the floor last week for north of 5 \nhours and spoke about the bill that will be disposed of as this week \ngoes on and, specifically, on an amendment that, though nongermane \npostcloture, the majority leader has agreed to hold a vote on. To me, \nthis will be one of the most important votes Members in this body cast \nthis year.\n  Again, I believe this is one of the most important votes Members in \nthe Senate will cast this year. Let me try to say why. This is a debate \nabout the regulation of tobacco and, to start with, Members need to be \nreminded that today this is not an industry without regulation. This is \nthe current charted Federal regulation of the tobacco industry before \nwe do anything. I point out that included in that regulatory structure \nis the Department of Transportation, Department of Treasury, Department \nof Commerce, Department of Justice, Office of the President, Department \nof Health and Human Services, Department of Education, Department of \nLabor, General Services Administration, Department of Veterans Affairs, \nFederal Trade Commission, Department of Agriculture, Environmental \nProtection Agency, U.S. Postal Service, and Department of Defense.\n  One, no Member can come to the floor and claim this is not a \nregulated product. It is the most regulated product sold in America \ntoday. I think there is consensus, and I agree, that we can do better \nthan this maze of regulatory oversight in jurisdiction that is \ncurrently structured within the Federal Government, because it has been \ncobbled together as the Federal Government has grown, as new areas saw \nthey had a piece of this pie, and they wanted some jurisdiction. We are \nthrowing this regulatory structure away, and the proposal in the base \nbill, H.R. 1256, is to centralize this regulation of tobacco within the \nFDA.\n  For those who aren't familiar with the FDA, let me say the Food and \nDrug Administration regulates 25 cents of every dollar of the U.S. \neconomy--25 percent of all of the products sold in the United States \nare regulated by this one agency.\n  FDA's core mission is this:\n\n       Responsible for protecting the public health by assuring \n     the safety, efficacy, and security of human and veterinary \n     drugs, biologic products, medical devices, our Nation's food \n     supply, cosmetics, and products that emit radiation.\n\n  Nowhere in there does it say tobacco, nor has it ever. A layperson \nwould look at this and say if there is an agency whose responsibility \nit is to approve safety and effectiveness, for God's sake, you could \nnot give them tobacco because they could never prove it was safe. It \nkills, and there is no dispute about that. We are trying to take a \nround peg and put it in a square hole. We are trying to find an agency \nthat we think has punitive steps that they can take, but we are \nactually going much farther than that. You see, not only is there \nexperience or expertise at the FDA to regulate tobacco, they are not. \nWe are going to ask the FDA to surge, with their resources, their \npersonnel, expertise, away from things such as lifesaving drugs, \neffective medical devices, and a responsibility to food safety at a \ntime Americans have been killed because this agency couldn't \neffectively do their job. We are going to ask them to surge to handle a \nnew product they have never, ever regulated.\n\n  As a matter of fact, the last FDA Commissioner, von Eschenbach, said \nthis:\n\n       The provisions in this bill--\n\n  I might say this was slightly over 2 years ago. As I have pointed out \nand talked about last week for over 5 hours on H.R. 1256, the authors \nof the bill didn't even change the dates in the bill from the bill \nwritten 2 years ago. As a matter of fact, the section by section is the \nsame bill written 10 years ago. So I think it is appropriate, if they \nare going to use an effective date of February 2007, that I use the \ncomments of the FDA Commissioner at the time, who said:\n\n       The provisions in this bill would require substantial \n     resources, and FDA may not be in a position to meet all of \n     the activities within the proposed user levels. . . . as a \n     consequence of this, FDA may have to divert funds from other \n     programs, such as addressing the safety of drugs and food, to \n     begin implementing this program.\n\n  This is not Richard Burr, this is the former Commissioner of the FDA \nsaying we may have to divert funds from other programs, such as safety \nof drugs and food. If the American people are given this choice, they \nwould say uphold the gold standard of the FDA. Let me go to bed at \nnight as I take that medication my doctor prescribed and the pharmacist \nfilled, and let me feel confident that the most qualified reviewer \nlooked at that application, at the clinical trial date, and made a \ndetermination that this drug was safe and effective for me. Make sure \nwhen I go to the grocery store and buy food in a global marketplace, \nwhere the melons might have come from Chile or the spinach from Mexico, \nthat they have the best and brightest addressing food safety.\n  They have already flunked that several times in the last 3 years, and \nwe have all dealt with the consequences of it. But think about what we \nare getting ready to do. We are getting ready to make it worse. We are \ngetting ready to take an agency that has a seal of approval, a gold \nstandard, and we are getting ready to say we want you to maintain that \ngold standard on drugs, and food, and biologics, and medical devices, \nbut we understand you cannot hold tobacco to the same threshold. So we \nwant you to ignore the fact that tobacco kills, and we want you to \nregulate it as we prescribe it in legislation. How does H.R. 1256 \nprescribe this in regulation?\n  We will turn to this, which is my continuum of risk chart. It \nbasically starts to my right, and your left, Mr. President. It has \nunfiltered cigarettes. You remember those. They had a risk of 100 \npercent. If you smoked them, there was a 100-percent likelihood that \nyou were going to have a health problem from smoking.\n  Then the industry came up with filtered cigarettes, and they reduced \nthe risk by 10 percent, from 100 percent to 90 percent. But when one is \nlooking for a way to play this, a 90-percent risk is not a good one.\n  What H.R. 1256 says is: OK, we realize FDA is not the right agency, \nbut we are going to place it there anyway, and we are going to tell the \nFDA: We want you to leave this alone; we don't want you to touch this \n100-percent risk or 90-percent risk. We want to grandfather all the \nproducts that were made before February 2007. And, oh, by the way, that \nwould include U.S. smokeless tobacco.\n  The most risky we are grandfathering in and we say to the FDA: You \ncan't change it. You basically can't regulate it. You can't regulate \nthe 100 percent, you can't regulate the 90 percent, and you can't \nregulate this small but growing U.S. smokeless market that has a risk \nof 10 percent.\n  One might look at the chart and say there are other things on there. \nThere are electronic cigarettes, tobacco-heating cigarettes, Swedish \nsmokeless snus. There are dissolvable and other products that have less \nrisk. All those products in February 2007 were not in the marketplace. \nThey are banned. They are eliminated.\n  What are we asking the FDA to do? We are asking them to grandfather \nthree categories of products and let all adults who choose to use a \ntobacco product choose from the most risky categories.\n  What are we saying to the 40 million Americans who smoke today? If \nyou are in this category of using cigarettes, we are not going to give \nyou any options as to what you turn to as you realize that is not the \nbest thing for your health. We are going to lock you in and hope it \nkills you fast so our health care cost goes down.\n  Any claim--any claim--that H.R. 1256 reduces the cost of health care \nis only because we have grandfathered in smokers who will die sooner, \nnot that we have allowed them a pathway through this bill to ever \nexperience not only products that are currently on the marketplace that \nreduce the risk from 100 percent to as little as 1 percent, but we have \ncompletely eliminated any additional innovation in product in the\n\n[[Page S6336]]\n\nfuture that would allow somebody to get from 100 percent to 1 percent \nand actually be a healthier American.\n  I am not on the floor today suggesting that regulation is not in \norder. It is in order. At 4:20 p.m. today, Members of the Senate will \nhave an opportunity to vote on a substitute amendment that has several \nchanges from this current bill. One, it does not centralize the \njurisdiction in the FDA. It creates, under the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services, a new agency called the Harm Reduction Center. Its sole \njob is to regulate tobacco. It regulates tobacco more specifically than \ndoes the FDA under H.R. 1256. But what it does allow is the development \nof new products that might encourage individuals to give up smoking and \nto turn to products that are less harmful.\n  Here is a list of the organizations that support tobacco harm \nreduction: The American Association of Public Health Physicians, 2008; \nthe World Health Organization, 2008; the Institute of Medicine, 2001; \nthe American Council on Science and Health, 2006; the New Zealand \nHealth Technology Assessment, 2007; the Royal College of Physicians, \n2002, 2007; Life Sciences Research Office, 2008; Strategic Dialogue on \nTobacco Harm Reduction Group, 2009--this year.\n  People around the world are talking about reduced harm, except in the \nSenate. As a matter of fact, we don't need to look far across the pond \nbefore we find Sweden. During the past 25 years, Swedish men have shown \nnotable reductions in smoking-related diseases: a decline in lung \ncancer incidence rate to the lowest of any developed country; no \ndetectible increase in oral cancer rate; improvement in cardiovascular \nhealth. Tobacco-related mortality in Sweden is among the lowest in the \ndeveloped world.\n  Why? Every Member of this Congress should ask why. Because the \nsponsors of this bill have said this is what we are trying to do in the \nUnited States.\n  How did Sweden do it? It is very simple. Sweden did it by allowing \nthese products to come to market. As a matter of fact, Swedish \nsmokeless snus is currently on the market in the United States. I am \nnot going to tell you the market share is big, but I can tell you this. \nThe risk of death or disease is less than 2 percent. But under H.R. \n1256, which the Senate may or may not adopt this afternoon, what we \nwould do is we would eliminate Swedish snus, and we would lock smokers \ninto the categories that are currently on the market, all because of an \narbitrary February 2007 date because somebody was too lazy to change \nthe bill.\n  Think about that: that we would take something Sweden found over 25 \nyears had been an incentive to get people off cigarettes and move \ntoward other products, to the degree that, in Sweden, they had a \ndecline in lung cancer, they had no detectible increase in oral cancer, \nand they had an improvement in cardiovascular health; that tobacco-\nrelated mortality in Sweden is among the lowest in the developed world. \nWhy is that? Because the authors of H.R. 1256 suggest that new product \ninnovation can happen, and I would tell you there are three thresholds \none has to meet for new products to come on the market. I will not talk \nabout the first two. I will focus on the third one.\n  The third one is this: that to have a product approved to be placed \non the market, a company has to prove that a nontobacco user is no more \nlikely to use that new product if that product is available. Then it \ngoes on to say, in great congressional form, that unless you have an \napplication that has been approved, you cannot engage the public on a \nproduct that has not been improved.\n  How does one do a clinical study that proves to the FDA that no \nAmerican is more likely to use tobacco on a product that wasn't in the \nmarketplace if, in fact, you can't talk to them about the product until \nit is approved? It is a Catch-22.\n  The authors of this bill knew exactly what they were doing. Let me \nsay it again. The authors of this bill knew exactly what they were \ndoing.\n  What has changed over the weekend since I was out here for 5 hours-\nplus last week? Public health experts around the country are beginning \nto read the bill and they are beginning to go: Oh, my gosh. Do not pass \nthis. This is a huge mistake. As a matter of fact, I will get into it \nin a little while. I have plenty of time that I am going to spend on \nit.\n  Understand there are only three reasons we would consider new \nadditional regulations: to reduce the rate of disease and death and to \nreduce the prevalence of youth access to tobacco products and \nspecifically smoking.\n  I know the Presiding Officer heard me say this last week. This is my \nchart of 50 States. In 1998, the tobacco industry came to a settlement \nwith States called the Master Settlement Agreement, MSA. In that \nagreement, they committed $280 billion to defray the cost of health \ncare for the States--specifically, their Medicaid costs--and also \nprovided money to make sure they could have cessation programs to get \npeople to quit smoking and to make sure youth access, youth prevalence \nwent down.\n  These are the CDC levels for last year, and I might say the CDC makes \na recommendation to every State at the beginning of the year as to how \nmuch they should spend on programs that encourage youth not to smoke. I \nam just going to pull randomly a few States.\n  Connecticut: Of the CDC recommendation, Connecticut spent 18.9 \npercent of what the CDC recommended; 21 percent of the youth in \nConnecticut have a prevalence of smoking; 23.2 percent of the youth in \nConnecticut have a prevalence of marijuana usage.\n  The Presiding Officer's own State, Illinois: Of the CDC \nrecommendation of what Illinois should spend on youth prevention, \nIllinois spends 6.1 percent; 19.9 percent of the youth have a \nprevalence to smoke. They are at 23.3 percent who have a prevalence of \nmarijuana use.\n  In Missouri, of the CDC recommendation on how much should be spent on \nthe prevalence of youth smoking, Missouri spent 3.7 percent; 23 percent \nof the youth have a prevalence of smoking; 19 percent a prevalence of \nmarijuana use.\n  I can see that the Presiding Officer gets where I am going. We have \nconstantly, since 1998, with the money provided by the tobacco industry \nto the States, chosen to build sidewalks over promoting programs to \nreduce youth prevalence of smoking. Now the authors of this bill would \nhave us suggest that by allowing the FDA to have regulation of tobacco, \nthe prevalence of youth smoking is going to go down because now we have \none Federal agency that will have total jurisdiction over this product.\n  Let me say this: If that were the case, the prevalence of marijuana \nusage by youth would be zero because it is illegal. There is no age \nlimit. As a matter of fact, there is no agency need for jurisdiction \nbecause nobody in America--adult or youth--is supposed to use it. It is \na myth for us to believe the authors of this bill that by simply \ndumping this in the FDA, somehow youth prevalence of smoking goes down. \nIt is a joke. It is a joke, and the public health community has now \nrecognized this.\n  In 1975, Congress commissioned the University of Michigan to track \nyouth smoking rates. At that time, youth smoking was at an alltime \nhigh. However, those rates started coming down and leveled off around \n30 percent all the way up to 1993. For some unknown reason at that \ntime, youth smoking started to rise and peaked at an alltime high in \n1997. In 1998, 12th graders who said they tried a cigarette in the last \n30 days was approximately 36 percent, according to the University of \nMichigan.\n  Congress didn't have a good sense of why this was happening. \nOpponents of the tobacco industry started blaming all this on the \nalleged manipulation of young people by tobacco manufacturers through \nsophisticated marketing and advertising.\n  The tobacco industry has a checkered past, I will be the first to \nadmit that, when it comes to advertising in the market. But what I am \nsuggesting is, it may not have been all due to tobacco marketing. There \nwas another trend occurring during the 1993 to 1998 period that \nvirtually mirrored that of youth smoking. It was the increase in \nillicit drugs in the United States.\n  Let me say that again. What mirrored the trend from 1993 to 1998 of \nthe increase in youth smoking was the increase of use of illicit drugs \nby teenagers. Something much broader was happening among our country's \nyoung people.\n\n[[Page S6337]]\n\n  The Senate's answer to the smoking rate increase was to pass this \ninitiative, to give FDA jurisdiction.\n  Senator Kennedy made the following remarks during the 1998 Senate \nfloor debate to emphasize the need to protect kids. Let me quote him:\n\n       FDA Commissioner David Kessler has called smoking a \n     ``pediatric disease with its onset in adolescents.'' In fact, \n     studies show that over 90 percent of the current adult \n     smokers began to smoke before they reached the age of 18. It \n     makes sense for Congress to do what we can to discourage \n     young Americans from starting to smoke during these critical \n     years. . . . Youth smoking in America has reached epidemic \n     proportions. According to a report issued last month by the \n     Centers from Disease Control and Prevention, smoking rates \n     among high school students soared by nearly a third between \n     1991 and 1997. Among African-Americans, the rates have soared \n     by 80 percent. More than 36 percent of high school students \n     smoke, a 1991 year high. . . . With youth smoking at crisis \n     levels and still increasing, we cannot rely on halfway \n     measures. Congress must use the strongest legislative tools \n     available to reduce youth smoking as rapidly as possible.\n\n  Well, the Senate told the American public that the passage of a \nmassive FDA tobacco regulation back in 1998 contained the strongest \nlegislative tools available to address youth smoking issues.\n  By the way, they have decreased since 1998--youth smoking has \ndecreased. As a matter of fact, overall smoking has decreased. I don't \nwant anybody to think there is no light at the end of the tunnel. As a \nmatter of fact, what this shows is a comparison--a study done by the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention and then a Congressional \nBudget Office estimate after reviewing the Kennedy bill, or Waxman \nbill, H.R. 1256. What the CDC said was that if we do nothing, we reduce \nsmoking to 15.97 percent by 2016, and the Congressional Budget Office, \nunder H.R. 1256, said that if we pass the Kennedy bill, the rate would \nbe 17.80 percent. As a matter of fact, I miscalculated when I put the \nchart together, and it is actually 2 percent higher, meaning we do 4 \npercent better if we do nothing.\n  You see, my point is this, and it is exactly what I said at the \nbeginning: The authors of this bill said its purpose is to reduce the \nrisk of death and disease and to reduce youth smoking. I would tell you \nthat a caveat to that should be that we should reduce smoking. Clearly, \nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that if you do \nnothing, it goes to this point, and the Congressional Budget Office, \nafter looking at the bill, suggests it is 2 percent or 4 percent higher \nif, in fact, we pass the bill. Why is that? How could it possibly be \nhigher if you pass legislation that is supposed to fix it? Well, it is \nfor this reason: It is because of what H.R. 1256 does. It is not a \npublic health bill. It is a bill that locks in the most risky products \nand grandfathers them to the Food and Drug Administration and allows no \npathway for reduced-harm products to come to market. It actually takes \nsome reduced-harm products that are currently on the market, that \nhaven't been sold since February 2007, and says, therefore, they are \ngone. There is no ability for the FDA to look at this product and say: \nMy gosh, in the name of public health, let's keep this product on the \nmarket, because the Senate is legislatively telling the FDA what to do.\n  Why does it matter what agency we put this in? If Congress believes \nthey can fix it, then why haven't they fixed it up until now? If \nwriting a bill that legislates how to fix it would work, why haven't we \ndone it? Well, I would contend that all I have to do is go to this \nchart of 50 States, and for the majority of the States the prevalence \nof marijuana usage is higher than the prevalence of youth smoking, \nwhich tells you there is no regulatory body that can eliminate the \nusage of an illegal product by those who choose to use it, unless--\nunless--it is through education. There is no education in H.R. 1256. \nLet me say it again: There is no education in H.R. 1256.\n  If the goal is to reduce the risk of death and disease and education \nis the only way to accomplish that, if the goal is to reduce youth \nprevalence of smoking and the only tool to accomplish that is \neducation, then I ask the sponsors to come to the floor and show me \nwhere the education is in FDA regulations.\n  I am on day 5 now--maybe day 6 if you count that I was here for a \nshort period of time last Monday, but I didn't make it yesterday, \nMonday--day 6, and I have yet to have anybody come to the floor and ask \na question, refute anything I have said or question the facts I have \nproduced. Why? Because I am using the same agencies most Members come \nto the floor and reference: the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention and the Congressional Budget Office. It is hard to say that \nthey are wrong, that they are not reputable entities within the Federal \nGovernment, and then turn around next week and bring your own \nstatistics using the same entities we use as a gauge.\n  One can question whether the Royal College of Physicians came to the \nright conclusion when they said:\n\n       In Sweden, the available low-harm smokeless products have \n     been shown to be an acceptable substitute for cigarettes to \n     many smokers, while ``gateway'' progression from smokeless to \n     smoking is relatively uncommon.\n\n  Let me say that again: ``. . . while gateway progression from \nsmokeless to smoking is relatively uncommon.''\n  Some authors of H.R. 1256 have come to the floor and said: Well, my \ngosh, if we let reduced-harm products come to the marketplace, this is \ngoing to create a gateway to youth usage of tobacco products that will \neventually turn them into smokers.\n  Read the substitute bill. The substitute bill requires the Reduced \nHarm Center to actually list for the American public the most risky \ntobacco products and the least risky. The bill that consolidates all \nthis jurisdiction for tobacco within the Food and Drug Administration \ndoesn't even require the Food and Drug Administration to rank the most \nrisky products. Why? Because those are the ones we have grandfathered. \nWe have said they can't touch them.\n  Compassion would tell you that if you want people to switch from \nsmoking and give it up, you have to give them a tool to get there. But \nwhat we have said is that the future will consist of no new tools \nexcept those manufacturers that were on the market before February \n2007--some magical date in history we will all look back on and \nprobably find that to blame as to why this program doesn't work.\n  In a little over an hour, we will have an opportunity to come to the \nfloor and to vote on the substitute. Let me say to my colleagues, if \nyou want a real public health bill, vote for the substitute. If you \nwant to reduce the prevalence of youth smoking, vote for the \nsubstitute. If you want to reduce the rate of death and disease, vote \nfor the substitute. Don't just listen to me, listen to public health \nexperts and authors who now have written on this issue.\n  This happens to be a book--and I am not sure how long ago it was \npublished, although I am sure I can probably find that out--that I \nthink I spent $50 today to get, either that or it is on loan. That \nseems like a lot of money, but the truth is, it is a book about how the \nSenate of the United States is getting shafted. It is a book about the \ncollusion that happened behind closed doors between the authors of this \nbill and Philip Morris. It is written by an author named Patrick \nBasham. I want to read a few things he has printed in his book.\n\n       Handing tobacco regulation over to the FDA, as Congress is \n     poised to do, is an epic public health mistake. It is \n     tantamount to giving the keys of the regulatory store to the \n     Nation's largest cigarette manufacturer.\n\n  It goes on:\n\n       There are significant and numerous problems with the FDA \n     regulating tobacco and virtually no benefits to public \n     health.\n\n  Let me say that again.\n\n       There are significant and numerous problems with FDA \n     regulating tobacco and virtually no benefits to public \n     health.\n\n  Do you get it? I mean, if you are going to bill it as a public health \nbill, for God's sake, put something in there that is to the benefit of \nthe public health of this country.\n  Mr. Basham goes on to say:\n\n       Kennedy, Waxman, and the public health establishment \n     present their legislation as a masterful regulatory stroke \n     that will end tobacco marketing, preventing kids from \n     starting to smoke, make cigarettes less enjoyable to smoke, \n     and reduce adult smoking. But FDA regulation of tobacco will \n     do none of these things.\n\n  This is not a fan of the tobacco industry. This is an author, an \nindividual, who has been covered in numerous publications. He is an \nadjunct\n\n[[Page S6338]]\n\nscholar with the Cato Center for Responsible Government. He is a \nlecturer at Johns Hopkins University. He has written a variety of \npolicy issues, and his articles have appeared in the New York Times, \nthe Washington Post, USA Today, the New York Post, and the New York \nDaily News, just to name a few. His book is titled ``Butt Out! How \nPhilip Morris Burned Ted Kennedy, the FDA & and the Anti-Tobacco \nMovement.'' This is no fan of tobacco. This is a guy who is calling \nballs and strikes. He is one person who is so concerned about the \npublic health in this country and making sure what we do accomplishes \ngood public health policy that he is willing to be outspoken.\n  He goes on in his book and says this:\n\n       The process of validating new reduced-risk products appears \n     to be designed to prevent such products from ever reaching \n     the marketplace, thus giving smokers the stark, and for many \n     the impossible, choice of ``quit smoking or die.''\n\n  You might want to remember that part. We can now call the continuum \nof risk ``quit or die.''\n\n       Rather than making smoking safer for those who continue to \n     smoke, it will deny smokers access to new products that might \n     literally save their lives. That is hardly a sterling \n     prescription for good public health.\n       If the objective is public health, H.R. 1256 falls way \n     short. Even if the idea of FDA regulation were good in theory \n     and practice, several things, including the FDA's competence \n     in tobacco policy and science, its public image, its fit with \n     the tobacco file, its available resources, and its overall \n     current competence, argue strongly against giving it \n     regulatory responsibility for our Nation's tobacco policy.\n\n  This is a scholar, Mr. President.\n\n       FDA regulation of tobacco need not be a public health \n     tragedy, however. By bringing the crafting of tobacco policy \n     out into the light of day, by taking it out of the hands of \n     the special interests and, most importantly, by keeping it \n     away from the FDA, there is every opportunity to begin to \n     create a policy that not only serves the interest of \n     nonsmokers and smokers, but a policy that might really work.\n\n  To Senators of the U.S. Senate: If you want a policy that really \nworks, do not adopt H.R. 1256. Consider strongly the merits of the \nsubstitute amendment, which does focus on the public health of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. Basham is a professor who studies and writes on a variety of \ntopics, and when he took an objective view of the situation, he saw \nH.R. 1256 for what it was. He saw it as misguided legislation.\n  Our amendment--mine and Senator Hagan's--accomplishes exactly what \nMr. Basham raises. Our amendment sets up a new agency under the \nauspices of HHS and a Secretary who will examine all tobacco products \nand set up a regulatory framework that will save lives. That is in the \npublic health interest of America. We don't preclude new reduced-risk \nproducts from entering the marketplace. We do not preclude reduced risk \nproducts from coming into the marketplace; H.R. 1256 does. We mandate \nthe Tobacco Harm Center post the relative risk of each tobacco product \ncurrently on the market. Wouldn't that be incredible if we had a \nranking between cigarettes and all the other things? We wouldn't need \nthat if H.R. 1256 passed because we would only have nonfiltered \ncigarettes, filtered cigarettes, and smokeless tobacco. I can tell you \nthe ranking would be unfiltered cigarettes the worst, filtered \ncigarettes next to the worst, and smokeless third. Those are the \nchoices that adults would have in this country, and for somebody who is \naddicted to smoking, if smokeless wasn't something that enticed them to \nquit smoking, they would be left out because the legislation does not \ncreate a pathway for new products.\n\n  We also give current users the information they need to decide \nwhether they want to migrate from a more harmful product, such as \ncigarettes, to less harmful products.\n  I have heard my colleagues and many other advocacy groups boast how \nthe underlying bill will give the FDA authority to remove toxins in \ncigarettes, boast how granting the FDA the ability to regulate \nadvertising will encourage people to not use, and current smokers to \nquit.\n  I agree, better warning labels will act as a deterrent to nonsmokers. \nBut what about current smokers? Dr. Basham sites a very interesting \nstudy conducted in Canada and the United States by an independent \norganization. The study consisted of showing smokers packages of their \ncurrent cigarettes with an increased warning label and graphic \npictorials of cancer and other diseases. The study concluded that no \nstatistically significant change in smoking behavior could be expected \nto be followed from the redesigned packages.\n  If you have noticed, over this 45 minutes, so far, I have sort of \nknocked all the things out that the sponsors of this bill said it \naccomplished. It does not do any of them. It does do one thing: it \ngrandfathers the most risky products and consolidates their regulation \nat the FDA. It does not reduce risk of death, disease, or youth \nprevalence of smoking.\n  Since H.R. 1256 bans any reduced risk smokeless products from \nentering the marketplace, it locks current smokers only into \ncigarettes. However, our amendment does not lock them into just \ncigarettes. We provide this consumer with the ultimate amount of \nchoice. The purpose of my amendment, as I said, is to reduce the risk \nof death and disease and to reduce youth prevalence of smoking.\n  The regulated products under my amendment? All tobacco and nicotine \nproducts. There are no holes in the substitute. It covers the entire \nscope of tobacco products. New smoking provisions in H.R. 1256, \n``change current tobacco advertising to black and white only and \nrequire graphic warning labels on packages of cigarettes.''\n  We require graphic warning labels on the package of cigarettes, and \nwe eliminate print advertising. Somehow the authors of this bill would \nhave us believe if we go from color to black and white advertising that \npeople under 18 actually will not read it or can't read it. Maybe \ntoday's youth can only read in color. But they suggest theirs is a \nstronger regulatory bill. But the substitute eliminates print \nadvertising. No longer will the Vogue magazine that a mom finds in the \ngrocery store attractive, that might not be one of those publications \nthat is considered a publication that youth would purchase, but a 14-\nyear-old might go to her mother's Vogue magazine and flip open and see \na tobacco ad by mistake--it can't happen under the substitute \nlegislation. It will happen under H.R. 1256, but only in black and \nwhite.\n  H.R. 1256 uses user fees to fund the FDA, about $700 million over 3 \nyears. We asked the Secretary of Health and Human Services: How much do \nyou need to stand up a complete new agency that is only focused on \ntobacco legislation? One hundred million dollars a year because these \nfees that we charge the tobacco companies are passed on to the \nconsumers, the people least likely to fund it, the ones who are already \nfunding the Children's Health Insurance Program, funding the majority \nof the State Medicaid programs. Let's give these folks a break. Let's \nnot put this entire burden on their backs, especially if it is not \ngoing to do any good.\n  It is not just Mr. Bashan. As a matter of fact, Brad Rodu wrote, \nMarch 26--Brad Rodu, the Endowed Chair of Tobacco Harm Reduction \nResearch, School of Medicine, University of Louisville--I will read a \ncouple of excerpts of what he wrote.\n\n       According to the American Association of Public Health \n     Physicians, the bill ``will do more harm than good in terms \n     of the future tobacco-related illnesses and death.'' While \n     the AAPHP favors ``effective regulation of the tobacco \n     industry. . . . This bill does not meet this standard.'' The \n     bill, introduced by Rep. Henry Waxman, is supported by \n     medical groups that are engaged in a crusade against the \n     tobacco industry. That's the problem: In a blind desire to \n     kill tobacco manufacturers, the Waxman bill may end up \n     hurting smokers.\n\n  It goes on and on. Again, an endowed chair of a major academic \ninstitution says don't do this.\n  How about Michael Siegel, Professor in the Social and Behavioral \nSciences Department at--get this--Boston University School of Public \nHealth, home of the authors of the bill. The Los Angeles Times, op-ed, \nJune 3--not long ago. Let me read a couple of excerpts out of Mr. \nSiegel's op-ed.\n\n       In the end, it ensures that federal regulation of tobacco \n     products will remain more about politics than about science.\n       H.R. 1256 gives the FDA the ability to lower nicotine \n     levels in cigarettes. Since H.R. 1256 locks current users \n     into cigarettes only by banning reduced risk products, H.R. \n     1256 ensures that 40 million Americans who currently smoke \n     are doomed to death and disease associated with cigarette \n     smoking. H.R. 1256 will cost lives, not save lives.\n\n\n[[Page S6339]]\n\n\n  This is a professor in the Boston University School of Public Health, \ntalking about his Senator's bill. He goes on to say:\n\n       Even worse, by giving a federal agency the appearance of \n     regulatory authority over cigarettes without the real ability \n     to regulate, the legislation would seemingly create a FDA \n     seal of approval for cigarettes, giving the public a false \n     sense of security about the increased safety of the product.\n       In fact, the bill's crafters are apparently so worried \n     about the harmful effects of such a public perception--\n\n  Get this--\n\n     that they have written a clause into the bill that prohibits \n     the cigarette companies from even informing the public that \n     cigarettes are regulated by the FDA or that the companies are \n     in compliance with FDA regulations.\n\n  The legislation forbids a company from even referring to the \nregulator. He goes on to say:\n\n       This is clearly an unconstitutional provision, as it \n     violates the free speech rights of the tobacco companies; \n     nevertheless, it suggests that even the supporters of the \n     legislation are aware that the bill creates a false \n     perception of the increased safety of cigarette smoking.\n\n  There is a charge I have not made. The bill is actually \nunconstitutional. When we recognize things as unconstitutional, I know \nit is the inclination of some Members of the Senate to wait and have it \npassed and somebody refer it to the Supreme Court so the Supreme Court \ncan tell us it is unconstitutional. When scholars tell us it is \nunconstitutional, I believe our responsibility is then: don't pass it, \ndon't do it.\n  Let me conclude with Michael Siegel, professor in the School of \nPublic Health, Boston University.\n\n       During the previous administration, the FDA was accused of \n     making decisions based on politics, not health. If the Senate \n     passes the FDA tobacco legislation, it will be \n     institutionalizing, rather than ending, the triumph of \n     politics over science in federal policymaking. This is not \n     the way to restore science to its rightful place.\n\n  I am not saying it. It is a professor from the School of Public \nHealth at Boston University.\n  What is this bill about? Its author said reducing the rate of death \nand disease and prevalence of youth smoking. Michael Siegel's \nassessment: It is about politics.\n  Patrick Bashan's conclusion in ``Butt Out,'' the book: It is about \npolitics. As a matter of fact, it says on the back of the book:\n\n       Philip Morris outwitted this coalition of useful idiots at \n     every turn.\n\n  The decision in front of Members of the Senate is simple. Do you want \nto reduce the risk of death? Do you want to reduce the risk of disease? \nIf you want to reduce the prevalence of youth smoking you only have one \nchance, and that is support the substitute amendment.\n  If you want to do politics as usual, if you want to let politics \ntrump science, if you want to lock in a category of products that have \na high likelihood of risking the American people, if you want to ignore \nthe research from around the world that suggests by allowing lower harm \nsmokeless products on the marketplace it allows smokers to get off the \ntobacco products, support H.R. 1256.\n  I believed 5 days ago when I came to the Senate floor that was all I \nneeded to put up to win this debate. I actually believed that was all I \nneeded to put up for the American people. I have learned over the past \n5 days just how stubborn Members of the Senate are. I hope that now, \nafter 6\\1/2\\ hours of coming to the Senate floor on this one bill, \nstaff members through every office--Republican, Democrat, and \nIndependent--have taken the opportunity to check the facts that I have \npresented, and they have found I am right; they have found a study did \nexist in Sweden. I didn't make it up; they have found that CDC did do a \nstudy--if we did nothing we would reduce smoking more than if we pass \nthis bill; they have found that in Sweden, people did become healthier \nbecause of the decision to use smokeless products.\n  I thought this was all it took for the American people to understand \nit; that you can't take an agency of the Federal Government that is \n``responsible for protecting the public health by assuring the safety, \nefficacy and security of human and veterinary drugs, biologic products, \nmedical devices, our Nation's food supply, cosmetics and products that \nemit radiation''--it is impossible to take an agency where that is \ntheir core mission and give them a product where you ask them to ignore \nthe gold standard on everything else they regulate. I think the \nAmerican people would say it seems reasonable to create a new entity to \nregulate tobacco, if for no other reason than--if you didn't believe \nany other science that I have shown and the data that has been proven--\nif for no other reason than why would we jeopardize this gold standard? \nWhy would we make one American at home wonder whether that \npharmaceutical product they were taking was actually safe or effective?\n  Why would we have them question for a minute whether that medical \ndevice was approved and reviewed by the most seasoned reviewer versus \nmaybe somebody who was fresh on the job because that seasoned person \nwent over to regulate tobacco products?\n  Why would we put the American people in a more difficult situation \ntoday on their question of food safety with the incidents we have had \nof death in the United States of America because the Agency could not \nquite meet their mission statement?\n  Why would we dump on them now? Why would we do this to the American \npeople? It is beyond me. But when you turn to some of the folks who \nhave written on this issue--whether it is Brad Rodu, whether it is \nPatrick Basham, whether it is Michael Siegel, in the public health \ndepartment at Boston University--I guess the only answer is, it is \npolitics over science, that for 10 years people have said we have to \nput this in the FDA, that Matt Meyers, head of Campaign for Tobacco-\nFree Kids, is the most powerful ``U.S. Senator'' because he is getting \nhis wish, he is getting exactly what he has been trying to do for \ndecades. He is not a science expert. If he was, he would be voting for \nthe substitute, if he were here.\n  He wrote the bill. I am surprised he did not catch the mistake of \nFebruary 2007. Nobody caught that. But the truth is, the bill has not \nchanged much in 10 years, though the world has changed a lot. The \nscience has changed a lot. Health care has changed a lot.\n  There is a real opportunity to do the right thing in the Senate. But \nMembers will have to show a degree of independence and vote for the \nsubstitute and not wait for the base bill. I hope Members will heed the \nwords of people who have no dog in this fight who have suggested, if we \npass this bill--not the substitute, the base bill--we will have done a \ngreat disservice to the public health of America. More importantly, we \nwill have done a disservice to those individuals to get locked into \nthese categories, as shown on this chart, because their certain future \nis death and disease. They are counting on us. They are. They are \ncounting on us to do the right thing.\n  I can leave this debate tonight and say: I left nothing in the bag. I \nhave tried everything to convince my colleagues not to make a huge \nmistake. I will sleep well tonight. If this substitute does not pass, \nif H.R. 1256 passes and becomes law, it is others who are going to have \nto live with the way they voted. When people die because of what they \ndid, it is others who are going to have to live with it.\n  There are going to be more articles. This is just the tip of the \niceberg of health professionals, of public health individuals, people \nwho detail in great quantity exactly what has been going on. As a \nmatter of fact, as they say, the wool has been pulled over our eyes. \nWell, it has not. That is why we have a substitute amendment. That is \nwhy the majority leader allowed a nongermane amendment to come to the \nfloor. Well, it might have had something to do with that he did not \nhave the votes for cloture without allowing it to come to the floor, \nbut I give him the benefit of the doubt that he understood this was an \nimportant debate to have, that this was worth extending the opportunity \nfor people to vote up or down.\n  I see my colleague is here to speak, and I am not going to prolong \nthis debate. In less than an hour, Members will have an opportunity to \ncome to the floor. Most Members will get probably 2 minutes equally \ndivided; 60 seconds to hear what it has taken me 6 hours to say in this \ndebate. Clearly, that is not much time. But now it is in their hands. \nIt is a decision Members of the Senate will have to make about the \nfuture of the public health policy of this country.\n\n[[Page S6340]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues, on both sides of the aisle, to support the \nsubstitute amendment today at 4:20 and make sure the future of our \ncountry is one we will be proud of and not one we will find as an \nembarrassment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado).

Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak about the \nPresident's announcement a few hours ago relative to pay-go.\n  Today, the President said:\n\n       Paying for what you spend is basic common sense. Perhaps \n     that's why, here in Washington, it has been so elusive.\n\n  Well, I could not agree more. But I must ask: Where was that common \nsense when the President proposed to add $10 trillion to the national \ndebt in the fiscal year 2010 budget submission? Where was this basic \ncommon sense when he signed a bill earlier this year that adds $1 \ntrillion in debt this year alone? Where was this newfound fiscal \ndiscipline when he proposed a massive universal health care proposal \nthat is now turning out to be a government-run proposal with just a \ndownpayment of $650 billion?\n  The President's announcement undoubtedly was meant to quell rising \nfears about the amount of spending and borrowing his administration has \nundertaken. It was likely intended to calm the fears of those who buy \nour debt who are wondering if it is just paper.\n  But do the President's words today in any way address the mountain of \ndebt and increased taxes he proposed and supported just a few weeks ago \nwith the budget submission? The answer to that is no.\n  Today's announcement does absolutely nothing to decrease the rising, \ncrushing debt we have accumulated. In fact, this President has \nsignificantly added to our debt, causing it to rise to an unprecedented \nlevel, an unsustainable level. Let me repeat that. The President's \nannouncement does absolutely nothing to address our record spending and \nborrowing. This is akin to maxing out on the personal credit card and \nthen promising not to use it anymore but offering no plan to pay off \nthe balance.\n  The President rightly pointed out today:\n\n       The debate of the day drowns out those who speak of what we \n     may face tomorrow.\n\n  Maybe it is an appropriate time to thoughtfully consider what we face \ntomorrow because of the unpaid credit card balance.\n  It is important to dissect the rhetoric and speak to Americans who \nhave been promised something I would suggest the President cannot \ndeliver. Remember that those in the so-called middle class--and the \ndefinition of that has changed--have been told they will be shielded \nfrom tax increases. Well, I would suggest the evidence is obvious. The \nrug is about to be pulled out from underneath them by the President's \nexplosive growth in spending and borrowing.\n  If Congress continues to follow the President's unlimited spending \nspree and tries to balance the budget at the same time, the middle \nclass will get hammered with tax increases. This, I would suggest, is \nthe elephant in the room that no one in the Obama administration wants \nto discuss for fear of the consequences.\n  But the American people deserve an open discussion about the real-\nlife consequences of big government and the runaway freight train of \nspending and borrowing that comes with bigger government.\n  Supporters of the current budget claim that only individuals earning \nmore than $200,000 will see their taxes go up; therefore, there will be \nno tax increase on the middle class. Yet such a tax on higher income \nearners still results in an average annual deficit hovering around $1 \ntrillion per year for the next 10 years, described by many to be \nunsustainable.\n  Our national revenue simply cannot keep up with the bloated spending \nin the budget, and that is resulting in a shortfall.\n  Let me illustrate this in an example. This is equivalent to a \nLincoln, NE, teacher earning $33,000 per year but spending $58,000 per \nyear--year after year. It cannot last long. So is the Obama \nadministration going to continue this spending increase with only the \nrevenue from the so-called rich? How can they continue running annual \ndeficits with no end in sight? They cannot. Inevitably, the spending \nspree and exploding deficits will land squarely on the middle class in \nthe form of higher taxes, unless we do something.\n  The reality is, the Obama administration cannot continue the \nunprecedented level of spending while claiming to hold the middle class \nharmless.\n  If you do not believe me, listen to leading economists.\n  Martin Sullivan, a former economic aide to President Reagan, \nactually, who backed President Obama last fall, said:\n\n       You just simply can't tax the rich enough to make this all \n     up.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       Just for getting the budget to a sustainable level, there \n     needs to be a broad-based tax increase.\n\n  Leonard Burman, director of the liberal Tax Policy Center, said:\n\n       [T]here's no way we're going to be able to pay for \n     government 10, 20 years from now without coming up with a new \n     revenue source.\n\n  Finally, economist Paul Krugman, a New York Times columnist, wrote:\n\n       I, at least, find it hard to see how the federal government \n     can meet its long-term obligations without some tax increases \n     on the middle class.\n\n  All of these experts echo the point I am making: You cannot tax the \nrich enough to cover all the spending. Inevitably, what all of this is \nleading to is that the middle class will fall victim to massive \ntaxation.\n  I will put this into more tangible terms by examining how much the \ntax rate would need to rise to make up for only this year's projected \nbudget deficit--just this year's projected budget deficit. The deficit \nfor this year alone is an eye-popping $1.8 trillion. This does not even \ntake into consideration the more than $12 trillion public debt we \ncurrently owe.\n  Here is what would have to happen to the tax rate. The rates for the \ntop four brackets would skyrocket from the current rates of 35 percent, \n33 percent, 28 percent, and 25 percent to an alarming 90 percent across \nthe board. Imagine, people would have to work until Thanksgiving just \nto pay their taxes.\n  Some may say: Well, this is great. Tax the rich because they can \nafford to pay more in taxes. Yet those making up the third and fourth \nbrackets from the top can hardly be characterized as rich.\n  Let's look at who actually falls in those income brackets. Currently, \nfor tax year 2008, people who fall under the 25-percent bracket earn \nabout $32,000 to $78,000.\n  Does anyone want to come to the Senate floor and make the case that \nsomebody making $32,000 a year in Nebraska is rich? The average salary \nin Nebraska is $35,000. I do not know anyone who would suggest that \nonly wealthy people fall within the bracket.\n  The average Nebraskan would have something to say about that in terms \nof whether they are wealthy. Let's look at the next bracket, those \ntaxed at 28 percent. The income levels for this bracket are roughly \n$78,000 and $164,000 for singles. For married couples, it is $131,000 \nto $200,000. What does that mean? This means that a landscape architect \nin Nebraska making $75,000 a year, hypothetically, married to an \nemergency room nurse making $59,000 a year would fall into a 90-percent \ntax rate. Again, I suggest if you asked this couple, I am quite \nconfident they would not describe themselves as wealthy. Taxing the \nmiddle class to the tune of 90 percent would bring this economy to its \nknees.\n\n  There is some notion in America that we, the people, should be the \nmasters of our own economic success. If you tax someone at a 95-percent \nrate, you take away the economic incentive to be innovative, to strive \nfor greater success. Eventually you end up with slim or no productivity \nor competitiveness. Yet this administration keeps spending as though it \nis monopoly money. Just this week, more directions: Get that money\n\n[[Page S6341]]\n\nout there. Get that spending going. Their spending binge has an \nunsustainable course. Complying with pay-go alone won't even come close \nto fixing it. Maybe Congress would benefit from being coached by the \nsame credit card counselors who help Americans who are drowning in \ndebt. I will bet those counselors would have some stern words.\n  My point is simple: This is not the right direction for our country. \nWe must start to make spending decisions today that paint a realistic \nand candid picture of the impact on the middle class, and if it is the \npurpose of our Nation to hold them harmless, then we have to cut \nspending and we have to smart size our government.\n  Working families across our Nation and in my State deserve an honest \ndebate. It is time for Washington to take responsibility. The people at \nhome I believe are demanding it. I often say Nebraskans have great \nwisdom to convey. I couldn't agree more with a gentleman from North \nPlatte, NE, who wrote me a letter recently and he said this:\n\n       It's important to remember that while government consumes \n     wealth, transfers wealth and sets the ground rules for the \n     generation of wealth, it is the private individuals that \n     create it.\n\n  As a final note, the President today rightly acknowledged:\n\n       The reckless fiscal policies of the past have left us in a \n     very deep hole.\n\n  I would add to that: And the present.\n\n       Digging our way out will take time, and patience, and tough \n     choices.\n\n  Again, I could not agree more, other than I would add to that: The \npresent.\n  However, instituting pay-go does nothing to cut the deficit or the \ndebt, it simply attempts to hold the line, which the President's budget \nfails to do. His proposal is actually a more liberal approach than what \nis already in House rules. Right-sizing government and cutting spending \nis far from revolutionary. So while the President is saying when you \nfind yourself in a massive hole, stop digging, the more important \nquestion might be: How are we going to start filling up this gaping \nhole?\n  Our country needs leadership, not the empty rhetoric I would suggest \nwe heard today. The President's speech today sought to subdue the fears \nof many regarding our country's exploding deficits. I am sure it was \ntargeted to those who buy that debt, who are expressing concerns about \nwhat they are purchasing. Yet people should not be fooled into thinking \nthat pay-go is the holy grail for solving all of our spending and \nborrowing woes. I believe that while pay-go is a useful tool, when you \nlook at the hard facts, you realize that President Obama's speech \ntoday, though, is simply too little and it is too late. The horse is \nalready out of the barn, and the President is talking to us about \nclosing the barn door.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the Burr \namendment No. 1246. The Burr substitute amendment takes major steps to \nrestrict tobacco. It creates a new office within HHS to regulate \ntobacco. It puts in place a realistic, science-based standard for the \napproval of new and reduced risk products. It also requires states to \ndo more on tobacco control--something we can all support.\n  As many of you know, I support strong tobacco regulation. I want to \nremind my colleagues that supporting a different approach to tobacco \nregulation doesn't mean being soft on tobacco.\n  The Burr amendment is extensive--longer and more detailed even than \nthe underlying bill. It makes it more difficult for kids to get tobacco \nand start smoking, and that is the most important thing of all.\n  Whether we see the Burr proposal or the Kennedy proposal put in \nplace, we still have our work cut out for us when it comes to putting \nout tobacco use. I am going to keep working on this issue, and I am \ngoing to keep putting forward new ideas to stop smoking. These \nproposals are a first step, but we have a long way to go.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Burr amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak as in morning business for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6341-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6341-S6342]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT\n\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair. I will try and be brief on this. I know \nI have spoken at some length about the bill before us, the Family \nSmoking Prevention and Tobacco Control Act. I wish to begin by again \nthanking our colleagues who voted yesterday to allow us to move forward \nby supporting the cloture motion. It took a bipartisan effort and I am \ngrateful to colleagues, both in the majority and the minority, for \nlending their support to that effort. I am also pleased we are having \nan opportunity to vote on the Burr-Hagan amendment. There were some \nquestions raised as to whether that amendment would be permissible \nunder a postcloture environment from a parliamentary standpoint. As I \ntold my friend from North Carolina, Senator Burr, even though I \ndisagree with his amendment, I would vote against a point of order if \none were raised against it so he would have a chance to make his case. \nHis State is going to be affected by this decision we are making. As I \nrecall, I think he told me there are some 12,000 to 15,000 tobacco \nfarmers in North Carolina, hard-working families who have been in the \nbusiness for generations. This will have an impact on them. It may not \nbe as dramatic as some suggest, but it certainly will have a negative \nimpact if we are successful in reducing the amount of smoking and use \nof tobacco products by young children.\n  I am pleased my colleague from North Carolina has had a chance to \nmake his case, along with his colleague from North Carolina, Senator \nHagan.\n  Having said I would support his right to be heard, now I wish to take \na few minutes to express why I support the underlying bill. This bill \nhas been supported over the years by a substantial number in this body, \nas well as in the other body, the House of Representatives--as I \npointed out in the past, this matter, which has been under \nconsideration for almost a decade, has not become law because neither \nHouse of Congress has adopted the legislation in the same Congress. We \nhave ended up with the Senate passing a bill, the other House passing a \nbill, but never in the same Congress. So for all of these years, the \nFood and Drug Administration has not been able to regulate tobacco \nproducts.\n  We are about to change that if we, in fact, reject the Burr amendment \nand several others that are pending and give the Food and Drug \nAdministration the power, the authority, to regulate the sale, \nproduction, and marketing of tobacco products, particularly to young \nchildren. So for the first time, the FDA will have this authority and \nput in place tough restrictions that for far too long have been absent. \nThis will provide support for families when it comes to how cigarettes \nare marketed to their children.\n  I am sure my colleagues are tired of hearing me speaking over the \nlast several weeks about the number of young people who start smoking \nevery day. We have been at this matter now for about 2 or 3 weeks, \nconsidering the floor action, as well as the action in the HELP \nCommittee, which is the committee of jurisdiction. You can do the math \nyourself: Over 20 days, 3,000 to 4,000 children every day starting to \nsmoke while we have been deliberating this piece of legislation. \nNeedless to say, I don't know of a single person in this country with \nan ounce of sense who wants that many children who begin this habit to \ncontinue. I don't know of anybody with any sense at all who believes \nour country is better off if day after day we allow an industry to \nmarket products designed specifically to appeal to young people, \nknowing what danger and harm it causes. Four hundred thousand of our \nfellow citizens expire, die every year because of smoking-related \nillnesses--400,000 people. That is more than the number of people who \nlose their lives as a result of automobile accidents, AIDS, alcohol\n\n[[Page S6342]]\n\nabuse, illegal drug abuse, and violent crimes with guns. All of those \ncombined do not equal the number of deaths that occur because of \npeople's use of tobacco and tobacco products. That does not include the \nnumber of people who lead very debilitated lives, who are stricken with \nemphysema or related pulmonary illnesses that fundamentally alter their \nlives and the lives of their families.\n  I apologize to my colleagues for continuing to recite these numbers, \nbut I pray and hope these numbers may have some impact on those who \nwonder if every aspect of the bill makes the most sense or not. None of \nus should ever claim perfection, but we have spent a lot of time on \nthis, a lot of consideration on this. There are 1,000 organizations, \nfaith-based, State organizations--leading organizations dealing with \nlung cancer and related problems and they are all speaking with one \nvoice. They are telling us to pass this bill, pass this bill, and allow \nfinally for the FDA to be able to control the marketing, the selling, \nand the production of these tobacco products.\n  Absent any action by this Congress, more than 6 million children who \nare alive today will die from smoking. Mr. President, 1 out of 5 \nchildren from my State of Connecticut smokes today, and 76,000 \nchildren, we are told by health care professionals, will die \nprematurely because of their addiction to tobacco.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we are on the eve of passing major health \ncare reform legislation. The centerpiece of that bill, as I hear my \nRepublican friends and Democratic friends talk about it, is prevention. \nThat is the one piece about which there is a great deal of unanimity. \nHow can we deal with health care reform? The best way to treat a \ndisease is to have it never happen in the first place. This bill may do \nmore in the area of prevention, if adopted, than anything else we may \ninclude in the health care bill in the short term. The estimates are \nthat 11 percent of young people would not begin the habit of smoking if \nthis bill is adopted. Imagine 11 percent of the young people not \nsmoking of that 3,000 to 4,000 every day who start. That in itself \nwould be a major achievement.\n  My friend from North Carolina, Senator Burr, does not give authority \nto the FDA. The FDA is 100 years old. His bill creates a completely new \nagency, an untested agency, to oversee tobacco products. But the FDA is \nthe right agency because it is the only agency that has the regulatory \nexperience and scientific experience and the combination of that with a \npublic health mission. Unlike the Kennedy bill, the underlying bill, \nthe Burr substitute fails to provide adequate resources to do the job. \nIn the first 3 years, if the Burr substitute is adopted, it would \nallocate only one-quarter of the funding allocated in Senator Kennedy's \nproposal. The Burr substitute fails to give the authority to remove \nharmful ingredients in cigarettes, which the Kennedy bill would do. It \ndoesn't go far enough in protecting children and has weaker and less \neffective health warnings as well.\n  I say respectfully to my friend, setting up and creating a whole new \nagency, providing a fraction of the funding necessary to get it done, \nand providing inadequate resources in order to support these efforts is \nnot the step we ought to be taking. All of us can agree that the FDA is \nbasically the agency we charge with the responsibility of regulating \neverything we consume and ingest, including the products ingested by \nour pets. The FDA has jurisdiction over your cat food, dog food, and \nwhat your parakeet may have, but your child's use of tobacco is not \nregulated by anybody. Your child's safety, in many ways, is being less \nprotected than that of a household pet. That needs to change.\n  For a decade, we have debated this. We have been through countless \narguments. Now we have come down to the moment as to whether this \nCongress, in a bipartisan fashion, as we did yesterday, will say enough \nis enough. We have come to the end of the debate.\n  Mr. President, 400,000 people are losing their lives every day, and \n3,000 to 4,000 children are starting to smoke, a thousand of whom will \nbe addicted for life, and one-third of that number will die because of \nthe use of these products. That is over with. The marketing, the \nproduction, as well as the selling of these products has to come to an \nend. This is the best way to save money, if you are not impressed with \nthe ethics and morality of the issue.\n  This is a self-inflicted wound we impose on ourselves as a country, \nknowing the damage it causes, the costs it imposes, the hardships, the \nhorror, and the sorrow it brings to families. I don't know a single \nperson who smokes and wants their child to begin that habit. If they \ncould stand here collectively--the families across this country who are \nsmokers--they would say with one voice: Pass this bill. Please do \neverything you can to see to it that my child doesn't begin that habit.\n  Ninety percent of smokers start as kids, we know that. So we need to \nchange how we regulate these products. That is what this bill does. It \nhas had tremendous support from our friends, both Republicans and \nDemocrats, over the years. We have never done it together, and we are \non the brink of doing that and making a significant change in our \ncountry for the better. It is long overdue.\n  When the vote occurs on the Burr amendment, I urge my colleagues to \nvote against the amendment. I want to do everything I can to help those \nfarmers. The bill makes a difference in providing real help to the \nfarmers. I see my friend from Kentucky. He knows I went to law school \nthere, and he knows I have an affection for the people there. We owe it \nto them to provide real help so they can get back on their feet. I say \nto my friend from North Carolina, and others, I know what it means to \nhave an industry in your State face these kinds of challenges, but \nclearly the challenge to our Nation is to begin to reduce the number of \nchildren who smoke and to save lives every year. I say respectfully \nthat there is no more paramount issue for our Nation as a whole.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject the Burr amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the ranking member of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Senator Sessions, Senator Kyl, and I will take a \nfew moments to discuss the pending Supreme Court nomination and the \nproceedings leading up to that.

I find that not \nobjectionable on the other side.\n  I would inform our colleagues that we are going to proceed as if in \nmorning business.

Mr. President, I thank Senator McConnell for his \nleadership in so many ways but in particular the concern he has shown \nrepeatedly on the U.S. judiciary. He is on the Judiciary Committee, and \nhe takes these issues seriously. I think it is important that we all do \nso.\n  I have to say I am disappointed that this morning we learned from \nmedia reports--I did--that the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Leahy, announced we would begin the hearings on July 13 on \nJudge Sotomayor. I believe that is too early. I don't believe it is \nnecessary. It is far more important that we do this matter right than \ndo it quick. When the announcement was made, President Obama said the \ntime we should look to is October 1, when the new Supreme Court term \nstarts. I think that always was an achievable goal, and it is something \nI said I believe we could achieve and still do it in the right way.\n  The question is, Can we get all this done in this rush-rush fashion? \nIt will be the shortest confirmation time of any recent nominee. It is \na time well shorter than that of Justice Roberts--now Chief Justice--\nand we had a need to move that a bit because he was confirmed, as it \nturned out, on September 29, a couple of days before the new term \nbegan. He was going to be Chief Justice. But the last nominee, whose \nrecord was much like this nominee, Justice Alito, was coming up in late \nDecember, and the Democratic leader\n\n[[Page S6343]]\n\nthen on the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, asked that it be put \noff until after Christmas. The Republican chairman at that time, \nSenator Specter, despite President Bush's desire that it move forward, \nsaid: No, I think that is a reasonable request, and so we put it off. \nIt was 90-some-odd days before that confirmation occurred. It was well \nover 70 days before the hearings began.\n  Mr. President, first and foremost, we are committed to giving this \nnominee a fair, good, just hearing. But to do so requires that we have \nan opportunity to examine her record of probably more than 4,000 cases. \nIn addition to that, she has given a lot of speeches and written law \nreview articles, which need to be analyzed.\n  Make no mistake about it, this is the only time, the only opportunity \nthis Congress and the American people have to play a role in what will \nturn out to be a lifetime appointment, an appointment to a Federal \nbench of independence and unaccountability for the rest of their lives. \nI think it is important that we do this right.\n  I thank Senator McConnell for his leadership in trying to insist that \nwe do it right. I believe, from what I know today, the timeframe set \nforth is unrealistic. More than that, it is not necessary. Let's do \nthis right, take our time, and do it in a way that I hope--as I have \nsaid repeatedly, this would be what people could say is the finest \nconfirmation process we have ever had.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I thank my good friend from Alabama for \nhis observation about this nomination. He and I have been involved in a \nnumber of these confirmation proceedings over the years. In every one \nof them, I think there is a sense of fairness that can be reached on a \nbipartisan basis so that the nominee is adequately and appropriately \nvetted. That is what the Senator from Alabama is looking for as we go \nforward on the Judiciary Committee.\n  Frankly, I was surprised to learn that the majority decided \nunilaterally, basically, that the schedule would involve hearings \nbeginning on that specific date, July 13, to which Senator Sessions \nreferred.\n  During the Senate's consideration of both the Roberts and Alito \nnominations, we heard a lot from our Democratic colleagues about how \nthe Senate wasn't a rubberstamp and about how it was more important to \ndo it right than to do it fast. If that was the standard, I suggest to \nour colleagues, just a few years ago, why wouldn't it be a good \nstandard today? If that was the standard when the Republicans were in \nthe majority, why wouldn't it be a good standard when the Democrats are \nin the majority? We are talking about the same Supreme Court, the same \nlifetime appointment to which Senator Sessions referred.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee, today, said back then that \n``We need to consider this nomination as thoroughly and carefully as \nthe American people deserve. It is going to take time.'' That was \nSenator Leahy then. He also said, ``It makes sense that we take time to \ndo it right.'' I think the American people deserve nothing less. He \nalso said that we want to do it right, we don't want to do it fast. \nAgain, if that was the standard a few years ago when Republicans were \nin the majority, I don't know why it wouldn't be the standard today.\n  I don't know what our friends in the majority are fearful of. This \nnominee certainly has already been confirmed by the Senate twice. She \nhas an extensive record, and it takes a while to go through 3,600 \ncases. In the case of the Chief Justice, there were only 327 cases. He \nhad only been on the circuit court for a couple of years. She has been \non one court or another for 17 years. It is a larger record. I am \nconfident, and our ranking member, Senator Sessions, confirms that the \nstaff is working rapidly to try to work their way through this lengthy \nnumber of cases. But a way to look at it is the committee had to review \nan average of six cases a day in order to be prepared for Judge \nRoberts' hearings--six cases a day. The committee will now have to \nreview an average of 76 cases--76 cases--per day in order to be ready \nby the time the majority has proposed for the Sotomayor hearing.\n\n  The Senate functions on comity and cooperation, and the majority \nleader and I are a big part of that every day, trying to respect each \nother's needs and trying to make the Senate function appropriately. \nHere the Democratic majority is proceeding, in my view, in a heavy-\nhanded fashion, completely unnecessary, and is basically being \ndismissive of the minority's legitimate concerns of a fair and thorough \nprocess. There is no point in this. It serves no purpose, other than to \nrun the risk of destroying the kind of comity and cooperation that we \nexpect of each other in the Senate, all of which was granted in the \ncase of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito.\n  Let me be clear. Because of what our Democratic colleagues are doing \nand the way they are doing it, it will now be much more difficult to \nachieve the kind of comity and cooperation on this and other matters \nthat we need and expect around here as we try to deal with the Nation's \nbusiness.\n  I hope they will reconsider their decision and work with us on a \nbipartisan basis to allow a thorough review of this lengthy record that \nthe nominee possesses.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I wish to join the ranking member of the \ncommittee on which I sit, as well as the distinguished minority leader, \nin asking the question of why we have to set a date right now on the \nhearing for Judge Sotomayor. There is no reason for us to do that \nbecause there is no way to know at this point whether we will have our \nwork done by that time.\n  Historically--and it is for good reason--you want to have the review \ncompleted before you question the witness about the matters under \nreview. That makes sense. So there is no reason to set that date today, \nand that is troublesome. We don't know if we will be ready by July 13, \nbut there is a lot of history to suggest it is going to be very \ndifficult to be ready by that time.\n  The leader just pointed out the fact that if you compare the work \nrequired to consider the nomination of the now-Chief Justice John \nRoberts as opposed to this nominee, you have more than 10 times as many \ncases to look at with Judge Sotomayor as you had with Justice Roberts. \nThat takes a lot of time. And even with 20-some staffers reading these \n4,000-plus decisions, it is not just a matter of reading the cases; it \nis a matter of then looking to see what the precedents cited were to \ndetermine whether you think the judge was right in the decision that \nwas rendered, to look at the other references in the case to see how \nclosely this followed existing law, and whether it appears the judge \nmight be trying to make law as opposed to deciding law.\n  That is important in this particular case because of the standard the \nPresident laid down for his nominees which strongly suggests something \nbeyond deciding the law. In 5 percent of the cases, as he said, there \nis no precedent, there is no legal mechanism for deciding how the case \nshould come out. You have to base it on other factors. Everybody is \nwell aware of some of the factors this particular nominee has talked \nabout and the President has talked about--the empathy, the background, \nthe experience in other matters.\n  The question is, in reading these opinions, do you find a trend of \ndeciding cases on something other than the law, potentially the making \nof law in this particular case? And even if, as the leader said, you \nhave to review 76 cases a day, that is only the decisions she has \nparticipated in or the opinions she has written or joined in.\n  How about the other writings--her law review writings, her speeches \nshe has given, the FBI report, the ABA report, which we do not have \nyet, the questionnaire which has not been completed; in other words, a \nvariety of things that have been reviewed and read. And then you \ndiscuss the nomination with witnesses to say this matter has been \nraised, this matter has been raised, what do you think about that?\n  She will have a variety of people who will be writing to the \ncommittee on her behalf. We will receive reams of letters and comments \nfrom people who think she is a good nominee, and we will receive a lot \nof comments, I suspect, from people who think she is not a good \nnominee. We need to go through all of that. When people write to us\n\n[[Page S6344]]\n\nabout these nominees, for or against, we don't ignore what they say; we \ntake it to heart. That is part of our job. All of this takes a great \ndeal of time and effort.\n  Final point, Mr. President. We don't want to leave this to staff. We \nare going to read those opinions. I have instructed my staff on the \nopinions I want to read. I am used to reading court opinions, but not \neverybody has done that fairly recently in their career, and that takes \na lot of time as well, considering all the other work we have to do.\n  To do this right, to conduct the kind of fair and thorough hearing \nthat Senator Sessions talked about, and to follow the kind of \nprecedents and tradition that the minority leader talked about, I think \nit is important for us to do it right, to get it right, to take the \ntime that requires. And if that means going beyond July 13, then do \nthat.\n  Senator Specter, when he was chairman of the committee, worked in a \nbipartisan way with Senator Leahy. Senator Leahy can certainly work in \na bipartisan way with us to ensure there is an adequate amount of time.\n  At the end of the day, what we want is a hearing that everyone can \nsay was fair, was thorough, resulted in a good decision and, hopefully \nand presumably, will allow this nominee, if she is confirmed, to take \nher position prior to the beginning of the October term. Justice \nRoberts was confirmed, I believe, on the 29th of September, and that \nwas 4 days ahead of the time, I think--or 2 days. The Court reconvenes \non October 5. Therefore, I see no reason why, if we do this right, we \ncannot have the nominee--if this nominee is confirmed--confirmed by the \ntime the October term begins.\n  I say to my colleagues, let's do this right and not try to push \nthings beyond the point that is appropriate under the circumstances.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kyl for his leadership \non this committee. He is one of the Senate's great lawyers. I \nappreciate his insights, as we all do.\n  I note that I think this rush is ill advised. In truth, the White \nHouse was determined to get the nominee's questionnaire to the Senate \nin a hurry. There were a number of cameras and crews and press releases \nthat went out when boxes were delivered. In many ways, the \nquestionnaire was incomplete, the result, I think, of that kind of \nrush. In others, the nominee failed to provide sufficient details that \nare required by the questionnaire.\n  For example, the judge did not include a troubling recommendation to \nthe Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund to lobby against a New York State \nlaw that would reinstate the death penalty, and it had quite a bit of \nintemperate rhetoric in it. After that was noted, she admitted she had \nfailed to include but got that document in. But I suggest perhaps if \nsomebody had not been aware of that omission, maybe we would not have \nreceived that document at all. What else might she have failed to \ninclude that might be an important bit of information as our committee \ndoes its oversight work?\n  In addition, the nominee was supposed to provide opinions and filings \nfor cases going to verdict, judgment, or final decision. For three \ncases, she indicates that the District Attorney's Office is searching \nits records for information on this case, and she did not provide \nthose.\n  In 14 cases, she noted that she tried, the record is incomplete and \nnot provided. So we don't have any documents related to these cases.\n  As another example, the nominee is supposed to list speeches, \nremarks, and lectures she gave and, in the absence of having a prepared \ntext, to provide outlines, notes, and then a summary of the subject \nmatter.\n  Several of the entries lacked any subject matter descriptions or are \nso vague as to be utterly uninformative, including these quotes I will \nnote for the record, and we have had some problems with her speeches. A \nlot of speeches she has given she has no text for.\n  I note this is on her questionnaire: ``I spoke on Second Circuit \nemployee discrimination cases.'' She did not indicate what or give any \nsummary of that.\n  Another one: ``I spoke at a federal court externship class on `Access \nto Justice.' '' It is not clear what that was in any way, and no \nsummary and certainly no text.\n  ``I participated in a panel entitled `Sexual Harassment: How to \nPractice Safe Employment.' '' Similarly, no additional explanation.\n  Next: ``I spoke on the United States judicial system.''\n  Next: ``I spoke on the topic `Lawyering for Social Justice.' I \ndiscussed my life experiences and the role of minority bar \norganizations.''\n  ``I participated in a symposium on post-conviction relief. I spoke on \nthe execution of judgments of conviction.''\n  ``I spoke on the implementation of the Hague Convention in the United \nStates and abroad.''\n  ``I participated in an ACS panel discussion on the sentencing \nguidelines.''\n  ``I participated in a roundtable discussion and reception on `The Art \nof Judging' at this event.''\n  It would be nice to know what she thought about the art of judging.\n  ``I contributed to the panel, `The Future of Judicial Review: The \nView from the Bench' at the 2004 National Convention. The official \ntheme was `Liberty and Equality in the 21st Century.' ''\n  Those are some of the things that I think are inadequate responses to \nthe questionnaire's requirements. This questionnaire is one we have \nused for nominees of both parties for a number of years.\n  The chairman justifies this rushed schedule because of the need, he \nsays, to allow the nominee to respond to unfair criticisms of her \nrecord. But the chairman and all our Democratic colleagues know that \nthe Republican Senators who will actually be voting on this nominee, I \nam confident and certain, have been nothing but extremely fair and \ncourteous and respectful of the nominee. Even when she made mistakes, \nsuch as omitting several things from her questionnaire, we have not \ncriticized her for that. So in return for this courtesy, I am \ndisappointed that we are being rushed to complete this process in a \ntime based on what I know now is not a wise approach. I don't think it \nis a good way to begin the proceedings.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on this date. Perhaps we \ncan do better as we move forward. It is an important process. It is the \npublic's only opportunity to understand what this is about. I think we \nought to do it right. As Senator Leahy has said, do not rush it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, let me say a few words regarding the \nexcellent work of the Judiciary Committee, the work that has been done \nby Chairman Leahy. He has informed me that Senator Sessions has been \nmost cooperative during the entire time Senator Sessions has had this \nnew assignment.\n  Senator McConnell asked me one day last week to delay a floor vote on \nJudge Sotomayor until after the August recess, and he sent me a letter, \nwhich I was happy to receive, making his case for this delay. I \nindicated to him this morning--he, Senator McConnell--that I had a \ntelephone call scheduled with the chairman of the Judiciary Committee \nand the President to go over the content of Senator McConnell's well-\nwritten letter.\n  We had quite a long conversation with the President. Time? I don't \nknow, 15 minutes, 10 minutes. But it was certainly enough to learn very \nquickly that the President was well versed on this nomination.\n  After having spoken with the President and the chairman of the \ncommittee this morning, I had an obligation to convey to Senator \nMcConnell my conclusion based on my conversation with the President.\n  What I wish to do now, Mr. President, is read into the Record a \nletter I had delivered this morning to Leader McConnell:\n\n       Dear Mitch:\n       Thank you for your letter regarding the process for \n     considering the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to the United \n     States Supreme Court. I have taken your concerns\n\n[[Page S6345]]\n\n     into consideration and have discussed the confirmation \n     process with the President and the Chairman of the Judiciary \n     Committee.\n       Judge Sotomayor's judicial record is largely public and has \n     been undergoing extensive review by all interested parties at \n     least since the President announced her nomination on May 26. \n     In addition, she has returned her questionnaire, including \n     available records of her speeches and writings, in record \n     time. Her record for review is now essentially complete.\n       In contrast, both Judge Roberts and Judge Alito had spent \n     significant time in the executive branch and much of their \n     record was not public or available for review following their \n     nominations. Numerous executive branch documents were not \n     included with their questionnaires, and much staff \n     preparation time was devoted to extensive negotiations over \n     document production with both nominations.\n       In 2005, Senator Leahy agreed to a September 6 hearing date \n     for the Roberts nomination before Judge Roberts had submitted \n     his questionnaire, and before more than 75,000 pages of \n     documents, primarily from the Reagan Library and the National \n     Archives, came in throughout August and before the hearing \n     began in September. Indeed, on the eve of the planned start \n     of the hearing, on August 30, the Archives notified the \n     Judiciary Committee they had found a new set of documents \n     consisting of about 15,000 pages. These were delivered \n     September 2, further complicating the hearing preparations. \n     The hearings went ahead on September 12.\n       Furthermore, Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans and Chief \n     Justice Rehnquist passed away while Judge Roberts' nomination \n     to be an Associate Justice, leading to a week-long delay in \n     his hearing after he was then nominated to be the new Chief \n     Justice.\n       Despite these obstacles, Judge Roberts was confirmed 72 \n     days after President Bush named him as a nominee to the \n     Supreme Court. If Judge Sotomayor is confirmed before the \n     Senate recess in August, she will have been confirmed on a \n     virtually identical timetable. If, however, she is not \n     confirmed until the beginning of the Court's term in October, \n     consideration of her nomination will have lasted nearly twice \n     as long as that of Judge Roberts.\n       Confirming Judge Sotomayor before the August recess would \n     give her time to prepare adequately for the Court's fall \n     term, including the review of hundreds of petitions for \n     certiorari for the Court's first conference and preparation \n     for merits arguments. It would also allow her time to move \n     and hire law clerks. I do not believe it is fair to delay \n     Judge Sotomayor's confirmation if it is not absolutely \n     necessary.\n       I appreciate that Senate Republicans are committed to a \n     fair and respectful confirmation process for Judge Sotomayor. \n     I believe it is important that Senators be permitted the \n     opportunity to thoroughly review Judge Sotomayor's record and \n     to fulfill our constitutional duty to provide advice and \n     consent. I believe our proposed schedule for hearings and a \n     floor vote on her confirmation will do so.\n\n  I signed that letter Harry Reid.\n  The hearing date is just 48 days after Judge Sotomayor was selected \nand is consistent with the 51-day average time between announcement of \na Presidential selection and the start of their hearings. It has been \nthat way for the past nine Court nominees who were confirmed.\n  The proposed alternative, that the hearings be held after the August \nrecess, or the first Tuesday after Labor Day, Tuesday, September 8, \nwould subject Judge Sotomayor to the longest delay between selection \nand her confirmation hearing of any Supreme Court nominee in history, \nso far as we can tell. We stopped checking, frankly, when we got back \nto 1960. The GOP plan would delay her hearing until the 107th day after \nher selection. Robert Bork, the current record holder, waited 76 days. \nThomas and Alito waited 64 and 67 days, respectively.\n  We are doing our utmost to have this nominee have a fair hearing. We \nwant to make sure the Republicans have all the time they need, but \nhistory doesn't lie, and history suggests we are being overly generous \nwith this good woman. She will be a wonderful addition to the Court, \nand I would hope we can move forward and have this matter resolved \nquietly, respectfully, and fairly.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, if the Senator would yield. I might add to \nthat. When I met with the distinguished Senator from Alabama last week, \nI had originally suggested it would be well within the appropriate \ntimeframe of the other Justices--including Justice Roberts--that we \nhave the hearing the week we came back from our week-long break of the \nFourth of July. He had expressed--and I will let him speak for \nhimself--some concern about that week after, and so I said: OK, we will \nput it a week later.\n  He, obviously, wanted to speak with his leadership, and that is fine. \nI had originally intended to speak about it on Friday, but I understood \nthat the Republican leader had sent a letter to the majority leader \nbecause the majority leader had told me about that, and we are all \naware of the date. There was never a question about what date I \nintended to start. I had known that for some time. But this morning I \ntold him by telephone I was going to do that date. I talked to the \nPresident, and I so advised Judge Sotomayor.\n  The fact is, we are not doing something where we have problems with \ntens of thousands of pages just days before the hearing. We have all \nthe material. I can't speak for other Senators, but we have a lot of \nwork to do. We are paid well, and we have big staffs. I had hoped to \ntake some vacation time during the Fourth of July week--I will not. I \nwill spend that time preparing for it in my farmhouse in Vermont. I \nwould suggest Senators may have to spend some time doing that. I know a \nlot of our staffs--both Republican and Democratic staffs--are going to \nhave to plan to take time off. They are going to be working hard.\n  We have a responsibility to the American people. Certainly, we have a \nresponsibility to have a Justice have time enough to get a place to \nlive down here, hire law clerks, and get going.\n  Mr. REID. Will my friend yield for a moment?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Sure.\n  Mr. REID. It is also true, is it not, the announcement was made that \nduring the 5 weeks we are in session during July we are going to be \nworking Mondays through Fridays, and you have informed the members of \nthe Judiciary Committee--Democrats and Republicans--that would be the \ncase? That is why--it is my understanding from the distinguished \nchair--you had announced the hearing was going to start on a Monday?\n  Mr. LEAHY. We are going to be in anyway. I would also note this gives \nus plenty of time.\n  We get elected in November, most of us--the first week in November--\nand when we are new Senators, we find it difficult to put everything \ntogether in 2 months, to go into the Senate in January. We should at \nleast give the same courtesy to a Justice of the Supreme Court that we \nexpect the American voters and taxpayers to give us.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I wish to confirm and agree with most of \nwhat the majority leader and our chairman have said. The bottom line \nis, this is a nomination that should be easy to study up on. The record \nis public. The record has been available from the day she was \nnominated. There are not thousands and thousands of pages given to us \nat the end of the days, as I know my colleague, the chairman, has said.\n  I would like to make one other point. I know my colleague, our \nranking minority member, Mr. Sessions, said Alito took some 90 days. \nThat is true. But that included both the Thanksgiving and Christmas \nbreaks. If you look at the actual working days, it was much shorter, as \nit has been for every other Justice. Let me repeat. If we were to do \nwhat the minority leader asks, and not vote on this nomination until \nwell after the September break, it would be the longest nomination \nproceeding we have had for the most publicly available and most concise \nrecord.\n  This is not somebody whom we have to dig and find out things about, \nbecause she has had 17 years--17 years--of Federal decisions at the \ndistrict and at the court of appeals level, more than any other nominee \nto the Supreme Court in 100 years--in 70 years, excuse me. No, in 100 \nyears for Federal and in 70 years for Federal and State because Justice \nCardozo had 29 years on the State bench. The record is ample and the \nrecord is public. Given the staff that I know the Judiciary minority \nhas, as chairman of the Rules Committee, any lawyer worth their salt \ncould more easily research the whole record in less than a month. So, \nactually, Chairman Leahy has been kind of generous by delaying a week \nor two beyond that month.\n\n  Every day, as we speak now, there are, I daresay, tens of thousands \nof lawyers who have larger research dockets to do and are doing them in \nless\n\n[[Page S6346]]\n\ntime. So the bottom line is very simple. One can only come to the \nconclusion that the reason for delay is delay alone, not needing time \nto study a public, ample record. So I would urge my colleagues on the \nother side to reconsider.\n  I have been told, at least on my subcommittee, that no one is going \nto participate in any meetings on anything. I don't know if that is \ntrue--I hope it isn't--that there is going to be an attempt to close \ndown the Judiciary Committee on all the important issues we face.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask my colleague, in terms of the public \nrecord, is it true not only that this is the longest period of time, \nbut if we were to delay it until September, that would be the longest \nperiod of time for consideration of any Justice for the Supreme Court \nin history?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I believe my colleague from Massachusetts is correct.\n  Mr. KERRY. Certainly much longer than Justice Alito, Justice Roberts \nor any of the others whom we considered very rapidly?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Clearly, longer than Roberts--much longer than Roberts--\nand somewhat longer than Alito. But Alito had both the Thanksgiving and \nChristmas breaks that were counted in that time, and we all know people \nare busy celebrating the holidays.\n  Mr. KERRY. I would also ask my colleague whether there is any \nrationale here whatsoever, that we have seen, for why this Justice's \nentire record, which is public, and has been poured over already, \nrequires having the longest period in history, in terms of Justices of \nthe Supreme Court, particularly given the issues that are at stake and \nthe convening of a new Court in October?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Well, I thank my colleague, and I think his points are \nwell taken. As I mentioned before, the bottom line is, any lawyer worth \nhis salt--and there are many very qualified lawyers in the minority on \nthe Judiciary Committee--could research this record within a month, \neasily--easily. Right now, in the buildings here in Washington and in \nthe buildings in New York and in the buildings in Birmingham, AL, are \nlawyers who have far more extensive research to do in less time and \nthey do it well.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Would my friend yield for a question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I know we have to vote, but I wish to speak for a minute. \nAs a woman, and being from California, we have such excitement about \nthis nomination. I know we all agree this is a historic first, this \nnomination, and I think, given that and the fact that the women of this \ncountry comprise a majority and there is only one woman on the Court--\nand we certainly have never had a Latino on the bench--I am asking my \nfriend, does he not believe this nominee should be accorded equal \ntreatment--equal treatment as it relates to the others who have been \nnominated to the same post?\n  That is all I am asking for. I am not on the committee, but I am \nsupporting our Chairman Leahy and the rest of the committee--at least \nthose who are moving toward this in a schedule similar to Justice \nRoberts. I would ask, once again: Shouldn't we, who are very excited \nabout this nomination and want to see it move forward, expect to have \nJudge Sotomayor treated in an equal fashion?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I think my colleague from California makes an excellent \npoint, and I would answer in the affirmative. We are not asking for \nmore time. We are actually asking for less time, if you include \nvacation time.\n  It is not a situation like with Justice Roberts and even Judge Alito, \nwhere there were weeks and weeks before we were able to get private \nrecords that were available. No one has requested--Judge Sotomayor has \nnot worked with the executive, so you don't have all those issues that \nhave to be discussed and negotiated about executive privilege. She has \na 17-year career on the bench. She has 3,000 opinions. If that is not \nan adequate record?\n  My office just in 2 days looked at every one, for instance, of the \nimmigration asylum cases that were brought before her. There were 83--a \npretty good sample, 83 percent. I don't recall the number, but there \nwere a large number of cases, and 83 percent of the time we found she \ndenied asylum to the immigrant applicant, which we concluded made it \npretty clear that her fidelity to rule of law trumped her natural \nsympathy for the immigrant experience.\n  We just did that in a day or two. I don't have the kind of staff that \nmy good friend, the Senator from Alabama, has. He should have it. He is \nthe ranking minority Member. So it is very easy, given the number of \nstaff, given the public record, given that there is no litigation or \ndiscussion about executive privilege--as there was with both nominee \nAlito and nominee Roberts--that a month seems to me to be ample time. \nThe chairman, in his wisdom, to which I will defer, gave more than a \nmonth to the day of the nomination.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the Senator yield for just one question?\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I am happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I know the Senator from California raised the question \nof doing for this nominee as the others. If this goes forward as \nplanned, it would be 48 days from nomination announcement to the first \nhearing. I wonder if the Senator from New York would acknowledge that \nfor Justice Breyer it was 60 days; for John Roberts it was 55, the \nshortest; and Sam Alito was 70. This would be much shorter a period of \ntime than the period we are being given for this nominee, who has 3,500 \ncases.\n  I would ask if the Senator remembers saying with regard to the Alito \nnomination, when our Democratic colleagues asked that it be held over \npast Christmas, and at their request it was done so, he said:\n\n       It is more important to do it right than to do it quickly. \n     And now we have a bipartisan agreement to do that.\n\n  So we just ask for a bipartisan agreement to do it right and not too \nfast. I don't know how we can work it out, but I think this is an \narbitrary date, designed to move this process forward by a certain end \ngame, faster than we need to. The vacancy, as the Senator knows, does \nnot occur until October when Justice Souter steps down. So we do need \nto complete it by then. I have told the President I will work to make \nsure that occurs.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. I thank my colleague.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. If I might respond, with nominee Alito, now Justice \nAlito, there was a Christmas break. As I understand it, according to \nChairman Leahy it was the majority, Republicans, who asked we go to \nthat Christmas break, not the Democrats. In Justice Roberts' case, I \nbelieve Katrina intervened and everybody had to drop everything and \nwork on the emergency of Katrina.\n  If you look at days where the record is available, and it has been \navailable right from the get-go here, and no vacation, no intervening \nlong recesses and things like that, the minority here, any Senator \nhere, will have had more time to scrutinize this record than we have \nhad for most other Judges. Again, underscored by the fact that the \nrecord is public, is open and ample.\n  No one has to go look for needles in a haystack to try to figure out \nthe record of Judge Sotomayor. It is very extensive and ample. With \nJustice Roberts, we only had a few years where he was on the bench and \nall the rest of his record was in the executive and it took us weeks, I \nthink--the chairman probably remembers this better than me--or months \nto get the record.\n  With that, I yield the floor. I know we want to get on with the vote.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to \n3 minutes before the vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I join in saying the chairman of the \nSenate Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy, has come up with a \nreasonable timetable for considering this historic nomination. I \nbelieve his setting Monday, July 13, for the hearing is well within the \nordinary bounds of time allotted for Supreme Court nominees. The \nimportant date is when paperwork is submitted. When it came to the \nsubmission of paperwork before the hearing\n\n[[Page S6347]]\n\nactually took place, basically, when it came to Judge Sotomayor, she \ncompleted her paperwork setting forth her key information, background, \non June 4. The July 13 hearing will take place 39 days after that \npaperwork was submitted.\n  In the case of Justice Alito--who incidentally had participated in \n4,000 cases, 1,000 more than Judge Sotomayor--in that case, in Justice \nAlito's case, the hearing took place 40 days after we received his \nwork; for Chief Justice John Roberts, 43 days. This is entirely \nconsistent.\n  I might also add a point that was raised by Senator Udall of New \nMexico. Judge Sotomayor is no stranger to this Chamber. She was \nnominated first for the district court bench by President George \nHerbert Walker Bush and then nominated for the district court by \nPresident Clinton. That is an indication that we have seen her work \nbefore. We are aware of her background.\n  The last point I would make, consistent with the Senator from \nCalifornia, is that justice delayed could be justice denied. In this \ncase, if we continue this hearing for a record-breaking period of \ntime--which has been requested by the Republican side--it will mean we \nwill have a vacancy on the Supreme Court when it begins its important \nwork this fall.\n  What Chairman Leahy has asked for is reasonable. It is consistent \nwith the way Judges were treated under President Bush and at the time \nthe Republicans had no objection or complaint about it. This is a \nreasonable timetable. I urge my colleagues to support Chairman Leahy.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6347-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6347]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, today in the Appropriations Defense \nSubcommittee we heard about some good things going on in South Asia and \nthe new strategy for both Afghanistan and Pakistan to bring military \nand civilian efforts into that region.\n  I understand the Armed Services Committee has just approved the \nnomination of LTG Stanley McChrystal, an ex-commander of the \ninternational security forces, the final senior-level military position \nin the theater.\n  The dedicated members of the American military, our intelligence \nprofessionals and State Department officials continue to serve our \ncountry well, but it is essential that the efforts of each be woven \ntogether to form a comprehensive strategy that will not only win the \nbattle but win the war. This will take senior leaders of great vision \nin all areas of our government.\n\n[[Page S6348]]\n\n  Last November I reached out to many of these leaders when I sent then \nPresident-elect Obama and his national security team my report on the \nway forward in Afghanistan and Pakistan. President Obama has taken many \nof the steps I outlined, steps that are critical to our long-term \nsuccess in the region.\n  Earlier this year the President appointed a special envoy for the \nregion who will oversee the implementation of the new strategy and he \nappointed a new ambassador to Afghanistan, who will focus the efforts \nof U.S. Government agencies in country. With General Petraeus firmly in \nplace as the CENTCOM commander and the recent nomination of LTG Stanley \nMcChrystal as the next commander of International Security Forces, \nAfghanistan--COMISAF--the President will have filled the senior-most \nmilitary and civilian positions in-theater.\n  I recently met personally with General McChrystal to talk about our \nway forward in the region and to listen to his ideas on Afghanistan and \nPakistan. I must say I was impressed. He is not only a dedicated and \naccomplished soldier who has years of combat and counterterrorism \nexperience, he is also an effective leader who understands the critical \nchallenges we face in the region. More importantly, he understands that \nthe war will not be won with military might alone--that to win this war \nwe must combine the outstanding work of our military with effective \ndiplomatic and economic efforts.\n  A true counterinsurgency--or COIN--strategy, one that wins the hearts \nand minds of the local population and gains grassroots support for \ndevelopment and governance efforts, includes an effective public \ndiplomacy campaign. General McChrystal not only understands the \nimportance of good public diplomacy, he is dedicated to ensuring that \nour actions on the ground speak as loudly for our intentions as do our \ninformation efforts. That is part of what I call ``smart power''--\ncombining diplomatic, economic, informational and military efforts.\n  I have seen first-hand the success of these smart power efforts. In \nNangarhar Province, the Missouri National Guard Agriculture Development \nteam gained the trust and cooperation of the local leaders. These \nMissourians have given Afghans in Nangarhar the skills they need to \ngrow and harvest legitimate and sustainable crops. As a result, Afghan \nfarmers are not only improving their own lives and land, but poppy \nproduction in the region has virtually been eliminated. I am confident \nthat General McChrystal will support increased focus and investment in \nsmart power efforts such as these.\n  General McChrystal understands how critical putting an ``Afghan \nface'' on our combat operations is to our ultimate success. I was \npleased that when we talked about accomplishing this goal by improving \nour efforts to train the Afghan National Army and Police, General \nMcChrystal acknowledged the Afghan component is essential to any \nsuccessful COIN strategy. Years of special operations experience has \nled him to know inherently how important it is to have the populace \ngain confidence in its own government institutions. Having met with the \ngeneral in Iraq and seen the good work he did there, having watched his \nwork on the Joint Staff, and having spoken with him at length over the \npast several weeks, I can unequivocally state that he is the kind of \nofficer who intends to do just this--build public trust in Afghanistan.\n  Just look at his testimony. According to the general, more \nintelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance (ISR) is good not only \nbecause it gives you a better understanding of the battle space, but \nalso because it increases precision which ultimately reduces civilian \ncasualties. Reducing civilian casualties is a must and will gain trust \nin Afghanistan.\n  General McChrystal also believes that corruption is ``one of the \nthings that must be reduced for the government to be legitimate, and \ntherefore for the people to trust it.'' The general intends for us to \npartner with Afghans at every level to help them rid or reduce the \nwidespread corruption because it has a corrosive effect on the \nlegitimacy of the government and is perceived by the Afghan people to \nbe a real problem. This will also gain trust in Afghanistan.\n  Finally, he believes it is important that we succeed in Afghanistan \nnot only because it removes access to safe havens for al-Qaida and \nassociated groups, but because it is the right thing to do. According \nto the general's testimony, ``we have the ability to--to support the \npeople of Afghanistan and to move and to shape a better future that \nthey want. And I think that that will make a difference in how we are \nviewed worldwide.'' This gains trust in general.\n  Everything I have seen or heard about Lieutenant General McChrystal, \nfrom my conversations with him and from his testimony before the Senate \nArmed Services Committee, his impeccable record of military command and \noperations, to the comments of his fellow officers, tells me that Stan \nMcChrystal will be a wise, measured, and excellent commander of our \noperations in Afghanistan. I strongly urge my colleagues to support \nthis nomination without delay so General McChrystal can get on the \nground.\n  I thank the Chair, and I particularly thank my distinguished \ncolleague from Utah.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6348-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6348-S6349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          CONFIRMATION PROCESS\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to associate myself with the remarks \nand concerns expressed earlier by both the Judiciary Committee's \nranking member, Senator Sessions, and the distinguished Republican \nleader and whip, Senators McConnell and Kyl.\n  The White House talking points tell us that the Supreme Court \nnomination, Judge Sonia Sotomayor, has more Federal judicial experience \nthan any Supreme Court nominee in a century. My friends on the other \nside of the aisle have taken, used, and aggressively circulated these \ntalking points. I assume by stressing judicial experience they are \nsaying that this overwhelmingly deep, broad, and vast judicial record \nprovides the basis on which to judge the nominee's fitness for the \nSupreme Court. Well, that coin has two sides. The flip side is that a \n17-year judicial career that has produced thousands of judicial \ndecisions takes time to evaluate adequately and properly to consider. \nThe question is whether the majority is at all interested in a genuine, \nserious, deliberative process by which the Senate can fulfill one of \nour most important constitutional responsibilities. This process should \nbe fair and thorough. Instead, it is being rigged and rushed for no \napparent reason other than that the majority can do so.\n  This process should be bipartisan, and instead it is becoming \nentirely partisan. The ranking member was not even given the very same \ncourtesy that the chairman was given when he was in that position at \nthe time of the previous Supreme Court nominations.\n  Let me focus on the process followed to consider the previous Supreme \nCourt nominee, Justice Samuel Alito. He had served on the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Third Circuit for more than 15 years when he was \nnominated to the Supreme Court. This is 5 years longer than Judge \nSotomayor has served on the Second Circuit and nearly the same as Judge \nSotomayor's combined judicial service on both the district and circuit \ncourts.\n  The other party demanded and was granted 70 days from the \nannouncement of the nomination to the hearing to study then-Judge \nAlito's record. The Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Specter, was \nchairman at the time. He made no unilateral partisan announcements. He \nimposed no truncated, limited timeframe. No, he consulted the ranking \nmember, and they agreed there would be 70 days to study that voluminous \njudicial record.\n  Oh, what a difference an election makes. With the unilateral partisan \nedict announced today by the chairman, we are being given only 48 days \nto study the same lengthy record. We are told we must consider the \nlargest judicial record in a century in the shortest time in modern \nmemory, and that is simply not enough. It is not enough to do the job \nright, and I would remind my friends on the other side that it was \ntheir leaders who once said that it is more important to do it right \nthan to do it fast. That was when there was a Republican President and \na Republican Senate. Are we to assume from the unilateral imposition of \na stunted and inadequate process that the majority today no longer \ncares that the confirmation process be done right, only that it be done \nfast?\n\n[[Page S6349]]\n\n  The chairman has actually suggested that he really has no choice, \nthat some intemperate criticism by a few people has somehow forced his \nhand. He cannot be serious about this. This nominee has the full force \nand weight of no less than the entire administration of a currently \npopular President, a compliant media, and the largest partisan \ncongressional majority in decades to come to her defense. Interest \ngroups are mobilizing, lobbying campaigns are in full swing, Web sites \nare already in operation. With all of that, are we to believe a few \nill-considered remarks by a few people outside this body are enough to \ncut the confirmation process off at the knees? Are we to believe this \nis all it takes to set aside fairness, to undercut the ability of the \nSenate to do its confirmation duty, and to inject this degree of \npartisanship and rancor into the process? Give me a break.\n  This is choice, plain and simple, and it is the wrong choice. The \ndistinguished Senator from New York, Mr. Schumer, has said that \nSenators on our side of the aisle oppose this nominee at their peril, \nas if there is any peril in fairly applying basic principles and \nstandards to this as well as to other nominees. But the distinguished \nmajority leader has apparently said the same thing to Senators on this \nside of the aisle, literally daring any of them to vote against this \nnominee. That is a strange tactic, indeed, especially so publicly and \nso early on in the process. It makes me wonder whether there are \nconcerns, even on the majority side, that the leadership simply cannot \nallow to be expressed.\n  I urge my friends on the other side to reconsider and not be \nintimidated and not be pushed around. There is more than enough time to \ndo the confirmation job right, to have a fair and thorough process that \ncan have a confirmed Justice in place when the Supreme Court begins its \nterm in October. There is no need gratuitously to further politicize \nthe confirmation process. Injecting such partisanship at the beginning \neasily can result in greater conflict and division further down the \nconfirmation road, and that is not good for Judge Sotomayor or anybody \nelse in this body. That is not in the best tradition of the Senate, it \nis not how the Supreme Court nominations have been considered in the \npast, and it is not the way we should do this today.\n  I have been informed there have been some 4,000 decisions. My gosh, \nit is going to take some time to go through those decisions.\n  I believe we ought to be fair in this body, and fairness means giving \nenough time to be able to do the job properly and to get it done within \na reasonable period of time and not be pushed in ways that really don't \nmake sense.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6349-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6349-S6352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes now to talk \nabout the perils of creating a government plan on American families and \nhealth care.\n  I am very disappointed that the President and my friends on the other \nside of the aisle have chosen to pursue the creation of a new \ngovernment-run plan--one of the most divisive issues in health care \nreform--rather than focusing on broad areas of compromise that can lead \nus toward bipartisan reform in health care legislation.\n  Yesterday, I spearheaded a letter with my Republican Finance \nCommittee colleagues urging the President to strike a more conciliatory \ntone on health care reform. Having played a profound role in almost \nevery major health care legislation for the last three decades and \nhaving worked repetitively in a bipartisan manner with everyone from \nSenators Kennedy and Dodd to Congressman Waxman, I know something about \ngetting things done for our families in a thoughtful manner. You \nadvance legislation by focusing on areas of compromise, not strife.\n  First and foremost, let me make this point again, even though I am \nstarting to sound like a broken record: Reforming our health care \nsystem to ensure that every American has access to quality, affordable, \nand portable health care is not a Republican or Democratic issue; it is \nan American issue. When we are dealing with one-sixth of our economy, \nit is absolutely imperative that we address this challenge in a \nbipartisan manner. Anything less would be a huge disservice to our \nfamilies and our Nation.\n  Clearly, health care spending continues to grow too fast. This year \nwill mark the biggest ever 1-year jump in health care's share of our \nGDP--a full percentage point to 17.6 percent. You can think of this as \na horse race between costs and resources to cover these costs. The sad \nreality is that costs win year after year.\n  Growing health care costs translate directly into higher coverage \ncosts. Since the last decade, the cost of health coverage has increased \nby 120 percent--three times the growth of inflation and four times the \ngrowth of wages. It is not the only problem, but cost is one part of \nthe reason more than 45 million Americans do not have health insurance.\n  I believe we need to do more to ensure we achieve universal and \naffordable access to quality health care for every American. We can do \nthis by reforming and improving the current system. However, the \ncreation of a government plan is nothing more than a backdoor approach \nto a Washington-run health care system.\n  At a time when major government programs such as Medicare and \nMedicaid are already on a path to fiscal insolvency, creating a brand \nnew government program will not only worsen our long-term financial \noutlook but also negatively impact American families who enjoy the \nprivate coverage of their choice.\n  To put this in perspective, as of this year, Medicare has a liability \nof almost $39 trillion, which in turn translates into a financial \nburden of more than $300,000 per American family.\n  In our current fiscal environment, where the government will have to \nborrow nearly 50 cents of every dollar it spends this year, exploding \nour deficit by almost $1.8 trillion, let's think hard about what we are \ndoing to our country and our future generations.\n  The impact of a new government-run program on families who currently \nhave private insurance of their choice is also alarming. A recent \nMilliman study estimated that cost-shifting from government payers, \nspecifically Medicare and Medicaid, already costs families with private \ninsurance nearly $1,800 more each year. Creating another government-run \nplan will further increase these costs on our families in Utah and \nacross the country.\n  Let me make a very important point. A new government plan is nothing \nmore than a Trojan horse for a single-payer system, a one-size-fits-all \ngovernment-mandated system, where we are going to put bureaucrats \nbetween you and your doctors. Washington-run programs undermine market-\nbased competition through their ability to impose price controls and \nshift costs to other purchasers.\n  The nonpartisan Lewin Group has concluded that a government plan open \nto all, and offering Medicare-level reimbursement rates, would result \nin 119.1 million Americans losing their private coverage. This is \nalmost three times the size of the entire Medicare Program, which is \nalready in trouble. More important, this would run contrary to the \nPresident's own pledge to the American families about allowing them to \nkeep the coverage of their choice. So far as I know, no one has \ndisputed the Lewin Group. They are well known as one of the most \nnonpartisan groups in the country.\n  Proponents of this government plan seem to count on the efficiency of \nthe Federal Government in delivering care for American families, since \nit is already doing such a great job with our banking and automobile \nindustry.\n  Medicare is a perfect example. It is on a path to fiscal meltdown, \nwith Part A already facing bankruptcy within the next decade, and we \nall know it. It underpays doctors by 20 percent and hospitals by 30 \npercent, compared to the private sector, forcing increasing numbers of \nproviders to simply stop seeing our Nation's seniors. According to the \nJune 2008 MedPAC report, 9 out of 10 Medicare beneficiaries have to get \nadditional benefits beyond their Medicare coverage--9 out of 10.\n  We have a broken doctor payment system in Medicare that has to be \nfixed every year, so seniors can continue to get care. This year alone, \nthis broken formula calls for a more than 20-percent cut. I can keep \ngoing, but the point is simple: Washington and a government-run plan is \nnot the answer.\n  Talk about creating problems. The supporters of the government plan\n\n[[Page S6350]]\n\nknow these facts. So they are trying a different approach by claiming \nthat the government plan is simply competing with the private sector on \na so-called level playing field. Give me a break.\n  History has shown us that forcing free market plans to compete with \nthese government-run programs always creates an unlevel playing field \nand dooms true competition.\n  The Medicare Program, once again, provides an important lesson. As a \npolitical compromise, Medicare was set up in 1965 to pay doctors and \nhospitals the same rates as the private sector. Faced with rising \nbudget pressures, Congress quickly abandoned this level-playing-field \napproach and enacted price limits for doctors and hospitals. Today, as \nI have said, Medicare payments are 20 percent less for doctors and 30 \npercent less for hospitals compared to the private sector. I have been \ntold by doctors from Utah and across the country that if this \ncontinues, they will simply stop seeing patients altogether. A number \nof them are ready to quit the profession. I cannot tell you the \nproblems that will arise if we go to a government-run program--a Trojan \nhorse to lead us to a government-mandated, government-run, one-size-\nfits-all massive program.\n  In his March, 2009, testimony before the House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, Doug Elmendorf, the Director of the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, testified that it would be ``extremely \ndifficult'' to create ``a system where a public plan [government plan, \nif you will] could compete on a level playing field'' against private \ncoverage. The end result would be a Federal Government takeover of our \nhealth care system, taking decisions out of the hands of our doctors \nand our patients, placing them in the hands of a Washington \nbureaucracy, and inserting that bureaucracy right between them.\n  Here is the bottom line: We are walking down a path where stories \nsuch as Jack Tagg's could become increasingly common in our great \ncountry. In 2006, Jack Tagg, a former World War II pilot, suffered from \na severe case of macular degeneration. The regional government \nbureaucrats rejected his request for treatment, citing high costs, \nunless the disease hit his other eye also. It took 3 years to overturn \nthat decision--3 years, while he had to suffer, when we could have done \nthis in a better way.\n  Let's remember that a family member with cancer in an intensive care \nunit would probably neither have the time nor the resources to appeal \nsuch an egregious bureaucratic decision. We need to remember the real \nimplications of these policies--not simply in terms of political spin \nand special interests but in terms of its impact on real people, who \nare mothers, fathers, husbands, wives, brothers, sisters, and children.\n  Similar to the ill-conceived stimulus legislation and flawed auto \nbailout plan, health care reform has the potential of simply becoming \nanother example of the Democrats justifying the current economic \nturmoil to further expand the Federal Government.\n  To enact true health care reform, we have to come together as one to \nwrite a reasonable and responsible bill for the American families who \nare faced with rising unemployment and out-of-control health care \ncosts.\n  I do look forward to working together to transform our sick-care \nsystem into a true health care system. I continue to hold deep in my \nheart that we will move beyond these beltway games and work together in \na bipartisan way to fix Main Street. The time is now and I am ready.\n  I am absolutely positive the way to go is not with a government-run, \ngovernment-mandated health care program, which will bring the lowest \ncommon denominator in health care to everybody. I think you are going \nto find that the costs are so astronomical, the way it is being formed \nin the HELP Committee, in particular, that we are leaving a burden on \nour kids and grandkids and great grandkids that is going to be \ninsurmountable.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Before the Senator leaves the floor, I wish to tell the \nSenator from Utah how much I am looking forward, on a personal level, \nto working with him in this 5-month sprint to figure out a way to fix \nAmerican health care in a bipartisan fashion. Some of the moments I am \nproudest of have been those when the two of us have been able to team \nup on health reform. Without getting into it this afternoon, let me say \nthat millions of poor young people who use community health centers are \ngetting services there at no extra cost to our taxpayers, because \nSenator Hatch was willing to work with this Senator and a group of \nothers, including public interest groups and a wide variety of health \ncare advocates, in order to change malpractice rules. This was done to \nmake sure not only that those who had a legitimate claim got served but \nalso that the bulk of the money went to patients in need. Thousands of \nlow-income Americans get care because Senator Hatch was willing to take \na stand for low-income folks. I wish to tell him I am very much looking \nforward to working with him and our colleagues on a bipartisan basis \nover the next 5 months to get this job done.\n  Mr. HATCH. If the Senator will yield, I am very appreciative of the \nSenator's remarks. I have spent 33 years working on virtually every \nhealth care bill that has come up. We have always done it in a \nbipartisan way. I certainly enjoy working with the distinguished \nSenator from Oregon. He is one of the more thoughtful people in health \ncare on the Finance Committee and in this whole body. I am grateful to \nhim for wanting to work together and in a bipartisan manner. We need to \ndo that. You cannot work on a partisan basis on issues regarding the \nAmerican economy. There are some in the White House and on the \nDemocratic side who want to do that. I am grateful the Senator from \nOregon is not one of them. I, personally, will do everything in my \npower to try to put together a bipartisan approach to this that would \nwork and would put the best of the private sector in with the best of \nthe government sector and work for our folks in this country. When you \nare talking about one-sixth of the American economy, if we do that, it \nwill be for the betterment of the country and for everybody. If we go \nin a partisan, one-size-fits-all way--especially, in my opinion, with a \ngovernment-run plan--we are going to be anything but good as far as \nhealth care is concerned. I am grateful for the Senator's kind remarks.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I share the Senator's interests. There are \na lot of Senators of good will on both sides of the aisle who want to \nget this done right.\n  Mr. HATCH. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning \nbusiness for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. When I was a young man, I got involved working with senior \ncitizens as codirector of the Oregon Gray Panthers. Every day back \nthen, we got up and said we are going to make a difference. We are \ngoing to help people and, particularly, for senior citizens we are \ngoing to make it possible for them to have a better quality of life.\n  The distinguished occupant of the chair is, I think, close to my age. \nWe can both recall that in those days if a town had a lunch program for \nsenior citizens, that was considered a big deal. There weren't a whole \nlot of discount programs. People didn't even talk about home and \ncommunity-based health care services. In most of the country, back \nthen, if a town had a lunch program for senior citizens, that was \nconsidered a full-fledged program for older people.\n  In those early days with the Oregon Gray Panthers I started thinking \nabout the importance of good-quality, affordable health care. I spent \nhours and hours back then watching what happened when seniors and their \nfamilies got exploited in the health care system. The first issue I was \ninvolved with concerning senior citizens was a real tragedy. At that \ntime, there were a lot of older people who needed insurance to \nsupplement their Medicare. It was very common for senior citizens then, \nevery time some fast-talking salesman came through, to buy another \npolicy. When I was running the legal aid office for senior citizens I \nwould go to visit older people in their homes, and very often they \ncould take out a shoe box full of\n\n[[Page S6351]]\n\nhealth insurance policies--15 or 20 policies. A lot of them weren't \nworth the paper they were written on. In fact, they had what were known \nas subrogation clauses, so that if you had another policy, the first \none would not pay off. It was tragic to watch senior citizens walking \non an economic tightrope every week, balancing food against fuel and \nfuel against medical bills, and getting sold all this junk health \ninsurance, and as I said earlier, most of it wasn't worth a lot more \nthan the paper it was written on. I starting saying to people, I want \nto do something about this. In a few years, I got elected to the House \nof Representatives, and I had a chance to work with both Democrats and \nRepublicans, a number of them in the Senate today. Chairman Baucus was \nvery involved in the effort.\n\n  In the early nineties, we finally drained that swamp of paper. Today \nit is possible for a senior to have just one of these policies, not 15 \nor 20, and have the extra money to spend on other essentials. The \ncoverage is standardized so you don't need to be some kind of Houdini \nin order to figure it out.\n  That effort resulted in the only tough law on the books today that \nreally has teeth in it to regulate and stop some of these private \ninsurance ripoffs. I am very proud to have taken a role along with some \nof my colleagues in the Senate in changing it.\n  Democrats and Republicans, as part of health reform, are going to \nhave to fix the insurance market for the nonelderly population. The \ninsurance market today for those who are not in Medicare or in the \nveterans system, but who instead have private coverage, is inhumane. It \nis all about cherry-picking. It is about trying to find healthy people \nand send sick people over to government programs more fragile than they \nare. That is today's insurance market.\n  Fortunately, a big group of Democratic Senators and Republican \nSenators are now on record saying they want to change that. They want \nto make sure, for example, that people cannot be discriminated against \nif they have a preexisting condition. These Senators want to make sure, \nfor example, that instead of being sent off to the individual insurance \nmarket, where people don't really have any clout or any bargaining \npower, people will be able to be part of a bigger group so they get \nmore value for their health care dollar. In this larger group market, \ninsurance companies pay out a bigger portion of the premium dollar in \nterms of benefits.\n  Democrats and Republicans are prepared to, in effect, turn the \ncurrent system of private insurance around completely and say: Instead \nof basing it on cherry-picking, which is what it is about today, in the \nfuture, private insurers should have to take all comers. They should \nnot discriminate. People should pool into large groups, and the \ncompanies should compete on price, benefits, and quality. There will \nhave to be prevention and wellness so it is not just sick care, as \nSenator Hatch touched on very eloquently.\n  That is something Democrats and Republicans already are on record as \ncoming together to support. Fixing the private insurance marketplace is \na fundamental part of health reform.\n  There are other areas where Democrats and Republicans can join \nforces. One that I care most about is making health care coverage \nportable so that you do not lose your coverage when either you leave \nyour job or your job leaves you.\n  This is an especially serious problem for the millions of folks who \nare laid off today. They go to a program called COBRA, which, I might \nnote, is the only Federal program named after a poisonous snake. \nColleagues have improved it, certainly, in the stimulus to try to \nprovide additional assistance. But it is still part of a dysfunctional \nsystem that has not changed a whole lot since the 1940s. Much of the \nrules with respect to coverage--and certainly, in my opinion, that have \nled to the lack of portability--were made in the 1940s, when there were \nwage and price controls, and when big decisions got made that affect \nhealth care today.\n  Back in the 1940s, the rules made some sense for those times. People \nwould usually go to work somewhere and pretty much stay put for 20 or \n25 years until you gave them a gold watch and a 20,000-calorie \nretirement dinner. That is not what the workforce is about today.\n  Today the typical worker changes their job 11 times by the time they \nare 40. So what workers need is portable health care coverage, coverage \nthey can take from place to place. People do not need to find that when \nthey lose their jobs, they go out and face discrimination in the \ninsurance marketplace where they are not able to afford insurance, even \nwith the COBRA subsidies which, of course, run out often before they \nget their next position.\n  The current system is also anti-entrepreneur because very often \nsomebody who works for a business has a good idea and they would like \nto go into the marketplace and try it out, but if they have an illness, \nthey cannot leave their job because they are not going to be able to \nget coverage at their next job.\n  Once again, Democrats and Republicans in the Senate are on record as \nbeing willing to make a fundamental change in the way the system works \ntoday. They are on record in favor of portability and guaranteeing to \nAmericans who lose their job or want to go somewhere else the ability \nto take their coverage with them. This system would be administered in \na seamless kind of way so you wouldn't have to go out and reapply and \nhave physicals and incur excessive costs.\n  Which leads me to my next point where Democrats and Republicans are \nin agreement, and that is lowering the crushing costs of health care \nadministration. This Senate has begun to move in the right direction, \nwith the leadership of the Obama administration, to promote electronic \nmedical records. As far as I am concerned, we ought to send these paper \nmedical records off to the Museum of American History and put them next \nto the typewriter and telegraph.\n  The Obama administration has made good progress in moving in that \ndirection. But much more needs to be done to lower administrative costs \nin health care.\n  Once again, Democrats and Republicans have teamed up. They've said, \nlet's use the withholding system. We already do that for administering \nmuch of the human services benefits on which our people rely. We will \nmake sure people sign up once so they don't have to go through it again \nand again. We will pool people into these larger groups so they don't \nhave to experience the excessive administrative costs that are \nassociated with smaller groups, and they will have portable coverage so \nour people do not have to apply time and again, every time they change \ntheir job.\n  For each one of these issues--insurance reform, portability, lower \nadministrative costs--already there exists a significant group of \nDemocrats and Republicans in the Senate willing to join forces.\n  My own view is these are not partisan issues, and I think there are \nother areas that can also be tackled together by Democrats and \nRepublicans.\n  One of the most contentious of those upcoming issues involves the tax \nrules for American health care. The reason these are so important is, \nof course, they are vital to Americans who are trying to pay for their \nhealth care and other essentials. These tax rules, which are upwards of \n$250 billion a year, amount to the biggest federal health care program.\n  Prominent Democrats and prominent Republicans, just in the last few \nweeks, have said these rules do not make sense. Let me give some \nexamples for colleagues on our side of the aisle of some of the \nprogressives who have called for reforms just in the last couple of \nweeks. Robert Reich, the former Secretary of Labor, certainly one of \nthe leading progressive thinkers in our country, has talked about the \nregressivity of these rules, how they disproportionately favor the most \naffluent. Bob Greenstein, the head of the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, is on record with the same views. Both of those reflect the \ncomments of individuals who are progressive.\n  Suffice it to say, a number of conservatives have spoken out against \nthese rules as well. Milton Friedman, going back to a legendary \nconservative, began to speak out against these rules some time ago.\n  We ought to deal with these issues on a bipartisan basis. I know of \nno Senator--not a single one--who is going to support taxes on middle-\nclass people on\n\n[[Page S6352]]\n\ntheir health care. It is off the table. It is not going to happen. \nThere are 100 of us. Not a single one of us is going to support taxing \nthose individuals. But I do think Democrats and Republicans, just like \nRobert Reich and Bob Greenstein on the Democratic side and \nconservatives going back to Milton Friedman on the Republican side, \nhave said we can come together and find a way to make sure in the \nfuture these rules do not subsidize inefficiency and also \ndisproportionately favor the most affluent.\n  What is tragic in the State of Delaware, the State of Oregon, the \nState of Georgia, is, if somebody does not have health care coverage \nand works in a furniture store outside Atlanta, they, in effect, have \ntheir Federal tax dollar subsidize somebody who is particularly well \noff who decides they want to get a designer smile in their health care \nplan.\n  Can we not all say in the interest of protecting taxpayers and \nfairness that we want that person who is interested in their designer \nsmile to be able to buy as many of them as they want; but can we not \nagree, Democrats and Republicans, that if they are going to get a \ndesigner smile, they are going to pay for it with their own money \nrather than with subsidized dollars?\n  In each of these areas I mentioned there is an opportunity for \nDemocrats and Republicans to come together. What each of the areas I \nhave touched on deals with is making health care more affordable--more \naffordable for individuals, more affordable for families, and more \naffordable for taxpayers who are getting pretty darned worried about \nthe debts that are being incurred and the prospect that their kids and \ntheir grandkids are going to have to pick up some of these bills.\n  I believe one of the keys to making health care more affordable is to \nmake it possible for the individual, largely as part of a group where \nthey can have some clout, to be rewarded for making a financially sound \ndecision for herself and her family and to have a choice to go to the \nkind of program that makes sense for her and her family.\n  The current statistics show 85 percent of our people who are lucky \nenough to have employer coverage get no choice. Let me repeat that. \nEighty-five percent of those who are lucky enough to have employer \ncoverage get no choice.\n  Every one of us is going to require that a final bill protect \nsomebody's right to keep the coverage they have. Mr. President, 100 \nSenators are going to vote for the requirement that you can keep the \ncoverage you have. But can we not agree, as Democrats and Republicans, \nthat we are also going to say you ought to have some other choices? I \nwould like those choices to be in the private sector. If you can find a \nplan that is financially in your interest, you can keep the difference \nbetween what your health care costs today and what this new health \npackage you buy costs. You can keep the difference. We will have a \nfunctioning market. If you save $600, $800 on the health care you buy, \nyou have $800 to go fishing in Oregon, and I suspect the Senators from \nDelaware and Georgia may have some other ideas for where people can use \ntheir savings.\n  The point is, we will have created a market where there is none now. \nI consider the current health care system today, for all practical \npurposes, a money-laundering operation. What we have done largely since \nWorld War II is set it up so that third parties call the shots, and \nthere are not any opportunities for individuals who want to make a \ncost-conscious choice to buy a good quality health care package. In \neffect, the individual has been divorced from the process completely.\n\n  I am not calling for individuals to go off into the health insurance \nmarketplace by themselves. What I am saying is they ought to have the \nopportunity, as we have as Members of Congress, to be part of a large \ngroup where they can have clout, where they aren't discriminated \nagainst, where they do have power in the marketplace to make a sensible \nchoice for themselves and their family.\n  So in each of these areas, Mr. President--and this is why I wanted to \ncome to the floor of the Senate today, because I know emotions are \nstarting to run hot on this health issue--I have outlined ways in which \nDemocrats and Republicans can come together. The Congressional Budget \nOffice, which is the independent arbiter of all of this, has largely \nscored the proposals I have outlined in the legislation that 14 \nSenators are in support of as being budget neutral over a 2-year phase-\nin period. The CBO has said that in the third year the proposals would \nactually start bending the cost curve downward.\n  I close with this--and I thank my colleague and friend from Georgia \nfor his patience--I think we have five of our most dedicated \nlegislators working now on a bipartisan basis in two committees to \nbring Democrats and Republicans together. The leaders on the Finance \nCommittee on which I serve--Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley have \nbeen extremely fair and gracious. They have put untold hours into this \nissue. Both of them have spent an exceptional amount of time with me, \nand they have extended that offer to literally any Member of the \nSenate, to sit down and spend time with them to try to address this \nbill in a bipartisan way. In the HELP Committee, Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Dodd, and Senator Enzi who serves on both committees, are \nextending the same kind of goodwill. I have told the leaders of both of \nthese committees I am going to do everything I can to bring to them the \nideas I have outlined today that have strong bipartisan support and \nhave been scored by the Congressional Budget Office as saving money and \npushing the cost curve downward. I have great confidence in the leaders \nof those two committees, because they are showing they want to spend \nthe time to bring the Senate together.\n  I see the distinguished Senator from Maine on the floor, and I know \nthat for a lot of us who have worked together on health care over a lot \nof years, this is a historic opportunity. This is the place--the \nSenate--and this is the time to get it done. I believe Democrats and \nRepublicans coming together can make it happen.\n  Mr. President, with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 15 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Family Smoking \nPrevention and Tobacco Control Act, but before I do I want to \ncompliment the Senator from Oregon for his passion and his eloquent \nstatement on behalf of renovating and reforming our health care system. \nThat certainly will be a historic occasion. I have worked with him on \nso many instances in the past, in a bipartisan fashion, on key issues, \nsuch as prescription drugs and adding the critical Part D benefit to \nthe Medicare Program. That also was a historic event in the Medicare \nProgram--the first major expansion of Medicare since its inception. I \nlook forward to working with him in a genuine bipartisan way to build a \nconsensus for this historic occasion that is so essential and so \nimportant to all Americans.\n  It is important to get it right. It is important that we work \ntogether in a concerted fashion, as we have in the past. And certainly \non the Senate Finance Committee, as we begin to proceed to mark up \nlegislation in the future, I certainly am looking forward to working \nwith him.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, would the Senator yield for a \nparliamentary request?\n  Madam President, at the conclusion of the remarks of the Senator from \nMaine, I ask unanimous consent to be recognized for 5 minutes, and then \nfollowing me that Senator Isakson be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator and the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6352-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6352-S6354]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           FAMILY SMOKING PREVENTION AND TOBACCO CONTROL ACT\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I am proud to join my colleagues in \nexpressing first and foremost my admiration for Senator Kennedy, for \nhis longstanding, vigorous leadership, which has been the impetus \nbehind this legislation. Undeniably, Senator Kennedy continues to serve \nas the strongest of champions on so many matters relating to health \ncare, and I am certainly,\n\n[[Page S6353]]\n\nas we all are, grateful for his tireless contributions to this major \ninitiative. I also commend Senator Dodd, who has been guiding this \nlegislation here in the Senate, and I certainly appreciate all of his \nefforts to make sure that this legislation becomes a reality. I also \nappreciate the public health agencies and advocates who work \nceaselessly to address these serious public health problems associated \nwith tobacco, as we all well know, and who are committed to the task of \nreducing youth smoking. I certainly want to commend States such as \nMaine that have used their funds from the 1998 tobacco settlement to \nreduce smoking rates.\n  First and foremost, it is regrettable as the first decade of the 21st \ncentury draws to a close that we are even having this debate when the \nAmerican Lung Association reports that cigarette smoke contains more \nthan 4,800 chemicals, 69 of which are known to cause cancer, and that \nsmoking is directly responsible for approximately 90 percent of lung \ncancer deaths, and that 8.6 million people in the United States have at \nleast one serious illness caused by smoking.\n  In addition, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates \nthat smoking costs the country $96 billion a year in health care costs \nand another $97 billion a year in lost productivity.\n  It didn't have to be this way. Looking back over the last several \nCongresses, I can tell you that many of my Senate colleagues have \nengaged on this issue of tobacco usage's ill effects for the better \npart of a decade. I well recall during the 105th Congress at least five \ncomprehensive tobacco policy bills which were introduced in the Senate. \nThe Senate Commerce Committee, on which I have served, held no fewer \nthan 10 hearings on issues ranging from how to implement the tobacco \nsettlement to protecting children from the health risks of becoming a \nsmoker to reviewing marketing and labeling restrictions that were under \nconsideration at the time.\n  In 1997, Senator McCain, who then chaired the Commerce Committee, \nintroduced the National Tobacco Policy and Youth Smoking Reduction Act, \nwhich contained many of the very same safeguards as the measure \ncurrently before us. While on the one hand it is irrefutable that \nprotecting youth from the harms of smoking and ensuring tobacco \nproducts are manufactured under high standards was the correct course \nof action in 1997, how is it conceivable it has taken 12 years to get \nthis right? Why, after the first warning 25 years ago by the Surgeon \nGeneral on the hazards of smoking, has that message not been translated \ninto law?\n  Why is Congress taking this action now? What has changed since 1997 \nto prompt this renewed action? For one, there has been a justifiable \ndrumbeat of outrage over fraudulent findings that has grown louder by \nthe decade as the tobacco industry has been less than forthcoming, and \nat times deceitful, in providing consumers with information to make \ninformed decisions about smoking.\n  In fact, in August of 2006, a district court judge found that several \ntobacco companies intentionally manipulated information, lied, and \nconspired ``to bring new, young and hopefully long-lived smokers into \nthe market in order to replace those who die or quit.'' Furthermore, \nthe Harvard School of Public Health study in 2008 found that cigarette \ncompanies strategically manipulated menthol levels in cigarettes to \nattract and addict young people. It is bad enough Congress could have \nacted and chose not to do so, but what makes the situation even worse \nis that, in the interim, tobacco companies have ratcheted up their \nmarketing campaigns.\n\n  Congress is tackling the tobacco issue again in the wake of \ndiscovering how tobacco manufacturers add substances to cigarettes to \nincrease their addictiveness, enhance the taste--and this is \nunbelievable--making them more palatable to children. Menthol makes an \nindividual's airways less reactive to the harsh effects of smoking, and \nammonia is often added to speed the delivery of nicotine to the \nsmoker's brain.\n  That is not to say we haven't made progress in trying to limit some \nof the negative health effects of cigarette smoking. We have. Since \n1983, the proportion of Americans who smoke has declined from 30 to 24 \npercent, and since the landmark 1964 Surgeon General report, our \nknowledge of health risks of tobacco has expanded greatly. And yet, \nwithout substantial initiatives by Congress, in the past 10 years the \nrate of tobacco use has not dropped but merely stabilized. Today, \napproximately 1 in 5 youth and adults smokes regularly.\n  The first step toward addressing the enormous toll taken on our \nNation by smoking is to equip the Federal Government with the tools it \nrequires to hold purveyors of tobacco to account. For too long, there \nhas been a vacuum in authority when it comes to regulating smoking at \nthe Federal level. Our bill, the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \nControl Act, would create the kind of restrictions that the Food and \nDrug Administration unsuccessfully tried to impose on the tobacco \nindustry in 2000. Unfortunately, the Supreme Court held that Congress \nhad not yet granted the FDA explicit authority to regulate tobacco. The \npurpose of the FDA restrictions was to prevent the tobacco industry \nfrom marketing its products to kids or to create products that are \nspecifically attractive to children, such as flavored cigarettes. \nGranting FDA the authority to protect the children from these \npotentially deadly products is paramount. Thus, the legislation before \nus would allow regulation of manufacturers of tobacco products in order \nto ensure standards of content, label, and marketing.\n  Under our bill, the Secretary of Health and Human Services would be \nauthorized to develop regulations that impose guidelines on the \nadvertising and promotion of a tobacco product consistent with and to \nthe full extent permitted by the first amendment to the Constitution. \nThese regulations would be based on whether they would be appropriate \nfor the protection of public health. It is imperative that we provide \nthe FDA the flexibility to respond to inevitable tobacco industry \nattempts to circumvent restrictions, while acknowledging the rights of \nthe tobacco industry to sell its products to consenting adults.\n  While this bill allows that informed adults ought to be able to \npurchase tobacco products, we must also understand that many smokers \nwant to quit smoking. In 2006, 44 percent of smokers stopped smoking at \nleast 1 day in the preceding year because they were trying to quit \nsmoking completely. Undoubtedly, for some, cessation is more difficult, \nand as they struggle to limit their risk, those individuals will seek \nout products which they understand to be less hazardous, such as lower \ntar and nicotine products. While these actions are admirable, their \nbenefits are indisputably limited. That is partially because the \ntobacco industry has waged a marketing campaign to convince consumers \nthat they can continue to smoke and mitigate the negative health \nimpacts of smoking by choosing alternatives, such as light, low tar, \nand low nicotine cigarettes. Again, an FDA with the authority to \nregulate the production and marketing of tobacco products is the most \nviable answer.\n  Our approach would also ensure that the scientific expertise of the \nFDA is applied to appropriately regulate tobacco. Current smokers \ndeserve to learn more about the products they consume. Additionally, we \nmust have much improved marketing oversight, so that children and \nadults are not targeted with false or deceptive advertising of a \ndangerous product.\n  To that end, I was pleased to join with Senator Lautenberg in \nsponsoring legislation that would end the fraud of allowing the tobacco \nindustry to perpetuate the Orwellian idea of the safer cigarette. The \nTruth in Cigarette Labeling Act was a bill Senator Lautenberg and I \nintroduced to prohibit the cigarette companies from using the ``FTC \nmethod'' for measuring tar and nicotine, which had been found to be a \ndeceptive method of presenting data on tar and nicotine exposure \nthrough smoking.\n  Thankfully, the Federal Trade Commission agreed to implement the \nLautenberg-Snowe bill by not allowing tobacco companies to label their \nproducts with low tar, low nicotine, and light. To augment that effort, \nSenator Lautenberg and I sent a letter to the FTC supporting the \ndecision to curtail these deceptive marketing tactics and finally \nholding cigarette producers to higher standards in advertising their \nproducts.\n\n[[Page S6354]]\n\n  As I stated at the outset, since 2000, efforts at smoking reduction \nhave largely atrophied. A Harris poll released just last year \ndemonstrated that after two decades of reduction in smoking rates, \nprogress has stalled. In 2009, do we really want to say that one in \nfour Americans smoking is an acceptable statistic, and that we will \nturn a blind eye to the fact that all too many young Americans have \ntaken up smoking? Do we really want to say that although in the last 12 \nyears America created YouTube, the IPod, the Iphone and more--yet we \ncan't keep children from smoking altogether or substantially lower the \ninstances of smoking by adults. Our response must be nothing less than \nthe bill we are championing today.\n  And make no mistake, time is of the essence. The reality is the \naverage smoker begins at age 19. So many individuals take up tobacco \nuse before they can ever legally purchase the product. And let there be \nno mistake about it--our youth are targeted to be the next generation \nof tobacco consumers.\n  In fact, in my home State of Maine, 1 in 7 high school students \ncurrently smokes, and each year, 1,600 youth become new daily smokers. \nAnd most concerning, an estimated 27,000 youth now living in Maine will \ndie prematurely from health consequences related to cigarette smoking, \nand health care costs in Maine directly caused by smoking have reached \na whopping $602 million annually.\n  Maine has responded with a comprehensive tobacco prevention and \ncontrol program known as the Partnership for a Tobacco-Free Maine which \nis funded with proceeds from the tobacco settlement. And I am proud to \nsay that Maine is among the States that have maximized their tobacco \nsettlement money for the purpose of reducing smoking rates and easing \nrelated health problems. That is why Maine has established Healthy \nMaine Partnerships, including 31 local partnerships that span the \nentire geography of Maine, which are engaging in more than 156 policy \nand environmental change efforts to reduce tobacco use, increase \nphysical activity, and encourage healthy eating at local schools, \nworksites, hospitals, recreation centers and other community sites.\n  While I commend the efforts of States such as Maine in attempting to \nstem the tide of youth smoking, what we have not yet dealt with is the \nknown practices of tobacco companies marketing directly to our \nchildren. The fact is, the industry has not only targeted children as \nits new customers, but it has designed products for them as well. Even \nas one prohibition is imposed--such as restricting the use of cartoon \ncharacters like ``Joe Camel''--we find that the tobacco industry \ndevises a new scheme. We witnessed the new flavored products in \npackaging which was designed to appeal to a new generation. Many \n``child-oriented'' flavors have been developed including such varieties \nas chocolate, vanilla, berry, lime and the package I am holding--\ncoconut-and-pineapple-flavored Kauai Koala.\n  Although State-level bills to ban flavored cigarettes have been \nintroduced in New York, Minnesota, West Virginia, Connecticut, \nIllinois, North Carolina, and Texas--a move in the right direction to \nbe sure--there is more we must do. It is time for Congress to act to \nprotect our youth--to safeguard our children and in the process send a \nclear message to those in the tobacco industry that we will not permit \nthem to recruit our children at increasingly younger ages to become \nlifelong cigarette smokers.\n  Our bill will achieve what we failed to accomplish 12 years ago, and \nwe can ill afford to allow this opportunity to pass. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting this timely and necessary \nlegislation to protect the health of all Americans, especially the \nmillions of children at risk of becoming cigarette smokers.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6354-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6354-S6355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING ERIK NECCIAI\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the outstanding \nservice Erik Necciai has provided to the Senate Committee on Small \nBusiness and Entrepreneurship in his capacity as a professional staff \nmember and counsel. When Erik joined the Committee staff just--over 2 \nyears ago--in June 2007 I knew that I had selected a top-notch staffer \nwho cared deeply about making a difference in peoples' lives, and I \nwill feel a deep loss with his departure from Capitol Hill later this \nweek.\n  Indicative of the dedicated person Erik is, he began his work on the \ncommittee the day after he arrived home from his honeymoon in romantic \nItaly with his new bride, Tina. During his first weeks here, Erik was \nfocused on preparing for a committee roundtable regarding legislative \nsuggestions to improve the Small Business Innovation Research, SBIR, \nprogram. He was simultaneously studying for the Maryland bar exam--no \nsmall feat! As if that was not enough, Erik faced a daily commute of \nroughly 2 hours each way, coming from his home in Solomon's Island, MD. \nAfter a whirlwind first month, Erik settled in quickly, remaining a \nproactive staff member who consistently sought new and critical avenues \nto increase contracting opportunities to small businesses and reform \nthe Small Business Administration's HUBZone program.\n  Over his 2 years on the Hill, Erik has helped me develop thoughtful \nand probing legislation regarding small business contracting and \nprocurement. Committee Chair Mary Landrieu and I will soon be \nintroducing crucial legislation to reauthorize and make significant \nimprovements to the SBIR and Small Business Technology Transfer, STTR, \nprograms, and Erik was instrumental in helping us craft this bill. \nAdditionally, Erik always prepared comprehensive and insightful \nbackground materials for me that included meticulously researched \nstatistics for committee hearings and roundtables. He has also been \npersonally responsive to small businesses seeking help navigating the \nconfusing and difficult maze known as Federal contracting. And Erik has \nbeen an aggressive watchdog, exhorting government agencies to not just \nmeet but exceed their small business contracting goals.\n  Prior to joining the committee staff, Erik had already assembled an \nimpressive and varied resume. A contracting specialist and procurement \ntechnician and Navy acquisitions consultant for the Department of the \nNavy, Erik came to the Senate armed with the necessary experience and \nknowledge to hit the ground running in procurement. A 2006 dean's list \ngraduate of the Thomas M. Cooley Law School in Michigan, Erik has also \ninterned for the circuit court of his home county in Frederick, MD, in \naddition to serving as a law clerk for the District Court of Ingham \nCounty, MI. These experiences all led to the in-depth and extensive \nknowledge Erik possess about contract law.\n  He graduated from Virginia Tech in 2002 with a major in biology and \nchemistry. This led to his work in 2003 as a research scientist for the \nNational Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health. Prior \nto taking that position, Erik went overseas to South Africa to take \npart in student research. He organized and presented several lectures \non government and conservation issues, including voting rights and the \nAIDS epidemic.\n  Erik has also given generously of his time in the service of others. \nHe has been a dental assistant at the Virginia Homeless Dental Clinic, \nand received the Volunteer of the Year Award for his stellar work as a \nhospital operating room assistant. A division I varsity scholarship \nathlete in track and field--who was named a 2002 Virginia Tech Athlete \nof the Year--Erik has also combined his athletic prowess and engaging \nspeaking skills to participate as a motivational speaker for Special \nOlympics athletes.\n  Erik's perpetual smile and charming demeanor make him eminently \nlikeable and easily approachable. His responsible nature and insightful \nanalytical skills make him a key member of any group, and a talented \nHill staffer. The consummate team player, Erik never seeks credit or \nrecognition for himself, but always looks for ways that government can \nempower people to improve their lot.\n  A proud native of Maryland, Erik Necciai has already led an exciting \nlife. But on Thursday, Erik leaves the Senate to begin a new chapter as \nthe director of an international consulting firm headquartered locally \nin Northern Virginia. I only hope that he can find a way to reduce his \ncommute time. That\n\n[[Page S6355]]\n\nsaid, Erik's determination, sincerity, thoughtfulness, and character \nwill be sorely missed in the halls of the Russell Building. I wish Erik \nand his beautiful wife Tina the best in all of their endeavors, and \nsincerely thank Erik for his remarkable commitment to public service.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I rise to recognize and honor the \nsignificant accomplishments of Special Olympics Rhode Island executive \ndirector Mike McGovern. Mike is retiring this month after 21 years of \nworking to expand opportunities for Rhode Islanders with disabilities. \nHe has been a lifelong friend, since grammar school and high school. He \nis someone I respect and admire immensely, and this respect and \nadmiration is shared by the entire community of Rhode Island.\n  He has demonstrated a lifelong commitment to upholding the mission \nand values of the Special Olympics. Mike's special dedication and \nenthusiasm have ensured that the Special Olympics Rhode Island remains \none of the most impressive organizations in our State, providing year-\nround sports training and competitions to approximately 2,700 young and \nadult athletes across the State.\n  Mike began his involvement with Special Olympics Rhode Island as a \nvolunteer for 18 years, every year pitching in, helping out. That is \nthe way he is--a generous heart, a great sense of community and \nneighborliness. He then served as assistant executive director for \nSpecial Olympics Rhode Island from 1988 to 1998, when he took over the \nrole of executive director.\n  Under his leadership, Special Olympics Rhode Island expanded the \nnumber of sports offered to 20. His athlete-centered approach helped \nthe program experience a 40-percent increase in competitors.\n  Mike has also worked hard to ensure that the funding goals of Special \nOlympics Rhode Island were achieved. During his time with Special \nOlympics Rhode Island, the organization built a budget surplus of over \n$1 million. He also helped launch a capital campaign to establish a \npermanent home for Special Olympics Rhode Island. His innovative \nspirit, which characterized his entire tenure, was evident in many \ndifferent ways--particularly 33 years ago, when he and several friends \ncofounded the Penguin Plunge, which is an annual New Year's Day ritual \nin Jamestown, RI, where hardy souls, hundreds of them, brave the frigid \nwaters of Narragansett Bay to raise money for Special Olympics Rhode \nIsland and raise a feeling of camaraderie, fellowship, and good spirits \nto begin the year.\n  Last month, Mike attended his final games as executive director. Held \nat the University of Rhode Island in Kingston, Special Olympics Rhode \nIsland dedicated its 2009 State summer games to Mike McGovern for his \noutstanding, long-time commitment to the Special Olympics. Speaking at \nthe games, he spoke of being inspired by the courage of the athletes \nthrough their ability to defy stereotypes, to compete, to strive--all \nof them--to win. We, too, are inspired by his commitment to a very \nnoble cause.\n  Through his presence at the organization, he imbued it with a special \nspirit. That spirit will be missed. But he will continue to serve \nbecause that is his nature.\n  Thank you, Mike, for your exemplary service. You have been a strong \nadvocate for thousands of Special Olympics athletes, both on and off \nthe playing field. Your dedicated leadership and hard work have helped \nthousands of Rhode Islanders with disabilities achieve their goals.\n  Also, you have been a great success in something as important--as a \nhusband, as a father, as a friend. I wish you and your lovely family, \nyour wife and your children, the best in your well-deserved retirement.\n  Let me conclude by saying Rhode Island's special athletes have never \nhad a more special friend than Mike McGovern.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to address the \nChamber as in morning business for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, it is a distinct honor and privilege \nfor me to stand on the floor of the Senate to pay tribute to a \ngentleman I went to college with, a gentleman who has reported on \npolitics and government in Georgia for the better part of the last 35 \nyears, a gentleman who recently announced his retirement at the end of \nthis month from the associate editorial page responsibilities at the \nAtlanta Journal and Constitution.\n  Mr. Jim Wooten, born and raised in McRae, GA, veteran of Vietnam, 20 \nyears in the Georgia Air National Guard, former President of the \nGeorgia Press Association, lifetime trustee of the Georgia Press \nAssociation's educational fund, has made a tremendous contribution to \nour State and to the public lives of all our people. I rise to pay \ntribute to him.\n  One of the greatest tributes of all that I can share is what happened \non Monday, at lunch this week. I had a luncheon with the Board of Cox \nEnterprises. The Cox newspapers own the Atlanta Constitution, as they \ndo the Palm Beach Post and the Dayton paper. They own many other \nbusinesses. It is a huge privately held company.\n  At that luncheon, unsolicited by me, the name of Jim Wooten came up \nand, one by one, the leaders of Cox Enterprises talked about the \ntremendous contributions that Jim Wooten has made to their newspaper.\n  As one who was first elected in 1976 and has been written about many \ntimes by Jim Wooten, I wanted to add my tribute to his journalistic \ntalent and the contribution he has made. I am not sure I know of any \nother writer I have read who has reported on what is going on in \npolitics in our State, who has gotten it right more often--in fact \nalways--than Jim Wooten.\n  Conservative? Yes, he is conservative. But he is pragmatic. When he \nwrites his opinions on the editorial page of the Atlanta Constitution, \nit makes a difference in the minds and attitudes of Georgia's people.\n  I say job well done to Jim Wooten. I hope his retirement is \nsuccessful and rewarding in every way he wishes it to be, and I thank \nhim very much for all the contributions he has made to the lives of all \nGeorgians and, in one case, to this Georgian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6355-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6355-S6356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                HOUSING\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I would like to talk for a minute, if I can, Madam \nPresident, about a very important issue. I don't come to the floor all \nthat often, but people will tell you I come to the floor too often to \ntalk about the housing industry. I am going to do it for a little bit \ntonight because it is critically important to our economy and to our \ncountry.\n  A year and a half ago, I introduced a piece of legislation, in \nJanuary of 2008, creating a housing tax credit of $15,000 for any \nfamily who would buy and occupy their home as a principal residence in \nthe United States. I did so because housing had collapsed, foreclosures \nwere beginning to become rampant and are rampant today. Standing \ninventory proliferated, builders were going out of business, and our \neconomy was in a downward slide.\n  The CBO score on that $15,000 tax credit is $34.2 billion, and I was \ntold last January that was too expensive, we couldn't afford to do it. \nBy my last count--Senator Coburn is a better counter than I am--we \nspent about $5.5 trillion trying to fix an economy that has been in a \ncontinual downward slide.\n  Fortunately, in July of last year, with the help of Members on both \nsides, we did get a tax credit passed, but it was basically an \ninterest-free loan for $7,500, it was means tested to families who were \nfirst-time home buyers or had incomes under $150,000. It did no good.\n  Later in the year, I finally convinced this body, and we took off the \nlimitation in terms of the payback and made it a real tax credit and \nraised it from $7,500 to $8,000 and it has made a difference. First-\ntime home buyers used it and the market stabilized, but we don't\n\n[[Page S6356]]\n\nhave a recession in first-time home buyers. We have a recession in the \nmove-up market.\n  The man who is transferred from Missouri or Georgia who can't sell \nhis house in Missouri, can't come to Georgia, can't take the transfer. \nThe corporation can't afford to buy the house and hold it for him \nbecause of the proliferation of inventory that is owned and today in \nthe United States of America one in two sales made every day is a short \nsale or a foreclosure. That is an unhealthy market, and it is \ncontinuing to precipitate a downward spiral in values, loss of equity \nby the American people, and a protracted, difficult economic time for \nour country.\n  Tomorrow, joined by a number of Members of this Senate on both sides, \nI will reintroduce the $15,000 tax credit that is available to any \nfamily or individual who buys or occupies any home in the United States \nof America as their principal residence with no means test for first-\ntime home buyers, no means test or income limitations. Tomorrow it also \nwill be announced in New York the Business Roundtable has adopted this \ntax credit as its No. 1 suggestion to the U.S. Government as the one \nthing we can do to turn around the American economy.\n  I am getting to be a pretty old guy. I went through the second \nrecession of my career in 1974. Gerald Ford was President, it was a \nDemocratic Congress. America had a 3-year standing inventory of new \nhouses built and unsold. The economy went into a tailspin. Values \nstarted to go down. We were in deep trouble.\n  That Republican President and that Democratic Congress came together \nand passed a $2,000 tax credit for any family who bought and occupied \nas its principal residence a new house that was standing and vacant. In \n1 year's time, a 3-year inventory was reduced to 1 year; values \nstabilized, the economy came back, home sales became healthy, and \nAmerica recovered. That is precisely what will happen this time.\n  I am not so smart that I figured it out, I am lucky enough that I \nlived through it in 1974, and 30 years later we need to do the right \nthing for America and the right thing for our economy and put in a \ntime-sensitive, 1-year significant tax credit for anyone who buys and \noccupies as their residence a single-family home.\n  An independent group estimated, when I introduced this last year, \nthat it would create 700,000 house sales and 684,000 jobs this year. I \nthink it is ironic that house sales today are at half a million. A \nnormal to good year in the United States is 1.2 to 1.5 million sales.\n  If you could get the tax credit and the 700,000 sales that have been \nestimated it will introduce and add it to the 500,000 sales we have \ntoday, it will return our housing market to normalcy. It will stabilize \nthe values of the largest investment of the people of the United States \nof America. It will recreate equity lines of credit that have \ndissipated and disappeared in the American family. And over time it \nwill restore our vibrant economy back to the economy we all hope and \npray will come.\n  So I ask all of the Members of the Senate to reconsider their \npositions in the past and consider joining me in the introduction of \nthis legislation tomorrow. We have three Democrats and three \nRepublicans who have come on board. I would like to see all 100 of us \nbecause in the end all of our problems will be more easily solved if \nthe problems of the American taxpayers and citizens are solved, and \ntheir biggest problems today are an illiquid housing market, a decline \nin their equity, a decline in their net worth, and a depression in the \nhousing market that we are obligated to correct if we possibly can.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I wish to take a few minutes this evening to kind of \ndiscuss with the American people what is going to happen on health \ncare--what it looks like is going to happen.\n  As a practicing physician, there are things I know that if we start \nfrom ground zero we would do in health care in this country. But as I \nwas reading some articles, I pulled this quote. This is by Adrian \nRogers, and it really belies what is happening right now with this idea \nof transferring the wealth. Here is what he said:\n\n       You cannot legislate the poor into freedom by legislating \n     the wealthy out of freedom. What one person receives without \n     working for, another person must work for without receiving.\n       The government cannot give to anybody anything that the \n     government does not take first from someone else. When half \n     of the people get the idea that they do not have to work \n     because the other half is going to take care of them, and \n     when the other half gets the idea that it does no good to \n     work because somebody else is going to get what they worked \n     for, that, my dear friend, is about the end of any Nation. \n     You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it.\n\n  Those are pretty wise words.\n  As I think about the trillions of dollars that have gone through \nCongress this year and the fact that our spending is totally out of \ncontrol, with minimal effect other than things like the Senator from \nGeorgia--had we actually spent the $35 billion on a tax credit to \nstimulate housing rather than spending about $100 billion on true, true \nstimulus activities and another $680-some billion on other items, and \nthe fact that all of a sudden we are now talking about pay-go--that is \nabout me paying and you going--and we have spent $800 billion in the \nlast year and avoided pay-go 15 times in the Senate in the last year. \nFifteen times we have said: Oh, time out, pay-go does not count. And we \nspent another $800 billion. What that means is we did not have the \nmoney, we borrowed it.\n  So as we start into the health care debate, there are some things I \nbelieve are critically important that I think most Americans would \nagree with.\n  The first is that individuals ought to be in charge of their health \ncare. Nothing should stand between you as a patient and your physician. \nNo bureaucrat, no government-run program should get in between that \nrelationship.\n  The second thing I know is you ought to be able to pick what you \nwant, you ought to be able to afford what you want, and you ought to be \nable to do that at the time that is appropriate for your health care \nneeds. That means you have to be in charge of your health care, you \ncannot have someone else. I am reminded of that fact because we have a \nMedicaid Program in which 40 percent of physicians in this country do \nnot participate, and what we are really saying to people on Medicare \nis: We will give you health care, but we will limit a large number of \nphysicians and providers because we are not willing to pay what it \nactually costs to do that.\n  The third thing is that we cannot assume, which we have, and I am \nworried we will, that people cannot manage their own health care, that \nthey have to have Uncle Sam manage it for them. Nothing could be \nfurther from the truth.\n  There are some key components. Health care is about people. It is not \nabout an insurance company, it is not about your employer, and it is \ncertainly not about the government. It is about you. And if it is about \nyou, you ought to be in control of that--absolutely, without a fact be \nin control. You ought to have a caring professional who will be able to \nspend the time with you to truly teach you prevention, to truly work \nwith you on wellness, to truly manage your chronic disease, and then we \nought to recognize that those services ought to be paid for, not \noutlandish fees but appropriate payment.\n  You recognize that in none of the government-run programs, which is \nnow 60 percent of health care, do we truly pay for prevention. We will \npay for it when you get sick. That is why we have ``sick care'' in \nAmerica. We do not have health care, we have sick care. And we do not \nhave real insurance. What we have is prepaid health expense, which \nabout 20 percent, 25 percent of the money that went into that health \ninsurance doesn't ever come back to help you get well or prevent you \nfrom getting sick.\n  So we ought to be about the fact that we know there is something \nwrong with health care in America today. We all know that. We are \ndissatisfied, whether it is the bills you get after you get a test that \nyou can't read or can't understand or you have to wait or have an \napproval to get something. Regardless of what your doctor thinks, you \nstill may not be able to access that care. There is no question we need \nto\n\n[[Page S6357]]\n\nfix health care, and I will be the first to admit we need to do that. \nBut how we do it--how we do it is ultimately important, not just for \nthe health care of Americans, but it will markedly impact our economy.\n  The very idea that we have to have another $1.3 trillion to $2 \ntrillion to fix health care does not fit with any realistic set of \nfacts anywhere else in the world. We spend twice as much per person in \nthis country as anybody else in the world save Switzerland. We are not \ngetting value for what we are buying.\n  Now, why aren't we? One of the reasons we are not is because you are \nnot in control of your health care. You do not get to see a transparent \nprice or quality or availability for what you purchased because we have \ngiven over the payment for that to some other organization. So we are \nless inclined to be prudent purchasers because it is not coming out of \nour pocket, whether it is Medicaid or Medicare or a health insurance \nplan. We ought to be about fixing that. And our health care cannot be \nabout bureaucrats in Washington. It is personal. It is also local.\n  The trust in a patient-doctor relationship is enhanced by \ntransparency of the cost and transparency of the quality. You ought to \nbe able to go and buy a health care service and know what it is going \nto cost before you buy it, and you ought to know that you are likely to \nget great outcomes based on transparency of quality. That has to be \nthere.\n  The second thing that has to be there is you have to know we are \ngoing to spend the dollars in a way to prevent you from getting sick, \nnot just take care of you once you get sick. Grandmom was right: An \nounce of prevention is worth more than a pound of cure. Yet we do not \nincentivize that in any of the Federal Government programs we have \ntoday. And we do some--especially in the ERISA-based plans or the \ncompany-owned plans, they have learned this.\n  A great plan that is out there that people are fortunate to have is \nSafeway. Safeway's health care costs have risen one-half of 1 percent \nin the last 4 years. The average of other plans of other employers has \nrisen 42 percent. What is the difference? Why is it that Safeway, with \n200,000 employees, has been able to have only half a percent, plus they \nalso have increased satisfaction with the health care they are getting? \nWhat is the difference? The difference is prevention and wellness and \nmanagement of chronic disease.\n  So anything we do that does not address prevention and incentivize \nit, wellness and incentivize it, and management of chronic disease and \nincentivize it will not make any fix we do here sustainable. We can \ncover everybody in the country. We can charge $1.2 trillion or $1.3 \ntrillion to our kids over the next 10 years and we can get everybody \ncovered, but if we have not fixed the sustainability to where we do not \nhave a 7.2-percent automatic inflation in health care every year, we \nwill not have done anything. And it will not be long before we will not \nbe able to afford it, and then we will take the people in the \ngovernment-run option and we will put them into Medicare, and then we \nwill do a price control.\n  There is no question that we need to carefully address America's \nhealth care challenge. We need to find immediate measurable ways to \nmake it more accessible and affordable without jeopardizing quality. We \nneed to make sure we give individuals choice at every point in the \nhealth care continuum. And we need to make sure we allow personalized \ncare. We are not a bunch of cattle lining up in the chute. Everybody is \ndifferent. Everybody needs to be able to make their own decisions.\n  On top of that, the No. 1 thing we have to do is protect the doctor-\npatient relationship. Half of getting well is having confidence in the \nperson who is treating you. When you do not get to choose that, as you \ndo not in Medicaid and oftentimes in Medicare because we are limited to \nthe doctors who are taking Medicare, you are limiting the outcome.\n  If you cannot get treatment when you need it, there is a crisis. If \nyou are denied the ability to choose the doctor or hospital that is \nbest for you, that is a crisis for you. If you cannot afford the \ncoverage you need for you and your family, then you have a crisis.\n  We need to stop looking at it from a global perspective and restore \nthe humanity to health care. We need to focus more on people and less \non the system.\n  I have a lot of ideas on health care. I, along with many others, have \nintroduced the Patient's Choice Act, where we allow everybody to have \ninsurance in this country. We equalize the tax treatment for everybody \nin this country.\n  All the studies say that any plan Congress puts forward, our plan \nwill do as well or better with some major differences. We do not raise \nthe cost at all. It does not cost anything. As a matter of fact, it \nsaves the States $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years just on Medicaid \nalone. And every Medicaid patient out there will have a private \ninsurance program, and nobody will ever know if they got it through \nMedicaid or not. They will be truly accessing and having the care, and \nwe will not raise taxes on anybody to do that--no one.\n  The other thing we do is, if you like what you have today, you can \nkeep it. You absolutely can keep it. If what you have is what you want, \nit gives you care when you want it, access to the doctors you want or \nto the hospital you want, and you can afford it, you are going to keep \nit. But if you would like something different, and not be locked in, \nnot having to stay at a job because you are afraid you will not have \ninsurance when you leave, you need to look at what we are talking \nabout.\n\n  There is no preexisting illness exclusion. There is no individual \nmandate, although there is an auto enrollment where you can opt out. If \nyou do not want health insurance, you do not have to take it, but you \ndo not get the tax credit that goes along with buying it.\n  So, in fact, of the 46 million people who do not have access to care \ntoday through an insurance program, they will have it under this \nprogram, and they will have prevention, and they will have wellness, \nand they will have a medical home or an accountable care organization \nto manage their chronic disease, help them manage it. And they will get \nto do that where they want to do it, not where some bureaucrat tells \nthem they will do it or where some insurance company tells them where \nthey will do it.\n  We have a chance to hit a home run for the American people on health \ncare--not just on their health care, but keeping us globally \ncompetitive, keeping jobs here at home instead of shipping them off \nwhere the labor costs and health care costs are less. We have a chance \nto hit two home runs. The question is, Will we do it?\n  We have before us in the HELP Committee a draft of a bill that has \nthree big blanks on it. We do not have any analysis by the CBO on what \nit is going to cost. We have no knowledge about what it costs, and we \nare going to be marking that up in a week. We are supposed to get \nhealth care done in 6 weeks in this country, which is 17 percent of our \nGDP, one-sixth of our economy, and we are going to do it without \nknowing what we are doing.\n  The parameters under which this Senate is addressing health care are \na prescription for disaster. What we should do is put out the bills, \nhave a legitimate debate about what is a proper way to go, and let the \nAmerican people hear the debate and see which way to go. I will tell \nyou, if you allow the American people to decide: Here is a government-\ncontrolled option or here is my option, with me choosing everything, me \nnot depending on the government, me making the choices for my family--\nwhen I want it, where I want it, and how I want it--individual freedom \nand liberty will win every time over a government-mandated program or \na, quote, public government-run insurance company.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair reminds the Senator that his time \nunder morning business has expired.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask for 10 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I do not object. It will be the last extension?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  One of the questions we ought to ask the American people is: Would \nyou rather pay the costs you pay today for the quality of care you \ncurrently receive or would you rather get in line, pay less, not have \nthe same quality,\n\n[[Page S6358]]\n\nand not get to choose the health care you are going to get or your \nfamily is going to get--defer the decisionmaking about you and your \nfamily's health care to a government bureaucracy?\n  All of us agree, Democrats and Republicans, we want to fix health \ncare. All of us want prevention, wellness, management of chronic \ndisease. All of us want as much freedom as we can give the American \npeople. But the difference lies in how we do it and who pays the bill. \nThat is why I started out with the article from Adrian Rogers. We are \ngoing to spend $2.4 trillion on health care this year, and we are going \nto get back $1.7 trillion worth of health care.\n  We should not be spending a penny more. What we should be saying to \nthe Senate is: Why aren't you fixing what is wrong with this terrible, \nbroken system? And the answer is: We need more money. That is the \ngovernment's answer every time. Every time: We need more money. We need \na new program.\n  We do not need a new program. What we need is to allow the individual \nentrepreneurship and ingenuity of the American people and give them the \nresources with which to buy their health care and make their personal \nchoices, and what you will see is a dynamic that squeezes $500 billion \nto $700 billion out of the cost of health care in this country.\n  There are a lot of components. Health care is a complex issue. \nEverybody who worked on it knows it. It is hard in a 20- or 30-minute \ntalk on the floor to explain a bill fully. But if you had absolute \naccess, and you could afford health care, and you got to make the \nchoices, and it did not cost your kids any more in the future to pay \nfor that by borrowing against their future, most Americans would say: I \nwill buy something like that. That is a fix.\n  And by the way, we are going to incentivize the $40 billion we spend \nevery year supposedly on prevention to where it is actually making some \ndifference on cost. We are going to quit paying for food that is \nterrible for you through the Food Stamp Program. We are going to fix \nthe School Lunch Program so we do not feed you high carbohydrates and \nfat. And we are going to give you protein, fruits, and vegetables. We \nare going to do that which is necessary to put us on a glidepath to \nwhere we have real health care instead of sick care in this country. \nPeople will buy that.\n  I cannot wait for the real debate to start on health care. When you \nhear the talk, and you read the articles that have been written--just \nfor example, on comparative effectiveness, the director who is involved \nin that in England said it was the biggest mistake they ever made. It \nexplains why people in England die earlier. It explains why they have a \ncancer cure rate about a third lower than ours. It explains why people \ncannot get care because they have a government option. They have a \ngovernment option that eliminates the ability for true choice, true \naccess, and true affordability.\n  One of the things our bill will do is make sure, no matter how sick \nyou are, you get an insurance policy. When it comes time for renewal, \nthey cannot deny you. Our bill gives everybody insurance in this \ncountry and incentivizes you to the point where you will have extra \nmoney with which you pay for the additional costs associated with that \ncare.\n  Our plan does not mandate anything, except the base minimum plan is \nthe base minimum plan the Members of Congress get. If you want to buy \nmore than that, you can. But nobody is going to tell you what you have \nto buy. You buy what is right for you, what is right for your family.\n  One of the costs of health care in this country--and it is about 8 or \n9 percent of the cost of health care--is doctors like me ordering tests \nyou do not need because I fear a malpractice lawsuit. We incentivize \nthe States to make changes--very simple changes--do not eliminate the \nright of any individual to go to court, but set up health courts or set \nup judge-doctor-lawyer panels or a combination thereof, and we give \nthem extra money if, in fact, they will do that. It is an easy, cheap \nbuy. Because if we reform the tort system State by State, we get back \nabout a hundredfold for every dollar we put out that comes out of \nhealth care that will then go to prevention, wellness, and management \nof chronic disease.\n  We have cost-shifting in this country. If you opt out and you go to \nan ER, your State can buy you a high-deductible policy, whereas you are \nstill covered. You are not going to ever lose your home because you had \nan accident or you had a major health complication because you will be \nauto enrolled as soon as you hit the ER. So we eliminate about $200 \nbillion in cost-shifting.\n  I have just outlined $500 billion that can go away under our bill out \nof $2.4 trillion--money that does not help anybody get well, money that \ndoes not prevent anybody from getting sick.\n  I had an orthopedist in my office today and he had a patient who he \nthought had a torn anterior cruciate ligament. That is a ligament \nconnecting the femur to the tibia. And she could not relax. He is a \ngood orthopedist. By clinical exam, you can tell if somebody has torn \nan ACL, anterior cruciate ligament. So he said: Well, you can't relax. \nWe'll do an MRI. So she comes back a week later and says: Doctor, I \ndidn't do the MRI. I didn't want to pay for that. And she brought a \nglass of wine with her, a glass of chardonnay. She said: I think if I \ndrink this, about 15 minutes after I drink this, I think I will be \nrelaxed enough for you to do it. Well, sure enough, she did, and she \nrelaxed. She had a torn ACL, and she never had to have an MRI. It just \nsaved us about $1,800. It saved her and us $1,800. He could have given \nher xanax and done the same thing.\n\n  But the point is, she made a logical decision not to spend $1,800 \nbecause there was another way of doing it. Part of that was because she \nhad a $5,000 deductible health care policy, so she made a good economic \nchoice. Multiply that 100,000 times in this country every month and see \nhow much money we can take out of the health care system by people \nacting in their own best health interest and financial interest.\n  We have a lot in front of us, and we have a lot that is riding on us. \nI hope we get to see the bills, which we have not seen yet, and what \npeople want to do. The first bill out is: The government does \neverything; the government is in control. There is not one government \nprogram that either offers the services or is not bankrupt that we have \non health care today. Medicare is bankrupt. Medicaid--we are bankrupt, \nso they are bankrupt. They have $80 billion worth of fraud in Medicare; \n$40 billion worth in Medicaid. The Indian Health Service is a sham, \nespecially on the reservation, because we do not have the quality and \nwe have not put the money there. Why shouldn't a Native American have \nan insurance policy to be able to buy health care wherever they want? \nWhy shouldn't a veteran be able to get care wherever they want rather \nthan have to travel 200 miles to a VA health care center? Why can't we \nkeep the commitment that we would say: If we are going to offer you \naccess, then we are going to offer you access to the best, the highest \nquality health care, with you making the decisions about your care, \nwhen you get that care, and who gives you that care.\n  The patient has to come first. Senators' egos have to come second. \nAnd we have to fix this program in a way that not only solves the \nhealth care crisis but does not create another crisis for our children \ndown the road.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for his patience, and I wish \nhim a good night.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from Rhode \nIsland.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, it is always a pleasure to hear the \nSenator from Oklahoma discussing health care, which I know is very dear \nto him. So I did not feel my time was wasted listening to him speak on \nthat subject, and I wish him a good evening as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, if I may, to speak in morning \nbusiness, but to exceed the 10-minute rule.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6358-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6358-S6359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GASPEE DAY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, the Boston Tea Party is one of the \ncelebrated events in American history. From a young age, Americans \nlearn the story of the men who crept onto British ships moored in \nBoston harbor on December 16, 1773, to toss overboard\n\n[[Page S6359]]\n\nshipments of tea that the English sought to tax. These Massachusetts \npatriots yearned for liberty, opposed ``taxation without \nrepresentation,'' and stepped into history books with this simple act \nof defiance.\n  But conspicuously absent from too many of those same history books is \na group of Rhode Island men who took on the British Crown in a bold, \ninsubordinate gesture matching the temper of their bold and \ninsubordinate colony more than a year earlier than the Boston Tea \nParty. This evening, I would like to share the story of the H.M.S. \nGaspee, a daring group of Rhode Islanders, and the real beginning of \nthe fight for American independence.\n  In the early 1770s, as tensions between England and her American \ncolonies grew increasingly strained, King George III stationed the \nH.M.S. Gaspee, under the command of Lieutenant William Dudingston, in \nthe waters of Rhode Island. Its mission was to search incoming ships \nfor smuggled goods and contraband and to enforce the payment of taxes.\n  On June 9, 1772, 237 years ago tonight, the sailing vessel Hannah was \ntraveling from Newport to Providence, when it was intercepted by the \nGaspee and ordered to stop to allow a search. On board the Hannah, CAPT \nBenjamin Lindsey refused and continued on his course, despite warning \nshots fired by the Gaspee. Under full sail and into a falling tide, the \nHannah pressed north up Narragansett Bay with the Gaspee in hot \npursuit. Overmatched in size, Captain Lindsey found advantage in guile \nand in his greater knowledge of Rhode Island waters. He led the Gaspee \nto the shallow water of Pawtuxet Cove. There, the lighter Hannah sped \nover the shallows, but the heavier Gaspee ran aground in the shallow \nwaters off Namquid Point. The Gaspee was stuck, until the higher tides \nof the following day would lift her from the mud.\n  Captain Lindsey proceeded on his course to Providence, where he met \nwith a group of Rhode Islanders, including John Brown, a community \nleader whose family helped found Brown University. The two men arranged \nfor a meeting of local patriots at Sabin's Tavern, on what is now \nProvidence's east side, later that evening. At the meeting, the \nassembled Rhode Islanders decided to act. The HMS Gaspee was a symbol \nof their oppression and she was helplessly stranded in Pawtuxet Cove. \nThe opportunity was too good to pass up.\n  That night, there was no moonlight on the waters of Pawtuxet Cove. \nThe Gaspee lay silent on the sandbar. Down the bay from Providence came \n60 men in longboats, led by John Brown and Abraham Whipple, armed and \nheaded through those dark waters for the Gaspee.\n  When the men reached the Gaspee and surrounded it, Brown called out \nand demanded that Lieutenant Dudingston surrender his vessel. \nDudingston refused and instead ordered his men to fire upon anyone who \nattempted to board the Gaspee.\n  That was all these Rhode Islanders needed to hear, and they rushed \nthe Gaspee and forced their way aboard her. In the violent melee, \nLieutenant Dudingston was shot in the arm by a musket ball. Rhode \nIslanders had drawn the first blood of the conflict that would lead to \nAmerican independence, right there in Pawtuxet Cove, 16 months before \nthe ``Tea Party'' in Boston.\n  Brown and Whipple's men seized control of the Gaspee from its British \ncrew and transported the captive Englishman safely to shore. They then \nreturned to the abandoned Gaspee to set her afire and watched as the \npowder magazine exploded, blowing the ship apart and leaving her \nremains to burn to the water line. That historic location is now called \nGaspee Point.\n  Since that night in June, 237 years ago tonight when the Gaspee \nburned, Rhode Islanders have marked the event with celebration. This \nyear, as I do every year, I will march in the annual Gaspee Days Parade \nin Warwick, RI. Every year, I think about what it must have been like \nto be among those 60 men: muffled oars on dark waters; comrades pulling \nwith voices hushed; a shouted demand, the indignant response, and then \na pell-mell rush to clamber aboard; the oaths and shouts of struggle, \ngun shots and powder smoke, the clash of sword and cutlass; and when it \nwas over, the bright fire of the ship in the night, the explosion \nturning night to day and reverberating across the bay and the hiss and \nsplash as the pieces fell and the water claimed the flames.\n  I hope that one day the tale of the brave Rhode Islanders who stormed \nthe HMS Gaspee will be remembered among the other stories of the \nRevolution and that they will be given their due place in our Nation's \nhistory beside the tea partiers of Boston.\n  I hope, frankly, on an annual basis, to come back to this floor and \nrelate that story over and over and over again. It is a proud part of \nRhode Island's heritage.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6359-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6359-S6361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                TORTURE\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to now change the subject and \nspeak about an incident that is not part of anybody's proud heritage \nand that is the evidence we have recently heard about America's descent \ninto torture. I know it is an awkward subject to talk about, an awkward \nsubject to think about. On the one hand, we, as Americans, love our \ncountry, we hate the violence that has been done to us, and we want \nmore than anything to protect our people from attacks. On the other \nhand, torture is wrong and we have known it and behaved accordingly in \nfar worse circumstances than now.\n  When Washington's troops hid in the snows of Valley Forge from a \nsuperior British force bent on their destruction, we did not torture. \nWhen our capital city was occupied and our Capitol burned by troops of \nthe world's greatest naval power, we did not torture. When Nazi powers \nthreatened our freedom in one hemisphere and Japanese aircraft \ndestroyed much of our Pacific fleet in the other, we did not torture. \nIndeed, even when Americans took arms against Americans in our bloody \nCivil War, we did not torture.\n  I know this is not easy. Our instincts to protect our country are set \nagainst our historic principles and our knowledge of right versus \nwrong. It is all made more difficult by how much that is untrue, how \nmuch that is misleading, and how much that is irrelevant have crowded \ninto this discussion. It is hard enough to address this issue without \nbeing ensnared in a welter of deception.\n  To try to clarify it, I wish to say a few things. The first is that I \nsee three issues we need to grapple with. The first is the torture \nitself: What did Americans do? In what conditions of humanity and \nhygiene were the techniques applied? With what intensity and duration? \nAre our preconceptions about what was done based on the sanitized \ndescriptions of techniques justified? Or was the actuality far worse? \nWere the carefully described predicates for the torture techniques and \nthe limitations on their use followed in practice? Or did the torture \nexceed the predicates and bounds of the Office of Legal Counsel \nopinions?\n  We do know this. We do know that Director Panetta of the CIA recently \nfiled an affidavit in a U.S. Federal court saying this:\n\n       These descriptions--\n\n  He is referring to descriptions of EITs--enhanced interrogation \ntechniques--the torture techniques.\n  He says in his sworn affidavit:\n\n       These descriptions, however, are of EITs as applied in \n     actual operations and are of a qualitatively different nature \n     than the EIT descriptions in the abstract contained in the \n     OLC memoranda.\n\n  The words ``as applied'' and ``in the abstract'' are emphasized in \nthe text.\n\n       These descriptions, however, are of EITs as applied in \n     actual operations and are of a qualitatively different nature \n     than the EIT descriptions in the abstract contained in the \n     OLC memoranda.\n\n  The questions go on: What was the role of private contractors? Why \ndid they need to be involved? And did their peculiar motivations \ninfluence what was done? Ultimately, was it successful? Did it generate \nthe immediately actionable intelligence protecting America from \nimmediate threats that it had been sold as producing? How did the \ntorture techniques stack up against professional interrogation?\n  Well, that is a significant array of questions all on its own, and we \nintend to answer them in the Senate Intelligence Committee under the \nleadership of Chairman Feinstein, expanding on work already done, \nthanks to the\n\n[[Page S6360]]\n\nprevious leadership of Chairman Rockefeller.\n  There is another set of questions around how this was allowed to \nhappen. When one knows that America has over and over prosecuted \nwaterboarding, both as crime and as war crime; when one knows that the \nReagan Department of Justice convicted and imprisoned a Texas sheriff \nfor waterboarding prisoners; when one sees no mention of this history \nin the lengthy opinions of the Office of Legal Counsel at DOJ that \ncleared the waterboarding--no mention whatsoever; when assertions of \nfact made in those OLC opinions prove to be not only false but provably \nfalse from open source information available at the time; when one \nreads Chairman Levin's excellent Armed Services Committee reports on \nwhat happened at the Department of Defense, it is hard not to wonder \nwhat went wrong. Was a fix put in? And, if so, how? A lot of damage was \ndone within the American institutions of government to allow this to \nhappen.\n  If American democracy is important, damage to her institutions is \nimportant and needs to be understood. Much of this damage was done to \none of America's greatest institutions--the U.S. Department of Justice. \nI am confident the Judiciary Committee, under Chairman Leahy's \nleadership, will assure that we understand and repair that damage and \nprotect America against it ever happening again.\n  Finally--and I am very sorry to say this--but there has been a \ncampaign of falsehood about this whole sorry episode. It has disserved \nthe American public. As I said earlier, facing up to the questions of \nour use of torture is hard enough. It is worse when people are misled \nand don't know the whole truth and so can't form an informed opinion \nand instead quarrel over irrelevancies and false premises. Much \ndebunking of falsehood remains to be done but cannot be done now \nbecause the accurate and complete information is classified.\n  From open source and released information, here are some of the \nfalsehoods that have been already debunked. I will warn you the record \nis bad, and the presumption of truth that executive officials and \nagencies should ordinarily enjoy is now hard to justify. We have been \nmisled about nearly every aspect of this program.\n  President Bush told us ``America does not torture'' while authorizing \nconduct that America itself has prosecuted as crime and war crime, as \ntorture.\n  Vice President Cheney agreed in an interview that waterboarding was \nlike ``a dunk in the water'' when it was actually a technique of \ntorture from the Spanish Inquisition to Cambodia's killing fields.\n  John Yoo, who wrote the original torture opinions, told Esquire \nmagazine that waterboarding was only done three times. Public reports \nnow indicate that just two detainees were waterboarded 83 times and 183 \ntimes. Khalid Shaikh Mohammed reportedly was waterboarded 183 times. A \nformer CIA official had told ABC News: ``KSM lasted the longest on the \nwaterboard--about a minute and a half--but once he broke, it never had \nto be used again.''\n  We were told that waterboarding was determined to be legal, but we \nwere not told how badly the law was ignored and manipulated by the \nDepartment of Justice's Office of Legal Counsel, nor were we told how \nfuriously government and military lawyers tried to reject the defective \nOLC opinions.\n  We were told we couldn't second guess the brave CIA officers who did \nthis unpleasant duty, and then we found out that the program was led by \nprivate contractors with no real interrogation experience.\n  Former CIA Director Hayden and former Attorney General Mukasey wrote \nthat military interrogators need the Army Field Manual to restrain \nabuse by them, a limitation not needed by the experienced experts at \nthe CIA.\n  Let's look at that. The Army Field Manual is a code of honor, as \nreflected by General Petraeus' May 10, 2000, letter to the troops in \nIraq. He wrote this:\n\n       Some may argue that we would be more effective if we \n     sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain \n     information from the enemy. They would be wrong. . . . In \n     fact, our experience in applying the interrogation standards \n     laid out in the Army Field Manual . . . shows that the \n     techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in \n     eliciting information from detainees.\n       We are indeed warriors. . . . What sets us apart from our \n     enemies in this fight, however, is how we behave. In \n     everything we do, we must observe the standards and values \n     that dictate that we treat noncombatants and detainees with \n     dignity and respect.\n\n  Military and FBI interrogators, such as Matthew Alexander, Steve \nKeinman, and Ali Soufan, it appears, are the true professionals. We \nknow now that the ``experienced interrogators'' referenced by Hayden \nand Mukasey had actually little to no experience.\n  Philip Zelikow, who served in the State Department under the Bush \nadministration, testified in a subcommittee that I chaired. He said the \nCIA ``had no significant institutional capability to question enemy \ncaptives'' and ``improvised'' their program of ``cooly calculated \ndehumanizing abuse and physical torment.'' In fact, the CIA cobbled its \nprogram together from techniques used by the SERE Program, designed to \nprepare captured U.S. military personnel for interrogation by tyrant \nregimes who torture not to generate intelligence but to generate \npropaganda.\n  Colonel Kleinman submitted testimony for our hearing, in which he \nstated:\n\n       These individuals were retired military psychologists who, \n     while having extensive experience in SERE (survival, evasion, \n     resistance, and escape) training, collectively possessed \n     absolutely no firsthand experience in the interrogation of \n     foreign nationals for intelligence purposes.\n\n  To the proud, experienced, and successful interrogators of the \nmilitary and the FBI, I believe Judge Mukasey and General Hayden owe an \napology.\n  Finally, we were told that torturing detainees was justified by \nAmerican lives saved--saved as a result of actionable intelligence \nproduced on the waterboard. That is the clincher, they stay--lives \nsaved at the price of a little unpleasantness. But is it true? That is \nfar from clear.\n  FBI Director Mueller has said he is unaware of any evidence that \nwaterboarding produced actionable information. Nothing I have seen \nconvinces me otherwise. The examples we have been able to investigate--\nfor instance, of Abu Zubaida providing critical intelligence on Khalid \nShaik Mohammed and Jose Padilla--turned out to be false. The \ninformation was obtained by regular professional interrogators before \nwaterboarding was even authorized.\n  As recently as May 10, our former Vice President went on a television \nshow to relate that the interrogation process we had in place produced \nfrom certain key individuals, such as Abu Zubaida--he named him \nspecifically--actionable information. Well, we had a hearing inquiring \ninto that, and we produced the testimony of the FBI agent who actually \nconducted those interrogations.\n  Here is what happened. Abu Zubaida was injured in a firefight and \ncaptured in Afghanistan. He was flown to an undisclosed location for \ninterrogation. The first round of interrogation conducted \nprofessionally by Soufan and his assistant from the CIA produced such \nsignificant intelligence information that a jet with doctors on it was \nscrambled from Langley--from this area--and flown to the undisclosed \nlocation so that the best medical care could be provided to Abu Zubaida \nso he could continue to talk. That was the first round of information.\n  In the second interrogation, conducted consistent with professional \ninterrogation techniques, Abu Zubaida disclosed that the mastermind of \nthe \n9/11 attacks was Khalid Shaik Mohammed. That may be the apex piece of \nintelligence information we have obtained during the course of the \nconflict.\n  At that point, the private contractors arrived, and for some reason \nAbu Zubaida was handed over to them so they could apply their enhanced \ninterrogation techniques. Ali Soufan testified that at that point they \ngot no further information. What triggered the first round of \ninformation was that Soufan knew about Zubaida's pet name that his \nmother used for him. When he used that nickname, Zubaida fell apart. He \ndidn't know how to defend himself, and he began to disclose this very \nimportant information.\n  Knowledge, outwitting people, playing on mental weaknesses, taking \nadvantage of our skills as Americans--that is what worked and got the \ninformation about Mohammed. He was\n\n[[Page S6361]]\n\nturned over to the private contractors for enhanced techniques and they \ngot nothing.\n  It was then determined that because the interrogation had become \nunproductive, he should be returned to the FBI agent and CIA agent who \nhad twice interrogated him. It was in the third round that he disclosed \ninformation about Jose Padilla, the so-called dirty bomber, which was \nso important that Attorney General Ashcroft held a press conference, I \nbelieve in Moscow, to celebrate the discovery of this information. \nAgain, for some reason, he was turned back again to the private \ncontractors for the application of more abusive techniques, and again \nthe flow of information stopped.\n  For a third time, he was returned to the FBI and CIA agents again for \nprofessional interrogation, but by now he had been so compromised by \nthe techniques, even they were unsuccessful in getting further \ninformation.\n  As best as I have been able to determine, for the remaining sessions \nof 83 waterboardings that have been disclosed as being associated with \nthis interrogation, no further actionable information was obtained. Yet \nthe story has been exactly the opposite. The story over and over has \nbeen that once you got these guys out of the hands of the FBI and the \nmilitary amateurs and into the hands of the trained CIA professionals, \nwho can use the tougher techniques, that is when you get the \ninformation. In this case, at least, the exact opposite was the truth, \nand this was a case cited by the Vice President by name.\n  The costs of this could be high. There has been no accounting of the \nwild goose chases our national security personnel may have been sent on \nby false statements made by torture victims seeking to end their agony; \nno accounting of intelligence lost if other sources held back from \ndealing with us after our dissent into what Vice President Cheney \nrefers to as the ``dark side''; no accounting of the harm to our \nnational standing or our international good will from this program; no \naccounting of the benefit to our enemies' standing--particularly as \nmeasured in militant recruitment or fundraising; and no accounting of \nthe impact this program had on information sharing with foreign \ngovernments whose laws prohibit such mistreatment.\n  At the heart of all these falsehoods lies a particular and specific \nproblem: The ``declassifiers'' in the U.S. Government are all in the \nexecutive branch. No Senator can declassify, and the procedure for the \nSenate as an institution to declassify something is so cumbersome that \nit has never been used. Certain executive branch officials, on the \nother hand, are at liberty to divulge classified information. When it \ncomes out of their mouth, it is declassified because they are \ndeclassified. Its very utterance by those requisite officials is a \ndeclassification. What an institutional advantage. The executive branch \ncan use, and has used, that one-sided advantage to spread assertions \nthat either aren't true at all or may be technically true but only on a \nstrained, narrow interpretation that is omitted, leaving a false \nimpression, or that sometimes simply supports one side of an argument \nthat has two sides--but the other side is one they don't want to face \nup to and don't declassify.\n  One can hope the Obama administration will be more honorable. I \nsuspect and believe they will be. But the fact is that a cudgel that so \nlends itself to abuse will some day again be abused, and we should find \na way to correct that imbalance. It is intensely frustrating to have \naccess to classified information that proves a lie and not be able to \nprove that lie. It does not serve America well for Senators to be in \nthat position.\n  Chairman Levin has already done excellent work in the Armed Services \nCommittee, and there is no reason to believe that good work won't \ncontinue. Chairman Rockefeller has done excellent work in the \nIntelligence Committee, and his successor, Senator Feinstein, has \npicked up the mantle and continues forward with energy and \ndetermination. We can be proud of what she is doing. Chairman Leahy has \nbegun good work in the Judiciary Committee, and more will ensue when we \nsee the report of the Department of Justice Office of Professional \nResponsibility about what went wrong in the Office of Legal Counsel. \nThe new administration, I hope and expect, is itself drilling down to \nthe details of this sordid episode and not letting themselves be fobbed \noff with summaries or abridged editions. In short, a lot is going on, \nand a lot should be going on.\n  While it is going on, I want my colleagues and the American public to \nknow that measured against the information I have been able to gain \naccess to, the story line we have been led to believe--the story line \nabout waterboarding we have been sold--is false in every one of its \ndimensions.\n  I ask that my colleagues be patient and be prepared to listen to the \nevidence when all is said and done before they wrap themselves in that \nstory line.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer. I know the hour is late. I appreciate \nhis courtesy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6361-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6361-S6362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today with a heavy heart to honor the \nlife of Major Matthew Philip Houseal, from Amarillo, TX. Matthew was 54 \nyears old when he lost his life on May 11, 2009, from injuries \nsustained from a noncombat related incident in Baghdad, Iraq. He was a \nmember of the 55th Medical Company, U.S. Army Reserve, Indianapolis, \nIN.\n  Today, I join Matthew's family and friends in mourning his death. \nMatthew will forever be remembered as a loving husband, father, son, \nand friend to many. He is survived by his wife Dr. Luzma Houseal; seven \nchildren, Teresa, Catherine, David, Isabel, Patrick, Monica and Kelly; \nhis parents, William and Helen Houseal; eight siblings, Dr. Timothy \nHouseal and wife Leslie, U.S. Army Retired LTC Stephen Houseal and wife \nJulie, Joseph Houseal, Friar David Houseal, John Houseal and wife Gail, \nU.S. Air Force COL Anne T. Houseal and husband Paul Houser, Elizabeth \nNightingale, and Maria Johnston and husband Jeff; 26 nieces and \nnephews; and a host of other friends and relatives.\n  Matthew, a native of Washington, DC, grew up in St. Joseph, MI, and \nreceived a bachelor's degree, master's degree, and medical degree from \nthe University of Michigan. He spent his surgical internship at Henry \nFord Hospital and went through the Officers Training School in the U.S. \nNavy. He served his psychiatry residency at Texas Tech University in \nLubbock, TX, and spent over a decade at the Texas Panhandle Mental \nHealth Mental Retardation, where he was a beloved member of the staff. \nHe joined the Army Reserve as a major in 2007.\n  Matthew had many passions in life: known as a brilliant physician and \nan insatiable learner, Matthew held a private pilot license and was a \ncertified flight instructor with more than 10,000 hours of flight time \nin different types of aircraft. His extraordinary accomplishments were \nonly rivaled by his passion for his family, especially his seven \nchildren.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over this loss, we can take \npride in the example Matthew set as a soldier and as a father. Today \nand always, he will be remembered by family and friends as a true \nAmerican hero, and we cherish the legacy of his service and his life.\n  As I search for words to do justice to this valiant fallen soldier, I \nrecall President Abraham Lincoln's words as he addressed the families \nof soldiers who died at Gettysburg: ``We cannot dedicate, we cannot \nconsecrate, we cannot hallow this ground. The brave men, living and \ndead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power \nto add or detract. The world will little note nor long remember what we \nsay here, but it can never forget what they did here.'' This statement \nis just as true today as it was nearly 150 years ago, as we can take \nsome measure of solace in knowing that Matthew's heroism and memory \nwill outlive the record of the words here spoken.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of MAJ Matthew Philip Houseal in \nthe official Record of the Senate for his service to this country and \nfor his profound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace. I pray \nthat Gary's family can find comfort in the words of the prophet Isaiah \nwho said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord God will \nwipe away tears from off all faces.''\n\n[[Page S6362]]\n\n  May God grant strength and peace to those who mourn, and may God be \nwith all of you, as I know He is with Matthew.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6362-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TIMETABLE FOR SOTOMAYOR HEARING\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, earlier today, Chairman Leahy announced \nJuly 13 as the start date for the Judiciary Committee hearings on \nSupreme Court Justice nominee Sonia Sotomayor. I am extremely \ndisappointed with this unilateral decision on the part of my Democratic \ncolleagues. In the past, the decision of when to start these Supreme \nCourt hearings has been a bipartisan one. With the Roberts and Alito \nnominations, Republicans worked with our colleagues to accommodate \nDemocrat concerns about the timing of the hearings for the highest \ncourt in the land. Senators Leahy and Specter held joint press \nconferences announcing the Roberts and Alito hearings.\n  I would have hoped that Ranking Member Sessions and Judiciary \nCommittee Republicans would have gotten the same courtesy for President \nObama's nominee. Yet I understand that Ranking Member Sessions had no \nidea that Chairman Leahy was going to the floor to make this July 13 \nannouncement, and that he was not consulted about this decision. \nClearly the July 13 date is not a bipartisan decision.\n  Moreover, July 13 is just not enough time to prepare for a thorough \nand careful review of Judge Sotomayor's record and qualifications to be \na Supreme Court Justice. First, July 13 is a mere 48 days from the \nnomination announcement to the hearing, which is shorter than the \ntimeframe for Justices Roberts and Alito. Moreover, Justice Roberts had \njust a few hundred decisions for the Judiciary Committee to analyze. \nJudge Sotomayor has over 3,000 cases over a 17-year period on the \nFederal bench for us to study. The Alito confirmation hearing timeframe \nis probably a better comparison since Justice Alito had a similar large \nnumber of decisions.\n  With respect to concerns that criticisms have been lodged against the \nnominee, we don't control what outside groups say, but I do I know that \nSenate Republican members have treated Judge Sotomayor fairly and have \nnot engaged in personal attacks. So the idea that Judge Sotomayor needs \na hearing scheduled as soon as possible to respond to criticisms by \noutside groups just doesn't hold water.\n  In addition, the Judiciary Committee has yet to receive everything we \nneed from Judge Sotomayor. I understand that her questionnaire is not \ncomplete, that we have yet to receive all her documentation, memos, \nspeeches and unpublished opinions, that we still don't have her ABA \nreview and FBI background report. It seems like the rushed nature of \nthe process has contributed to the deficiencies in the questionnaire \nand the number of documents that are still missing. We need all this \nstuff in order to fully vet the nominee.\n  Judge Sotomayor has an extensive record, and the July 13 timetable \nthat Chairman Leahy wants to impose will force us to consider a Supreme \nCourt nominee with one of the lengthiest records in recent history in \nthe shortest time in recent history. Republican members got no serious \nconsideration to address concerns about timing, and no consultation or \nbipartisanship on setting the start date as has been done in the past.\n  I and my Republican colleagues are committed to give Judge Sotomayor \na fair hearing, but we need to thoroughly review her extensive legal \nrecord and that takes time. It is important that we do the job right \nbecause this is a lifetime appointment and we are talking about the \nhighest court of the land. As my Democrat colleagues have said before, \nthe Senate cannot be a rubberstamp. We have a constitutional \nresponsibility to carefully vet Judge Sotomayor and not rush the \nprocess. We owe this to the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6362-2", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6362]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        REMEBERING RONALD TAKAKI\n\n Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to honor \nthe life of Professor Ronald Takaki, a pioneer and leader in the field \nof ethnic studies. Professor Takaki passed away on May 26, 2009, at the \nage of 70.\n  Ronald Takaki, the grandson of Japanese immigrants, was born and \nraised in Hawaii. In his youth he was an avid surfer, earning the \nnickname ``Ten Toes Takaki'' because of his ability to perform one of \nthe most impressive and iconic stunts a surfer can do on a surfboard. \nThough uninterested in school when he was younger, Takaki applied to \nand was accepted at the College of Wooster in Ohio; he was the first in \nhis family to attend college. After earning a bachelor's degree in \nhistory, he attended UC Berkeley, where he received a master's and \ndoctorate in history. It was at UC Berkeley, doing a dissertation on \nthe history of American slavery, that Takaki found his passion.\n  In 1967, Takaki was hired by UCLA, where he taught the University of \nCalifornia's first Black history course following the tumultuous Watts \nriots. Though an unlikely candidate to teach the course, students \nquickly came to respect and admire him, and he and his class became one \nof the most popular on campus. In 1971, Professor Takaki returned to UC \nBerkeley, where he served as the first full-time teacher in the \nDepartment of Ethnic Studies.\n  In addition to teaching Black history, Professor Takaki also \nestablished UC Berkeley's PhD program in ethnic studies, the first of \nits kind in the Nation. During the 30 years he taught at UC Berkeley, \nProfessor Takaki succeeded in his desire to make the school's \ncurriculum more multicultural and diverse. He inspired and engaged \nthousands of students with his thought-provoking and insightful \nperspectives on race and ethnicity in the United States.\n  Professor Takaki was also a distinguished and prolific writer. Among \nhis most well-known books were Iron Cages: Race and Culture in 19th-\nCentury America; A Different Mirror: A History of Multicultural \nAmerica, which won the American Book Award, and Strangers from a \nDifferent Shore: A History of Asian Americans, which was nominated for \na Pulitzer Prize.\n  Professor Takaki is survived by his wife Carol; his children Troy, \nTodd, and Dana; his brother Michael; his sister Janet; and his seven \ngrandchildren. I extend my deepest sympathies to his entire family.\n  Professor Takaki was widely considered to be the father of \nmulticulturalism. His trailblazing spirit and love of life was evident \nin everything that he did, and his many years of service as an \neducator, writer, and activist will not be forgotten. We take comfort \nin knowing that future generations will benefit from his tireless \nefforts to make America a better place to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6362-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S6362-S6363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      COMMENDING THE U.S. ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS--OMAHA DISTRICT\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I wish to \nrecognize the 75th anniversary year of the establishment of the Omaha \nDistrict as part of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.\n  Established on January 2, 1934, the immediate mission of the Omaha \nDistrict was the creation of Fort Peck Dam in Montana, which was the \nfirst of six multipurpose main stem dams operating as part of a flood \ncontrol system on the upper Missouri River. After completing the Fort \nPeck Dam, the Corps, operating under the Pick-Sloan Plan, went on to \nbuild the other five main stem structures on the Upper Missouri River. \nThe Plan called for a coordinated effort with the Bureau of Reclamation \nfor irrigation projects, flood control, navigation, and recreation \nfacilities.\n  In the early 1940s, the Omaha District added military construction to \nits mission. Its first task was construction of Lowry Field in \nColorado. Since then, the Omaha District has been involved in the \nconstruction of several historic projects, such as the Northern Area \nDefense Command in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado; various missile control \nand launch facilities throughout the Midwest; and facilities for Space \nCommand.\n  As the Cold War ended in the 1980s, the national focus switched to a \nstronger set of environmental principles. The Omaha District readily \nadopted a ``green'' program, providing outstanding leadership in \nenvironmental remediation. Today, the Omaha\n\n[[Page S6363]]\n\nDistrict is managing one of the largest base realignment and closure \nand ``Grow the Army'' initiatives in the Nation.\n  For more than 75 years, the men and women of the Omaha District have \nserved their country by harnessing the mighty Missouri River basin, \nbuilding state-of-the-art facilities to serve our military, and \nrecovering the earth from hazardous toxic and radioactive waste.\n  It is only fitting that we in the Senate recognize the impressive \nachievements of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers--Omaha District during \nits 75th year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6363-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           2009 NEW HAMPSHIRE EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION AWARDS\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN.

This failure of fiscal discipline contributed to \ntransforming surpluses projected at the beginning of this decade into \ntrillions of dollars in deficits. I am committed to returning our \nGovernment to a path of fiscal discipline, and PAYGO represents a key \nstep back to the path of shared responsibility.\n  PAYGO would hold us to a simple but important principle: we should \npay for new tax or entitlement legislation. Creating a new non-\nemergency tax cut or entitlement expansion would require offsetting \nrevenue increases or spending reductions.\n  In the 1990s, statutory PAYGO encouraged the tough choices that \nhelped to move the Government from large deficits to surpluses, and I \nbelieve it can do the same today. Both houses of Congress have already \ntaken an important step toward righting our fiscal course by adopting \ncongressional rules incorporating the PAYGO principle. But we can \nstrengthen enforcement and redouble our commitment by enacting PAYGO \ninto law.\n  Both the Budget I have proposed and the Budget Resolution approved by \nthe Congress would cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term, \nwhile laying a new foundation for sustained and widely shared economic \ngrowth through key investments in health, education, and clean energy. \nEnacting statutory PAYGO would complement these efforts and represent \nan important step toward strengthening our budget process, cutting \ndeficits, and reducing national debt. Ultimately, however, we will have \nto do even more to restore fiscal sustainability.\n  I urge the prompt and favorable consideration of this proposal.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, June 9, 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6363-5", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:15 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.

Nothing in this paragraph shall \n     preclude the proceeding parties or any members thereof from \n     conducting negotiations before or after the mandatory \n     negotiation period for the purpose of achieving a voluntarily \n     negotiated access agreement.\n       (B) Length.--The period for negotiations initiated under \n     subparagraph (A) shall be 3 months.\n       (C) Determination of need for further proceedings.--At the \n     close of the period for negotiations initiated under \n     subparagraph (A), the Electronic Payment System Judges shall \n     determine if further proceedings under this Act are \n     necessary.\n       (3) Proceeding parties in further proceedings.--\n       (A) In general.--In any further proceeding ordered by the \n     Electronic Payment System Judges under paragraph (2)(C), \n     there shall be only 2 proceeding parties, 1 consisting of all \n     providers of the covered electronic payment system and the \n     other consisting of all merchants that have access to or seek \n     access to the covered electronic payment system. Each \n     proceeding party shall bear its own costs. A provider of a \n     covered electronic payment system or a merchant that has \n     access to or seeks access to the covered electronic payment \n     system may choose not to participate in the proceeding as a \n     member of a proceeding party, but unless such provider or \n     merchant executes a voluntarily negotiated access agreement, \n     such provider or merchant shall be bound by the determination \n     of the Electronic Payment System Judges with regard to the \n     fees and terms for access to the covered electronic payment \n     system.\n       (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this paragraph may be \n     construed to prohibit the proceeding parties or any members \n     thereof in a proceeding under subparagraph (A) from \n     negotiating and entering into a voluntarily negotiated access \n     agreement at any other time.\n       (4) Regulations.--\n       (A) Authorization.--\n       (i) In general.--The Electronic Payment System Judges may \n     issue regulations to carry out the duties of the Electronic \n     Payment System Judges under this Act. All regulations issued \n     by the Electronic Payment System Judges are subject to the \n     approval of the Attorney General and the Chairman. Not later \n     than 120 days after the date on which all Electronic Payment \n     System Judges are appointed under section 4(h)(1), the \n     Electronic Payment System Judges shall issue regulations to \n     govern proceedings under this subsection. In setting these \n     regulations, the Electronic Payment System Judges shall \n     consider the regulations issued by the Copyright Royalty \n     Judges under section 803(b)(6) of title 17, United States \n     Code.\n       (ii) Scope.--The regulations issued under clause (i) shall \n     include regulations regarding\n\n[[Page S6369]]\n\n     the procedures described in subparagraph (B).\n       (B) Procedures.--\n       (i) Written direct statements.--The written direct \n     statements of the proceeding parties shall be filed by a date \n     specified by the Electronic Payment System Judges, which may \n     be not earlier than 4 months, and not later than 5 months, \n     after the end of the voluntary negotiation period under \n     paragraph (2). Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the \n     Electronic Payment System Judges may allow a proceeding party \n     to file an amended written direct statement based on new \n     information received during the discovery process, not later \n     than 15 days after the end of the discovery period specified \n     in clause (ii).\n       (ii) Discovery schedule.--Following the submission to the \n     Electronic Payment System Judges of written direct statements \n     by the proceeding parties, the Electronic Payment System \n     Judges shall meet with the proceeding parties to set a \n     schedule for conducting and completing discovery. Such \n     schedule shall be determined by the Electronic Payment System \n     Judges. Discovery in such proceedings shall be permitted for \n     a period of not longer than 60 days, except for discovery \n     ordered by the Electronic Payment System Judges in connection \n     with the resolution of motions, orders, and disputes pending \n     at the end of such period.\n       (iii) Initial disclosures.--\n\n       (I) In general.--In a proceeding under this Act to \n     determine fees and terms for access to a covered electronic \n     payment system, certain persons shall make initial \n     disclosures not later than 30 days after the date of \n     commencement of the proceeding, in accordance with this \n     clause.\n       (II) Issuers, acquirers, and owners.--Any person who is 1 \n     of the 10 largest issuers for a covered electronic payment \n     system in terms of number of cards issued, any person who is \n     1 of the 10 largest acquirers for a covered electronic \n     payment system based on dollar amount of transactions made by \n     merchants they serve, and any person who owns or controls the \n     relevant covered electronic payment system and establishes \n     the terms and conditions through which issuers and acquirers \n     participate in the covered electronic payment system, shall \n     produce to the Electronic Payment System Judges and to both \n     proceedings parties--\n\n       (aa) an itemized list of the costs necessary to operate the \n     covered electronic payment system that were incurred by the \n     person during the most recent full calendar year before the \n     initiation of the proceeding; and\n       (bb) any access agreement between that person and 1 or more \n     merchants with regard to that covered electronic payment \n     system.\n\n       (III) Merchants.--Any person who is 1 of the 10 largest \n     merchants using the relevant covered electronic payment \n     system, determined based on dollar amount of transactions \n     made with the covered electronic payment system, shall \n     produce to the Electronic Payment System Judges and to both \n     proceeding parties--\n\n       (aa) an itemized list of the costs necessary to access the \n     electronic payment system during the most recent full \n     calendar year prior to the initiation of the proceeding; and\n       (bb) any access agreement between that person and 1 or more \n     providers with regard to that covered electronic payment \n     system.\n\n       (IV) Disagreement.--Any disagreement regarding whether a \n     person is required to make an initial disclosure under this \n     clause, or the contents of such a disclosure, shall be \n     resolved by the Electronic Payment System Judges.\n\n       (iv) Depositions.--\n\n       (I) In general.--In a proceeding under this Act to \n     determine fees and terms for access to a covered electronic \n     payment system, each proceeding party shall be permitted to \n     take depositions of every witness identified by the other \n     proceeding party. Except as provided in subclause (III), each \n     proceeding party also shall be permitted to take 5 additional \n     depositions in the entire proceeding.\n       (II) Organizational entities.--A deposition notice or \n     subpoena may name as the deponent a person who is an \n     individual or a person who is not an individual. Such \n     deposition notice or subpoena shall describe with reasonable \n     particularity the matters on which examination is requested. \n     If the deposition notice or subpoena names a person who is \n     not an individual, the deponent person so named shall \n     designate 1 or more officers, directors, or managing agents, \n     or other individual persons who consent to testify on behalf \n     of the deponent person, and may set forth, for each \n     individual person designated, the matters on which the \n     individual person will testify. A subpoena shall advise a \n     nonparty deponent person of the duty of the deponent person \n     to make such a designation. An individual person designated \n     under this subclause shall testify as to matters known or \n     reasonably available to the deponent person.\n       (III) Additional depositions.--The Electronic Payment \n     System Judges may increase the permitted number of \n     depositions for good cause in exceptional circumstances, and \n     shall resolve any disputes among persons within either \n     proceeding party regarding the allocation of the depositions \n     permitted under this clause.\n\n       (v) Written discovery.--In a proceeding under this Act to \n     determine fees and terms for access to a covered electronic \n     payment system, each proceeding party shall be permitted to \n     serve written discovery requests on 10 persons. These written \n     discovery requests may include requests for production or \n     inspection, a total of no more than 10 requests for admission \n     in the entire proceeding, and a total of no more than 25 \n     interrogatories in the entire proceeding. The Electronic \n     Payment System Judges may increase the permitted number of \n     requests for admission or interrogatories for good cause in \n     exceptional circumstances, and shall resolve any disputes \n     among persons within either proceeding party regarding the \n     allocation of the requests for admission or interrogatories \n     permitted under this clause.\n       (vi) Subpoenas.--Upon the request of a party to a \n     proceeding to determine fees and terms for access to a \n     covered electronic payment system, the Electronic Payment \n     System Judges may issue a subpoena commanding a person to \n     appear and give testimony, or to produce and permit \n     inspection of documents or tangible things, if the resolution \n     of the proceeding by the Electronic Payment System Judges may \n     be substantially impaired by the absence of such testimony or \n     production of documents or tangible things. A subpoena under \n     this clause shall specify with reasonable particularity the \n     materials to be produced or the scope and nature of the \n     required testimony. Nothing in this clause shall preclude the \n     Electronic Payment System Judges from requesting the \n     production by a person of information or materials relevant \n     to the resolution by the Electronic Payment System Judges of \n     a material issue of fact.\n       (vii) Objections to discovery requests.--\n\n       (I) In general.--Any objection to a request or subpoena \n     under clause (v) or (vi) shall be resolved by a motion or \n     request to compel production made to the Electronic Payment \n     System Judges in accordance with regulations adopted by the \n     Electronic Payment System Judges. Each motion or request to \n     compel discovery shall be determined by the Electronic \n     Payment System Judges, or by an Electronic Payment System \n     Judge when permitted under subsection (a)(2). Upon such \n     motion or request to compel discovery, the Electronic Payment \n     System Judges may order discovery under regulations \n     established under this paragraph.\n       (II) Considerations.--In determining whether discovery will \n     be granted under this clause, the Electronic Payment System \n     Judges may consider--\n\n       (aa) whether the burden or expense of producing the \n     requested information or materials outweighs the likely \n     benefit, taking into account the needs and resources of the \n     proceeding parties, the importance of the issues at stake, \n     and the probative value of the requested information or \n     materials in resolving such issues;\n       (bb) whether the requested information or materials would \n     be unreasonably cumulative or duplicative, or are obtainable \n     from another source that is more convenient, less burdensome, \n     or less expensive; and\n       (cc) whether the proceeding party seeking discovery has had \n     ample opportunity by discovery in the proceeding or by other \n     means to obtain the information sought.\n       (viii) Voluntarily negotiated access agreements.--In \n     proceedings to determine fees and terms for access to a \n     covered electronic payment system, the Electronic Payment \n     System Judges shall make available to the proceeding parties \n     all documents filed under section 3(c)(1).\n       (ix) Settlement conference.--The Electronic Payment System \n     Judges shall order a settlement conference between the \n     proceeding parties to facilitate the presentation of offers \n     of settlement between the parties. The settlement conference \n     shall be held during the 21-day period beginning on the date \n     on which the discovery period ends and shall take place \n     outside the presence of the Electronic Payment System Judges.\n       (x) Direct and rebuttal hearings.--At the conclusion of the \n     21-day period described in clause (ix), the Electronic \n     Payment System Judges shall determine if further proceedings \n     under this Act are necessary. If the Electronic Payment \n     System Judges determine further proceedings under this Act \n     are necessary, the Electronic Payment System Judges shall \n     schedule a direct hearing of not more than 30 court days and \n     a rebuttal hearing of not more than 20 court days during \n     which both proceeding parties will be allowed to offer \n     witness testimony and documents.\n       (xi) Sponsoring witnesses.--No evidence, including \n     exhibits, may be submitted in the written direct statement or \n     written rebuttal statement of a proceeding party without a \n     sponsoring witness, except for--\n\n       (I) requests for admission that have been admitted by the \n     receiving proceeding party;\n       (II) evidence of which the Electronic Payment System Judges \n     have taken official notice;\n       (III) incorporation by reference of past records;

A bill to amend title XI of the Social Security Act to \nprovide for the conduct of comparative effectiveness research and to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to establish a Patient-Centered \nOutcomes Research Trust Fund, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, last year, America spent $2.4 trillion on \nhealth care. That is 1/6 of our economy. Yet we ranked last among major \nindustrialized nations in the Commonwealth Fund's National Scorecard on \nHealth System Performance, which ranks the number of deaths that could \nbe prevented before age 75 through effective health care.\n  Some analysts estimate that as much as 30 percent of our spending is \nfor ineffective, redundant, or inappropriate care. That's care that \ndoes nothing to improve the health of Americans.\n  Our system also leaves nearly 50 million Americans without health \ncoverage and 25 million more with inadequate coverage. Most \nbankruptcies and foreclosures in America are related to medical costs.\n  Our system needs reform.\n  Today, along with Senator Conrad, the Chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, I am proud to introduce a bill that would improve health \ncare in America by helping doctors and patients to make better, more-\ninformed health care decisions.\n  This legislation would increase the chances that Americans receive \nthe right care. This bill would provide for research that can help \nphysicians and patients know more about what works best in medicine, \nand what does not.\n  Some patients, receive medical treatments that work well. Some \npatients receive treatments that do not. In many cases, doctors simply \ndon't have enough reliable evidence to decide which treatments are best \nfor which patients.\n  Rapid innovation and advancements in medicine have led to an ever-\nchanging array of new and sometimes expensive technologies. The age of \npersonalized medicine and genetic engineering will provide even more \nchoices for patients and their physicians. Indeed, both patients and \nphysicians can face great difficulty in choosing among treatment \noptions.\n  Patients and physicians need more credible information about how \ntreatments for a specific condition compare to each other. Today, the \nvast majority of medical information shows how treatments work compared \nto placebos. Most medical information does not show how treatments work \ncompared to each other.\n  For example, men with prostate cancer have a choice among 3 common \ntreatments surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. Each approach yields \ndifferent outcomes in terms of survival, ability to return to work, and \nother measures of quality of life.\n  Comparative effectiveness research would compare each approach in a \nsystematic way. That way, doctors and patients would have more \ninformation about how options work, and for whom. The bill that I \nintroduce today would do just that.\n  This bill would facilitate comparisons across a broad spectrum of \nhealth care interventions and health care strategies that are used to \nprevent, treat, diagnose and manage health conditions. By evaluating \nand comparing what works best, patients and providers can make more \ninformed decisions about care.\n  More specifically, this bill would create a nonprofit institute that \nwould be responsible for setting national health care research \npriorities. The institute, called the Patient-Centered Outcomes \nResearch Institute, would be a private\n\n[[Page S6372]]\n\nentity. It would be governed by a multi-stakeholder, public-private \nsector Board of Governors. It would not be an agency of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Keeping the Institute a private, nonprofit entity would shelter it \nfrom potential political influence from both the executive and \nlegislative branches of Government. The independence and expertise of \nthe Institute would result in more credible and more useful research \nfor Americans.\n  The Institute would set national priorities for comparative \neffectiveness research and facilitate studies that would help to answer \nthe most pressing questions about what works, and what doesn't.\n  The Institute would have the authority to contract with experienced \nFederal agencies--such as the National Institutes of Health and the \nAgency for Health Care Research and Quality, or with private \nresearchers--to carry out the actual research. The Institute would also \nbe responsible for disseminating the findings of the research in ways \nthat make sense to both patients and providers.\n  The Institute's work would not happen behind closed doors. The bill \nwould provide opportunities for public input and scientific review of \nthe integrity of the research being conducted. The Institute's meetings \nwould be accessible to the public, and open forums would help to \nsolicit and obtain input on the Institute's activities and agenda. \nAlso, public comment periods would be made available to discuss \nresearch findings.\n  The Institute's work would benefit all Americans who receive health \ncare. So both public and private payers would fund the Institute. After \nan initial investment from general revenues, the Institute would be \nfunded by an all-payer system, drawing from both public and private \nsources.\n  Comparative effectiveness research would not be the ultimate decision \nmaker. Instead, it would provide an additional tool to improve health \nquality. The Institute would be a health care resource, a scientific \nentity, a source of knowledge, and a provider of information.\n  According to the Institute of Medicine, this research would provide \nbetter evidence--objective information--so that doctors and patients \ncould make better decisions.\n  If we are truly to reform our health care system, then we must get \nmore evidence into the hands of the people making medical decisions. \nThis research is not only about reducing health care costs. It is \nfocused on addressing significant gaps in knowledge.\n  It is not just the academics and economists who agree. Patient \nadvocates like the National Breast Cancer Coalition, provider groups \nlike the American Medical Association, and consumer groups like AARP \ncan see the benefits of this research quite clearly. They have all \nextended their support.\n  The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act made a significant \ninvestment towards this type of research. But that was just a first \nstep. We must ensure that this research will be sustained in the years \nto come.\n  From cars to toasters, Americans are able to readily view and \nevaluate information about the quality and effectiveness of so many of \nthe items that they buy. It seems only logical that they should have \ninformation on what works and what does not when it comes to their \nhealth, especially with one in every 6 of this country's dollars leing \nspent on health care.\n  It is time for Americans and their doctors to be wield the world's \nmost advanced science, so that the most personal health care decisions, \nlike so many of the other decisions we make, are made with access to \nthe best available information.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this common-sense measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1213\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, today I join my good friend and colleague, \nSenator Baucus, in introducing the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research \nAct of 2009. This proposal builds on the legislation we introduced \nduring the last Congress. Our legislation is the product of months of \ncareful deliberations regarding the best way to expand the quality and \nquantity of evidence available to patients, physicians, and other \nhealth care decision-makers about the comparative clinical \neffectiveness of health care services and treatments. We have met with \ndozens of key stakeholders and thought leaders to discuss various \naspects of this legislation. People have come to us with many \nconstructive suggestions, many of which are reflected in the bill that \nwe are introducing today. I am proud of the result. This legislation \nlays the groundwork for improving health care quality and patient \noutcomes, enhancing patient safety, and reducing overall health care \ncosts in the long run.\n  As Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, I am acutely aware of the \nlong-term budget challenges facing our Nation. Health care spending is \ngrowing at an unsustainable rate. Although demographic changes \nassociated with the retirement of the baby boom generation contribute \nto this spending growth, the most significant factor is growth in \nhealth care costs in excess of per capita GDP growth. According to \nCongressional Budget Office projections, by 2050, Medicare and Medicaid \nspending alone will consume 12 percent of our Nation's gross domestic \nproduct.\n  But excess growth in per capita health care costs is not just a \nchallenge for Federal health spending and the Federal budget. If we \ncontinue on the current trajectory, the private sector will also be \noverwhelmed by rising health care costs. In fact, total health care \nspending is projected to grow from about 17.6 percent of GDP in 2009--\nwhich is far higher than in other industrialized countries--to more \nthan 37 percent of GDP in 2050.\n  Clearly, we need to address the underlying causes of rising health \ncare costs, not just in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, but in the \noverall health care system. Simply cutting Medicare and Medicaid \nwithout making other changes will do little to solve the larger problem \nwe face. Skyrocketing health care costs are hurting families, \nbusinesses, and State and Federal budgets. In a speech before the\n\n[[Page S6379]]\n\nBusiness Roundtable on March 12th, President Obama emphasized this \npoint: ``Medicare costs are consuming our Federal budget. Medicaid is \noverwhelming our State budgets. At the fiscal summit we held in the \nWhite House a few weeks ago, the one thing on which everyone agreed was \nthat the greatest threat to America's fiscal health is not the \ninvestments we've made to rescue our economy. It is the skyrocketing \ncost of our health care system.''\n  Health care reform is about achieving three important goals: choice, \nquality, and affordability. To achieve these three goals, we must \nconfront the fact that our health care system does not deliver care as \neffectively or efficiently as it should. There is widespread agreement \nthat Americans are not getting good value for the money we are already \nspending on health care. According to work by the Dartmouth Atlas \nProject, nearly 30 percent of total spending in our health care system, \nor $700 billion per year, is wasteful and does nothing to improve \nhealth outcomes.\n  Despite our high level of health care spending, health outcomes in \nthe United States are no better than health outcomes in the other OECD \ncountries. Indeed, the U.S. spends twice as much as other OECD nations \non health care, yet Americans have shorter average life expectancies \nand higher average mortality rates than residents of other OECD \ncountries. OECD data show that the U.S. has one of the highest rates of \nmedical errors among industrialized nations and that U.S. patients are \nmore likely to receive duplicate tests and more likely to visit an \nemergency room for a condition that could have been treated in a \nregular office visit than most other nations in the comparison. \nSimilarly, a 2008 Commonwealth Fund report found that the U.S. is last \namong 19 industrialized nations in preventable mortality, or deaths \nthat could have been prevented if individuals had access to timely and \neffective care.\n  We can and must find ways to deliver health care more efficiently, \nreduce ineffective or unnecessary care, and get better health outcomes \nwithout harming patients.\n  One solution is to generate better information about the relative \nclinical effectiveness of alternative health strategies--and encourage \npatients and providers to use that information to make better choices \nabout their health. Many health care services and treatments are \nabsorbed quickly into routine medical care--yet there is little \nevidence that these services and treatments are any more clinically \neffective than existing treatments and services. Generating more \ncomparative clinical effectiveness research is one of the keys to \ntransforming our health care system away from a system based on volume \ntoward a system that focuses on evidence-based medicine and improving \npatient outcomes.\n  The Federal Government currently funds some comparative effectiveness \nresearch through the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, AHRQ, \nthe National Institutes of Health, NIH, and the Veterans Health \nAdministration. For example, the Effective Health Care Program at AHRQ \nhas been a successful initiative. But comparative effectiveness \nresearch is not the primary focus of any Federal agency--nor is this \nFederal funding occurring permanently on a large scale.\n  Provisions included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, \nARRA, temporarily expanded existing Federal efforts by providing $1.1 \nbillion to AHRQ, NIH, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, \nHHS, for such research through 2010. Important work is currently \nunderway to develop recommendations for how best to utilize some of \nthese resources. In particular, I would like to commend the work being \ndone by the Institutes of Medicine, IOM, to convene a panel of experts \nthat is tasked with making recommendations on how to spend the $400 \nmillion provided to the HHS Secretary through ARRA. The IOM panel has \nbeen doing extraordinary work in gathering ideas and input from a very \nbroad group of stakeholders under a very tight timeline. I look forward \nto seeing the results of its work at the end of the month. It is this \nmodel of allowing for input from a broad set of stakeholders and of \nconducting priority-setting activities in a transparent way that we are \nhoping to advance in the legislation we are introducing today.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, CBO, the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission, MedPAC, and the IOM have all discussed the positive impact \nof creating a new entity charged solely with conducting research on the \ncomparative effectiveness of health interventions, including \npharmaceuticals, medical devices, medical procedures, diagnostic tools, \nmedical services and other therapies.\n  In its June 2007 report to Congress, MedPAC issued a unanimous \nrecommendation that ``Congress should charge an independent entity to \nsponsor credible research on comparative effectiveness of health care \nservices and disseminate this information to patients, providers, and \npublic and private payers.''\n\n  And the Congressional Budget Office agrees. In a report, entitled, \n``Research on the Comparative Effectiveness of Medical Treatments: \nIssues and Options for an Expanded Federal Role,'' former CBO Director \nPeter Orszag wrote that, ``generating better information about the \ncosts and benefits of different treatment options--through research on \nthe comparative effectiveness of those options--could help reduce \nhealth care spending without adversely affecting health overall.''\n  The IOM also supports getting better information into the hands of \npatients and providers. As part of its report, ``Learning What Works \nBest: The Nation's Need for Evidence on Comparative Effectiveness in \nHealth Care,'' the Institute concluded that, ``[a] substantially \nincreased capacity to conduct and evaluate research on clinical \neffectiveness of interventions brings many potential opportunities for \nimprovement across a wide spectrum of healthcare needs.''\n  This bill that Senator Baucus and I are introducing today represents \nan important step in creating a long-term vision for expanding \ncomparative clinical effectiveness research. The bill would \nsignificantly expand the conduct of comparative clinical effectiveness \nresearch to get better information into the hands of patients and \nproviders in the hopes of improving health outcomes and reducing \nunnecessary or ineffective care.\n  The purpose of this bill is to provide patients and physicians with \nobjective and credible evidence about which health care treatments and \nservices are most clinically effective for particular patient \npopulations. The research conducted under our bill would evaluate and \ncompare the clinical effectiveness of two or more health care \ninterventions, protocols for treatment, care management, and delivery, \nprocedures, medical devices, diagnostic tools, and pharmaceutical, \nincluding biologicals\n  Access to better evidence about what works best will help patients \nand health care providers make better-informed decisions about how best \nto treat particular diseases and conditions. Our hope is that the \nevidence generated by this research could lead to savings in the \noverall health care system over the long-term by empowering patients \nand doctors with information about treatments and services that may be \nclinically ineffective, while at the same time improving health care \noutcomes and quality.\n  Specifically, our bill creates a private, nonprofit corporation, \nknown as the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, which would \nbe responsible setting national research priorities and carrying out a \ncomparative clinical effectiveness research agenda. In conducting the \nresearch, the Institute would contract with AHRQ, the VA, and other \nappropriate public and private entities and could use a variety of \nresearch methods, including clinical trials, observational studies and \nsystematic reviews of existing evidence.\n  Many leading experts on this issue, such as MedPAC, have concerns \nthat a large entity within the Federal government would be vulnerable \nto political interference that could hamper the Institute's \ncredibility, and, therefore, limit the usefulness of its research. As a \nresult, we chose a model outside of the Federal government, but subject \nto government oversight.\n  In order to ensure that the information developed is credible and \nunbiased, our bill establishes a 21-Member Board of Governors to \noversee the Institute's activities. Permanent board members would \ninclude the HHS Secretary and\n\n[[Page S6380]]\n\nthe Directors of AHRQ and NIH. The remaining 18 board members would be \nappointed by the Comptroller General of the U.S. and would include a \nbalanced mix of patients, physicians, public and private payers, \nacademic researchers, philanthropic organizations, quality improvement \nentities, and medical technology manufacturers.\n\n  To ensure further credibility, the Institute is also required to \nappoint expert advisory panels of patients, clinicians, researchers and \nother stakeholders that would assist in the development and carrying \nout of the research agenda; establish a methodology committee that \nwould help create methodological standards by which all research \ncommissioned by the Institute must be conducted; create a peer review \nprocess through which all primary research findings must be assessed; \nand develop protocols to help translate and disseminate the evidence in \nthe most effective, user-friendly way.\n  Moreover, Senator Baucus and I want to ensure that the operations of \nthe Institute are transparent and focused on the needs of patients. \nTherefore, we built in a strong role for public comment prior to all \nkey decisions made by the Institute. For example, the bill requires \npublic comment periods prior to the approval of research priorities and \nindividual study designs. In addition, the bill calls for public forums \nto seek input, requires that all proceedings of the Institute be made \npublic at least seven days in advance and be made available through \nannual reports, and requires that any conflicts of interest be made \npublic and that board members recuse themselves from matters in which \nthey have a financial or personal interest.\n  Because all health care users will benefit from this research, our \nlegislation funds the Institute with contributions from both public and \nprivate payers. These contributions will include mandatory general \nrevenues from the Federal Government, amounts from the Medicare Trust \nFunds equal to $2 per beneficiary annually, and amounts from a $2 fee \nper-covered life assessed annually on insured and self-insured health \nplans. Funding will ramp up over a series of years. By the 5th year, we \nexpect the Institute's total annual funding to reach nearly $600 \nmillion per year and continue to grow thereafter.\n  The concept of an all-payer approach for comparative effectiveness \nresearch has been embraced by a number of health care experts. For \nexample, on the subject of comparative effectiveness information in its \nJune 2008 report, MedPAC stated: ``The Commission supports funding from \nfederal and private sources as the research findings will benefit all \nusers--patients, providers, private health plans, and federal health \nprograms. The Commission also supports a dedicated funding mechanism to \nhelp ensure the entity's independence and stability. Dedicated broadly \nbased financing would reduce the likelihood of outside influence and \nwould best ensure the entity's stability . . .''\n  To ensure accountability for these funds and to the Institute's \nmission, our bill requires an annual financial audit of the Institute. \nIn addition, the bill requires GAO to report to Congress every five \nyears on the processes developed by the Institute and its overall \neffectiveness, including how the research findings are used by health \ncare consumers and what impact the research is having on the health \neconomy. Finally, the bill requires a review of the adequacy of the \nInstitute's funding, which will include a review of the appropriateness \nand adequacy of each funding source.\n  Let me take a moment to address some of the criticisms that might be \nlevied against this proposal. Some may say this Institute will impede \naccess to care and will deny coverage for high-cost health care \nservices. That is simply not the case. Our proposal explicitly \nprohibits the Institute from making coverage decisions or setting \npractice guidelines. It will be up to medical societies and patient \ngroups to use the research findings as they see fit. Moreover, to the \nextent that high-cost health care services or new technologies are \nstudied by the Institute and found to be clinically ineffective \ncompared to other services and technologies, such evidence will be made \npublic to consumers and providers so that they can make informed \nchoices.\n\n  We have been working with colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nwho have concerns about the impact this research could have on patient \nsafety and access to health care treatments and services. For several \nmonths, we have been engaged in an active dialogue to address these \nconcerns. While I am disappointed that those discussions did not result \nin co-sponsorships for this legislation at this time, I look forward to \ncontinuing that dialogue in a constructive manner as we work to include \na long-term vision for comparative effectiveness research in a \ncomprehensive health reform bill.\n  In the meantime, we have made a number of meaningful changes to our \nlegislation that address the concerns voiced by our colleagues. For \nexample, we have placed a greater focus on aspects of personalized \nmedicine and included new patient safeguards to ensure that when CMS \nuses this research it does so through a process that is transparent, \nallows for public comment, and takes into account the benefits to \nparticular subpopulations.\n  This bill is a balanced, carefully crafted proposal that has taken \ninto consideration the recommendations of a broad range of stakeholders \nand thought-leaders. We welcome further discussion and suggested \nimprovements. But we refuse to allow this proposal to get bogged down \nin political maneuvering or scare tactics. Our nation needs to \nimmediately ramp up and sustain a major comparative clinical \neffectiveness research initiative to improve health outcomes and reduce \nineffective and inefficient care.\n  Senator Baucus and I will work jointly to push for the expeditious \nenactment of this bill as part of a comprehensive health reform bill. I \nurge all of my colleagues to join our effort and cosponsor the Patient-\nCentered Outcomes Research Act of 2009. There is no time to waste.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. Casey, Mr. Bond, Ms. Stabenow, \n        Mr. Cardin, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Crapo):\n  S. 1214. A bill to conserve fish and aquatic communities in the \nUnited States through partnerships that foster fish habitat \nconservation, to improve the quality of life for the people of the \nUnited States, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the National Fish \nHabitat Conservation Act, which I am introducing today along with my \ncolleagues Senators Bond, Casey, Stabenow, Cardin, Whitehouse, and \nSanders. This legislation will significantly advance ongoing efforts to \nrestore and protect fish habitat, improve the health of our waterways \nand ensure that we have robust fish populations far into the future.\n  Today, nearly half of our fish populations are in decline and half of \nour waters are impaired, which is why it is especially important that \nwe work together to protect and restore remaining habitat. The National \nFish Habitat Conservation Act will leverage federal, state and private \nfunds to support voluntary regional conservation partnerships, which in \nturn will allow federal and state governments, the recreational and \ncommercial fishing industries, the conservation community, and \nbusinesses to work together--for the first time--to effectively \nconserve aquatic habitats.\n  Our legislation authorizes $75 million annually for fish habitat \nprojects. Based on the highly successful North American Wetlands \nConservation Act model, the bill establishes a multi-stakeholder \nNational Fish Habitat Board to recommend science-based conservation \nprojects to the Secretary of Interior for funding. Regional partners \nwill then work to implement those conservation projects to protect, \nrestore and enhance fish habitats and fish populations.\n  The National Fish Habitat Conservation Act will go a long way toward \nensuring the viability of our fish and their habitats for generations \nto come. I look forward to working with my colleagues to pass this \nimportant legislation and reverse the decline of our ailing waterways \nand fisheries.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CASEY (for himself and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 1215. A bill to amend the Safe Drinking Water Act to repeal a \ncertain\n\n[[Page S6381]]\n\nexemption for hydraulic fracturing, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Fracturing \nResponsibility and Awareness of Chemicals, FRAC, Act along with my \ncolleague, Senator Schumer, that protects drinking water and public \nhealth from the risks associated with an oil and gas extraction process \ncalled hydraulic fracturing. Specifically, our bill does two things. \nFirst, it repeals an exemption to the Safe Drinking Water Act that was \ngranted to oil and gas companies four years ago. Second, it requires \noil and gas companies to publicly disclose the chemicals used in \nhydraulic fracturing.\n  The regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water \nAct is supported by 77 groups, including 14 groups from Pennsylvania.\n  The oil and gas industry uses hydraulic fracturing in 90 percent of \nwells. The process, which is also called ``fracking,'' involves \ninjecting tens of thousands of gallons of water mixed with sand and \nchemical additives deep into the rock under extremely high pressure. \nThe pressure breaks open the rock releasing trapped natural gas, which \nis then captured. Fracking often occurs near underground sources of \ndrinking water. Unfortunately, a provision included in the 2005 Energy \nPolicy Act exempted hydraulic fracturing from compliance with the Safe \nDrinking Water Act. The oil and gas industry is the only industry to \nhave this exemption.\n  The Casey-Schumer legislation is extremely important to people living \nin Pennsylvania, especially those living in communities along a \ngeological formation called the Marcellus Shale. The Marcellus is a \ngeological formation covering 34 million acres extending from southern \nNew York, through central and western Pennsylvania, into the eastern \nhalf of Ohio and across most of West Virginia. The deepest layer of the \nMarcellus formation--the Marcellus Shale--contains a significant amount \nof natural gas trapped in deep rock formations up to 9,000 feet below \nground. Last year, a professor at Penn State estimated that there was \n168 million cubic feet of natural gas in the Marcellus Shale. In the \nindustry it is what is known as a ``Super Giant gas field.'' It is \nenough natural gas to provide for the entire country for 7 years. This \nvast amount of natural gas combined with a more complete knowledge of \nthe natural fractures in the Marcellus Shale through which the gas can \nbe easily extracted, has led to what Pennsylvanians are calling a gas \nrush.\n  As I have mentioned, fracking involves injecting water mixed with \nchemicals. My major concern is that the chemicals added to the water to \ncreate fracking fluids are highly toxic. We're talking about chemicals \nlike formaldehyde, benzene, and toluene. These chemicals are injected \nright below underground drinking water. This is especially important to \nPennsylvania because our state has the second highest number of private \nwells for drinking water in the nation, second only to Michigan. Three \nmillion Pennsylvanians are dependent on private wells to provide safe \ndrinking water to their homes. So massive drilling to get to the \nnatural gas in the Marcellus Shale is not required to comply with the \nSafe Drinking Water Act, but drilling is happening right next to \ndrinking water supplies. You can see why Pennsylvanians are concerned \nabout their future access to safe drinking water.\n\n  Now, the oil and gas industry would have you believe that there is no \nthreat to drinking water from hydraulic fracturing. But the fact is we \nare already seeing cases in Pennsylvania, Colorado, Virginia, West \nVirginia, Alabama, Wyoming, Ohio, Arkansas, Utah, Texas, and New Mexico \nwhere residents have become ill or groundwater has become contaminated \nafter hydraulic fracturing operations began in the area. This is not \nsimply anecdotal evidence; scientists have found enough evidence to \nraise concerns as well. In a recent letter supporting our bill, 23 \nhealth professionals and scientists wrote the following:\n\n       . . . Oil and gas operations are known to release \n     substances into the environment that are known to be very \n     hazardous to human health, including benzene, arsenic, \n     mercury, hydrogen sulfide, and radioactive materials. The \n     demonstrated health effects caused by these substances \n     include cancers, central nervous system damage, skin and eye \n     irritation, and lung diseases. For example, fluids used in \n     the hydraulic fracturing process may contain toxic chemicals \n     such as 2-butoxyethanol, formaldehyde, sodium hydroxide, \n     glycol ethers, and naphthalene. For these reasons, we support \n     regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking \n     Water Act and the disclosure of all chemical constituents in \n     hydraulic fracturing fluids to public agencies, including the \n     disclosure of constituent formulas in cases of medical need. \n     Moreover, we support full regulation of stormwater runoff, \n     which can pollute drinking water supplies, under the Clean \n     Water Act.\n       There are growing reports of individuals living near oil \n     and gas operations who suffer illnesses that are linked to \n     these activities, yet there has been no systemic attempt to \n     gather the necessary data, establish appropriate monitoring, \n     analyze health exposure or assess risk related to any of \n     these activities. This should be done, in addition to full \n     Health Impact Assessments to inform future planning and \n     policy efforts.\n\n  In Dimock, Pennsylvania, we have a recent example of the risks \ninvolved with hydraulic fracturing. On New Year's Day, Norma \nFiorentino's drinking water well exploded. It literally blew up. Stray \nmethane leaked and migrated upward through the rock and into the \naquifer as natural gas deposits were drilled nearby. An investigation \nby the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania shows that a spark created when the \npump in the well house turned on may have led to the explosion. The \nblast cracked in half the several-thousand-pound concrete slab at the \ndrilling pad on Ms. Fiorentino's property and tossed it aside. \nFortunately, no one was hurt in the explosion. But throughout the town, \nseveral drinking water wells have exploded and nine wells have been \nfound to contain so much natural gas that one homeowner was advised to \nopen a window if he plans to take a bath. Tests of the well water show \nhigh amounts of aluminum and iron, which leads researchers to believe \nthat drilling fluids are contaminating the water along with the gas. So \nthis is a real concern. We are talking about serious implications if we \ndon't develop the Marcellus Shale carefully and responsibly.\n  I would point out that Pennsylvania has a long history of developing \nour natural resources to power the region and the nation. In fact, \nPennsylvania is home to the Drake Well near Titusville, Pennsylvania, \nwhich celebrates its 150th anniversary this year. The Drake Well was \nthe first commercial oil well in the United States and it launched the \nmodern petroleum industry. In addition to oil, Western Pennsylvania has \nlong produced natural gas. Pennsylvania also mines coal which we use to \nprovide electricity to many of our neighboring states. Pennsylvanians \nare proud of the contributions we have made to the growth of our \nnation. Contributions that were made because we developed our abundant \nnatural resources. But we also bear the burden of some environmental \nlegacies, most created in previous generations when we were not as \nconcerned with responsible development. We have old natural gas wells \nthat were not capped and leak methane into homes in Versailles, PA. We \nhave acid mine drainage that we spend millions of dollars every year to \ntry and remediate. These examples are the lessons from which we need to \nlearn.\n  Pennsylvania will develop the natural gas in the Marcellus Shale. We \nare doing it right now, and we will see more drilling over the next few \nyears. But we must develop the Marcellus Shale using the best \nenvironmental practices to protect our communities and our state. That \nis why I am introducing the Fracturing Responsibility and Awareness of \nChemicals Act. This legislation will ensure that hydraulic fracturing \ndoes not unnecessarily jeopardize our groundwater. There are affordable \nalternatives that oil and gas companies can use so that they are not \nrisking contaminating drinking water wells with potentially hazardous \nchemicals.\n  I think Norma Fiorentino from Dimock, Pennsylvania, summed it up best \nwhen she told a reporter, ``You can't buy a good well.''\n  So I urge all of my colleagues to support this legislation and ensure \nthat our groundwater is protected as we responsibly develop our natural \nresources.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S6382]]\n\n                                S. 1215\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend subtitle A of the Antitrust Criminal Penalty \nEnhancement and Reform Act of 2004 to extend the operation of such \nsubtitle for a 1-year period ending June 22, 2010; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Antitrust \nCriminal Penalties Enforcement and Reform Act of 2004 Extension Act. \nThis legislation extends a critical component of the Antitrust Criminal \nPenalty Enforcement and Reform Act of 2004, set to expire on June 22, \nwhich encourages participation in the Antitrust Division's leniency \nprogram. As a result, the Justice Department will be able to continue \nto detect, investigate and aggressively prosecute price-fixing cartels \nwhich harm consumers.\n  The Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice has long \nconsidered criminal cartel enforcement a top priority, and its \nCorporate Leniency Policy is an important tool in that enforcement. \nCriminal antitrust offenses are generally conspiracies among \ncompetitors to fix prices, rig bids, or allocate markets of customers. \nThe Leniency Policy creates incentives for corporations to report their \nunlawful cartel conduct to the Division, by offering the possibility of \nimmunity from criminal charges to the first-reporting corporation, as \nlong as there is full cooperation. For more than 15 years, this policy \nhas allowed the Division to uncover cartels affecting billions of \ndollars worth of commerce here in the U.S., which has led to \nprosecutions resulting in record fines and jail sentences.\n  An important part of the Division's Leniency Policy, added by the \nAntitrust Criminal Penalties Enforcement and Reform Act of 2004, limits \nthe civil liability of leniency participants to the actual damages \ncaused by that company--rather than triple the damages caused by the \nentire conspiracy, which is the typical in civil antitrust lawsuits. \nThis removed a significant disincentive to participation in the \nleniency program--the concern that, despite immunity from criminal \ncharges, a participating corporation might still be on the hook for \ntreble damages in any future antitrust lawsuits.\n  Maintaining strong incentives to make use of the Leniency Policy \nprovides important benefits to the victims of antitrust offenses, often \nconsumers who paid artificially high prices. It makes it more likely \nthat criminal antitrust violations will be reported and, as a result, \nconsumers will be able to identify and recover their losses from paying \nillegally inflated prices. The policy also requires participants to \ncooperate with plaintiffs in any follow-on civil lawsuits, which makes \nit more likely that the plaintiff consumers will be able to build \nstrong cases against all members of the conspiracy.\n  Since the passage of ACPERA, the Antitrust Division has uncovered a \nnumber of significant cartel cases through its leniency program, \nincluding the air cargo investigation, which so far has yielded over a \nbillion dollars in criminal fines. In that investigation, several \nairlines pled guilty to conspiring to fix international air cargo rates \nand international passenger fuel surcharges. Not only were criminal \nfines levied, but one high-ranking executive pled guilty and agreed to \nserve eight months in prison. In fiscal year 2004, before the passage \nof ACPERA, criminal antitrust fines totaled $350 million. Criminal \nantitrust fines in fiscal year 2009 have already surpassed $960 \nmillion. Scott Hammond, the Deputy Assistant Attorney General for \nCriminal Enforcement in the Antitrust Division, has stated that the \ndamages limitation has made its Corporate Leniency Program ``even more \neffective'' at detecting and prosecuting cartels.\n  ACPERA's damages limitation is set to expire later this month, so we \nmust act quickly to extend it. Otherwise, the Justice Department will \nlose an important tool that it uses to investigate and prosecute \ncriminal cartel activity. This bill extends that provision for 1 year. \nOver the next year, we will fully review ACPERA, and consider potential \nchanges to make it more effective.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1219\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require that certain complex diagnostic laboratory \ntests performed by an independent laboratory after a hospital \noutpatient encounter or inpatient stay during which the specimen \ninvolved was collected shall be treated as services for which payment \nmay be made directly to the laboratory under part B of title XVIII of \nthe Social Security Act; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce The Patient Access to Critical Lab Tests Act. The legislation \nwould modernize Medicare billing rules to improve beneficiary access to \nimportant, life-saving advanced diagnostic technologies.\n  Mapping the human genome has enabled revolutionary advances in \nunderstanding a wide variety of diseases, and ushered in an era where \ntreatments can be tailored to individual patients based on their DNA \nand specific molecular character of their disease. Complex diagnostic \nlaboratory tests make such ``personalized medicine'' possible. By \nunderstanding the molecular nature of\n\n[[Page S6383]]\n\ndisease, these new technologies increasingly allow clinicians and \npatients to pick individualized treatment options, rather than basing \ntreatment choices on broad assessments of what works best for a \npopulation.\n  Unfortunately Medicare payment, coding and coverage practices are \nharming Medicare beneficiary access to specialized diagnostic tests. In \nparticular is the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \nMedicare ``date of service'' regulation. Under the regulation, any test \nfurnished within 14 days after the patient's discharge from a hospital \nis deemed to have been performed on the day of collection, when the \npatient was in or at the hospital, even though the patient may no \nlonger be at the hospital when the test is ordered, and the test is not \nused to guide treatment during the patient's hospital encounter. A \nlaboratory test that is deemed to coincide with the date on which the \npatient was a hospital patient becomes a service furnished by the \nhospital, even though the hospital may have nothing to do with the \nordering, performance, or use of the test.\n  The combination of these rules creates a host of administrative and \nfinancial disincentives for hospitals to embrace these tests.\n  Hospitals are required to exercise professional responsibility over \nthese services, but are unwilling to do so for tests that are not \noffered by the hospital, and which are, in fact, offered by \nlaboratories that are otherwise unaffiliated with and unfamiliar to the \nhospital.\n  Hospitals are required to bill for the service; the laboratories may \nnot bill Medicare directly, and instead must bill the hospital for the \nservices they provide, which means the hospital assumes the financial \nrisk that the service is covered and that Medicare will pay for it.\n  In light of these administrative and financial disincentives, \nhospitals are encouraging physicians to delay ordering the tests until \nafter the 14 days; others are cancelling orders altogether. These \ndisincentives create obstacles for physicians and their patients, and \ngenuine barriers to access these beneficial tests.\n  These rules also create substantial hardship for the laboratories \nthat are seeking to develop these tests. In order for the tests to be \ncovered, hospitals must enter into agreements with the laboratories \nfurnishing the tests. It is administratively overwhelming for these \nsmall laboratories to seek to enter into agreements with all potential \noriginating hospitals, which may number in the thousands when \nconsidering sites where tissue may be stored.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today with Senator Wyden would \nrequire CMS to take a small, but important step toward facilitating \nMedicare beneficiary access to innovative, life-saving diagnostic tests \nby updating the ``date of service'' regulation. Specifically, the \nPatient Access to Critical Lab Tests Act would permit independent \nlaboratories offering complex diagnostic laboratory tests to bill \nMedicare directly for tests performed anytime following a patient's \nhospital stay, without forcing the hospital into an unnecessary \nmiddleman role.\n  Given the promise of these new technologies, it is important that all \nregulatory regimes keep pace with the rapidly evolving world of science \nand technology, and operate to promote innovation. Out-dated \nregulations and calcified regulatory agencies can stifle innovation and \nprevent new life-saving diagnostics and therapies from ever coming to \nmarket. They can also serve as a drag on our economy.\n  Fixing this rule is a matter of critical importance to Medicare \nbeneficiaries, as well as to the laboratories developing these \ntechnologies.\n  I encourage colleagues to join Senator Wyden and me in cosponsoring \nthis bill. I likewise urge Senators Baucus and Grassley to consider \nthis important measure as part of health care reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1220\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Patient Access to Critical \n     Lab Tests Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Timely access to laboratory testing is essential to \n     ensure quality of care for patients.\n       (2) Genetic and molecular laboratory testing are the new \n     cornerstones of high quality, cost-effective preventive \n     medicine.\n       (3) The completion of the Human Genome Project in 2003 \n     paved the way for a more sophisticated understanding of \n     disease causation, which has contributed to the advent of \n     ``personalized medicine''.\n       (4) Personalized medicine is the application of genomic and \n     molecular data to better target the delivery of health care, \n     facilitate the discovery and clinical testing of new \n     products, and help determine a patient's predisposition to a \n     particular disease or condition.\n       (5) Personalized medicine offers the promise of smarter, \n     more effective, and safer care as physicians and patients \n     become equipped with better information to guide treatment \n     decisions.\n       (6) Some of the most encouraging personalized medicine \n     developments involve highly specialized laboratory tests \n     that, using biomarkers and vast stores of historical data, \n     provide individualized information that enable physicians and \n     patients to develop personalized treatment plans.\n       (7) Several outdated Medicare regulations for laboratory \n     billing are obstructing access to highly specialized \n     laboratory tests and delaying patients' diagnoses and \n     treatments. These same rules are discouraging investments in \n     development of new tests.\n       (8) Realizing the promise of personalized medicine will \n     require improved regulation that appropriately encourages \n     development of and access to these specialized tests.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) where practical, Medicare regulations and policies \n     should be written to promote development of and access to the \n     highly specialized laboratory tests referred to in subsection \n     (a)(6); and\n       (2) the Medicare regulation described in section 414.510 of \n     title 42, Code of Federal Regulations, is one such regulation \n     that should be revised to permit laboratories furnishing \n     certain specialized tests to bill for and be paid directly by \n     Medicare for furnishing such tests.\n\n     SEC. 3. TREATMENT OF CERTAIN COMPLEX DIAGNOSTIC LABORATORY \n                   TESTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding sections 1862(a)(14) and \n     1866(a)(1)(H)(i) of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1395y(a)(14) and 1395cc(a)(1)(H)(i)), in the case that a \n     laboratory performs a covered complex diagnostic laboratory \n     test, with respect to a specimen collected from an individual \n     during a period in which the individual is a patient of a \n     hospital, if the test is performed after such period the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services shall treat such test, \n     for purposes of providing direct payment to the laboratory \n     under section 1833(h) or 1848 of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395l(h) \n     or 1395w-4), as if such specimen had been collected directly \n     by the laboratory.\n       (b) Covered Complex Diagnostic Laboratory Test Defined.--\n     For purposes of this section, the term ``covered complex \n     diagnostic laboratory test'' means an analysis--\n       (1) of DNA, RNA, chromosomes, proteins, or metabolites that \n     detects, identifies, or quantitates genotypes, mutations, \n     chromosomal changes, biochemical changes, cell response, \n     protein expression, or gene expression or similar method or \n     is a cancer chemotherapy sensitivity assay or similar method, \n     but does not include methods principally comprising routine \n     chemistry or routine immunology;\n       (2) that is described in section 1861(s)(3) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(s)(3));\n       (3) that is developed and performed by a laboratory which \n     is independent of the hospital in which the specimen involved \n     was collected and not under any arrangements (as defined in \n     section 1861(w)(1) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(w)(1)); and\n       (4) that is not furnished by the hospital where the \n     specimen was collected to a patient of such hospital, \n     directly or under arrangements (as defined in section \n     1861(w)(1) of such Act (42 U.S.C. 1395x(w)(1)) made by such \n     hospital.\n\n     SEC. 4. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       The provisions of section 3 shall apply to tests furnished \n     on or after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Roberts):\n  S. 1221. A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nensure more appropriate payment amounts for drugs and biologicals under \npart B of the Medicare Program by excluding customary prompt pay \ndiscounts extended to wholesalers from the manufacturer's average sales \nprice; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce legislation that will help ensure Medicare beneficiaries' \naccess to cancer drugs provided by community-based cancer clinics.\n\n[[Page S6384]]\n\n  Cancer takes a great toll on our families, friends, and our Nation. \nOn average, one American dies from cancer each minute and the overall \ncost of cancer to the U.S. is $220 billion annually. While these \nstatistics are daunting, the rate of cancer deaths in the U.S. has \ndecreased since 1993. This decrease is the result of earlier detection \nand diagnosis, more effective and targeted cancer therapies, and \ngreater accessibility to quality care provided by oncologists. These \nvital services have allowed millions of individuals to lead healthy and \nproductive lives after successfully battling cancer.\n  Leading the treatment against cancer, community cancer clinics treat \n84 percent of Americans with cancer. Community cancer clinics are \nfreestanding outpatient facilities that provide comprehensive cancer \ncare in physician's office settings located in patients' communities. \nThese clinics are especially critical in rural areas where access to \nlarger cancer clinics is not available.\n  In 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug Improvement and Modernization \nAct was signed into law. This legislation contained numerous provisions \nthat were beneficial to America's seniors and medical facilities; \nhowever, it also provided a reduction in Medicare's reimbursement for \ncancer treatment. The new Medicare drug reimbursement rates, based on \naverage sales price or ASP, are artificially lowered by the inclusion \nof prompt payment discounts. These discounts are provided by the \npharmaceutical manufacturer to the distributor and are a financing \nmechanism between the manufacturer and the distributor for prompt \npayment of invoices. As such, they are not passed on to community \noncology clinics, which purchase drugs from distributors. However, \npharmaceutical manufacturers are required by statute to include all \ndiscounts and rebates in the calculation of ASP, including prompt \npayment discounts that are not provided to community oncology clinics. \nThe inclusion of these prompt payment discounts results in the \nartificially lowering of Medicare drug reimbursement rates by \napproximately 2 percent. Community cancer clinics are reporting that \nthey are finding more cancer drugs reimbursed by Medicare at a rate \nless than their cost.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that Medicare \nreimbursements to oncologists would be reduced by $4.2 billion from \n2004-2013. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that reductions will reach \n$14.7 billion over that time. This increased reduction will have a \ndebilitating effect on oncologists' ability to provide cancer treatment \nto Medicare beneficiaries, especially those in the community setting.\n  This legislation will remove manufacturer to distributor prompt \npayment discounts from the calculation of ASP to provide a more \nappropriate Medicare drug reimbursement and will help ensure Medicare \nbeneficiaries' access to community-based cancer treatment. I encourage \nmy colleagues to work with me to move this legislation forward \npromptly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1221\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. EXCLUSION OF CUSTOMARY PROMPT PAY DISCOUNTS \n                   EXTENDED TO WHOLESALERS FROM MANUFACTURER'S \n                   AVERAGE SALES PRICE FOR PAYMENTS FOR DRUGS AND \n                   BIOLOGICALS UNDER MEDICARE PART B.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1847A(c)(3) of the Social Security \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1395w-3a(c)(3)) is amended--\n       (1) in the first sentence, by inserting ``(other than \n     customary prompt pay discounts extended to wholesalers)'' \n     after ``prompt pay discounts''; and\n       (2) in the second sentence, by inserting ``(other than \n     customary prompt pay discounts extended to wholesalers)'' \n     after ``other price concessions''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to drugs and biologicals that are furnished on or \n     after January 1, 2010.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McCONNELL (for himself, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. McCain, and \n        Mr. Durbin:)\n  S.J. Res. 17. A joint resolution approving the renewal of import \nrestrictions contained in the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n2003, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the annual renewal \nof the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003. Once again, I am \njoined by Senators Feinstein, McCain and Durbin who have been steadfast \nand longtime advocates for the Burmese people.\n  This resolution extends for another year the sanctions that are \ncurrently in place against the illegitimate Burmese regime, the State \nPeace and Development Council, SPDC. This bill would keep those \nsanctions in place unless and until the regime takes a number of clear \nsteps towards democracy and reconciliation. This measure also includes \nrenewal of the enhanced sanctions enacted last year as part of the Tom \nLantos Block Burmese JADE Act of 2008.\n  As many of my colleagues know, the news from Burma has been \nparticularly troubling of late. Nobel Peace Prize winner Daw Aung San \nSuu Kyi, who has been under house arrest for 13 of the last 19 years, \nwas charged last month with permitting a misguided American to enter \nher home. As a result, she faces up to 5 years in prison. My colleagues \nin the Senate and I remain deeply concerned about the outcome of her \n``trial.'' I was pleased that the Senate responded to this outrageous \nprosecution by unanimously passing S. Res. 160, which condemned the \n``trial'' of Suu Kyi and the dubious actions taken by the SPDC against \nher.\n  The Obama administration has indicated that a new strategy on Burma \nis forthcoming, and I look forward to reviewing it. Whatever the \ncontent of this strategy, it appears from correspondence between my \nHouse colleagues and the State Department that the administration will \ncontinue to support sanctions against the Burmese regime, even as it \nconsiders additional means of effecting positive change in the troubled \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the joint \nresolution be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the joint resolution was \nordered to be printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n                              S.J. Res. 17\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. AMENDMENT TO BURMESE FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY ACT OF \n                   2003.\n\n       Section 9(b)(3) of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of \n     2003 (Public Law 108-61; 50 U.S.C. 1701 note) is amended by \n     striking ``six years'' and inserting ``nine years''.\n\n     SEC. 2. RENEWAL OF IMPORT RESTRICTIONS UNDER BURMESE FREEDOM \n                   AND DEMOCRACY ACT OF 2003.\n\n       (a) In General.--Congress approves the renewal of the \n     import restrictions contained in section 3(a)(1) and section \n     3A (b)(1) and (c)(1) of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act \n     of 2003.\n       (b) Rule of Construction.--This joint resolution shall be \n     deemed to be a ``renewal resolution'' for purposes of section \n     9 of the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003.\n\n     SEC. 3. EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This joint resolution and the amendments made by this joint \n     resolution shall take effect on the date of the enactment of \n     this joint resolution or July 26, 2009, whichever occurs \n     first.\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator McConnell to \nintroduce a joint resolution renewing the ban on all imports from Burma \nfor another year.\n  I regret that we must take this action once again.\n  I had hoped that since we last took up this resolution last year, the \nruling military junta, the State Peace and Development Council, SPDC, \nwould have, at long last, heeded the voices of the people of Burma and \nthe international community and put Burma on a path to democracy, human \nrights, and the rule of law.\n  Sadly, the regime responded to these calls in true fashion, by trying \nyet again to break the will of Burma's democratic opposition and stifle \nany movement for change.\n  Just last month, the military junta arrested and detained Nobel Peace \nPrize Laureate and Burma's democratically elected leader Aung San Suu \nKyi on trumped-up charges of violating her house arrest.\n  Currently standing trial--behind closed doors and without due \nprocess--she faces up to 5 years in prison if convicted. This will come \non top of spending the better part of the past 19 years isolated and \nalone under house arrest.\n\n[[Page S6385]]\n\n  The regime's actions should come as no surprise. They represent yet \nanother attempt to hold on to power and crush any opposition.\n  Almost 20 years ago, it annulled parliamentary election results \noverwhelmingly won by Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy.\n  Six years ago government-sponsored thugs attempted to assassinate Suu \nKyi and other members of her National League for Democracy by attacking \nher motorcade in northern Burma.\n  Two years ago, the regime brutally put down pro-democracy \ndemonstrations of the Saffron Revolution led by Buddhist monks.\n  And last year, we saw the regime ignore offers made by the \ninternational community and international humanitarian organizations to \nhelp Burma respond to the devastation caused by Cyclone Nargis, leading \nto countless deaths of innocent civilians.\n  In addition, they imposed a new constitution on the people of Burma, \none that was negotiated behind closed doors without the input of the \ndemocratic opposition and one that will entrench the military's grip on \npower.\n  The SPDC understands all too well that the vast majority of Burmese \ncitizens embrace Suu Kyi's call for freedom and democracy and reject \nthe junta's oppressive rule.\n  That is why they are trying once again to silence her voice.\n  We cannot allow this brutal dictatorship to succeed.\n  For those of my colleagues who are disappointed with the lack of \nprogress in bringing freedom and democracy to Burma since we first \nenacted this ban in 2003, I share their disappointment.\n  But now is not the time to turn back. Now is not the time to reward \nthe regime for its oppressive tactics by lifting any part of our \nsanctions regime on Burma.\n  It has not made ``substantial and measurable progress'' towards:\n  ending violations of internationally recognized human rights;\n  releasing all political prisoners;\n  allowing freedom of speech and press;\n  allowing freedom of association;\n  permitting the peaceful exercise of religion and;\n  bringing to a conclusion an agreement between the SPDC and the \nNational League for Democracy and Burma's ethnic nationalities on the \nrestoration of a democratic government.\n  By renewing the import ban we express our solidarity with Aung San \nSuu Kyi and the democratic opposition who bravely stand up to the \nregime and reject their abuses.\n  They understand that the import ban is not directed at the people of \nBurma, but at the military junta that dominates economic and political \nactivity in their country and denies them their rights.\n  And I remind my colleagues that this import ban renewal is good for 1 \nyear and we will have the opportunity to revisit this issue again next \nyear.\n  I am hopeful that the United Nations Security Council and the \ninternational community will follow our example and put additional \npressure on the SPDC to release Aung San Suu Kyi and all political \nprisoners immediately and unconditionally and engage in a true dialogue \non national reconciliation, one that will lead to a truly democratic \nconstitution.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this Joint Resolution as soon as \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6385-1", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n      SENATE RESOLUTION 173--SUPPORTING NATIONAL MEN'S HEALTH WEEK\n\n  Mr. CRAPO submitted the following resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions:\n\n                              S.

Res. 176\n\n       Whereas, over the course of the last decade, the Zimbabwean \n     African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), led by \n     Robert Mugabe, increasingly turned to violence and \n     intimidation to maintain power amidst government-directed \n     economic collapse and a growing humanitarian crisis;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2008 Country Report on \n     Human Rights Practices states that the Government of Zimbabwe \n     ``continued to engage in the pervasive and systematic abuse \n     of human rights, which increased during the year,'' including \n     unlawful killings, politically-motivated abductions, state-\n     sanctioned use of excessive force and torture by security \n     forces against opposition, student leaders, and civil society \n     activists;\n       Whereas Zimbabwe held presidential and parliamentary \n     elections on March 29, 2008, with official results showing \n     that Mr. Mugabe won 43.2 percent of the vote, while Morgan \n     Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition party Movement for \n     Democratic Change (MDC), won 47.9 percent of the vote;\n       Whereas, in the wake of those elections, Mr. Mugabe and his \n     allies launched a brutal campaign of violence against members \n     and supporters of the MDC, voters and journalists, and other \n     citizens of Zimbabwe, leading Mr. Tsvangirai to withdraw from \n     the June 27, 2008, runoff presidential election, which Mr. \n     Mugabe, the only remaining candidate, then won with 85 \n     percent of the vote;\n       Whereas, on September 15, 2008, ZANU-PF and the MDC signed \n     a ``Global Political Agreement'' (GPA) to form a transitional \n     government under which Mr. Mugabe would remain President, Mr. \n     Tsvangirai would become Prime Minister, and the parties would \n     divide control of the ministries;\n       Whereas the Global Political Agreement, as written, \n     included provisions to restore the rule of law and economic \n     stability and growth, establish a new constitution, end \n     violence by state and non-state actors, and promote freedom \n     of assembly, association, expression, and communication;\n       Whereas the installation of the transitional government \n     stalled for five months as Mr. Mugabe and his allies refused \n     to compromise on control of key ministries and security \n     agencies and continued to use the state security apparatus to \n     intimidate and commit violence against political opponents;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations, the humanitarian \n     situation during that time deteriorated to unprecedented \n     levels, with an estimated 5,000,000 people in Zimbabwe \n     susceptible to food insecurity, and collapsing water and \n     sewerage services giving rise to a cholera epidemic that has \n     resulted in the deaths of more than 4,000 people;\n       Whereas, on February 11, 2009, the parties finally formed \n     the transitional government;\n       Whereas there has since been some progress toward the \n     implementation of the Global Political Agreement, including \n     positive steps by the Ministry of Finance, such as the \n     issuance of a Short Term Economic Recovery Program (STERP) \n     and the abandonment of the Zimbabwe dollar in favor of \n     foreign currencies;\n       Whereas many of the reform-minded individuals within the \n     new transitional government are limited by a severe lack of \n     qualified personnel and material resources;\n       Whereas the full implementation of the Global Political \n     Agreement continues to be obstructed by hardliners in the \n     government, and important issues regarding senior government \n     appointments remain unresolved, notably the status of the \n     current Reserve Bank Governor and the Attorney General;\n       Whereas ZANU-PF officials have made efforts to obstruct \n     implementation of the Global Political Agreement as they \n     continue to arrest legitimate journalists and human rights \n     activists and delay the swearing into office of properly \n     designated officials nominated by MDC; and\n       Whereas the security forces continue to operate outside the \n     rule of law, condoning land invasions, restrictions on media \n     access and freedoms, and harassment, arbitrary arrests, and \n     detention of civil society activists in Zimbabwe: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that the \n     United States Government, in coordination with other \n     democratic governments and international institutions \n     desiring to help the people of Zimbabwe, should--\n       (1) continue to provide humanitarian assistance to meet the \n     urgent needs of the people of Zimbabwe;\n       (2) make available increased resources for nongovernmental \n     entities to provide assistance and to pay salaries or fees to \n     appropriately qualified people in Zimbabwe to enable progress \n     to be made in the critical areas of education, health, water, \n     and sanitation;\n       (3) welcome and encourage responsible efforts by the \n     international community to support, strengthen, and extend \n     reforms made by ministries within the Government of Zimbabwe, \n     especially the Ministry of Finance;\n       (4) provide concrete financial and technical assistance in \n     response to requests from the people of Zimbabwe and civil \n     society organizations in their efforts to draft and enact a \n     new constitution based on democratic values and principles \n     that would enable the country\n\n[[Page S6387]]\n\n     to hold fair and free elections at an early date;\n       (5) work with and encourage regional governments and \n     leaders to promote human rights, the restoration of the rule \n     of law, and economic growth in Zimbabwe;\n       (6) maintain the existing ban on the transfer of defense \n     items and services and the suspension of most non-\n     humanitarian government-to-government assistance until there \n     is demonstrable progress toward restoring the rule of law, \n     civilian control over security forces, and respect for human \n     rights in Zimbabwe;

Con. Res. 25\n\n       Whereas a strong system of health care safety net providers \n     is vital to ensuring that any health care system address \n     access, cost, and quality challenges while providing care for \n     the most vulnerable individuals and communities;\n       Whereas community health centers currently form the \n     backbone of the health care safety net for the United States, \n     caring for more than 1 out of every 5 uninsured low-income \n     Americans and providing almost 1 out of every 5 office visits \n     under Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program;\n       Whereas more than 60,000,000 individuals in the United \n     States are medically disenfranchised, lacking access to \n     primary care services like those provided by health centers \n     and other safety net providers, regardless of insurance \n     coverage;\n       Whereas health centers effectively remove barriers to care \n     by providing cost-effective, high-quality, and comprehensive \n     preventive and primary health care, as well as effective care \n     management for individuals with chronic conditions;\n       Whereas health centers have compiled a well-documented \n     record of reducing health disparities and improving patient \n     health outcomes, lowering the overall cost of care for their \n     patients by 41 percent as compared to individuals who receive \n     care elsewhere, and generating $18,000,000,000 in savings \n     each year for the health care system;\n       Whereas an expansion of the highly effective Health Centers \n     Program to provide a health care home for all 60,000,000 \n     medically disenfranchised Americans would increase the \n     overall savings that health centers generate for the health \n     care system to up to $80,000,000,000 each year;\n       Whereas Congress has recognized the value of the care that \n     health centers provide to those enrolled in Medicaid and the \n     Children's Health Insurance Program by making their services \n     a guaranteed benefit and establishing a mechanism to \n     appropriately reimburse health centers for the quality care \n     that they provide;\n       Whereas private insurance often does not appropriately \n     reimburse safety net providers like health centers for the \n     full spectrum of care they provide, forcing health centers to \n     subsidize under-payments for their privately insured patients \n     by diverting funds intended to support care for those in \n     need; and\n       Whereas millions of Americans in underserved communities \n     are in need of a health care home like those provided by \n     health centers, which serve as a proven model of health care \n     delivery that assures high-quality and cost-effective health \n     care in every State of the Nation: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That--\n       (1) all individuals should have the choice of a community \n     health center as their health care home and every health \n     center should be appropriately reimbursed for the high-value \n     preventive and primary care they provide;\n       (2) health care reform should include measures to expand \n     community health centers in order to reach more individuals \n     who need a health care home;\n       (3) the current payment mechanisms for Federally-qualified \n     health centers through Medicaid and the Children's Health \n     Insurance Program are essential to ensuring access to \n     affordable and high-quality preventive and primary care \n     services for beneficiaries of such programs;\n       (4) any expansion of private insurance must include \n     mechanisms to ensure the full participation of, and \n     appropriate reimbursement to, Federally-qualified health \n     centers and other safety net providers in order to ensure \n     adequate access to care for those individuals who are \n     medically underserved or disenfranchised; and\n       (5) ensuring access to all safety net providers, including \n     Federally-qualified health centers, will be vital to ensuring \n     that health care reform is successful in expanding access, \n     improving quality, and reducing cost.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/06/09/senate-section/article/S6388-3", "month": "06", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S6388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NOTICES OF HEARINGS\n\n\n                 COMMITTEE ON RULES AND ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER.

Res. 176\n\n       Whereas, over the course of the last decade, the Zimbabwean \n     African National Union-Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF), led by \n     Robert Mugabe, increasingly turned to violence and \n     intimidation to maintain power amidst government-directed \n     economic collapse and a growing humanitarian crisis;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2008 Country Report on \n     Human Rights Practices states that the Government of Zimbabwe \n     ``continued to engage in the pervasive and systematic abuse \n     of human rights, which increased during the year,'' including \n     unlawful killings, politically-motivated abductions, state-\n     sanctioned use of excessive force and torture by security \n     forces against opposition, student leaders, and civil society \n     activists;\n       Whereas Zimbabwe held presidential and parliamentary \n     elections on March 29, 2008, with official results showing \n     that Mr. Mugabe won 43.2 percent of the vote, while Morgan \n     Tsvangirai, leader of the opposition party Movement for \n     Democratic Change (MDC), won 47.9 percent of the vote;\n       Whereas, in the wake of those elections, Mr. Mugabe and his \n     allies launched a brutal campaign of violence against members \n     and supporters of the MDC, voters and journalists, and other \n     citizens of Zimbabwe, leading Mr. Tsvangirai to withdraw from \n     the June 27, 2008, runoff presidential election, which Mr. \n     Mugabe, the only remaining candidate, then won with 85 \n     percent of the vote;\n       Whereas, on September 15, 2008, ZANU-PF and the MDC signed \n     a ``Global Political Agreement'' (GPA) to form a transitional \n     government under which Mr. Mugabe would remain President, Mr. \n     Tsvangirai would become Prime Minister, and the parties would \n     divide control of the ministries;\n       Whereas the Global Political Agreement, as written, \n     included provisions to restore the rule of law and economic \n     stability and growth, establish a new constitution, end \n     violence by state and non-state actors, and promote freedom \n     of assembly, association, expression, and communication;\n       Whereas the installation of the transitional government \n     stalled for five months as Mr. Mugabe and his allies refused \n     to compromise on control of key ministries and security \n     agencies and continued to use the state security apparatus to \n     intimidate and commit violence against political opponents;\n       Whereas, according to the United Nations, the humanitarian \n     situation during that time deteriorated to unprecedented \n     levels, with an estimated 5,000,000 people in Zimbabwe \n     susceptible to food insecurity, and collapsing water and \n     sewerage services giving rise to a cholera epidemic that has \n     resulted in the deaths of more than 4,000 people;\n\n[[Page S6390]]\n\n       Whereas, on February 11, 2009, the parties finally formed \n     the transitional government;\n       Whereas there has since been some progress toward the \n     implementation of the Global Political Agreement, including \n     positive steps by the Ministry of Finance, such as the \n     issuance of a Short Term Economic Recovery Program (STERP) \n     and the abandonment of the Zimbabwe dollar in favor of \n     foreign currencies;\n       Whereas many of the reform-minded individuals within the \n     new transitional government are limited by a severe lack of \n     qualified personnel and material resources;\n       Whereas the full implementation of the Global Political \n     Agreement continues to be obstructed by hardliners in the \n     government, and important issues regarding senior government \n     appointments remain unresolved, notably the status of the \n     current Reserve Bank Governor and the Attorney General;\n       Whereas ZANU-PF officials have made efforts to obstruct \n     implementation of the Global Political Agreement as they \n     continue to arrest legitimate journalists and human rights \n     activists and delay the swearing into office of properly \n     designated officials nominated by MDC;
