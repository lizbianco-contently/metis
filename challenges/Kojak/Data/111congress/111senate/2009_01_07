Mr. President, I have notified a number of Members--I had a \nmeeting with them at 9 o'clock this morning--that because of a Senator \nnot allowing us to move forward on this legislation last night and \nthrowing every procedural hurdle in the way of these bills, which is \nnow in the form of one bill, we are going to have a vote Sunday morning \nin the Senate. So everyone should understand, Sunday morning we are \ngoing to have a vote in the Senate.\n  I have had a number of meetings with President-elect Obama. We have a \nlot to do. I spoke with Senator Mikulski right before coming in. I have \nspoken with Senator Kennedy today. The Ledbetter legislation, to make \nthings more fair for people, especially women, is the next piece of \nlegislation we are going to move to after this bill. We have just a few \ndays to do all this work.\n  As President-elect Obama has said, there are people out there who \nwould love to work on Sunday. We are going to have to spend time on \nSaturdays, Sundays, and nighttime, especially during the first several \nmonths of this difficult time in which we find ourselves in this \ncountry. Everything that should be up is down. Alcoa is laying off \n13,500 people today. The word is out that they expected about 400,000 \njobs to be lost this month. They are reporting within the next few \nhours almost 700,000 jobs were lost this month. Do you think we can \nwork a weekend, maybe take a Saturday vote or a Sunday vote? I think we \nbetter do that. Senators should cancel their travel plans this weekend.\n  I have a family just like everyone else does, and I would rather not \nbe here this weekend. But I want everyone to understand--I am glad \nRepublicans are on their retreat. That is important. We are going to \nhave one later on. I hope the staff will alert them that on Sunday we \nare going to have a vote. I am sorry for the inconvenience, but as \nPresident-elect Obama has said, there are people out there who would \nlike to be able to work on Sunday. They would like to work anytime; \nthey don't have jobs. Mr. President, 670,000 people this month have \nlost jobs. Think about that--670,000 people have lost jobs.\n  Mr. President I want to say just one thing. This is Senator Byrd's \n50th anniversary. I spoke at some length yesterday about his record. I \ndon't want this day to go by without having acknowledged the 50th \nanniversary of Senator Byrd's service in the Senate. Senators will be \ncoming to the floor today to talk about Senator Byrd's 50 years of \nservice. At a later time, we will put that into a document and have \nthat available for the public and individual Senators.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll\n  Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, a nation's first responsibility is to \ndefend its citizens against hostile threats. The United States \nexercised that responsibility when the Taliban Government of \nAfghanistan supported terrorist attacks against our country. Israel has \nthe responsibility to protect its citizens from Hamas terrorist \nattacks.\n  I am deeply saddened by the continued violence and loss of innocent \nlives on both sides of the Israel-Gaza border.\n  I strongly support Israel's right to defend its citizens against \nthreats to its security and its existence. I wholeheartedly agree with \nPresident-elect Obama who defined the problem very clearly:\n\n       If somebody was sending rockets into my house, where my \n     family slept at night I'm going to do everything in my power \n     to stop that.\n\n  The recent military action in Gaza is in direct response to numerous \nrocket and mortar attacks from militants in the Hamas-controlled Gaza, \nwhich have killed and injured Israeli citizens and currently paralyzes \nthe southern regions of Israel.\n  Southern Israel cities have been the target of over 4,000 rockets and \nthousands of mortar shells since 2001, the majority of which were \nlaunched after Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005. During the \nmore recent 6-month truce, more than 215 rockets were launched at \nIsrael. Hamas has been extending the range of its striking capability, \nwith new rockets supplied by Iran. The Israeli Government now knows \nthat Hamas had acquired rockets that can reach Ashdod and even the \noutskirts of Beersheba.\n  Hamas' willingness to extend its reach deeper into Israel and its \noverall failure to end attacks exacerbates the already fragile \nhumanitarian situation for the residents of Gaza and undermines efforts \nto attain peace and security in the region. As a result of the \nfighting, Gaza City and its main medical center, Shiffa Hospital, have \nbeen left without electricity and hospitals are pushed beyond their \ncapacity to handle the number of victims. Hamas seems to care more \nabout inflicting damage on Israel than the protection and welfare of \nits own citizens.\n  Hamas poses a critical challenge to the regional peace process. \nLabeled as a terrorist organization but holding seats in the \nPalestinian Government and acting as the controlling authority in Gaza, \nthe organization's leaders encourage violence and cling to the belief \nthat Israel itself should be destroyed. Questions remain as to whether \nor not the organization should even be included in peace negotiations, \nbut the fact remains that the threat Hamas poses to Israel is an \nobstacle to any negotiation efforts.\n  I urge Israel and the Palestinians to take advantage of the current \nefforts to broker a sustainable cease-fire and a negotiated peaceful \nsettlement. Any such cease-fire must include Hamas' ending its rocket \nand mortar attacks, recognize its neighbor's right to exist, renounce \nviolence, and honor all past agreements in order to move toward a two-\nstate solution based on mutual peace and security.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we all know the American economy is \nin a challenged state. That is a nice\n\n[[Page S155]]\n\nway of putting it. I spent about a week in December traveling around my \nState visiting 22 counties, meeting with people who had been working \nthree jobs, had their hours reduced, were afraid they weren't going to \nbe able to buy their grandkids Christmas presents. Letters coming to my \noffice included a woman who said she inherited a small amount of money \nfrom her dad. She thought that would go to her daughter's wedding, but \ninstead it was used to pay for her retirement because she had lost so \nmuch money from her retirement funds. We heard stories of a man and his \nwife who would put their daughters to bed at night and gather at the \nkitchen table, shaking their heads and wondering how they were going to \nmake it. Those were the comments I heard when I was home in Minnesota \nin December.\n  I also saw some optimism and hope as I traveled the State and saw the \ngrowing energy economy and heard the enthusiasm for our new President-\nelect. Obviously, there was frustration with what has been going on \nwith this administration for the past 8 years and how they have not had \na forward-thinking plan for the economy. People have hope that is going \nto change.\n  I can tell there is widespread interest in the economic stimulus \npackage proposed by the new President. There is widespread interest in \nmy State for infrastructure spending, for the energy jobs. One thing I \nbelieve we need to devote some specific time to in the next few weeks--\nand I know the new President is interested in this--is the idea of \nlooking not only at roads and bridges and infrastructure but to look at \ntechnological infrastructure, to figure out why we have had trouble \ncompeting with countries around the world.\n  When one talks to people in Park Rapids, MN, who go maybe a mile out \nof town, they can't get on the Internet or it costs them $700 a month \nif they are going to do satellite, or they can be stuck with dial-up \nthat is so slow they can hardly use it, you get to understand the need \nfor better technological infrastructure. What I finally figured out, \nafter this 22-county tour--I had been trying to figure out why some \ncompanies say they are offering Internet service. I finally figured out \nwhat the problem is. In many parts of my State, they may have Internet \nservice, but it is either much too slow or much too expensive.\n  As a country we have ensured that every American has access to \ntelephone service and electricity regardless of economic status. We \nmust now do the same for broadband Internet access. Broadband not only \ncreates educational and health care opportunities, it can create \nopportunities for businesses and employment that would otherwise not \nexist in rural communities.\n  In these tough economic times, broadband deployment creates jobs--not \nonly the direct creation of jobs in the tech sector but also the \ncreation of even more indirect employment opportunities by increasing \naccess to broadband.\n  After visiting 22 of Minnesota's counties, I convened a Broadband \nRoundtable in my State on December 29. I heard firsthand from people \nabout the importance of making sure they have access to fast and \naffordable broadband. We have had success stories in our State, as \nwell.\n  One story I heard when I was out in a small town in Minnesota--\nSebeka--they began diversifying early into cutting-edge technologies, \nincluding fiber optic infrastructure, digital telephone switching, \ncable and satellite TV, broadband Internet service to 100 percent of \ntheir customers. They have a very high percentage--I think 70 to 80 \npercent--of people who are actually purchasing this high-speed Internet \nin a very small town in a remote area of Minnesota.\n  The government of Carver County, MN, is leading a collaborative \neffort to interconnect county facilities with cities, school districts, \ntownships, and other entities in the development of high-speed \ncommunications.\n  Through a number of funding and technical assistance programs, \nMinnesota's Blandin Foundation's Broadband Initiative has worked in \nrural Minnesota communities to educate community leaders and to get \nthese partnerships started.\n  Despite these local success stories, however, much more needs to be \ndone. The overall reality is America has become an international \nlaggard on broadband. In 2000, the United States ranked 4th among 30 \nnations surveyed in broadband subscribership, according to the \nOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Today, the \nUnited States is 15th on the list. So in the last 8 years, we have gone \nfrom 4th in the world to 15th in the world. That is not the kind of \nprogress that is going to keep this country moving and get us back on \ntrack.\n  According to the International Telecommunications Union, the United \nStates is now perched as 24th in the world in broadband penetration. \nCanada has a higher level of broadband penetration and digital \nopportunity than we do.\n  Broadband adoption in the United States does continue to grow--from \n47 percent of homes in March 2007 to 55 percent in April 2008. But the \nfigure is significantly lower for those living in rural America: only \n38 percent.\n  Of course, we have to consider more than just access, as I noted \nearlier. We need to look at speed. We need to look at speed if we are \ngoing to compete with countries such as India and Japan.\n  So we have work ahead of us. All of us understand broadband is a \ncritical infrastructure for the 21st century. By one estimate--to give \nyou a sense of what we are talking about, jobs--every 1 percentage \npoint increase in broadband penetration per year would lead to the \ncreation of nearly 300,000 new jobs. That is why it is essential that \nall communities, including our rural communities, have the opportunity \nto take advantage of the opportunities offered by this 21st-century \ninfrastructure. I want these jobs in my State going to Thief River \nFalls or Lanesboro or Crookston instead of going off to other countries \nsuch as Japan and India. It is that simple. I want these jobs to stay \nin the United States. We have seen the challenge before to make sure \nour rural communities are not left behind as technology develops.\n  For example, there are still many Americans who can remember growing \nup in homes with no electricity and no telephone service. In 1935, \nabout 80 percent of all homes and towns and cities in the United States \nhad electricity, but fewer than 12 percent of farms in America had \nelectricity, and only about 25 percent had telephone service, which was \noften unreliable.\n  In 1935, President Roosevelt created the Rural Electrification \nAdministration, REA. The REA helped organize and support farmer-owned \nelectric cooperatives to bring electricity to farms. By 1949--this was \nfrom 1935 to 1949--more than three-quarters of all farms in America had \nelectricity. So with those standards that were put in place, it went \nfrom 12 percent to 75 percent. That is an amazing achievement during a \ntime of crisis because people believed you could get this done.\n  The penetration of telephone service actually took longer. In 1949, \nonly 36 percent of America's farms had telephone service. That year, a \ntelephone amendment was added to the Rural Electrification Act, which \nmade loan funds available to finance rural telephone systems. In just a \nlittle more than a decade, nearly 80 percent of farms had telephone \nservice.\n  Even much of our modern transportation infrastructure--including \npaved roads and steel and concrete bridges--has come into existence \nonly in the past 70 years, thanks to both the New Deal and President \nEisenhower's Interstate Highway Program. Our broadband infrastructure \npresents us with the same challenge to make sure no one is left behind.\n  President-elect Obama understands that broadband must now be \nconsidered a basic part of our national infrastructure. He also \nunderstands that investment in our broadband infrastructure is \nessential to our long-term prosperity.\n  A few weeks ago, in a weekly address, President-elect Obama announced \nthat a key part of his economic recovery plan would involve increasing \nbroadband deployment and adoption, saying:\n\n       It is unacceptable that the United States ranks 15th in the \n     world in broadband adoption.\n\n  On Monday of this week, I sent a letter to the President-elect \napplauding his efforts to include investment in our Nation's \ninformation infrastructure as\n\n[[Page S156]]\n\npart of an economic stimulus package. I also asked that he consider \nthese partnerships that we have seen work so well in our State, and \nthat matching grants on the Federal level to work with the local \ncommunities would be one way to spur broadband development.\n  I finally asked him to look at the fact that this is not just about \ncommunities that have no access, it is also about communities that have \nbad access or slow access or too expensive access. If we really want to \nget the broadband infrastructure in place, we have to make it work for \neveryone, just as what Dwight D. Eisenhower did with the highway system \nin the 1950s, and just as President Roosevelt did with rural \nelectrification in the 1930s and 1940s.\n  I believe any economic stimulus package must include mechanisms \ndesigned to bring affordable and fast broadband to this country. An \neconomic stimulus package should fully fund the Broadband Data \nImprovement Act, which I cosponsored and which passed last Congress.\n\n  Any economic stimulus package, as I mentioned, must also fund \nmatching grants for community-level partnerships that demonstrate \nstrong cooperation among local governments, businesses, schools, health \ncare, and others.\n  Finally, one aspect of the Nation's information infrastructure that \nmay continue to elude us absent some type of Federal involvement is the \ncreation of an advanced, interoperable communications network for \npublic safety.\n  I still remember hearing when one of our police officers was shot and \nkilled in St. Paul, MN, how those who were trying to apprehend the \nperson, the murderer in this case, were trying to communicate. When \nthey were up in the helicopter, they literally had to have multiple \nwalkie talkies and telephones, sometimes six or seven, to try to match \nup with all the phone systems that were in use across the area.\n  Well, since then we have had improvements in the large metropolitan \narea of the Twin Cities in our interoperability, but we do not have \nthat kind of matching and that kind of cooperation in the rural parts \nof our State, nor do we have it across the country.\n  The first responsibility of government is to protect its citizens. \nThe fact that our Nation's police, fire, and other first responders, \nincluding those in our rural areas, still do not have access to such a \nnetwork more than 7 years after the tragic events of September 11 is \nsimply unacceptable. I believe consideration of this issue in the \ncontext of broadband stimulus measures may present the best chance to \naddress this continuing problem.\n  I join the President-elect and so many in this Senate in calling for \n21st-century technology to create jobs and help our economy be more \nrobust and competitive in the long term. This is about creating \nimmediate jobs, and we can get that with technological infrastructure. \nBut it is also about creating jobs in a way that leaves us with \nsomething that will actually move this economy forward.\n  This technological infrastructure, whether it be the electricity grid \nor whether it be the broadband I have spoken about today, is really our \nrural electrification. It is our interstate highway program. It is our \ngeneration's chance to build this infrastructure in a way that will fit \nthe changing needs of this country and allow us to compete on the world \nstage.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/07/senate-section/article/S156-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S156-S157]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO SENATOR ROBERT BYRD\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I couldn't help thinking today, as we \nwere sitting in our weekly caucus--that the senior member of our party \nhere in the Senate and the most senior Member of the Senate, and the \nsenior Senator from West Virginia, the distinguished Robert C. Byrd, \nhas now served 50 years which is an all time record as the longest \nserving Senator in our country.\n  I have had the privilege of serving beside Senator Byrd for 34 years \nand am proud to call him a very good friend. When I first came to the \nSenate as a new Member, it was Robert Byrd who took me aside and talked \nto me about the rules of the Senate. Senator Byrd took the time to \nspeak about the rules and history of the Senate, but he also talked \nabout the customs, and practices of this body. He spoke of the way you \ntreat each other, and how you treat members of the other party. He also \nexplained the customary order of recognition, the kinds of courtesies \nyou use and the importance of taking into consideration the needs of \nanother Senator.\n  Senator Byrd and I have sat here through inaugurations of Presidents, \nand we have traveled together to funerals of colleagues with whom we \nhave served. His late wife, Erma, and my wife, Marcelle, were friends \nand would often ride together down to the Senate for Senate gatherings. \nI know I would always enjoy running into Erma and Bob in the grocery \nstore in McLean, VA. After a while, we would tend to forget what it was \nwe had gone to the store for because we would be catching up on the \nnews of the Senate. Throughout it all, Bob Byrd has always had that \ngreat sense of what it means to be a Senator.\n  I said many times on the floor of this Senate that there are only 100 \nof us who have the privilege at any given time to serve here and the \nAmerican people. Bob Byrd has always understood that better than most \nof us ever will. We can be and should be the conscience of the Nation.\n  We are, above all, a Senate of reasonable men and women who live by \nvery specific rules, and we hurt both the Senate and the country if we \nignore those rules. So many times I have heard Senator Byrd, who would \nsee us moving away from the rules which guide us, stand up to address \nthe Chair and remind each one of us what it means to be a Senator, what \nit means to protect those principals and what it means to serve this \ncountry.\n  Senators come and go. All of us will at some time leave this body. \nBut those Senators who do the most to uphold and keep the functions and \nhistory of the Senate alive are the ones who will make it a better \nplace for the next generation of Senators. Senator Byrd has authored \nhistories of this Chamber, but then he has also lived the history of \nthis Chamber.\n  I salute my good friend from West Virginia. I look forward to serving \nwith him for years to come.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Madam President, I rise today to honor a giant of \nthe Senate, my colleague and the senior Senator from West Virginia, \nRobert C. Byrd.\n  Yesterday we watched a number of new Senators take an enormously \nimportant oath to serve our country and to defend our Constitution. I \nwas included in taking that oath and I couldn't help but think of my \nnew colleagues. If these new Senators are looking for an inspiration, a \nguiding light, or a model, the way that I did some years ago, they need \nlook no further than the seat directly behind our distinguished \nmajority leader.\n  In that seat they will find a man who took that same oath that we did \n50 years ago today. Senator Byrd has taken that oath a total of nine \ntimes. He has cast more votes than anyone in the history of the Senate. \nHe has held more leadership positions than anyone in the history of the \nSenate. He has served longer than anyone in the Senate. He has \nliterally written the book on the Senate and lived the story of the \nSenate over five decades.\n  Robert C. Byrd is nothing short of a legend. However, 50 years ago \ntoday he was a young man from West Virginia who married a coal miner's \ndaughter. He had spent 4 years in the West Virginia Legislature and 6 \nyears in the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  No one could know in 1959 that he would be a legend in 50 years. What \nthey did know was Robert Carlyle Byrd was an ambitious self-starter who \nwould put himself through law school while serving in the U.S. \nCongress.\n  They knew Senator Byrd was always willing to help a colleague and to \nprovide advice and guidance.\n  In 1959 they knew Robert Byrd had married his grade school \nsweetheart--\n\n[[Page S157]]\n\nErma Ora--who would stand with him her entire life and was just as \nbeloved as he was in West Virginia and in Washington. Senator Byrd \nalways knew Erma's greatness saying she was not only his wife but his \nbest counselor.\n  Speaking of West Virginia, the Senate knew from his first days here \nthat he would advocate fiercely for the citizens of our State and \nthroughout the years would bring prosperity to West Virginia.\n  While they knew these things in 1959, today we know Senator Byrd as \nthe conscience of the Senate. We know him as the Senator with the \ngreatest longevity. In West Virginia we now know him as the West \nVirginian of the 20th century and I am glad the Nation has had the \nopportunity to get to know Senator Byrd over these last 50 years.\n  I know my colleagues join me in congratulating Senator Byrd on a \nrecord-setting 50 years in the Senate. Senator, I wish you many more.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I want to join Senator Reid and all of \nmy colleagues in congratulating Senator Robert Byrd on reaching yet \nanother historic milestone in his lifetime of public service.\n  In the history of the U.S. Senate, only one Senator, Robert Carlyle \nByrd, has served for 50 years.\n  A half century of service to his State, our Nation, this institution, \nand our Constitution. That is a remarkable achievement and one that we \nare not likely to see again for a very long time.\n  Senator Byrd is, of course, a great student of history and the author \nof the definitive work on the history of the Senate. In fact, one could \nsay that Robert C. Byrd is Senate history.\n  Senator Byrd has served with (not under, with) 11 Presidents--very \nsoon to be 12 Presidents.\n  He was the first U.S. Senator ever to cast 15,000 votes, and he is \nthe only Senator ever to cast 18,000 votes.\n  Senator Byrd has served as majority leader, and held more leadership \npositions than any Senator in history.\n  To help put the length of his service in perspective, consider a few \nfacts:\n  When Senator Byrd cast his first vote in the Senate--on January 8, \n1959--his colleagues included Senators John Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson. \nVice President Richard Nixon was the Presiding Officer. Hawaii was not \nyet a State. And a state-of-the-art computer would have taken up half \nof the space of this Chamber and had roughly the same amount of \ncomputing power as a Palm Pilot.\n  He has been a candidate for election 13 times--10 times as a \ncandidate for the Senate and 3 times as a candidate for the House. He \nwon every time.\n  And he has become perhaps the most popular political figure in West \nVirginia history. He was named West Virginian of the Century by the \nresidents of his home State.\n  Senator Byrd's recent reelection to this body is a testimony to West \nVirginians' enduring respect and admiration for this proud son of ``the \nMountain State.''\n  It is an honor to serve with this giant of Senate history, and to \nshare with him this milestone. Again, I commend him and congratulate \nhim.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to offer my very \nsincere and heartfelt congratulations to the President pro tempore of \nthis body, Senator Robert Byrd. He has served in the body for 50 years. \nI have had the privilege of working on the Appropriations Committee \nwith him. There has been no one who has been more faithful to the \nConstitution, to the goals of the Senate or who has served this Senate \nmore honorably. I wish to say congratulations, Mr. Chairman. May you \nhave many more years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/07/senate-section/article/S157-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S157-S161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LAWFUL INTERROGATION AND DETENTION ACT\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I would like to speak--and I am \njoined on the floor by my comember of the Intelligence Committee, \nSenator Ron Wyden, who will also speak on this issue--about the bill \nthat Senators Rockefeller, Wyden and Whitehouse and I introduced \nyesterday. It is the Lawful Interrogation and Detention Act.\n  I began this effort some time ago because I believe very strongly it \nis time to end the failed experiment at Guantanamo. It is time to \nrepudiate torture and secret disappearances. It is time to end the \noutsourcing of coercive interrogations to outside contractors.\n  I believe it is time to return to the norms and values that have \ndriven the United States to greatness since the days of George \nWashington but have been tarnished in the past 7 years. That is what \nboth Senator Wyden and I hope this bill will do.\n  I have sent a copy of it to President-elect Obama's transition team. \nI have had occasion to talk with him about it and indicated that we \nlook to work closely with him.\n  What this bill would do is require the President to close the \ndetention facilities at Guantanamo Bay within 12 months. The need to \nclose this facility is clear. Along with the abuses at Abu Ghraib, \nGuantanamo has been decried throughout the world. It has helped our \nenemies recruit, it has reduced America's credibility worldwide, \nstrained relationships with our allies, and created a misguided dual \nlegal system.\n  Additionally, the Supreme Court now has ruled four times that the \nprocedures put in place at Guantanamo are illegal. First, in Rasul v. \nBush, the Court ruled the administration could not hold detainees \noutside U.S. law on Guantanamo soil; second, Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, in \nwhich the Court ruled the Government could not detain a U.S. citizen \nwithout due process and struck down the executive's process of labeling \ndetainees as unlawful enemy combatants; third, Hamdan v. Rumsfeld, in \nwhich the Court struck down the administration's process for trying \ndetainees outside the civilian legal system or the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice; and most recently in Boumediene, in which the Court \nruled that detainees must be afforded habeas corpus.\n  Guantanamo was explicitly created to be a separate and lesser system \nof justice, to hold people captured on or near the battlefield in \nAfghanistan indefinitely. In 7 years, it has produced three \nconvictions, including Australian David Hicks--who agreed to a plea \nbargain to get off the island, and Osama bin Laden's driver, Salim \nHamdan, whose sentence is almost already up.\n  The hard part about closing Guantanamo is not deciding to go do it; \nit is figuring out what to do with the remaining detainees. Under the \nLawful Interrogation and Detention Act, the approximately 250 \nindividuals now being held there would be handled in one of five ways.\n  No. 1, they can be charged with a crime and tried in the United \nStates in the Federal civilian or military justice systems. These \nsystems have handled terrorists and other dangerous individuals before \nand are capable of dealing with classified evidence and other unusual \nfactors.\n  Second, individuals could be transferred to an international \ntribunal, if such a tribunal exists.\n  Third, detainees could be returned to their native countries or, if \nthat is not possible, they could be transferred to a different country.\n  To date, more than 500 men have been sent from Guantanamo to the \ncustody of other countries. Recently, Portugal and other nations have \nsuggested they would be open to taking some of the remaining detainees \nas a way to help close Guantanamo. That is good news.\n  If there are detainees who cannot be charged with crimes or \ntransferred to the custody of another country, there is a fourth \noption. If the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National \nIntelligence agree an individual poses no security threat to the United \nStates, the U.S. Government may release him. This may work, for \nexample, for the Chinese Uighurs remaining at Guantanamo. I believe \nfive or six Uighurs have already been released. The District Court for \nthe District of Columbia has ordered that the remaining 17 Uighurs be \nreleased into our country. That decision has been stayed upon appeal.\n  Finally, for detainees who cannot be addressed in any one of the \nother four\n\n[[Page S158]]\n\noptions, the executive branch could hold them under existing \nauthorities provided by the law of armed conflict.\n  I believe these options provide sufficient flexibility to handle the \n250 or so people now being held at Guantanamo. If the incoming Obama \nadministration decides that other alternatives are needed, I hope they \nwill come to the Congress, explain the specifics of the problem, and we \nwill work toward a joint legislative solution.\n  The three other provisions in the legislation end parts of the CIA's \nsecret detention and interrogation program.\n  Some of the details of the program are already publicly known, such \nas the use of waterboarding on three individuals some years ago. Other \naspects remain secret, such as the other authorized interrogation \ntechniques and how they are used.\n  There have been public allegations of multiple deaths of detainees in \nCIA custody. There was one conviction of a CIA contractor in the death \nof a detainee in Afghanistan, but other details remain classified.\n  But it is well known that on August 1, 2002, the Justice Department \napproved coercive interrogation techniques, including waterboarding, \nfor the CIA's use. This, despite the fact that the Justice Department \nhas prosecuted the use of waterboarding, and the State Department has \ndecried it overseas.\n  The administration used what I believe to be faulty logic and faulty \nreasoning to say that waterboarding was not torture. In fact, it is.\n  We will never turn this sad page in our Nation's history until all \ncoercive techniques are banned and are replaced with a single, clear, \nuniform standard across the U.S. Government. I cannot say that too \nstrongly.\n  That standard established by this legislation is the interrogation \nset of protocols outlined in the Army Field Manual.\n  This is the field manual. It is not a casual document. It has been \ndeveloped and revised over a period of time. It contains 19 specific \ninterrogation techniques. They work for the military and operate under \nthe same framework as the time-honored approach of the FBI. If the CIA \nwould abide by its terms, it would work for the CIA as well.\n  These techniques were at the heart of former FBI Special Agent Jack \nCloonan's successful interrogation of those involved in the 1993 World \nTrade Center bombing. They were also the tools used by Special Agent \nGeorge Piro to get Saddam Hussein to provide the evidence that resulted \nin his death sentence.\n  We have powerful expert testimony that the Army Field Manual \ntechniques work against terrorist suspects. The manual's use across the \nGovernment is supported by scores of retired generals and admirals, by \nGEN David Petraeus, and by former Secretaries of State and national \nsecurity advisers of both parties.\n  Majorities in both Houses of Congress passed this provision last year \nas part of the fiscal year 2008 intelligence authorization bill. I \noffered that amendment, as I believe Senator Wyden will remember, in \nthe joint conference between the House and the Senate Intelligence \nCommittees, and it was added to the bill.\n  It sends a clear message that we do not support coercive \ninterrogations. But, regrettably, the President's veto of the bill \nstopped it from becoming law.\n  The President-elect agrees that we need to end coercive \ninterrogations and to comply strictly to the terms of the Convention \nAgainst Torture and the Geneva Conventions. So we look forward to \nworking with him to end this sad story in our Nation's history.\n  The third part of this legislation is a ban on contractor \ninterrogators at the CIA. Now, this is interesting. Unlike the FBI, \nwhere FBI agents do their own interrogations, CIA agents do not carry \nout all their interrogations. They hire contractors to do so. As \nGeneral Hayden has testified, the CIA hires and keeps on contract \npeople who are not intelligence professionals and whose sole job is to \nbreak detainees and get them to talk.\n  Now, I firmly and staunchly believe that outsourcing interrogations, \nwhether coercive or more appropriate ones, to private companies is a \nway to diminish accountability.\n  I also believe the use of contractors leads to more brutal \ninterrogations than if they were done by Government employees.\n  Think about it. You can have a set of interrogation practices and, \ndependent upon who administers them and the length of time they are \nadministered and the combination in which they are administered, they \ncan have very different effects on an individual.\n  There are surely areas where paid contractors make practical and \nfinancial sense. Interrogation, a form of collecting intelligence, is \nnot one of them.\n  The fourth and the final provision in this legislation requires that \nthe CIA and other intelligence agencies provide notification to the \nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, the ICRC, of their detainees. \nFollowing notification, the CIA will be required to provide \nInternational Red Cross officials with access to detainees in the same \nway the military does.\n  Access by the ICRC is a hallmark of international law and is required \nby the Geneva Conventions. Access to a third party and the ICRC, in \nparticular, was seen by the United States in 1947 as a guarantee that \nAmerican men and women would be protected if they were ever captured \noverseas.\n  I believe it still remains that guarantee.\n  We remain a nation at war, and credible, actionable intelligence \nremains a cornerstone of our war effort. But this is a war that will be \nwon by fighting smarter, not sinking to the depths of our enemies.\n  Our Nation has paid an enormous price because of these \ninterrogations. They cast shadow and doubt over our ideals and our \nsystem of justice. Our enemies have used our practices to recruit more \nextremists. Our key global partnerships crucial to winning the war on \nterror have been strained. It will take time to resume our place as the \nworld's beacon of liberty and justice. But I deeply believe, and the \ncosponsors believe, this bill will put us on that path and start the \nprocess.\n  So I urge its passage. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord the history of this legislation and the matters it contains.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Legislative Activity on Guantanamo and CIA Interrogations\n\n       April 30, 2007: Introduced the first Senate legislation to \n     close Guantanamo (co-sponsors: Dodd, Whitehouse, Kennedy, \n     Clinton, Kerry).\n       July 11, 2007: Introduced amendment to close Guantanamo to \n     the FY08 Defense Authorization bill. Amendment blocked from \n     receiving Floor consideration. (co-sponsors: Harking, Dodd, \n     Clinton, Brown, Bingaman, Kennedy, Whitehouse, Obama, \n     Salazar, Durbin, Byrd, Biden, Hagel, Boxer, Feingold).\n       December 5, 2007: Offered amendment to restrict CIA to Army \n     Field Manual interrogation techniques to the FY08 \n     Intelligence Authorization conference report. Amendment \n     adopted, passed in conference report by House and Senate, \n     vetoed by President Bush March 8, 2008. (amendment co-\n     sponsors: Hagel, Whitehouse, Feingold).\n       August 1, 2008: Introduced legislation restricting the CIA \n     to the Army Field Manual, banning contractor interrogations, \n     and providing access to detainees to the ICRC (co-sponsors: \n     Rockefeller, Whitehouse, Hagel, Feingold, Wyden).\n       January 6, 2009: Introduced legislation to close \n     Guantanamo, restricting the CIA to the Army Field Manual, \n     banning contractor interrogations, and providing access to \n     detainees to the ICRC (cosponsors: Rockefeller, Wyden, \n     Whitehouse).\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Now I will defer to my distinguished friend, my \ncolleague, the Senator from Oregon, the Honorable Ron Wyden. \n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Madam President, I am very pleased to be able to be out on \nthe Senate floor today with our incoming chair of the Intelligence \nCommittee to discuss this legislation. Senator Feinstein and I have sat \nnext to each other on the Intelligence Committee now for I think about \n8 years. We have talked about this issue on many occasions. I commend \nthe Senator from California for all of her leadership.\n  This is the right way to start off our committee on breaking with the \nlast 8 years of flawed policies that have been of dubious effectiveness \nand dubious legality. I am very pleased, honored to be one of our \ncosponsors, and I note that our outgoing chair, Senator Rockefeller, is \none of our cosponsors, and Sheldon Whitehouse, the distinguished \nSenator from Rhode Island, is one of the cosponsors and is a great \naddition to our committee as well. So I\n\n[[Page S159]]\n\nthank the chair for all of her leadership.\n  What I think Senator Feinstein has touched upon, and very \nthoughtfully, is, if you share our view that it is possible to fight \nterrorism ferociously without compromising American laws or American \nvalues, you must, as Senator Feinstein has correctly stated, you must \nbe smarter in order to strike that balance in a dangerous world.\n  Regrettably, this administration has not been willing to show this \nsort of wisdom. All too often for the last 8 years the administration \nhas engaged in complicated legal gymnastics to justify antiterrorism \nprograms that, in my view, are of questionable effectiveness, \nquestionable legality. Today, the incoming chair of our committee, \nSenator Feinstein, is helping us with this important legislation. The \nLawful Interrogation and Detention Act is helping us to right the \nbalance and show the country that with smart antiterrorism policies we \ncan effectively fight the war against terrorism and at the same time \nrestore our moral authority and protect our values.\n  I will tell you, based on the information I have seen again and \nagain, and what we are told by military leaders, these coercive \ntechniques simply are not effective. General Petraeus, for example, has \ndiscussed with respect to soldiers in Iraq, that coercive techniques \nmay be usable in terms of forcing someone to talk, but that does not \nnecessarily mean the person will say something that protects American \nsecurity.\n  Senator McCain, our distinguished colleague from Arizona, has made \nmuch of the same point. Certainly, the use of these techniques in a \nnumber of instances can be detrimental to our national security. \nCertainly, the techniques have discouraged allies in the past from \ncooperating with us and, frankly, in my view, they serve as something \nof a recruiting poster for our enemies.\n  One of the areas I hope to pursue in the future, not as part of this \nlegislation but working with our incoming chair, working with our \nranking minority member, Senator Bond, and the administration of the \nPresident-elect, is I hope to be able to declassify a significant \nportion of the history of this program, particularly the legal \nunderpinnings of this program, so the American people will actually be \nable to see that much of what has been done in the last 8 years simply \nis not as effective in the war against terrorism as the American people \ndeserve.\n  Certainly, it is important to recognize that when Americans are \ncaptured abroad in the future, international standards of prisoner \ntreatment, particularly the Geneva Convention, will sometimes be the \nonly shield they have. These standards have evolved from hopeful ideals \ninto widely observed rules of conduct, partly because the most powerful \ncountry on Earth has led by example.\n  Anytime our Government attempts to dodge these standards, it weakens \nthem, and it increases the risk of abuse for our prisoners. The fact \nthat our worst enemies have horrifying and barbaric methods for dealing \nwith prisoners does not, in my view, make these methods useful or \nlegitimate.\n  I am confident that President-elect Obama is not going to engage in \nmany of the practices that we have seen in the last 8 years. But I \ncertainly want to pass legislation that codifies these important \nprinciples and makes sure that none of his future successors engage in \nthese practices. That means you have to make the laws plain; you have \nto make them strong. This legislation will make them plainer and \nstronger than they are today. I would submit that is essentially what \nSenator Feinstein has been working for all these past years.\n  I want to mention a couple of the other provisions. I was struck by \nSenator Feinstein's comment with respect to the use of contractor \ninterrogators at the CIA. As Senator Feinstein noted, we do not get to \nhave a lot of open sessions in our Intelligence Committee. That is for \nobvious reasons; we are dealing with classified material. But I have \nfelt, as Senator Feinstein, very strongly about this topic and actually \nraised this concern with Admiral McConnell at his confirmation hearing \nto head our intelligence service. I remain concerned about this issue, \nand that provision in the Feinstein legislation is especially \nimportant, in my view, because interrogators must be accountable. Under \nthe clear language with respect to these interrogators in the Feinstein \nlegislation, that will be the case.\n  Finally, let me comment on the provision that closes the prison at \nGuantanamo. During the past 8 years, I was concerned about the \npotential impact of this legislation and this provision. I was \nconcerned at that point because it was not clear to me that President \nBush had a competent plan for dealing with all of the prisoners \ncurrently held there.\n  I was concerned that closing Guantanamo could simply lead to a \nmassive upswing in extraordinary rendition. Fortunately, President-\nelect Obama is working on a different strategy for dealing with those \nprisoners at Guantanamo, so I no longer have the same concern that \nunder his administration we would simply have prisoners handed over to \nforeign countries that would torture them. I have long believed that if \nyou looked at the intent of the Bush administration in this area, they \nsought to create a prison at Guantanamo Bay that would be under U.S. \ncontrol but beyond the reach of U.S. law. Now the Supreme Court has \ndefinitively ruled that constitutional protections apply to people at \nGuantanamo Bay. So I would hope that even the prison's strongest \nadvocates would say it serves no useful purpose.\n  The combination of the clear language in the Feinstein legislation we \ndiscuss today and that President-elect Obama is looking at a \ncomprehensive plan for dealing with the prisoners at Guantanamo leaves \nme with a reassurance that there is a chance to close this prison and \ndo it in a responsible fashion that will protect America's national \nsecurity interests.\n  There are four of us who are sponsoring this legislation. We have \nsought for many months to get these issues of interrogation and \nGuantanamo right. We have consistently tried to pursue this in a \nbipartisan fashion. We are going to continue to do so in this session.\n  I believe, under the leadership of our incoming chair, it is going to \nbe possible to get our Nation's counterterrorism program back on a firm \nlegal and operational footing and prevent the mistakes of the past from \nbeing repeated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator. We are both \nwesterners. We did sit together for about 8 years on the committee. As \nsuch, I have had a chance to discuss a great deal about this topic. It \nis a matter of very deep conscience and a sense of values of everything \nthis Nation stands for, the thing that sets us apart from many other \ncountries who pick people up and do horrible things to them. We don't \ndo that. We have always had such pride in that. The Senator hit a nail \non the head. People may talk, but they can say anything they want. It \nis not necessarily valuable. It is not necessarily actionable \nintelligence. Sometimes it might be. But there are other ways of doing \nthis and not sacrificing the values we hold dear. The nearest tool to \nachieve that is the Army Field Manual.\n  It has been great for me to work with the Senator from Oregon, and I \nlook forward to working with him in the future. I thank him very much.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to speak for such time as I may consume in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I come to the floor today to offer my support for S. 147, the Lawful \nInterrogation and Detention Act, which my very distinguished \ncolleagues, Senator Feinstein of California and Senator Wyden of \nOregon, have just spoken about.\n\n[[Page S160]]\n\n  This bill would do three very important things. The first is force \nthe closing of the interrogation and detention activities at the \nGuantanamo Base. I have supported previous legislation that would do \nthis. I enthusiastically support this legislation to do it.\n  The Bush administration has created a pretty significant mess with \nthe activities down at Guantanamo. Unfortunately, some things you can \nsnarl up so tightly that it becomes very difficult to unsnarl them, and \nI am afraid that is exactly the situation with Guantanamo. It will be \ndifficult to unsnarl. It is a real challenge for the incoming \nadministration. But it is vital that we do so because it has become a \nsymbol to the rest of the world of America's departure from our core \nprinciples. So I am enthusiastically in support of that provision.\n  Another provision would restrict our interrogation activities to \nthose techniques that are permitted under the Army Field Manual. In \neffect, it would end our embrace of enhanced interrogation techniques--\nindeed, torture.\n  In support of this notion, I would cite GEN David Petraeus, the \nCommander of the Multi-National Force in Iraq in 2007, who at the time \nwrote a letter to all U.S. military forces in Iraq. In that letter, he \nsaid this:\n\n       Some may argue that we would be more effective if we \n     sanctioned torture or other expedient methods to obtain \n     information from the enemy. They would be wrong. Beyond the \n     basic fact that such actions are illegal, history shows that \n     they also are frequently neither useful nor necessary. \n     Certainly, extreme physical action can make someone ``talk;'' \n     however, what the individual says may be of questionable \n     value. In fact, our experience in applying the interrogation \n     standards laid out in the Army Field Manual . . . shows that \n     the techniques in the manual work effectively and humanely in \n     eliciting information from detainees.\n\n  We have heard arguments that, well, you can't really rely on military \ninterrogators. They don't really know what they are doing. They are \namateurish. They need the limitations of the Army Field Manual. By \ncontrast, the interrogators of the CIA and of our intelligence \ncommunity are experts and much more sophisticated and adept and don't \nneed to have the Army Field Manual restricting them, as if it is some \nsort of a learner's permit for interrogation.\n  If you look at the facts, the reverse is actually true. It is the \nmilitary that has officers with literally decades of experience \ninterrogating enemy prisoners, interrogating enemy prisoners in \nsituations where their fellow soldiers' lives are on the line, where \nmen and women will die or live because of the information they are able \nto elicit. Notwithstanding those high stakes, they live by the terms of \nthe Army Field Manual. By contrast, we know that the CIA really did not \nknow much about interrogations, that when they got into the business, \nthey had to learn about it. The place they chose to learn was from the \nSERE Program, a program designed to train American soldiers, airmen, \nsailors and marines who are likely to be captured by enemies that \nengage in torture how to be prepared for that, how to withstand it. So \nfor training purposes, to prepare them for these ordeals, they used the \ninterrogation techniques of despot, tyrant nations--North Korea, \nCommunist China, Soviet Russia. For some reason, that was where our \nintelligence community thought it needed to go for expertise in how you \ninterrogate prisoners, never minding the fact that the purpose of those \ndespot regimes was not to interrogate prisoners and get actionable \nintelligence information; it was to torture those prisoners so they \nwould say things and produce propaganda for those tyrant regimes.\n  So the notion that the military is a bunch of amateurs in \nintelligence who need the constraint of the Army Field Manual to \nprevent them from making amateur errors and the CIA is a bunch of \nclever, crafty experts who can operate at a graduate level for all of \nthis is absolutely backward.\n  The damage that has been done to our country by this decision is, in \nmy opinion, incalculable. When I think of the choice that was made to \ngo this road, I am reminded of a phrase of Winston Churchill's. He \ndescribes a bad and dangerous decision that leads to worsening \nconsequences in this way. He describes it as going down ``the stairway \nwhich leads to a dark gulf. It is a fine broad stairway at the \nbeginning, but after a bit the carpet ends. A little farther on, there \nare only flagstones, and a little farther on still these break beneath \nyour feet.'' That is where we stand now, in this dark, descending \nstairway, with flagstones crumbling beneath our feet and the world \nlooking on in horror at our departure from our core principles. I \nbelieve this legislation will help turn us back away from that dark and \ndescending stairway, back into the light of our own best principles and \nthe good will of our fellow nations.\n  America has not only suffered grievous and lasting harm from this \nadministration's embrace of torture but also from this administration's \nembrace of torture's handmaiden. Torture's handmaiden, of course, is \nsecret detention.\n  The bill Senator Feinstein and Senator Wyden are proposing would \nrequire the International Committee for the Red Cross to have access to \nany prisoners held by the intelligence agencies. The ICRC has been \nvisiting detainees in connection with armed conflict since 1915, nearly \na century. In 2007, the ICRC visited over half a million detainees in \n77 different countries to ensure respect for their life, dignity, and \nfundamental right to judicial guarantees. All of those notions are \nenshrined in our own Constitution. They are our national bedrock.\n  Thirty-eight retired military leaders, distinguished generals and \nadmirals, have concluded that the ICRC access to prisoners held by our \nGovernment is a ``critical measure to ensure continuing respect for the \nnorm that [ICRC] access must be provided to all captives in wartime.'' \nThis letter comes from battlefield warriors and intelligence officers \nwho participated in every major American conflict from World War II \nuntil today. One of them, less than 3 years ago, was a member of our \nJoint Chiefs of Staff. They understand that this is important, and they \nunderstand why.\n  If we go down the corridors of history and survey the evil practices \nof tyrant regimes, we find one of their most notorious methods of \ncoercion and subjugation is holding prisoners secretly and \nincommunicado. From the oubliettes of the Bourbon Kings of France to \nCalcutta's Black Hole, from the Gestapo's secret prisons to the Soviet \ngulags, from medieval dungeons to the bamboo cages of the Cambodian \nkilling fields, secret and anonymous imprisonment has always been the \nhallmark of the despot. And now the Bush administration has stamped \nAmerica with this shameful mark.\n  Our military leaders who are in the best position to judge are \npushing back and saying ``enough.'' Why do they do that? I think they \ndo that because they are not beguiled by the force of arms. They live \nwith the likelihood of armed conflict, of injuries, of fatalities. They \nunderstand that we engage in that to defend principles, and to give \naway those principles without a shot fired accomplishes the very harm \nthat we have a military, that we have intelligence services to protect \nus from.\n  What is it, we ask ourselves, that makes our country great? Whence \ncometh our strength? For centuries, America has been called a ``shining \ncity on a hill.'' We are a lamp in the darkness to other nations. One \nof our greatest Senators, our friend Ted Kennedy, on the occasion of I \nbelieve his 15,000th vote in this institution said America is not a \nland, it is a promise. Torture, anonymous detention, and secret cells \nbreak that promise, extinguish that lamp, and darken that city on a \nhill.\n  Our strength as Americans comes from the fact that we stand for \nsomething. Our strength comes from the aspirations of millions of \npeople around the globe who want to be like us, who want their country \nto be like ours, who want to believe in what we believe in. Our \nstrength comes when we embody the hopes and dreams of mankind. Our \nstrength comes, as President Clinton said, not from the example of our \npower but from the power of our example.\n  I believe Senator Feinstein's legislation will restore across this \ndarkening world the power of America's example, turn us back from that \ndark and descending stairway, and restore us to the place where America \nbelongs as an ideal and an example for other nations. I appreciate \nSenator Feinstein's hard work in putting this legislation together. I \nappreciate the support of Senator Wyden.\n\n[[Page S161]]\n\n  Many months ago, I offered the first amendment in the Intelligence \nCommittee that would apply the Army Field Manual to interrogation \ntechniques used by our intelligence agencies, and Senator Feinstein was \nkind enough to cosponsor that amendment. We worked together in \nconference to get that amendment passed into legislation that was \nsubsequently vetoed. I submitted the International Committee of the Red \nCross access provision last year.\n  I cannot find words strong enough to explain the strength of my view \nabout the things we sacrifice for whatever small, short-term, tactical \nintelligence advantage we may achieve from torture and secret cells, \nassuming there even are any. Most intelligence professionals believe \nthat what you get from torture is people who will say anything to get \naway from the pain. But let's assume there is some value to it for the \nsake of argument. I cannot find words strong enough to explain how \noverwhelmed that small tactical value is by the loss of our reputation \nand our standing and the confidence and trust of our friends and allies \nwhen we engage in behaviors that have been associated with despots and \ntyrants and the worst of history's regimes.\n  Let's put this behind us. Let's support this bill. As we go through \nthis time of transition in American Government, let's also go through a \ntime of transition in America's reputation in the world.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell).

Madam President, I want to join my colleagues today in \nhonoring the extraordinary service and accomplishments of the senior \nSenator from West Virginia, the Honorable Robert C. Byrd. It was \nexactly 50 years ago today, on January 7, 1958, that he was first sworn \ninto the Senate. Senator Byrd is the longest serving Senator in U.S. \nhistory, and he truly is a living legend in this institution that he \nloves so dearly and defends so fiercely.\n  The Almanac of American Politics says: Robert Byrd ``may come closer \nto the kind of Senator the Founding Fathers had in mind than any \nother.''\n  I couldn't agree more. He is a person of wise and mature judgment, a \npatriot with a deep love of his country. He is passionately loyal to \nthe Constitution and a fierce defender of the role and prerogatives of \nCongress and the Senate in particular.\n  Senator Byrd was once asked how many Presidents he had served under. \nHe answered that he had not served under any President, that he had \nserved with 10 Presidents as a proud member of a separate and coequal \nbranch of Government. During his five decades in this body, Senator \nByrd has witnessed many changes our country has gone through. Think \nabout it. Our population since 1958 has grown by 125 million people. \nThere have been new technologies.\n  I was thinking about this. In 1958, I graduated from high school in \nDes Moines, IA. The year before the Russians had launched Sputnik, and \nwe were trying to catch up. We had not established ourselves in space. \nI was out of high school that summer, getting ready to go to college. I \nfound a job working on this new construction project called the \ninterstate highway system which was just beginning at that time. Jet \nair travel was just starting. I remember my first flight. The airplane \nwas propeller driven. We didn't have jet aircraft. There were some in \nthe military, but it hadn't started for commercial air travel at that \ntime. We had no computers, no cell phones, and nine out of ten TV sets \nwere black and white. That was 1958, the year Robert Byrd came to the \nSenate. There have been many changes that have happened over the last \n50 years.\n  Across this half century of rapid change, there has been one \nconstant--Senator Byrd's tireless service to this country, his passion \nfor helping bring new opportunities to the people of West Virginia, and \nhis dedication to this institution, the Senate of the United States.\n  Senator Byrd is a person of many accomplishments and a rich legacy. \nBut above all, I will mention his commitment to improving public \neducation and expanding access to higher education, especially for kids \nfrom poorer families. As many of my colleagues know, Robert C. Byrd was \nraised in the hardscrabble coalfields of southern West Virginia. That \nis one thing he and I have always talked about. My father was a coal \nminer also in the State of Iowa. His family was poor but rich in values \nand faith. His parents nurtured in Robert Byrd a lifelong passion for \neducation and learning. He was valedictorian of his high school class \nbut too poor to go to college right away. Those were the days before \nPell grants and Byrd scholarships. So he worked as a welder in a \nshipyard, later as a butcher in a coal company town. It took him 12 \nyears to save enough money to start college. He was a U.S. Senator when \nhe earned his law degree.\n  No other Member of Congress before or since has started and completed \nlaw school while serving in the Congress. But degrees don't begin to \ntell the story of the education of Robert C. Byrd. He is the ultimate \nlifetime learner. It is as though for the last 50 years he has been \nenrolled in the Robert C. Byrd school of continuing education. You \nwon't get a better, more thorough education at any school, Harvard, \nYale, or anywhere else.\n  Senator Byrd's erudition has borne fruit in no less than nine books \nhe has written and published over the last two decades. He literally \nwrote the book on the Senate, a masterful four-volume history of the \ninstitution that has become a classic. What my colleagues may not know \nis that he also authored a highly respected history of the Roman \nSenate. For those of us who have been here--in my case 24 years--we \nhave listened, either here on the floor or later when we got \ntelevision, on closed circuit in our offices, to the many speeches \nRobert Byrd gave about the Roman Senate, wonderful descriptions of the \nRoman Senate and how it operated. We could hear how he weaved in the \noperations of our own Senate. There are some who think Robert C. Byrd \nactually served in the Roman Senate. But that part of the Byrd legend I \ncan absolutely say is not true.\n  I have talked at length about Senator Byrd's education because it \nexplains why he is so passionate about ensuring that every American has \naccess to quality public education, both K-12 and higher. The one thing \nSenator Byrd and I have in common is our fathers were coal miners with \nvery little formal education. Coming from a poor background, Senator \nByrd believes, as do I, that a cardinal responsibility of Government is \nto provide a ladder of opportunity so that everyone, no matter how \nhumble their background, has a shot at the American dream. I said \nladder of opportunity; I didn't say an escalator. On an escalator, you \nget a free ride. You get on and you get a free ride. But with a ladder \nof opportunity, you still have to exert energy and effort and \nresponsibility to get to the top. But with that ladder there have to be \nrungs so you can actually climb.\n  The most important rungs on that ladder of opportunity involve \neducation, early childhood education, Head Start programs, quality K-12 \npublic schools, access to college and other forms of higher education. \nDuring my 24 years in the Senate, no one has fought harder for public \neducation than Senator Robert Byrd. As chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, he has been the champion of education at every turn, \nfighting to reduce class size, improving teacher training, bringing new \ntechnologies into the classroom, boosting access to higher education.\n  In 1985, my first year in the Senate, he created the only national \nmerit based college scholarship program funded through the U.S. \nDepartment of Education. Congress later named them in his honor. \nOriginally, the Byrd scholarships consisted of a 1-year $1,500 award to \noutstanding students. Today, Byrd scholarships provide grants of up to \n$6,000 over 4 years. How many kids\n\n[[Page S162]]\n\nof meager means, coming from low-income families but very bright, very \ncapable, have received these Byrd scholarships which got them through \ncollege.\n  Senator Byrd has also been outspoken in challenging the current \nadministration for failing to keep its commitments under the No Child \nLeft Behind Act. To the last fiscal year, No Child Left Behind has been \nunderfunded since 2002, when it first came into existence. It has been \nunderfunded by over $70 billion.\n  Think what that would mean for our local school systems in America \nhad we kept our commitment to funding No Child Left Behind. But I will \ntell you this: It would have been a lot worse if Senator Byrd had not \nbeen here on our Appropriations Committee, either as chairman or \nranking member, sponsoring the key amendments to boost the funding \nabove what the Bush administration had proposed.\n  Senator Byrd is a great student of literature, and I am sure he knows \n``The Canterbury Tales''--probably a lot of it by heart, as he knows a \nlot of things by heart, by memory. Describing the Clerk of Oxford, \nChaucer might just as well have been describing Robert C. Byrd. Here is \nwhat Chaucer said about the Clerk of Oxford:\n\n       Filled with moral virtue was his speech; And gladly would \n     he learn and gladly teach.\n\n  Madam President, Senator Byrd is a great Senator, a great American, a \ngreat friend. He has both written our Nation's history and left his \nmark on it.\n  It has been an honor to serve both in the Senate and on his Committee \nof Appropriations with Senator Byrd for the last 24 years. The good \npeople of Iowa have now reelected me, so I will be here for another \nterm. I look forward to serving with Senator Byrd in this body and on \nthe Appropriations Committee for many years to come.\n  So today on this historic anniversary, we honor his service, we \nexpress our respect and our love for this very remarkable Senator, \nRobert C. Byrd, from the great State of West Virginia.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/07/senate-section/article/S162-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S162-S163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    OMNIBUS PUBLIC LAND MANAGEMENT ACT OF 2009 RULE XLIV COMPLIANCE\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, pursuant to rule XLIV of the Standing \nRules of the Senate, I hereby certify that, to the best of my knowledge \nand belief, the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 does not \ncontain any limited tax benefits, limited tariff benefits, or \ncongressionally directed spending items, as those terms are defined in \nrule XLIV.\n  Rule XLIV broadly defines the term ``congressionally directed \nspending item'' to include `` a provision . . . included primarily at \nthe request of a Senator . . . authorizing . . . a specific amount of \ndiscretionary budget authority . . . for . . . expenditure with or to \nan entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or Congressional \ndistrict, other than through a statutory or administrative formula-\ndriven or competitive award process.''\n  The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009 is a collection of \nover 150 public land bills that were reported from the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources during the 110th Congress, for which we \nhave not been able to get unanimous consent to take up and pass during \nthe 110th Congress. I have included them in the Omnibus Public Land \nManagement Act of 2009 to facilitate their early consideration in the \nnew Congress, and not ``primarily at the request of a Senator.''\n  Nevertheless, even though no Senator has specifically requested me to \ninclude a congressionally directed spending item in the Omnibus Public \nLand Management Act of 2009, in the interest of furthering the \ntransparency and accountability of the legislative process, I have \nposted on the Web site of the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \na complete list of all provisions in the Omnibus Public Land Management \nAct of 2009 that authorize a specific amount of spending authority that \nis targeted to a specific State or locality, other than through a \nstatutory or administrative formula-driven or competitive award \nprocess. The list includes the name of the principal sponsors of the \nSenate bills in the 110th Congress that have been incorporated in the \nOmnibus Public Land Management Act.\n  In addition, I have added several other non-public-land measures from \nthe 110th Congress at the request of the majority leader. Most of these \nprovisions were included in the Advancing America's Priorities Act--S. \n3297--in the 110th Congress. They include: the Christopher and Dana \nReeve Paralysis Act, subtitle B of title I of S. 3297; four parts of \nsubtitle B, relating to oceans, of title V of S. 3297; and title VII of \nS. 3297, relating to the authorization of a greenhouse facility for the \nSmithsonian Institution. These provisions were determined not to \nconstitute ``congressionally directed spending items'' in the Advancing \nAmercia's Priorities Act. See 153 Cong. Rec. S7509-7510, July 26, 2008.\n  In addition, I have added the Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation \nProgram Act, H.R. 1907 in the 110th Congress, and the Smithsonian \nInstitution Facilities Authorization Act of 2008, H.R. 6627 in the \n110th Congress, at the request of the majority leader. The grant \nprogram established under Coastal and Estuarine Land Conservation \nProgram Act, section 12507 in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act, \ndoes not constitute a congressionally directed spending item because \nthe funds are to be allocated through a competitive grant process. The \nauthorizations in the Smithsonian Institution Facilities Authorization \nAct, sections 15101 and 15102 of the Omnibus Public Land Management \nAct, do not appear to constitute congressionally directed spending \nitems because they were requested by the Board of Regents of the \nSmithsonian Institution, and because they originated in the House of \nRepresentatives, where the committees of jurisdiction determined they \ndid not constitute congressional earmarks. See H. Rept. 110-842, part \n1, at 5, 2008, Committee on House Administration, and H. Rept. 110-282, \npart 2, at 4, 2008, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.\n  Finally, I have added the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of the Duck Valley \nReservation Water Rights Settlement Act, H.R. 5293 in the 110th \nCongress, at the request of the majority leader. This act ratifies a \nwater rights settlement among the Shoshone-Paiute Tribes of the Duck \nValley Reservation, individual water users, and the State of Nevada. \nSection 8 of H.R. 5293, section 10807 of the Omnibus Public Land \nManagement Act, creates two trust funds to settle the legal claims of \nthe Shoshone-Paiute Tribes against the United States for compromising \ntribal water rights and failing to maintain the Duck Valley Indian \nIrrigation Project. They do not appear to constitute congressionally \ndirected spending items because they were included to settle pending \nlegal claims rather than ``primarily at the request of a Senator,'' and \nbecause they originated in the House of Representatives, where the \ncommittee of jurisdiction determined that they did not constitute \ncongressional earmarks. See H. Rept. 110-815 at 11, 2008, Committee on \nNatural Resources.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the list be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009--S. 22\n\n       Provisions in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of \n     2009 authorizing appropriations in a specific amount for \n     expenditure with or to an entity or targeted to a specific \n     State, locality, or congressional district, other than \n     through a statutory or administrative formula-driven or \n     competitive award process:\n\n[[Page S163]]\n\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                                                           Principal sponsor of\n              Section                     Program or entity                State           Senate bill in 110th\n                                                                                           Cong.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday expenses \nbut also have suggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can \ndo now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond \ntoday. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for your newsletter regarding the current problem \n     of gasoline prices. I am a widow living on Social Security \n     income. My car is a 1981 Volvo. Driving my car has almost \n     come to a standstill. I drive only for necessities. I feel \n     like a bear hibernating over the winter. The idea of buying a \n     new car with better mileage is out of the question for me.\n       As to the things our Nation should be doing--these include \n     drilling for oil wherever available, using oil shale, \n     developing nuclear power, windmills, biofuels. Using corn for \n     ethanol is the craziest idea of all. The commodities market \n     is hitting new highs almost daily. With the floods in Iowa, \n     we cannot afford to use corn for oil. The animals that need \n     corn for food are affecting our prices in the grocery store. \n     Get rid of regulations that cause energy companies to take \n     years to develop energy or cause no action because of the red \n     tape of government.\n       Blaming the oil companies for so-called obscene profits is \n     nonsense. Taxes on gasoline are more than profits per gallon \n     of gas that the oil companies collect. Exxon has even said \n     that they are closing some stations because of non profit. It \n     is sad that many do not understand the basics of economics.\n       The American public has spoken. Stop listening to the \n     environmentalists. Because there has been no foresight, we \n     are suffering now for the lack of action by those in the past \n     who we elected to represent us. Both parties are responsible, \n     but blaming does not get the job done.\n       It is embarrassing to read that France has developed their \n     nuclear power while we just sit and talk about it. It is sad \n     knowing that foreign countries are acquiring leases to drill \n     for oil in our backyard, while we just sit and watch what is \n     going on in the Gulf of Mexico and grumble about it. It is \n     humiliating to hear those who say we are becoming a third \n     world nation. Americans are known for their innovation.\n       Gasoline prices are affecting food prices, small businesses \n     and the cost of all goods and services. Independent truckers \n     are suffering. We rely on them for delivery of our food and \n     goods to market. If their numbers decrease because of their \n     cost of doing business, it will cause an additional increase \n     in prices or possibly the disappearance of some goods. I do \n     not think we want that to happen to our food supplies.\n       The time has come to act. Now is the time. We must not \n     waste time. The public is begging for some common sense to \n     solve these problems. Egos must be ignored lest we suffer \n     more. Corporate America knows how to solve these problems. Do \n     not hinder them any more with government red tape.\n     LaVergne, Hayden.\n                                  ____\n\n       Our family lives about 30 miles from Idaho Falls where we \n     do most of our business. My daughter and I also drive about \n     32 miles each way to our places of work so we are impacted \n     every day. Our best guess is that we are spending about $400 \n     per month more now than we did when gas was $2 per gallon. So \n     far our response has been to curtail vacation traveling and \n     reduce other unnecessary purchases.\n       Solutions (in order of preference):\n       1. Pursue increased domestic oil drilling including off-\n     shore and ANWR and encourage construction of more refineries. \n     I believe environmental concerns have been greatly \n     exaggerated and need to be evaluated based on their cost \n     effectiveness relative to their impact on the cost of living \n     versus risk to our quality of life.\n       2. Pursue alternative energy sources only as far they are \n     cost-effective. If bio-fuels need to be subsidized in order \n     to maintain production, they are obviously not cost-\n     effective.\n       3. Pursue nuclear power generation (we are 20 years \n     behind). There is also potential for hydrogen as a by-product \n     that could be used as an alternative to gasoline. I have \n     doubts about wind generation as a cost-effective alternative \n     energy source, and I personally do not care for it is adverse \n     effect on the natural beauty of Idaho's landscapes.\n       4. Pursue improved coal-fired electrical generation. I also \n     have serious concerns regarding the apparent race to reduce \n     CO2 emissions at any cost when there is so little \n     real evidence that proves a correlation with global warming \n     (also unverified).\n       5. Encourage more mass transit systems in our larger cities \n     and offer incentives for their use. I was in San Diego, \n     California last week and the traffic was absolutely mind-\n     boggling.\n       6. Encourage better individual planning and carpooling \n     across the nation. There are way too many of us making \n     unnecessary trips to the store and letting our kids drive to \n     school every day when we have buses making the same trip, but \n     I suppose this will\n\n[[Page S164]]\n\n     take care of itself eventually when the price of gas gets to \n     around $6 per gallon.\n       Thanks for asking and thanks for your service to Idaho,\n     Wade, Hamer.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are an independent pharmacy and offer free delivery \n     service to our customers. Medicare, Medicaid, uninsured and \n     indigent customers are all included. We are seriously \n     considering charging for this service or eliminating it all \n     together due to excessively high fuel prices.\n       Along with fuel cost, Medicare issues, such as slow pay and \n     low pay, are making it really difficult to stay in business. \n     We have no control over our reimbursement prices and are told \n     to take it or leave it. All of these price increases must be \n     passed on to the consumer somehow if we are to survive. Drug \n     companies are raising prices too.\n       Thanks for asking for input.\n     Kent, Twin Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       We appreciate your concern about the rising costs of \n     energy. As you say in Idaho we live quite a distance from \n     most of the things we do. So the rising cost of gas has made \n     a big impact on what we spend for transportation. We would \n     encourage you to do whatever is necessary to make the changes \n     in the current laws to allow exploration and drilling for oil \n     including oil shale process. We have billions of gallons that \n     cannot be tapped because of all the government red tape. We \n     have supported the foreign suppliers long enough. Many of \n     them are supporting terrorists who are enemies to us and our \n     way of life. It is way passed time Congress became \n     accountable for the restrictions they have placed on \n     exploration and oil production. Do all you can to help this \n     situation.\n     Boyd and LaDene, Ucon.\n                                  ____\n\n       While the rise in petroleum prices is certainly a hardship \n     to many people in Idaho, I do not know what else would have \n     finally prompted a serious discussion about alternate energy \n     sources and about seriously conserving energy. I usually ride \n     a bicycle to work and drive an 18-year-old Honda Civic, which \n     gets 44 mpg on the highway. If the entire U.S. auto fleet got \n     similar mileage, I believe we could drastically cut our oil \n     imports. The technology for more fuel efficient vehicles has \n     been around for quite a while--that technology has not been \n     encouraged and is currently not utilized. Here is an excerpt \n     from Miller's Living in the Environment (8th edition) \n     textbook written 10 years ago: ``Since 1985 at least 10 \n     companies including Volvo, Volkswagon, Renault, Peugeot, \n     Honda, Mazda, Toyota and General Motors have had peppy \n     prototype cars that meet or exceed current safety and \n     pollution standards with fuel efficiencies of 67 to 138 mpg. \n     If they were mass produced their slightly higher costs would \n     be more than offset by their fuel savings . . . We can have \n     roomy, peppy, safe, gas sippers, but only if consumers begin \n     demanding them and buying them. (p 452).''\n       With encouragement from the government, we could do even \n     better than this. However, we do not seem to change our \n     wasteful energy behavior because it is logical or because it \n     harms the environment. We do it because we have to and cannot \n     afford to do otherwise. Only economic pressure will force us \n     to let go of our addiction to driving 2-3 ton SUVs, usually \n     with only one person inside, commuting 20 miles to work and 1 \n     mile to the store when walking or biking would do. People in \n     Europe drive smaller cars and use much less oil per capita--\n     but they have been paying $5 or more per gallon for a long \n     time. Drilling more holes in the ground to extract the \n     remaining reserves of oil in the U.S. faster, would only \n     serve to delay the change in consumption of petroleum that we \n     all must make. Subsidizing alternative energy development \n     makes good sense. Solar, wind, and biofuels, along with \n     conservation should receive highest priority. Nuclear power \n     would seem to be the best ``bridging'' source of energy--if \n     it were not for the problem of handling wastes. You might \n     want to look at the International Society of Doctors for the \n     Environment's resolution on nuclear energy, March 2007 \n     (http://201.116.215.170/isde.org). Further research on \n     handling nuclear waste should be encouraged before \n     constructing more nuclear power plants. Had we put \n     significant effort and resources on alternate energy during \n     the past 20 years, the adjustment to higher oil prices now \n     would not have been so painful. We will need to use a wide \n     variety of energy sources to replace the declining and \n     increasingly expensive petroleum. People will adjust to the \n     higher prices of gasoline by car pooling, taking public \n     transportation, moving closer to work, buying more fuel \n     efficient vehicles, making less needless trips, and many \n     other ways. I recognize that this is not the kind of personal \n     story about how high oil prices are hurting me, but I thought \n     you should be aware of a different view of the oil price \n     crisis.\n       Thank for asking for input.\n     Roger.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I live in Salmon. He will be 69 June 22nd; I \n     am 70. He is a recovering heart patient; I am a declining \n     COPD patient. We are on a fixed income (Social Security) and \n     are both under the care of specialists, who practice in \n     Missoula, Montana, 170 miles away. We cancelled our \n     appointments last month with our doctors because we simply do \n     not have the money for gas. It is a sad state of affairs when \n     a person cannot afford to visit their physician because gas \n     is (as of today here in Salmon) $4.25. I think it is time to \n     start drilling. Perhaps even open some of our reserves.\n       Thank you for offering this site for folks like us to share \n     the hardship this is causing not only in our lives but \n     everyone in our community.\n     Connie.\n                                  ____\n\n       One of the ways that my husband and I are coping with the \n     increasing gasoline prices is that my husband is riding his \n     motorcycle to work to reduce gasoline consumption. What I do \n     not like about this situation is that it increases his \n     chances for a fatal accident while commuting because of the \n     increased danger of not being seen by the numerous other \n     drivers in a high traffic time.\n       We should be using our own domestic resources for oil in \n     all ways possible (drilling and shale) and we should build \n     nuclear power plants. France is a good model for very safe \n     and productive nuclear resources.\n     Debra, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for asking us everyday Idahoans how high fuel \n     prices are affecting us on a daily basis. My husband and I \n     were just discussing this two days ago, about how and where \n     we can cut down in order to shift the dollars to gasoline. \n     First off, we are retired and on a fixed income; so that \n     means when the price of one thing goes up, another thing will \n     have to go down. We spend an average of $100 a month on gas. \n     That, I know, is small compared to other Idahoans, and that \n     is because we do not have to drive to work.\n       Since gas has doubled in one year, we have to come up with \n     another $100 a month to cover the increase. First, we ended \n     our gym membership, which was costing $45 a month. Well, that \n     is as far as we got. We do not know what else to cut down on. \n     So we are in the hole $65 monthly. I am going to see if I can \n     cut down on food, as I have seen the prices of food going up, \n     too. I know my electric bill, water bill, and gas bill will \n     be going up, too. It is very scary for us.\n       Other things we are doing is grouping our trips together. \n     This does offer a challenge due to logistics and time. And \n     the impact of this cannot be calculated by any means, so I do \n     not know what the effect of that will be.\n       Other things we are trying is not eating fast food anymore. \n     This is upsetting especially to me, because sometimes I just \n     do not have the energy or the desire to cook. Going to a fast \n     food was my respite.\n       We also are not planning to make any day trips to other \n     cities in Idaho anymore. We are new residents of Idaho, and \n     wanted to explore its beauty this summer, when the weather \n     was warmer. Last year, we were able to drive to Bogus Basin, \n     Silver City, McCall, and Tamarack, and also explore the Boise \n     National Forest. After all, is not that what retirement is \n     supposed to be? However, we stopped talking about those \n     trips. We even opted not to go to the next city over, Eagle, \n     to experience our first Eagle Days fair, due to the drive.\n       In other words, Senator, our driving today has been limited \n     to just essential places, such as the grocery store and \n     taking our Labradors to the nearby creek for a swim, which is \n     the highlight of their day and we just cannot take that away \n     from them.\n       We were planning on buying life insurance for my husband, \n     who is 63 and 13 years older than I am. Currently he has no \n     life insurance. We are newlyweds (just 1 year), and I am \n     always worried about what will happen to me when he dies. We \n     have bills to pay, and the funeral costs alone average \n     $7,000. After doing research comparisons, the best insurance \n     we could get was $125 a month for just $100,000 of life \n     insurance. We wanted to buy more insurance, but at $125 a \n     month, that was all we can afford. Now, even that is on hold. \n     That presents a daily worry for me, as my husband is active \n     and can get hurt anytime.\n       We must open up America for the oil companies to dig. I am \n     so upset with the current EPA guidelines, which seem to be \n     more concerned about protecting animals (like the caribou and \n     the polar bear) than of the survival of the human race, \n     especially the elderly like my husband and myself. Quality of \n     life? There is none anymore, but the caribou and the polar \n     bears have a great quality of life, do not they? I remember \n     my early Bible days when in Genesis, God told Adam, ``All \n     this is yours for your use'' (paraphrasing). Man is the \n     highest earth form yesterday, today, and always will be. I \n     truly believe that everything around us is meant to be used \n     to our advantage, with minimum and common sense protection.\n       I would also like to see a nuclear plant in Idaho. We have \n     so much land here, with the nearest civilization miles away. \n     Nuclear plants are safe. I know that. If having a nuclear \n     plant here in Idaho will help Idahoans with lower energy \n     costs, then that is what I want. My husband agrees, too. If \n     the other states are too liberal or too scared to put one up, \n     then that is their problem. Right now, my concern is for me, \n     my husband, and Idaho.\n       Thank you so much for letting me speak. I really appreciate \n     that. In my last state, that is unheard of. That is one of \n     the reasons I love living in Idaho.\n     Stella, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       A few years ago when we had another crisis with fuel, the \n     Feds stepped in and made a national speed limit to help \n     conserve fuel. I think it is needed more now than then. Stiff \n     enforcement penalties would need to be set up for each state \n     for enforcement.\n\n[[Page S165]]\n\n       Also many years ago we had glass bottles and people \n     employed in glass factories making them. We could save a lot \n     of petrol by getting away from so much plastic. Glass is far \n     easier to recycle than plastic and it is reusable.\n       It is time [Congress got past partisanship and figured out \n     how to solve these problems]. They should be paying us by now \n     not the other way around.

With 5 kilowatt-h/ sq meter of solar income, in \n     addition to our hydroelectric power and category 4-5 wind, \n     Idaho should be a net green energy exporter. Just because the \n     oil companies, in times of record profits, decide to squeeze \n     the consumer, does not mean we can make the short-sighted \n     choice to think only with our wallets.

MICHAEL'S COLLEGE STUDENT VOLUNTEERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I wish to draw the attention of the Senate \nto a group of selfless volunteers at St. Michael's College in \nColchester, VT, who sacrificed time with their families and friends \nthis past holiday season to ensure that Vermonters in need of emergency \nservices had someone to call upon even on the Christmas holiday.\n  St. Michael's Fire and Rescue was founded in 1969 and has been \nstaffed and operated by student volunteers ever since. Donald Sutton, \naffectionately known as ``Pappy'' around the firehouse, helped start \nthe organization as dean and director of campus security following the \nuntimely death of a student athlete on campus. Nearly 40 years later, \nthe organization serves as the primarily ambulance and fire service for \na large portion of the State's most populous region, Chittenden County.\n  The student volunteers who make this organization run find time \noutside of their rigorous course work to not only be on call but also \nto complete hundreds of hours of Emergency Medical Technician training \nand Firefighter training. While their classmates may be battling \nanother school on the ice, on the field, or on the court--St. Michael's \nFire and Rescue members are risking their lives in real-life emergency \nsituations, aiding the sick, and putting out fires. Even during the \nholidays, when schools shut down and students usually go home to visit \nwith family, these students stand watch for their community.\n  While I was at my family farm in Middlesex this holiday season, I \ncame across a Christmas Day Burlington Free Press article highlighting \nthe sacrifice of these students. I ask unanimous consent that the text \nof that article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Dec. 25, 2008]\n\n                 No Break for Students on Rescue Squad\n\n                         (by Joel Banner Baird)\n\n       Colchester.--Their classmates might delight in holiday \n     downtime: late nights, late mornings, heavy meals and torpor.\n       On the night before Christmas, a student-staffed rescue \n     squad at St. Michael's College remains on-call and alert--by \n     choice. Time off will come to squad Capt. Kristen Dalton, 21, \n     later this week, after a 90-hour week at the College Parkway \n     station.\n       Her fellow St. Mike's seniors, Mark Petersen and Peter \n     Cronin, both 21, opted for holiday duty, too.\n       This is more than a club. The squad's 20 members are first-\n     responders who you see tending to car-wreck victims and \n     heart-attack patients. They respond to more than 2,700 calls \n     every year from Chittenden County residents, most of them in \n     Colchester, Winooski and Hinesburg. Dalton looked cheerful on \n     a slow Wednesday morning.\n       The biology major and pre-med student said she typically \n     logs 40 to 50 hours per week at St. Michael's Fire and \n     Rescue.\n       Each volunteer, certified as an Emergency Medical \n     Technician, puts in at least 24 hours per week, including a \n     12-hour overnight shift at the station.\n       ``We hold ourselves to a 3-minute response time,'' Dalton \n     said. ``I throw a jumpsuit over my pajamas, I'm in my boots, \n     and I'm out the door.''\n       Like his captain, Petersen joined the squad as a freshman. \n     He said the commitment taught him how to juggle academic \n     commitments.\n       ``It really, really forces you into time management,'' he \n     said.\n       Another learning curve brought him up to speed as a member \n     of a larger, adult community.\n       ``What we do here is a lot of consequence-based decision-\n     making,'' he said. ``You see the results of your actions \n     right away. It makes you step back and say, `Hey--I'm not a \n     kid anymore.' ''\n       Interrupting him, a call came through dispatch: An infant \n     in Plattsburgh, N.Y., needed to be transported to Fletcher \n     Allen.\n       Petersen and Cronin did a final inspection of the neo-natal \n     intensive care truck--one of the station's three ambulances--\n     and headed out to pick up a specialist at the hospital en \n     route to New York.\n       Christmas Eve's activities would be anybody's guess. \n     Wrapped packages lay beneath a decorated tree in the ready \n     room. Cronin's parents said they'd cook breakfast for the \n     volunteers on Christmas morning.\n       Dalton said the squad would lose almost half of its members \n     after graduation. She's already planning a spring recruitment \n     drive.\n       ``This attracts a lot of different people--people who want \n     to do something good with their time,'' she said.\n       As if on cue, Kate Soons of Colchester, a self-described \n     ``lingering alum,'' entered with an overnight bag. She'd \n     heard about the Plattsburgh call and wanted to provide \n     backup.\n       Soons served with the squad in the 1980s, and now is a \n     nurse at Fletcher Allen. She also coordinates regional \n     emergency care training, and keeps tabs on St. Mike's \n     graduates who have chosen to stay active in the field.\n       Begun in 1969, the rescue squad is the busiest volunteer \n     ambulance unit in the state, she said.\n       ``It's a big family,'' she said.\n       Soons' husband, Pete Soons, also served with rescue \n     volunteers as an undergraduate. He directs the college's \n     department of public safety, overseeing campus security, \n     rescue and fire squads.\n       Unlike the rescue volunteers, St. Michael's 25 firefighters \n     have an off-campus affiliation; they're a battalion in the \n     Colchester Center Volunteer Fire Company.\n       Standing between a hose truck and an engine, company \n     firefighter Gary Zeno discussed hydrant fittings with \n     freshman Andrea Dillner, 19. Still in training, Dillner will \n     accompany squads as a rookie until she qualifies for hands-on \n     work.\n       Nonetheless, she volunteered.\n       After a briefing with Zeno, she headed upstairs, past a \n     wall-sized calendar of shift schedules and birthdays, to take \n     a nap.\n       Dalton, coffee in hand, looked as wide-awake as ever on the \n     night before Christmas.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/07/senate-section/article/S165-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S165-S166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      RETIREMENT OF CHARLENE DAVIS\n\n Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment today \nto recognize the career of journalist Dick Hoxworth who, after serving \nthe residents of central Pennsylvania for 40 years, retired from his \npost as anchor on WGAL-TV on Christmas Eve.\n  The longest serving anchor in the Harrisburg media market, Dick \ncovered some of the most newsworthy events in the region's history. \nMost notably, he covered the Agnes flood in 1972 and was one of the \nfirst reporters on the scene at the Three Mile Island nuclear accident. \nDuring the Vietnam war he reported on the return of the first American \nprisoners of war, as well as the arrival of the first Vietnamese \nrefugees to the United States. In the political arena, Dick Hoxworth \ncovered stories at both the Pennsylvania State Capitol and the White \nHouse.\n  Dick was a highly decorated newsman. Over the course of his \ndistinguished career, he received awards from the Associated Press, the \nPennsylvania Association of Broadcasters, and was nominated for 29 \nregional Emmy Awards, winning 3 times.\n  But simply listing Dick Hoxworth's accomplishments and accolades \nwithin the field of journalism doesn't tell his full story. Dick was an \nold-fashioned ``news man,'' getting his start before blogs, the \nInternet, 24-hour cable news, and live satellite feeds. However, as \ntime went on, he did one of the most difficult things to do in a \nprofession he transcended the changes that were taking place in his \nfield. Dick continued broadcasting, writing, and reporting even as the \nfaces and technology around him changed with the times. Rather than be \ndeterred by these changes, he embraced them and continued to thrive.\n  Edward R. Murrow once said, ``the newest computer can merely \ncompound, at speed, the oldest problem in the relations between human \nbeings, and in the end the communicator will be confronted with the old \nproblem, of what to say and how to say it.''\n  For 40 years, Dick Hoxworth knew what to say and how to say it And, \nin doing so, he has made Pennsylvania proud. Today I would like to \nrecognize and pay tribute to that service and his long and successful \ncareer. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/07/senate-section/article/S166-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S166]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO JAMES A. TEGNELIA\n\n Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the \naccomplishments and leadership of Dr. James Tegnelia for his service to \nthe Defense Threat Reduction Agency--DTRA--and the Nunn-Lugar \nCooperative Threat Reduction Program. DTRA is a 2,000-member combat \nsupport agency which is charged by the Department of Defense to \nsafeguard the United States and its allies from weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  I have had the pleasure of working closely with Jim and DTRA in their \nrole as the primary implementers of the Nunn-Lugar program. I am \nthankful to have had such a strong ally in the fight against nuclear \nproliferation. The agency is an integral actor in the fight to reduce \nWMD proliferation worldwide and has proven to be an extraordinary \nsource of leadership in reducing the threats posed by weapons of mass \ndestruction.\n  Dr. James Tegnelia, of Albuquerque, NM, has served as the Director of \nthe Defense Threat Reduction Agency since February 2005, and will leave \nthat post in February 2009, after 4 years of dedicated service. Dr. \nTegnelia's accomplishments are as wide in scope as they are large in \nnumber, and for this we honor him today on the floor of the U.S. \nSenate.\n  Dr. Tegnelia was instrumental in institutionalizing and integrating \nthe mission of combating weapons proliferation across the Department of \nDefense and in guiding agency support to the global war on terrorism. \nThe integration of Department of Defense missions in both fighting \nterror and WMD proliferation has allowed both agencies to share \nvaluable resources and seek common purpose in our efforts on both \nimportant fronts.\n  Jim has been a tireless champion of international efforts to curb the \nproliferation of nuclear weapons, and his understanding of the threat \nof weapons of mass destruction to our nation and U.S. interests abroad \nis unparalleled. This expertise and dedication manifested itself in a \nleadership role for the agency in the establishment of regional and \nglobal nonproliferation partnerships. Working closely with the \nDepartment of State, Dr. Tegnelia has been a vocal advocate of the \nPresident's Global Initiative to Combat Nuclear Terrorism, a program \ndesigned to prevent terrorists and dangerous regimes from threatening \nthe United States and its allies with the world's most deadly weapons.\n  I have had the opportunity to travel extensively with Dr. Tegnelia \nand the experts at DTRA to Nunn-Lugar dismantlement sites all over the \nworld. I remember fondly a trip we took just 2 years ago. He joined Sam \nNunn and I in celebrating the 15th anniversary of the program on a trip \nto Russia, Ukraine, and Albania. We enjoyed good conversation on the \nprogram's significant contributions to international security and Nunn-\nLugar's future prospects in countries outside the former Soviet Union. \nJim has been an immensely successful leader and colleague in the fight \nto keep the United States safe and secure against the threats of \nweapons of mass destruction. We are indebted for his service and honor \nhis commitment to this country.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in wishing him good luck in his future \nendeavors and thanks for a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/07/senate-section/article/S166-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S166-S167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING MAINE ENERGY SYSTEMS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, while many hold an idyllic notion of \nMaine in the winter as a haven for skiers and snow enthusiasts, Mainers \nknow that the cold winter months bring with them many dangers, \nparticularly when it comes to heating homes. That is why I wish to \nrecognize Maine Energy Systems of Bethel, a small business that is \nusing technology and innovative thinking to help solve our Nation's \nenergy crisis and keep Mainers warm during the State's lengthy winter.\n  Maine Energy Systems is the product of three men: Les Otten, Dr. \nHarry ``Dutch'' Dressler, and William Strauss. They came together in \n2007 to brainstorm a way to reduce energy costs for Mainers and for the \nNation. When the trio formed Maine Energy Systems they agreed that any \nsolution had to: Reduce dependency on foreign oil; be environmentally \nsensitive; be renewable; and be affordable. With these goals in mind, \nthey spent 14 months researching every aspect of energy delivery and \nproduction. These efforts eventually bore fruit when they partnered \nwith German manufacturer Bosch to create a wood pellet fueled boiler \nsystem suitable for sale in America.\n  Bosch created a boiler fueled by high-grade wood pellets that are \npumped through an automatic feeder into the boiler itself. The wood \npellets are made directly from trees or from the byproducts of other \nwood manufacturing processes before undergoing a unique and exciting \nprocess. The wood is first dried, pulverized and forced under high \npressure through the holes in a die, a specialized manufacturing tool. \nThe\n\n[[Page S167]]\n\nholes force the wood into a tightly compact pellet shape that stores \nenergy without wasting space. These pellets are extremely versatile and \ncan be made from either hardwood or softwood.\n  Once inside the boiler, the pellets are fanned in order to ensure \nmaximum combustibility. Finally, the pellets are burned, generating \nheat that can be used as a home heating source. The boiler has already \nbeen approved by the Underwriters Laboratories and proven reliable by \nthe American Society of Mechanical Engineers. In addition to their \ndependability, wood pellets are also environmentally friendly.\n  The wood pellets have very little ash content. Unlike traditional log \nfires, burning pellets do not appear to create chimney deposits and in \nfact, burning wood pellets creates no visible smoke. The only byproduct \nleft after burning is wood ash, which is actually beneficial to garden \nand lawn soil. Wood pellets are a local renewable resource, and many of \nthe pellets used by Maine Energy Systems come from trees in the small \nMaine town of Athens. In this way, Maine's abundant forests can help \nreduce our Nation's dependence on foreign sources of energy, in \nparticular Middle Eastern oil. The carbon footprint created by wood \npellet burning stoves is only 28.6 lbs. per million British thermal \nunits, which ranks as one of the most efficient ways to heat a home.\n  Maine Energy Systems is at the vanguard of the ``green'' product \nrevolution, creating a product that is beneficial to the environment, \nsaves consumers money, and produces profits and jobs. Entrepreneurs in \nthe purest sense of the word, Maine Energy Systems' founders have \nprovided our country a tremendous opportunity for a better future. I \nwish Les Otten, Dr. Harry ``Dutch'' Dressler, William Strauss, and \nMaine Energy Systems continued success as they help Mainers save money, \nenergy, and the environment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/07/senate-section/article/S167-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message from the President of the United States was communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/07/senate-section/article/S167-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       EXECUTIVE MESSAGE REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \na message from the President of the United States submitting \nnominations which were referred to the Committee on Armed Services.\n  (The nomination received today is printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/07/senate-section/article/S167-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S167]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:16 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \nagreed to the following concurrent resolutions, without amendment:\n\n       S.

 By Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 32. A bill to require the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to \nhold at least 1 public hearing before issuance of a permit affecting \npublic or private land use in a locality; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to speak on \nlegislation I am introducing that will require the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission to hold at least one public hearing before \nissuance of a permit affecting public or private land use in a \nlocality. I introduced legislation on this issue at the end of the \n110th Congress, and fully expect it to remain relevant as we move \nforward with upgrades to our energy infrastructure, possibly as part of \nan economic stimulus package. The legislation has been updated; namely, \nit now allows for a second hearing when officially requested by a \ncounty or local government to address issues not addressed at the \noriginal hearing.\n  Increasing demand for electricity throughout the Northeast is putting \na strain on energy infrastructure in my State, necessitating new \ntransmission lines and natural gas pipelines and the expansion of \nexisting ones. In southwestern and northeast Pennsylvania transmission \nline expansions are planned over hundreds of miles of private property, \nwhile in the southeast natural gas pipeline expansions are underway.\n  There is no doubt these projects can be invasive, and rarely do they \nfail to be controversial. I make a point of touching all of \nPennsylvania's 67 counties each year. In traveling Pennsylvania this \nFall I heard a lot of complaints, which didn't come as a surprise. I \nheard frequently from constituents who oppose these infrastructure \nprojects, and who felt their concerns were being ignored by the energy \ncompanies and by FERC.\n  I realize there will always be some opposition to large \ninfrastructure projects. What is unacceptable, however, is for the \npeople of my State to feel that their voices were not heard, that their \nissues were ignored. It may be the case that these projects are \nnecessary. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is the authority, \nand in exercising its authority it must be sensitive to local concerns.\n  To address this I propose simply that FERC hold a hearing in these \naffected communities. In many cases this is already done, but my \nlegislation makes it mandatory. State Public Utility Commissions, who \nhave a great say in these matters, are beyond Congress' reach. But \nwhere the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission is involved we can take \nsteps to ensure that our constituents' concerns receive due \nconsideration. Holding a hearing may not lead to all sides agreeing on \nthe proper route forward, but at the very least my Pennsylvania \nconstituents will come away with the satisfaction of having publicly \naired their grievances.\n  To ensure that constituent concerns are given all due consideration, \nmy legislation allows for affected parties to petition for a second \nhearing, provided certain conditions are met. In order for a second \nhearing to occur, a county government, or a municipal government within \nthe affected county, must petition the Federal Energy Regulatory \nCommission for a second hearing. A second hearing will only occur to \naddress an issue that was not addressed at the initial hearing, and the \nhearing shall occur between 30 and 60 days after approval by the \nFederal Energy Regulatory Commission.\n  The safeguards included in this legislation are critical to \nprotecting individual property rights. As the Nation moves forward in \nmaking needed updates to its infrastructure, defending citizens' \nconstitutional right to redress their government with their concerns \nshould be paramount for this Congress. I will continue to fight to \nallow my constituents to be heard when Federal projects will affect \ntheir rights as homeowners and landowners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/07/senate-section/article/S170-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S170-S175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. BINGAMAN:\n  S. 22. A bill to designate certain land components of the National \nWilderness Preservation System, to authorize certain programs and \nactivities in the Department of the Interior and the Department of \nAgriculture, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise to speak to Senator Bingaman's \nintroduction today of the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. I \nstrongly support this bill and Senator Bingaman's leadership in \nsponsoring it, and urge my colleagues to vote for its prompt passage.\n  This omnibus legislation includes no fewer than 20 bills of interest \nto California, including 14 bills to increase our water supply and to \nrestore our rivers and groundwater quality, 3 bills to designate \nadditional wilderness areas, and 3 other National Park Service, Bureau \nof Land Management, and Forest Service bills.\n  I would like to speak at some length about one of these bills, the \nSan Joaquin River Restoration Settlement Act, which I have introduced \nwith Senator Boxer to bring to a close 18 years of litigation between \nthe Natural Resources Defense Council, the Friant Water Users Authority \nand the U.S. Department of the Interior. Before I discuss the San \nJoaquin bill, however, I would like to review the other 19 California \nbills in the omnibus legislation introduced today. These include the \nfollowing:\n\n\n          Additions to National Wilderness Preservation System\n\n  Eastern Sierra and Northern San Gabriel Wilderness,\n  Riverside County Wilderness, and the\n  Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Parks Wilderness;\n\n\n                       Bureau of Land Management\n\n  Tuolumne Band of Me-Wuk Indians of the Tuolumne Rancheria land \nexchange;\n\n\n                             Forest Service\n\n  Mammoth Community Water District land conveyance;\n\n\n                         National Park Services\n\n  Tule Lake Segregation Center Resource Study;\n\n\n                         Bureau of Reclamation\n\n  San Diego Intertie feasibility study,\n  Madera Water Supply Enhancement Project authorization,\n  Rancho California Water District project authorization,\n  Santa Margarita River project authorization,\n  Elsinore Valley Municipal Water District project authorization,\n  North Bay Water Reuse Authority project authorization,\n  Prado Basin Natural Treatment System Project authorization,\n  Bunker Hill Groundwater Basin project authorization,\n\n[[Page S171]]\n\n  GREAT Project authorization,\n  Yucaipa Valley Water District project authorization,\n  Goleta Water District Water Distribution System title transfer,\n  San Gabriel Basin Restoration Fund, and the\n  Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation Program\n\n  I would like to say a few words about the water project \nauthorizations and wilderness bills, in addition to the San Joaquin \nRiver Settlement legislation.\n  In the Western U.S., drought, population growth, increasing climate \nvariability, and ecosystem needs make managing water supplies \nespecially challenging. The 9 California water recycling projects \nincluded in the omnibus bill offer a proven means to develop cost \neffective alternative water supply projects. Together they will help \nthe state reduce its dependence on imported water from both the Lower \nColorado River and Sacramento/San Joaquin Delta.\n  Among the other bills to benefit California water supply and quality, \none codifies the Lower Colorado River Multi-Species Conservation \nProgram, MSCP, a 50 year plan to protect endangered species and \npreserve wildlife habitat along the Colorado River.\n  The three wilderness bills in this package would together protect a \nwilderness about 735,000 acres of land in Mono, Riverside, Inyo, and \nLos Angeles Counties, and within Sequoia-Kings Canyon National Park. \nThis will protect spectacular lands ranging from the High Sierras to \nthe magnificent California deserts. I want to thank Senator Boxer in \nparticular for her leadership on these bills.\n  I would like to devote most of my remarks to the San Joaquin River \nRestoration Settlement Act, a bill Senator Boxer and I have cosponsored \nthat approves, authorizes and helps fund an historic Settlement on the \nSan Joaquin River in California. This Settlement restores California's \nsecond longest river, while maintaining a stable water supply for the \nfarmers who have made the San Joaquin Valley the richest agricultural \narea in the world. One of the major benefits of this settlement is the \nrestoration of a long-lost salmon fishery. The return of one of \nCalifornia's most important salmon runs will create significant \nbenefits for local communities in the San Joaquin Valley, helping to \nrestore a beleaguered fishing industry while improving recreation and \nquality of life.\n  This San Joaquin Settlement bill is nearly identical to the bill that \nwe introduced in the waning days of the 109th Congress, and \nreintroduced at the beginning of the 110th Congress as S. 27. However, \nthe bill we are introducing today does reflect a few significant \nchanges resulting from discussions among the numerous Settling Parties \nand various ``Third Parties'' in the San Joaquin Valley of California. \nDuring the past year the parties to the settlement and these affected \nthird parties, such as the San Joaquin River Exchange Contractors, have \nagreed to certain changes to the legislation to make the measure PAYGO \nneutral and to enhance implementation of the settlement's ``Water \nManagement Goal'' to reduce or avoid adverse water supply impacts to \nFriant Division long-term water contractors. The legislation that we \nare introducing today incorporates these changes, which are supported \nby the State of California and major water agencies on the San Joaquin \nRiver and its tributaries.\n  The Settlement has two goals: to restore and maintain fish \npopulations in the San Joaquin River, including a selfsustaining salmon \nfishery, and to avoid or reduce adverse water supply impacts to long-\nterm Friant water contractors. Consistent with the terms of the \nSettlement, we expect that both of these goals will be pursued with \nequal diligence by the Federal agencies.\n  Without this consensus resolution of a long-running western water \nbattle the parties will continue the fight, resulting in a court-\nimposed judgment. It is widely recognized that an outcome imposed by a \ncourt is likely to be worse for everyone on all counts: more costly, \nriskier for the farmers, and less beneficial for the environment.\n  The Settlement provides a framework that the affected interests can \naccept. As a result, this legislation has enjoyed the strong support of \nthe Bush Administration, California Governor Schwarzenegger's \nAdministration, the environmental and fishing communities and numerous \nCalifornia farmers and water districts, including the Friant Water \nUsers Authority and its member districts that have been part of the \nlitigation.\n  When the Federal Court approved the Settlement in late October, 2006, \nSecretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne praised the Settlement for \nlaunching ``one of the largest environmental restoration projects in \nCalifornia's history.'' The Secretary further observed that ``This \nSettlement closes a long chapter of conflict and uncertainty in \nCalifornia's San Joaquin Valley . . . and open[s] a new chapter of \nenvironmental restoration and water supply certainty for the farmers \nand their communities.''\n  I share the Secretary's strong support for this balanced and historic \nagreement, and it is my honor to join with Senator Boxer and a \nbipartisan group of California House Members who have previously \nintroduced and supported this legislation to authorize and help fund \nthe San Joaquin River Restoration Settlement.\n  During the past year we have worked with the parties to the \nsettlement, affected third party agencies and the State of California \nto ensure that the legislation complies with congressional PAYGO rules.\n  In May of 2008, the Energy and Natural Resources Committee approved \namendments agreed to by the parties that allow most Friant Division \ncontractors to accelerate repayment of their construction cost \nobligation to the Treasury. This change both increases the amount of \nup-front funding available for the settlement and decreases the bill's \nPAYGO ``score'' by $88 million, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. In exchange for agreeing to early re-payment of their \nconstruction obligation, Friant water agencies will be able to convert \ntheir 25-year water service contracts to permanent repayment contracts.\n  The amendments also included new provisions to enhance the water \nmanagement efforts of affected Friant water districts. Specifically, \nthe legislation now includes new authority to provide improvements to \nFriant Division facilities, including restoring capacity in canals, \nreverse flow pump-back facilities, and financial assistance for local \nwater banking and groundwater recharge projects, all for the purpose of \nreducing or avoiding impacts on Friant Division contractors resulting \nfrom additional River flows called for by the Settlement and this \nLegislation.\n  Near the end of the 110th Congress, parties to the Settlement and \naffected third parties came to agreement on additional provisions that \nwould greatly facilitate passage of the bill by making it PAYGO-\nneutral. The legislation we are introducing today includes substantial \nfunding, including direct spending on settlement implementation during \nthe first ten year period of $88 million gained by early repayment of \nFriant's construction obligation, and substantial additional funding \nauthorized for annual appropriation until 2019, after which it then \nbecomes available for direct spending again. This additional funding is \ngenerated by continuing payments from Friant water users and will \nbecome directly available to continue implementing the settlement by \n2019 if it has not already been appropriated for that purpose before \nthen.\n  In 2006, California voters showed their support for the settlement by \napproving Propositions 84 and 1E, that will help pay for the \nSettlement, with the State of California now committing at least $200 \nmillion toward the Settlement costs during the next 10 years. When \nState-committed funding, direct spending authorized by the bill, and \nother highly reliable funding including pre-existing payments by water \nusers are added together, there is at least $380-390 million available \nfor implementing the Settlement over the next 10 years, with additional \ndollars possible from additional federal appropriations.\n  Nevertheless, it is my intention to work with the Chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee during the 111th Congress to \nfind a suitable offset that will allow restoration of all of the direct \nspending envisioned by the settlement without waiting until 2019.\n  Today's legislation continues to include substantial protections for \nother\n\n[[Page S172]]\n\nwater districts in California who were not party to the original \nsettlement negotiations. These other water contractors will be able to \navoid all but the smallest water impacts as a result of the settlement, \nexcept on a voluntary basis. These protections are accomplished while \nensuring a timely and robust restoration of the River and without \ncreating any new precedents for implementing the Endangered Species \nAct. Similarly, there is no preemption of State law and nothing in the \nbill changes any existing obligations of the United States to operate \nthe Central Valley Project in conformity with state law.\n  The bill we are introducing today contains several new provisions to \nstrengthen these third-party protections in light of the changes made \nto address PAYGO. These include safeguards to ensure that the San \nJoaquin River Exchange Contractors and other third parties will not \nface increased costs or regulatory burdens as a result of the PAYGO \nchanges.\n  Support of this agreement is almost as far reaching as its benefits. \nThis historic agreement would not have been possible without the \nparticipation of a remarkably broad group of agencies, stakeholders and \nlegislators, reaching far beyond the settling parties. The Department \nof the Interior, the State of California, the Friant Water Users \nAuthority, the Natural Resources Defense Council on behalf of 13 other \nenvironmental organizations and countless other stakeholders came \ntogether and spent countless hours with legislators in Washington to \nensure that we found a solution that the large majority of those \naffected could support.\n  At the end of the day, I believe that this San Joaquin bill is \nsomething that we can all feel proud of, and I urge my colleagues to \nmove quickly to approve this omnibus public lands legislation and \nprovide the administration the authorization it needs to fully carry \nout the extensive restoration opportunities and other actions called \nfor under the Settlement.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY (for himself and Mr. Rockefeller):\n  S. 24. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to \nstrengthen the earned income tax credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today Senator Rockefeller and I are \nintroducing the Strengthen the Earned Income Tax Credit Act of 2009. \nSince 1975, the earned income tax credit, EITC, has been an innovative \ntax credit which helps low-income working families. President Reagan \nreferred to the EITC as ``the best antipoverty, the best pro-family, \nthe best job creation measure to come out of Congress.'' According to \nthe Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the EITC lifts more \nchildren out of poverty than any other government program.\n  It is time for us to reexamine the EITC and determine where we can \nstrengthen it. Census data and the events of Hurricane Katrina \nreiterated the fact that there is a group of Americans that are falling \nbehind. The poverty rate for 2007 was 12.5 percent and this is \nbasically the same as the rate for 2006. In 2007, there were 37.3 \nmillion living in poverty.\n  We need to help the low-income workers who struggle day after day \ntrying to make ends meet. They have been left behind in the economic \npolicies of the last 8 years. We need to begin a discussion on how to \nhelp those that have been left behind. The EITC is the perfect place to \nstart.\n  The Strengthen the Earned Income Tax Credit Act of 2009 strengthens \nthe EITC by making the following four changes: reducing the marriage \npenalty; increasing the credit for families with three or more \nchildren; expanding credit amount for individuals with no children; and \nsimplifying the credit.\n  First, the legislation increases marriage penalty relief and makes it \npermanent. In the way that the EITC is currently structured, many \nsingle individuals that marry find themselves faced with a reduction in \ntheir EITC. The tax code should not penalize individuals who marry.\n  Second, the legislation increases the credit for families with three \nor more children. Under current law, the credit amount is based on one \nchild or two or more children. This legislation would create a new \ncredit amount based on three or more children. One of the purposes of \nthe EITC is to lift families above the poverty level. Because the EITC \nadjustment for family size is limited to two children, over time large \nfamilies will not be kept above the poverty threshold.\n  Under current law, the maximum EITC for an individual with two or \nmore children is $5,028 and under this legislation, the amount would \nincrease to $5,656 for an individual with three or more children. \nIncreasing the credit amount would make more families eligible for the \nEITC. Currently, an individual with three children and income at and \nabove $40,295 would not benefit from the credit. Under this \nlegislation, an individual with children and income under $43,276 would \nbenefit from the EITC.\n  Third, this legislation would increase the credit amount for \nchildless workers. The EITC was designed to help childless workers \noffset their payroll tax liability. The credit phase-in was set to \nequal the employee share of the payroll tax, 7.65 percent. However, in \nreality, the employee bears the burden of both the employee and \nemployer portion of the payroll tax.\n  For 2008, the EITC will fully offset the employee share of payroll \ntaxes only for childless workers earning less than $5,720. A typical \nsingle childless adult will begin to owe Federal income taxes in \naddition to payroll taxes when his or her income is only $10,655, which \nis below the poverty line.\n  The decline in the labor force of single men has been troubling. \nBoosting the EITC for childless workers could be part of solution for \nincreasing work among this group. Increasing the EITC for families has \nincreased labor rates for single mothers and hopefully, it can do the \nsame for this group.\n  This legislation doubles the credit rate for individual taxpayers and \nmarried taxpayers without children. The credit rate and phase-out rate \nof 7.65 percent is doubled to 15.3 percent. For 2007, the maximum \ncredit amount for an individual would increase from $457 to $913. The \ndoubling of the phase-out results in taxpayers in the same income range \nbeing eligible for the credit. In addition, the legislation would \nincrease the credit phase-out income level from $7,470 to $13,800 for \n2009 and $14,500 for 2010.\n  Under current law, workers under age 25 are ineligible for the \nchildless workers EITC. The Strengthen the Earned Income Tax Credit Act \nof 2009 would change the age to 21. This age change will provide an \nincentive for labor for less-educated younger adults.\n  Fourth, the Strengthen the Earned Income Tax Credit Act of 2009 \nsimplifies the EITC by modifying the abandoned spouse rule, clarifying \nthe qualifying child rules, and repealing the disqualified investment \ntest. Current rules require parents to file a joint tax return to claim \nthe EITC. This can create difficulty for separated parents. If parents \nare separated and not yet divorced, complex rules govern whether the \ncustodial parent may claim the EITC if a separate return is filed. The \ncustodial parent must be able to claim head-of-household filing status. \nThis test requires that a parent must pay more than half of household \nexpenses from her own earnings, rather than from child support payments \nor program benefits. Under this legislation, the requirements by \npermitting a separated parent who lives with for more than six months \nof the year and also lives apart from his/her spouse for at least the \nfinal six months of the year to claim the EITC.\n  Under current law, two adults who live in the same household with a \nchild may each qualify to claim the child for the EITC, but only one \ntaxpayer may claim the child and the other taxpayer is not eligible to \nclaim the childless worker EITC. Under this legislation, filers who are \neligible to claim a child for the EITC but do not do so are eligible to \nclaim the smaller EITC for workers not raising a child. For example, a \nmother and aunt living in the same house who are both qualified to \nclaim the child would be able to receive the EITC. The one who claims \nthe child would get the larger amount and the other would be eligible \nfor the smaller childless worker credit.\n  Under current law, low-income filers are ineligible for the EITC if \nthey have investment income such as interest, dividends, capital gains, \nrent or royalties that exceeds $3,950 a year. Very few EITC claimants \nhave investment income above this level. This income\n\n[[Page S173]]\n\ntest creates a ``cliff'' because those workers with investment income \nof $2,951 would be unable to claim any EITC. This provision discourages \nsavings among low- and moderate-income families. Under this \nlegislation, the investment income test would be repealed.\n  This legislation will help those who most need our help. It will put \nmore money in their pay check. We need to invest in our families and \nhelp individuals who want to make a living by working. I urge my \ncolleagues to support an expansion of the EITC.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN:\n  S. 26. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to reset the \nincome threshold used to calculate the refundable portion of the child \ntax credit and to repeal the sunset for certain prior modifications \nmade to the credit; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I come before the Senate to once again \nraise an issue that is near and dear to my heart--an issue that is of \ngreat importance to working families across this country. In 2001 and \nagain in 2003, Senator Snowe and I worked together to ensure that low-\nincome working families with children receive the benefit of the Child \nTax Credit. Last year, we were successful in improving the credit to \nensure that more working families are able to receive its benefit for \nthe tax year 2008, and I come here today to introduce legislation that \nwill ensure this important provision continues to provide tax relief \nfor our working families in the future.\n  The change we made to the credit last year will ensure the Child Tax \nCredit is available for all working families. As some of my colleagues \nmay be aware, to be eligible for the refundable child tax credit, \nworking families must meet an income threshold. If they don't earn \nenough, then they don't qualify for the credit. The problem is that \nsome of our working parents are working full-time and yet they still \ndon't earn enough to receive a meaningful benefit from this provision \nbecause they just don't have a high enough income.\n  It is wrong to provide the credit to some hardworking Americans, \nwhile leaving others behind. That is why we temporarily lowered the \nincome threshold to $8,500 in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act \nlast Fall. As a result, the single, working parent that is stocking \nshelves at your local grocery store for minimum wage will receive a \nmeaningful credit this year.\n  This improvement to the credit must be made permanent to ensure that \nour tax code works for all Americans, especially those working parents \nforced to get by on the minimum wage. Today, we are introducing the \nWorking Family Child Assistance Act, legislation which makes the \nrefundable Child Tax Credit permanent and sets the income threshold at \na reasonable level so that all working parents, including those making \nthe minimum wage, receive the benefit of the credit.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the Administration \nto ensure that those low-income, hard-working families that need this \ncredit the most do receive its benefits.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. NELSON, of Florida (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mrs. \n        McCaskill, and Ms. Klobuchar):\n  S. 30. A bill to amend the Communications Act of 1934 to prohibit \nmanipulation of caller identification information; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, American consumers and public \nsafety officials increasingly find themselves confronted by scams in \nthe digital age. One of the most recent scams is known as caller I.D. \n``spoofing.'' Today, I am introducing a bipartisan bill with Senators \nSnowe, McCaskill and Klobuchar--The Truth in Caller I.D. Act of 2009--\nto put an end to fraudulent caller I.D. spoofing.\n  What is caller I.D. spoofing? It's a technique that allows a \ntelephone caller to alter the phone number that appears on the \nrecipient's caller I.D. system. In other words, spoofing allows someone \nto hide behind a misleading telephone number to try to scam consumers \nor trick law enforcement officers.\n  Let me give you a few shocking examples of how caller I.D. spoofing \nhas been exploited during the past 4 years:\n  In one very dangerous hoax, a sharp-shooting SWAT team was forced to \nshut down a neighborhood in New Brunswick, NJ, after receiving what \nthey believed was a legitimate distress call. But what really happened \nwas a caller used spoofing to trick law enforcement into thinking that \nthe emergency call was coming from a certain apartment in that \nneighborhood. It was all a cruel trick perpetrated with a deceptive \ntelephone number.\n  In another example, identity thieves bought a number of stolen credit \ncard numbers. They then called Western Union, set up caller I.D. \ninformation to make it look like the call originated from the credit \ncard holder's phone line, and used the credit card numbers to order \ncash transfers, which the thieves then picked up.\n  In other instances, callers have used spoofing to pose as Government \nofficials. In the past year, there have been several instances of \nfraudsters using caller I.D. fraud to pose as court officers calling to \nsay that a person has missed jury duty. The caller then says that a \nwarrant will be issued for their arrest, unless a fine is paid during \nthe call. The victim is then induced to provide credit card or bank \ninformation over the phone to pay the ``fine.''\n  Furthermore, while these examples are serious enough, think about \nwhat would happen if a stalker used caller I.D. spoofing to trick his \nvictim into answering the telephone, giving out personal information, \nor telling the person on the other end of the line about their current \nwhereabouts. The results could be tragic.\n  There are a number of Internet Web sites--with names like \nTricktel.com and Spooftel.com--that sell their services to criminals \nand identity thieves. Any person can go to one of these Web sites, pay \nmoney to order a spoofed telephone number, tell the Web site which \nphone number to reach, and then place the call through a toll-free \nline. The recipient is then tricked when he or she sees the misleading \nphone number on his or her caller I.D. screen.\n  A new Web site--Dramatel.com--even offers a prepaid calling card \nplatform that combines a caller I.D. spoofing service with other \nfeatures that allow a fraudster to disguise their voice and record the \nentire call. It's hard to imagine what legitimate purpose this service \ncould possibly offer--other than providing a tailor-made mechanism for \ncriminals to prey on innocent victims.\n  In essence, these Web sites provide the high-tech tools that \ncriminals need to do their dirty work. Armed with a misleading phone \nnumber, an identity thief can call a consumer pretending to be a \nrepresentative of the consumer's credit card company or bank. The thief \ncan then ask the consumer to authenticate a request for personal \naccount information. Once a thief gets hold of this sensitive personal \ninformation, he can access a consumer's bank account, credit card \naccount, health information, and who knows what else.\n  Furthermore, even if a consumer does not become a victim of stalking \nor identity theft, there is a simple concept at work here. Consumers \npay money for their caller I.D. service. Consumers expect caller I.D. \nto be accurate because it helps them decide whether to answer a phone \ncall and trust the person on the other end of the line.\n  In June 2007, I chaired a Senate Commerce Committee hearing on caller \nI.D. spoofing. At that hearing, there was broad consensus that caller \nI.D. spoofing was quickly developing into a major area of consumer \nabuse and criminal fraud. Unfortunately, the Federal Communications \nCommission and the Federal Trade Commission have been slow to act on \nthis latest scam. In the meantime, many spoofing companies and the \nfraudsters that use them believe their activities are, in fact, legal. \nWell, it's time to make it crystal clear that spoofing is a scam and is \nnot legal.\n  How does the bipartisan Truth in Caller I.D. Act of 2009 address the \nproblem of caller I.D. spoofing?\n  Quite simply, this bill plugs the hole in the current law and \nprohibits fraudsters from using caller identification services to \ntransmit misleading or inaccurate caller I.D. information with the \nintend to defraud, cause harm, or wrongfully obtain anything of value. \nThis prohibition covers both traditional telephone calls and calls made\n\n[[Page S174]]\n\nusing Voice-Over-Internet, VoIP, service.\n  Anyone who violates this anti-spoofing law would be subject to a \npenalty of $10,000 per violation or up to one year in jail, as set out \nin the Communications Act. Additionally, this bill empowers States to \nhelp the Federal Government track down and punish these fraudsters.\n  I invite my colleagues to join Senators Snowe, McCaskill, Klobuchar \nand myself in supporting the Truth in Caller I.D. Act of 2009. We \nshould not waste any more time in protecting consumers and law \nenforcement authorities against caller I.D. spoofing.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 30\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Truth in Caller ID Act of \n     2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act, to prevent credit \ncard issuers from taking unfair advantage of college students and their \nparents, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Student Credit \nCard Protection Act of 2009 with my colleague Senator Durbin. This \nlegislation will help prevent college students from compiling massive \ncredit card debt while in school.\n  College students have become the target of credit card companies \nadvertising campaigns over the past 15 years. Many universities allow \ncredit card companies to set up tables on campus and offer students \nfree gifts in exchange for filling out a credit card\n\n[[Page S175]]\n\napplication. Additionally, students receive card solicitations through \nmail to their on-campus mailbox or at their home address even before \nthey arrive at the university in the fall. These aggressive marketing \nstrategies have worked and now close to 96 percent of college graduates \nhold a credit card, compared to 1994, when only half had one. The \naverage college student graduates with close to $3,000 in credit card \ndebt, double the amount in 1994. In some very extreme cases, students \nare leaving school with multiple credit cards and debts amounting \nupwards of $10,000.\n  Credit card debt can make it harder for graduates to rent an \napartment, receive a car loan, or obtain a job after college. Due to \nthe lack of financial education and complicated terms and conditions, \nmany students find themselves in over their heads. The Student Credit \nCard Protection Act will help students avoid large credit card debt \nwhile forcing issuers to make more responsible loans. The bill requires \ncredit card issuers to verify annual income of a full-time student and \nthen extends a line of credit based on the income. For a student \nwithout a verifiable income, a parent, legal guardian or spouse must \ncosign the credit card and approve any increase in the credit limit. \nThese simple underwriting requirements will make it more difficult for \ncredit card companies to approve loans that are beyond a students' \nability to repay and return to a more responsible lending policy.\n  It is imperative that we help minimize the amount of debt young \nconsumers incur before entering into the workforce. On average, a \nstudent with a bachelors degree will leave school with $18,000 in \nstudent loan debt. Paying for housing, health-care and student loans \nalready place a financial strain on a recent college graduate. A huge \ncredit card payment on top of all of the other bills can lead to \nfinancial ruin before young people even have a chance to get on their \nfeet. This bill gives students the protection they deserve from \nirresponsible lending that can trap them in years of crushing debt \nrepayment.\n  The current economic situation has exposed many bad habits of both \nthe financial industry and the average consumer. The savings rate of \nour country has significantly declined over the past decade as consumer \nspending and borrowing steadily increased. While it is necessary for \nCongress to implement policies which will allow Americans to save more \nof their income, it is equally important for consumers to put into \npractice controlled and prudent spending habits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/07/senate-section/article/S175-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S175]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 9--COMMEMORATING 90 YEARS OF U.S.-POLISH DIPLOMATIC \nRELATIONS, DURING WHICH POLAND HAS PROVEN TO BE AN EXCEPTIONALLY STRONG \n   PARTNER TO THE UNITED STATES IN ADVANCING FREEDOM AROUND THE WORLD\n\n  Mr. LUGAR (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, and Ms. Mikulski) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was referred to the Committee on \nForeign Relations:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I rise today to offer a resolution \ncommemorating several remarkable milestones in the U.S.-Poland \npartnership. This year marks the 90th anniversary of diplomatic \nrelations between the United States and Poland, the 50th anniversary of \nthe Fulbright Exchange Program with Poland, and the 10th anniversary of \nPoland's accession to NATO.\n  The U.S.-Polish friendship formally began in 1919 and has endured \nthrough two world wars, the Cold War, and the emergence of a vibrant \ndemocracy after the fall of communism. This partnership has been \nbolstered by two unqualified successes of U.S. diplomacy. The Fulbright \nExchange Program has nurtured the pursuit of higher learning for Polish \nand American students, professors, and researchers, for many decades \noffering Poles a rare window into the opportunities afforded by \ndemocratic society. Such exchanges invigorated intellectual thought and \ncreativity in Poland, Eastern Europe, and the West and helped to hasten \nthe dissolution of the Warsaw Pact.\n  Poland exhibited great energy in undertaking economic, political, and \nmilitary reforms, and the NATO alliance was strengthened by Polish \nmembership in 1999. Poland today remains the closest of our allies, \nhaving contributed great wherewithal to combating global terrorism and \nbringing stability to Afghanistan and Iraq.

Mr. President, we are going to be in a weekend session. All \nDemocratic Senators have been told this, and Republican Senators have \nbeen notified. We earlier anticipated that the vote would be early \nSunday, but I have worked with the Senate staff and we are going to be \nprotected with postcloture time by having that vote at 2 p.m. So what \nwe will do is come in Sunday at 1 p.m. and have a vote at 2 p.m.\n  There are a few procedural games people can play, if they desire, and \nI\n\n[[Page S176]]\n\nam confident they won't, but if they do, we are protected, and we will \nhave that vote so that the 30 hours expires during the next day, which \nwould be Monday. We are working toward not being in session on \nSaturday. We think we can do that because some people have issues that \nthey want to be protected, and I think we can do that. But at least for \nnow--not for now; period--we are going to vote at 2 p.m. on Sunday, and \neveryone should know that. I know there are a lot of people who have \nplans, but there has been adequate notice.\n  I mentioned here this morning, and I repeat, that President-elect \nObama has said that there are people out there who would love to be \nable to work on a Sunday but they do not have a job, and this is the \nleast we can do. The reason we are doing it is we have to move this \nlarge number of issues as quickly as we can.\n  This one matter we will finish early next week will be the result of \n164 bills that have been held up. We are going to move then to Lilly \nLedbetter, an important piece of legislation. When we finish that, we \nare going to do the children's health initiative, which doesn't take \ncare of all the health care problems in this country, but it does solve \nthe problem for millions of our children. Then we are going to move to \nthe economic recovery plan, and there may be other things we have to \ndo. For example, if President Bush sends us the TARP--that is the \nmatter dealing with the financial bailout--we will have to deal with \nthat. So we have a lot to do, and I hope everyone is understanding of \nthe fact we have to vote on Sunday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/07/senate-section/article/S176-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S176]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, JANUARY 8, 2009\n\n  Mr. REID.
