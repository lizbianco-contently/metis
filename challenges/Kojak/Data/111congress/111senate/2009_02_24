Madam President, today following leader remarks, the Senate \nwill resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 160, the DC \nVoting Rights legislation, with the time divided until 11 a.m. between \nthe two leaders or their designees. The designation we have is, of \ncourse, Senator Lieberman, the chairman of the committee. At 11 a.m. \nthe Senate will proceed to a cloture vote on the motion to proceed to \nthe bill.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 to 2:15 to allow for the weekly \ncaucus luncheons. We will likely not have a vote on the nomination of \nSolis, a cloture vote. It is my understanding that Republicans have \nalmost cleared it. They have one more Senator to hear from to set this \nup. So there will be a vote at 4:30 from the time after the caucus. We \nare waiting for a phone call. Staff is waiting for a phone call. So \nwhat we would do if, in fact, that is granted, we would work until 4:30 \np.m. today on the Solis nomination. People can come and talk on that \nhowever they feel. At 4:30 we would have a vote on her confirmation.\n  Now, that vote will be completed shortly before 5 o'clock. Chairman \nLieberman will be the person who will be managing this bill. If people \nwant to amend this, they have that right to do that. I have spoken at \nsome length to the Republican leader. We have to get off this \nlegislation as soon as we can, because a week from this Friday, March \n6, the funding for the Government runs out. So we have to pass the bill \nthat will be coming from the House today, or at the latest tomorrow. We \nhave to get that passed.\n  We have scheduled a ``no-vote day'' next Friday. We would like to \nkeep that. If, however, we see that this appropriations bill is running \ninto trouble, we are going to have to cancel that because we have to \ncontinue working on the legislation until we complete it. But there \nshould be no problem in that regard.\n  I understand people want to offer amendments. That is fine. Let them \noffer amendments. But this bill has been around for a long time. It is \nnow on the Web--people can look at it--as of last night. It has been \naround for a long time. We have had Republican input, both in the House \nand in the Senate. It has been scrubbed very closely. So I hope \neveryone would look at the legislation, determine what amendments they \nwant to offer and recognize the deadline we have next Friday.\n\n\n                              THE ECONOMY\n\n  Members of Congress and all Americans look forward to hearing from \nPresident Obama tonight in his first address in the House Chamber. \nAfter we passed as a Congress, and he signed, the economic recovery \nplan into law, the President can confidently tell the American people \nthat we have begun filling with dirt the deep economic ditch he \ninherited. That is especially so with the announcement he made in Mesa, \nAZ last Wednesday about the housing crisis.\n  Throughout his campaign, and now the first weeks of his Presidency, \nPresident Obama has told it to us very straight. He has not sugar-\ncoated anything. He has not sugar-coated the challenges we face or \ntried to paint a rosy picture of a rapid recovery.\n  He will surely call upon us to lend a hand, to put politics aside and \ncontinue working together, not as two parties but as one Congress for \none country. In\n\n[[Page S2390]]\n\nthe early days of the 111th Congress, we have done that.\n  With the good-will and earnest hard work of Democrats and Republicans \nalike, we passed a historic wilderness bill, a lands bill that has been \ncalled the most significant environmental legislation in a quarter of a \ncentury.\n  We passed the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act to help employees fight \ncases of wage discrimination and ensure the principle of equal pay for \nequal work.\n  We passed the lands bill on a bipartisan basis. We passed the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act on a bipartisan basis. We passed a new \nChildren's Health Insurance Program to provide health coverage to \nmillions of low-income families, children of those families. We did \nthat on a bipartisan basis. We passed President Obama's economic \nrecovery plan on a bipartisan basis, a plan to begin creating jobs, \ninvesting in our workforce, and providing tax relief to working \nfamilies.\n  As I have traveled around the country these last 10 days or so, \npeople said: Well, that was not bipartisan. It was. We had Governors \nfrom Florida to California, Republican Governors and Governors in \nbetween, being cheerleaders for this legislation. The day before the \nlegislation passed in Florida, conservative Republican Governor Crist \nintroduced President Obama, telling the people of Florida that this \nlegislation was a must-pass for that State.\n  People said: Well, what happened in the Senate? We got one more \nRepublican vote than we needed. We had Republican input. It was a \nbipartisan bill. We may not have had a lot of Republican Senators \nvoting for this legislation, but there was Republican input. Senator \nVoinovich from Ohio was involved in this legislation to the last hour \nthat we worked on this. He asked for certain things in this legislation \nand, frankly, he got them. It was a bipartisan group of Senators, led \nby, on our side, Senators Nelson and Lieberman, on the Republican side \nby Senators Snowe, Collins, and Specter. So it was bipartisan.\n\n  I appreciate the work we have been able to accomplish in this Senate \nup to this time. We are moving America forward. We are in the early \nrounds of this fight we have. Without further steps, our economic \ncrisis will grow worse, not better. But there are going to be further \nsteps.\n  I heard on the radio this morning a tremendous interview about a \nperson who was selling cars. He said, there is no question about it, \nthat the stimulus is going to help him sell cars. I believe that is the \ncase, that all through our economy, we are going to see improvement.\n  That is why all of us--I repeat, Democrats and Republicans, Members \nof Congress--all Americans need to pick up that shovel and keep filling \nour economic ditch with dirt, so we can climb out of it. We and the \nObama administration, we as Congress, and our White House, will help \nmillions of American families keep their homes, stem the tide of \nfalling home values for the tens of millions of families who have done \nnothing wrong yet continue to see their home equity disappear.\n  We will implement banking reform to begin to unfreeze wheels of \ncredit once again so that families can buy cars, send their children to \ncollege, and businesses can manage inventory and hire new workers, all \nwhile implementing new oversight, protecting the American people from \nany future banking crisis.\n  We will pass a budget, and we will do it soon, that reflects the \npriorities of America's working families and safeguards every dollar of \ntaxpayer funds. Throughout this recession, American people have been \nbombarded with bad news, but they remain patient for the tough choices \nand hard days still to come, and feel good about the progress that has \nbeen made.\n  The people of my State, Nevada, a State hit harder than most any \nother, understand this turnaround will not happen tomorrow or the next \nday, but they expect that Congress will put progress over politics in \nevery decision we make.\n  Yesterday, President Obama said it all when he said: It is the \nobligation of the majority party to be inclusive. And he is right about \nthat. But he also said: It is the obligation of the minority party to \nbe constructive. Inclusive and constructive, if we keep those words in \nmind, these critical next weeks of legislating will provide us with an \nopportunity to again fill this economic ditch that has been dug these \nlast many years and begin building the mountains once again to get us \nout of there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/24/senate-section/article/S2390-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2390]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the motion to proceed to S. 160, \nwhich the clerk will report by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the bill (S. 160) to provide the \n     District of Columbia a voting seat and the State of Utah an \n     additional seat in the House of Representatives.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 11 a.m. will be equally divided and controlled between the two \nleaders or their designees.\n  The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Madam President, I would first ask unanimous consent, \nsince the leaders have consumed--quite eloquently, I might add--15 \nminutes, that the hour run from this minute until 11:15 so that both \nsides have the full hour and that the cloture vote on S. 160 occur at \n11:15 a.m.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I overlooked a very important part of \ntoday. It is my understanding it is the birthday of the manager of this \nlegislation. So all of us in the Senate wish the great Senator from the \nState of Connecticut happy birthday.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Well, the Senator from the State of Connecticut has\n\n[[Page S2391]]\n\nreached an age where he has mixed feelings when people acknowledge his \nbirthday. But I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. REID. As President Reagan said, the alternative, though----\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The alternative is not good. And I praise the Lord for \nevery day. So I say thank you to Senator Reid for his kind words.\n  Madam President, I rise today, and I am proud to do so along with my \nfriend and colleague, Senator Hatch of Utah, to urge all Senators to \nvote yes on the motion to proceed to this important legislation, the \nDistrict of Columbia House Voting Rights Act of 2009. This measure will \ngive the citizens of our Nation's Capital full voting rights in the \nHouse of Representatives while effectively adding a fourth \ncongressional seat for the State of Utah.\n  In 2007, this bill passed overwhelmingly in the House by a vote of \n241 to 177 but fell 3 votes short of gaining cloture in the Senate. \nThat failure to proceed here in the Senate, 2 years ago now, left the \ncitizens of the District with the wholly unsought after distinction of \nbeing the only residents of a democratically ruled national capital in \nthe world who have no say in how their nation is governed. It is really \nastounding. It is time to right this injustice, just as this Congress \nhas historically righted so many other voting injustices that stretch \nback to the very founding of our Nation.\n  I again thank my friend, Senator Orrin Hatch, for his principled and \nsteadfast support of this bill. I believe his commitment to join in \nthis historic change puts him up there with other great Republican \nSenators in recent history, such as Everett Dirksen, who worked with \nLyndon Johnson to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1964.\n  I also thank my colleagues, Senators Carper, Dodd, Durbin, Feingold, \nKennedy, Kerry, Landrieu, Lautenberg, Leahy, Levin, McCaskill, \nMikulski, Sanders, and Voinovich, for joining as cosponsors. And, of \ncourse, I thank our leader, Senator Reid, for bringing this bill to the \nfloor so swiftly in this 111th session. In the Senate, as we all know, \none of the greatest gifts you can get is floor time, and the priority \nSenator Reid has placed on this measure speaks volumes of his \ncommitments to fairness, justice, and, in this case, I think civil \nrights.\n  Great thanks are due to District Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton, who \nhas been a tireless champion of full representation for the citizens of \nthe District. In her 10 terms in Congress, Eleanor Holmes Norton has \nvaliantly represented the citizens of the District despite the fact--\nand I say valiantly and effectively represented the citizens of the \nDistrict--despite the fact that she has no vote on the House floor.\n  Madam President, before I go on with the substance of the argument, I \nwould like to ask that you let me know when I have consumed 14 minutes \nof my time so I can wind it up.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will so advise.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  I wish to begin by taking my colleagues way back to November 22, \n1800. Why that day? Because that was the day that could be considered \nthe official dedication of Washington, DC, as our Nation's Capital: \nNovember 22, 1800. On that day, President John Adams, who had only \nrecently moved into the still-unfinished Executive Mansion--it was not \nknown as the White House back then--gave his State of the Union Address \nto the opening of the second session of the Sixth Congress, which was \nalso moving into its offices in the unfinished Capitol Building.\n  It is a sweet historical coincidence that today we begin discussion \nof this bill and tonight President Obama addresses the 111th session of \nCongress.\n  President Adams opened his statement with a prayer that this new city \n``be the residence of virtue and happiness [and] be forever held in \nveneration!'' That prayer has only, let's say, imperfectly been \nrealized, but we aspire to it nonetheless.\n  Adams then called on Congress to be wise stewards of this new city of \nthen roughly 8,000 people.\n  He said:\n\n       You will consider it as the capital of a great nation \n     advancing with unexampled rapidity in arts, in commerce, in \n     wealth, and in population, and possessing within itself those \n     energies and resources which, if not thrown away or \n     lamentably misdirected, will secure to it a long course of \n     prosperity and self-government.\n\n  Beautiful words.\n  The District did, of course, grow into a robust and thriving capital. \nToday, with nearly 600,000 residents, the District has a population \nroughly equal to or, in fact, greater than the States of Alaska, North \nDakota, Vermont, and Wyoming. But, sadly, its residents have not been \nallowed to be full participants in our democracy, have not been allowed \nto have voting representation in the Congress of the United States.\n  I want to speak for a moment about some of the fundamental injustices \nthat result from that fact. The people of the District, of course, have \nbeen a direct target of a terrorist attack, but they have no vote on \nhow the Federal Government provides for their homeland security.\n  Men and women of the District have fought bravely in all our wars--\nwell, at least going back to the War of 1812--many, many giving their \nlives in defense of our country and its freedom. Yet they have no vote \non the serious questions of war and peace, of funding conflicts, of \nsupporting veterans when they return home.\n  The courts have found that Congress has the authority to tax the \ncitizens and businesses of the District. And do they pay taxes? In \n2007, residents and businesses of the District paid over $20 billion in \nFederal taxes, which is more than 19 States, and at the second highest \nper capita rate of Federal taxation in the Nation. This should be \nembarrassing; that is, the fact that they still do not have voting \nrepresentation here should be embarrassing to a nation whose Founders \nrallied around the Revolutionary slogan: Taxation without \nrepresentation is tyranny. The District is the only jurisdiction in the \ncountry that must seek congressional approval, through the \nappropriations process, before spending locally generated tax dollars. \nYet DC has no vote in the appropriations process.\n\n  Finally, if any American living in the 50 States--outside of the \nDistrict of Columbia, I mean to say--were to move abroad, they would \ncontinue to be entitled to full voting representation in Congress--\nvoting by absentee in their last State of residence--regardless of how \nlong they remain out of the country. The only way they can lose that \nfull voting representation here in Congress is if they were either to \nrenounce their citizenship or return to the United States and live in \nWashington, DC. Now, that just does not make sense.\n  I am pleased to say that as I hear the arguments of the opponents of \nthis bill, they seem to recognize and concur on the fundamental justice \nof our cause. Their primary argument against the bill is the question \nof constitutionality. Opponents cite article I, section 2, of the \nConstitution, which states that the House ``shall be composed of \nmembers chosen . . . by the people of the several states.'' But I would \nurge my colleagues to read on because in article I, section 8, the \nFramers gave Congress authority to ``exercise exclusive legislation in \nall cases whatsoever'' regarding the District. This so-called District \nclause grants Congress particularly sweeping powers with regard to \nlegislation for the District of Columbia. In fact, our courts have \nupheld Congress's right to treat the District as a ``State'' for \npurposes of Federal taxation, Federal court jurisdiction, the right to \na jury trial, and interstate commerce, among others.\n  A broad range of constitutional experts, including very respected \nconservative constitutional experts such as Judge Ken Starr and former \nAssistant Attorney General Viet Dinh tell us that Congress's power to \nprovide voting rights to the District lies within this District clause. \nIf Congress has this power, there is no excuse for not deploying it to \nend the injustice facing the District's many residents with respect to \nvoting representation in Congress.\n  Madam President, let me give a little more history. There are some \nquestion marks lurking in the history of voting rights in the Federal \nDistrict. In the first 11 years after Maryland and Virginia ceded land \nfor the Capital in 1788 and 1789, respectively, residents of that ceded \nterritory continued to vote in either Maryland or Virginia. They \nretained this right to vote through congressional legislation. But when \nthe\n\n[[Page S2392]]\n\nDistrict was formally established in 1800, Congress was silent on the \nvoting rights for citizens of our Capital City. Frankly, we do not know \nexactly why this came about. The rights were never explicitly \nwithdrawn. They just never addressed them.\n  What we all know is that our Nation has always moved to expand and \nprotect the right to vote so that evermore voices could be heard and \nrepresented. It is time to do that again. The fact is, in 1800, when \nthe Federal Government first took up residence in the District, as we \nall know, sadly, not all Americans could vote. Slaves, who made up \nnearly a sixth of our Nation's population, had no vote and outrageously \nwere counted as a mere three-fifths of a person. Women could not vote, \nand neither could many men. Most States required you to be a landowner \nto vote, so many tradesmen, laborers, shop clerks, farmhands, and \nothers who were vital to the Nation's growing economy were denied the \nfranchise.\n  The Senators of 1800 were chosen by State legislatures, not by \npopular vote. President Adams, in fact, was about to be defeated in \n1800 by his Vice President, Thomas Jefferson, in an election where most \nof the members of the electoral college were also chosen by State \nlegislatures, not popular vote.\n  Well, we have, over the decades and centuries since 1800, righted \nthose wrongs. As I heard someone once say: American democracy is on a \njourney without a final destination. We keep struggling and, \nthankfully, achieving, generation after generation, the rights that are \nproclaimed in our Declaration of Independence. So we move beyond those \nbarriers to voting through legislation, constitutional amendments, and \ncourt decisions. And our democracy is, of course, stronger for it.\n  State legislatures began expanding voter rolls beyond just landowners \nand also provided for the direct election of Presidential electors. Let \nme just read from----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has consumed 14 \nminutes.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank the Chair.\n  The Supreme Court, in Wesberry v. Sanders, in 1964, ruled that House \ndistricts had to be approximately equal in population. That was the so-\ncalled ``one man, one vote.'' Again, in each of these cases, our Nation \nhas always had the goal of expanding and protecting the right to vote. \nAnd that is what we seek to do today.\n  I am going to yield now to Senator Hatch, with whom I am proud to \ncosponsor this legislation. Senator Hatch in this case is not just the \ndistinguished and effective and honorable and intelligent Senator from \nUtah, he has written one of the great law journal articles which \nasserts and I think clearly establishes the constitutionality of what \nwe are trying to do today.\n  So I thank the Chair and I yield the floor to my friend from Utah.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I compliment my dear friend and \ndistinguished colleague from Connecticut for the leadership he has \nprovided on this issue and for the intelligence he has brought to this \nissue as well.\n  Madam President, I rise to support S. 160, the District of Columbia \nHouse Voting Rights Act of 2009, which I am cosponsoring with my friend \nfrom Connecticut, Senator Lieberman. This bill would give the District \nof Columbia one seat and Utah another seat in the House of \nRepresentatives. I will address three questions about this bill: \nwhether Congress may pass this bill or this legislation, whether \nCongress should pass it, and whether the Senate bill is how Congress \nought to do it. I believe the answer to all three questions is yes.\n  The first question is whether the Constitution allows Congress to \npass this legislation. Congress may certainly increase the size of the \nHouse from 435 to 437 Members and give a new seat to Utah which \nqualifies for one under the formula used in the last 2000 census. The \n2010 census will determine whether Utah keeps this seat. The Congress \ncertainly has the legislative authority to grant it to us. The \nconstitutional question is whether Congress may give the other new \nHouse seat created by this bill to the District of Columbia which is, \nof course, not a State. The District did not even exist when the \nConstitution was drafted to provide that the House be composed of \nMembers chosen by the people of the several States. The constitutional \nquestion is whether the word ``States'' prevents Congress from \nproviding a House seat for the District.\n  We should debate more often and more openly whether the Constitution \nallows us to do what we do. I studied the constitutional issues raised \nby the bill before us and published my analysis and conclusions, as the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut has noted, in the Harvard \nJournal on Legislation for everyone's consideration.\n  I commend it to my colleagues.\n  Madam President, I wrote in that article and acknowledge here today \nthat there are legitimate arguments on both sides. There are liberal \nand conservative legal experts on both sides. As we debate this bill, \nhowever, I hope those who oppose it on constitutional grounds will do \nmore than just repeat the single word ``States.'' Noting that the \nDistrict is not a State is a factual observation; it is not a \nconstitutional argument. It is a premise, not a conclusion.\n  Several considerations led me to conclude that this legislation's \nconstitutional foundation is solid. First, representation and suffrage \nare the heart of our American system of self-government. This principle \nis so fundamental that there must be affirmative evidence that \nAmerica's Founders intended to deny it to Americans living in the \nDistrict. That evidence simply does not exist.\n  Secondly, America's Founders demonstrated the opposite intention by \ntheir own legislative actions. In 1790, as the distinguished Senator \nfrom Connecticut has observed, Congress provided by legislation that \nAmericans living in the land ceded for the District could continue \nvoting in congressional elections. Nobody even suggested that this \nlegislation was unconstitutional, even though the land on which those \nAmericans lived was no more part of a State in 1790 than the District \nis today. If Congress could do it then, Congress can do it now.\n  Third, the Constitution explicitly gives Congress legislative \nauthority over the District ``in all cases whatsoever.'' This authority \nhas been called sweeping, plenary, and extraordinary by the courts and \nsurpasses the authority a State legislature has over its own State.\n  Fourth, courts have held for more than two centuries either that \nconstitutional provisions framed in terms of States can be applied to \nthe District or that Congress can legislatively accomplish for the \nDistrict what the Constitution accomplishes for States. Congress, for \nexample, has authority to regulate commerce among the several States. \nThe Supreme Court held in 1899 that this applies to the District of \nColumbia.\n  The original Constitution provided that direct taxes shall be \napportioned among the several States. The Supreme Court held in 1805 \nthat Congress's legislative authority over the District allows taxation \nof the District. The Constitution provides that Federal courts may \nreview lawsuits between citizens of different States. The Supreme Court \nheld in 1805 that Congress can legislatively extend this to the \nDistrict even though the Constitution does not.\n  In 2000, the Supreme Court affirmed a lower court decision holding \nthat while the Constitution does not provide congressional \nrepresentation for the District, that goal can be pursued in other \nvenues including, the Court said, ``the political process.''\n  Those who argue the word ``States'' in the Constitution cannot \ninclude the District must believe that all of these court decisions \nwere wrong. They must believe that District commerce cannot be \nregulated, that District residents cannot be taxed, cannot sue in \nFederal court, and have no right to a speedy trial. They are entitled \nto believe that, but they should say so and defend their position.\n  Fifth, maintaining the District as a jurisdiction separate from State \ncontrol in no way requires disenfranchising its residents. America's \nFounders wanted the Capital to be free from State control, and I \nsupport keeping it that way. I oppose statehood for the District of \nColumbia, and I think most people in this body do, but giving the \nDistrict a House seat so that\n\n[[Page S2393]]\n\nits residents can participate in the process of making the laws they \nmust obey in no way changes either the District's political status or \nCongress's legislative authority over the District.\n  These are some of the considerations leading me to conclude that the \nConstitution allows Congress legislatively to provide a House seat for \nthe District of Columbia.\n  The next question is should Congress do so or whether Congress should \ndo so. I believe it should. Representation and suffrage are essential \nto our American system of self-government. The Supreme Court has said \nno right is more precious in a free country than having a voice in the \nelection of those who govern us. Congress provides by legislation for \nthe millions of Americans living overseas to exercise that right by \nvoting in congressional elections. They obviously do not live in a \nState. They do not even live in America.\n  Do those who believe the word ``States'' in the Constitution \nprecludes representation for Americans living in the District, do they \nbelieve that it also precludes representation for Americans living \noutside the country altogether? Of course not.\n  I wish to emphasize the legislation before us would restore \ncongressional representation that Americans living in the District once \nenjoyed. After taking up residence in 1800, Congress failed to continue \nby Federal law the voting rights these Americans had previously \nenjoyed, by Congress's permission, under State law. One member of the \nDistrict City Council, Augustus Woodward, wrote in 1801 that District \nresidents are still part of the people of the United States and that \n``it is violating an original principle of Republicanism to deny that \nall who are governed by laws ought to participate in the formulation of \nthem.''\n  I continue to believe what I stated more than 30 years ago on the \nSenate floor that Americans living in the District should enjoy all the \nprivileges of citizens, including voting rights.\n  If Congress may and should provide a House seat for the District, the \nremaining question is how to do it. I believe the bill before us, \nrather than the House version, is the best vehicle for accomplishing \nthat goal. First, it disclaims Senate representation for the District \nboth explicitly and implicitly. It explicitly does so in language that \nthe Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins, first introduced during the \ncommittee markup in the 110th Congress.\n  The bill States:\n\n       The District of Columbia shall not be considered a State \n     for purposes of representation in the U.S. Senate.\n\n  But the bill also implicitly disclaims Senate representation by \ntreating the District as a congressional district rather than as a \nState even for purposes of House representation. This avoids even a \nrhetorical parallel to States that have only one House Member.\n  I wish to firmly repeat my continuing opposition to District \nrepresentation in the Senate. I opposed the constitutional amendment in \n1978 that would have given the District both House and Senate \nrepresentation. The two Houses of Congress are designed differently: \nthe House to represent population and the Senate to represent the \nStates. The House is considered the people's body, the Senate the \nState's body. The 17th amendment changed how Senators are elected but \ndid not change the Senate itself or its place in the design of \nCongress.\n  In addition, as I argued in 1978, adding a nonstate jurisdiction to \nthe Senate would disrupt the equal suffrage the Constitution guarantees \nto the States in this body. Secondly, the Senate bill provides for \nexpedited judicial review. The House bill does not. As I do, my \ncolleagues take the Constitution seriously, and this provision will \nhelp ensure that, if necessary, the courts can decide the legal issues.\n  Third, the Senate bill allows Utah to elect its additional House \nMember after drawing new congressional district lines. The House bill \nwould improperly force Utah to elect an additional Member at Large. \nThis would create two strange situations. It would mean one House \nMember from Utah would have three times as many constituents as the \nother, and it would mean Utahans would each have two House Members, \ntwice as many as Americans living in any other State. Utah has already \ndemonstrated that it is willing and able to draw fair and reasonable \nlines to elect a fourth House Member, and Congress has no business \nforcing Utah to do it any other way.\n  Let me close by saying there are many differences between Utah and \nthe District, to be sure, but their residents deserve to be properly \nrepresented in our National Legislature. I do not believe that \nrepresentation and suffrage, the heart of self-government, should be \nprovided based on how Americans will exercise this most precious right \nor which party they will likely support. I believe Congress may and \nshould provide for that representation and ought to do so by passing \nthe bill before us today, and I hope we will.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, obviously, the principal argument that must \nbe made against this bill is its blatant unconstitutionality. Article I \nof the Constitution clearly and expressly provides that representation \nin the House of Representatives shall be apportioned among the several \nStates. The meaning of this language is not ambiguous. Only States may \nbe represented in the House of Representatives--not territories, not \ndistricts, or other Federal possessions. It is hard to craft a \ncolorable argument that this bill is constitutional, especially in view \nof court decisions confirming what I just said.\n  But let me set aside for a moment the constitutional argument and \ntalk about the idea behind the bill, which is that it is wrong for \nresidents of the District not to have some representation in the House \nof Representatives. The argument is that everyone is entitled to \nrepresentation in Congress and that the District currently lacks such a \nrepresentative--in other words, that the District runs afoul of the \nprinciple of ``no taxation without representation'' as the \njurisdiction's current license plates complain. Of course, there is a \nrepresentative, but that representative is a nonvoting representative.\n  The argument, however, is wrong. The District does not lack \nrepresentation in the Congress or need a voting representative to, for \nexample, provide funding for the District of Columbia. It actually \nalready has representatives in Congress: 100 Senators and 435 House \nMembers, all of whom, under the Constitution itself, have the \njurisdiction and, indeed, the obligation to provide for the general \nwelfare of the residents of the District of Columbia. All of these \nMembers work in the District. Most of them live close to, if not in, \nthe District. Their presence here and the oversight that Congress \nprovides and the funding Congress provides effectively ensures that the \nDistrict is adequately cared for by the Congress.\n  If anyone here today doubts that Congress has been anything less than \ngenerous toward the District, I would ask them to consider the latest \ndata from the Tax Foundation on the amount of tax dollars each State \nand the District pay to the Federal Government and the amount each \nreceives in Federal spending in return.\n  Let's start with those States for whom the redistribution of \nAmerica's wealth via the Federal Government is not such a good deal. \nGoing down the rankings to No. 47 of per capita dollars received to \ndollars taxed, we have the State of New Hampshire. Its residents paid \nan average of $8,162 of taxes to the Federal Government but received a \nper capita average of only $6,386 in Federal spending. This earned New \nHampshire a return of only 71 cents for each dollar paid in Federal \ntaxes.\n  Next on the list is the State of Connecticut. Its residents paid an \naverage of $11,522 in Federal taxes but saw only $8,795 per capita in \nFederal spending in return, which means every dollar in Federal taxes \nsaw a return of only 69 cents in Federal spending.\n  At No. 49 on the scale of returns is the State of Nevada. Its \nresidents saw only a 65-cent return on every dollar paid in Federal \ntaxes. On average, every Nevadan paid $8,417 in Federal taxes, but the \nState received only $5,889 per capita in Federal spending.\n  Finally, rock bottom on the list of beneficiaries of Federal largess \nis the State of New Jersey. Its residents paid a total of $86 billion \nin taxes to the Federal Government. That comes to $9,902 paid to the \nUnited States by every man, woman, and child in the State. Yet the \nState saw only $6,740 in Federal spending--a return of only 61\n\n[[Page S2394]]\n\ncents of Federal return for every dollar New Jersey residents send to \nWashington.\n  Neither New Jersey nor any of these other States pay the most in \ntotal taxes to the Federal Government. That honor goes to California, \nwhose citizens paid a total of $289 billion in taxes to the Federal \nGovernment. That comes out to $8,028 for every man, woman, and child in \nCalifornia. But in return, the State only received $6,709 per capita in \nFederal spending--a return of only 78 cents for each dollar in Federal \ntaxes paid.\n  There is also the other end of the scale--the States that received \nmore in Federal spending than they pay in Federal taxes. Which are \nthey? Let's start with West Virginia, which ranked fifth. Its residents \npaid an average of $4,861 in taxes and received $8,872 per capita in \nFederal spending--a return of $1.76 for every dollar in taxes.\n  No. 2 on the list is Mississippi, which saw a return of $2.03 for \nevery $1 paid in Federal taxes.\n  At the very top is New Mexico, whose residents paid an average of \n$5,153 in Federal taxes but saw a per capita return of $10,733 in \nFederal spending or $2.03 for every dollar paid in Federal taxes. \nMississippi and New Mexico, with two Senators each, and with four and \nthree Congressmen respectively, made out better than all other States \nin terms of per capita Federal spending that Congress delivered to \nthese States, as compared to the amounts they pay in taxes. No State \ngot a better deal than Mississippi and New Mexico, which saw a per \ncapita return of over $2 for every dollar paid. So they did very well \nby any measurement.\n  There is one jurisdiction that does better than even these States and \nthat is--as you might guess--the District of Columbia. It far exceeded \nthe $2 return seen by even the No. 1 and 2 States on the list of \nFederal beneficiaries. For the last year for which data is available, \nDistrict residents paid an average of $11,582 in Federal taxes. But in \nreturn, the District of Columbia received over $65,109 in per capita \nFederal spending. This represents a return that is more than twice as \nhigh as that received by the No. 1 and 2 States, a return of 55 cents \nfor every $1 that its residents paid in Federal taxes. The District did \nover six times better than even first-ranked New Mexico, at $65,109. \nThis represents a 555-percent return on the District's investment in \nFederal taxes--generous by any standard, even accounting for the fact \nthat much of the money is for the Federal area for buildings and other \nprojects within the District.\n  The numbers I have been citing have not abated in recent times. Most \nrecently, on February 14, in the Federal stimulus bill, the District's \nnonvoting Delegate, Holmes-Norton, issued a press release bragging \nabout the District's recent take. She gave a press briefing in which, \naccording to news accounts:\n\n       . . . gave a detailed account of the $620 million of \n     benefits for the District of Columbia in the American \n     Recovery and Reinvestment Plan of 2009 at a press conference \n     this morning. The funds in the stimulus package are expected \n     to generate 12,000 jobs and an even larger number of jobs at \n     the Department of Homeland Security headquarters in Ward 8, \n     which will receive $650 million, even more than expected, to \n     build the first of five buildings at the DHS compound, a \n     project expected to generate 38,000 jobs in the area. The \n     Congresswoman's work to make sure that in every category DC \n     was treated as a State paid off handsomely for the District, \n     which did better in funds received than seven States. Funds \n     to repair federal structures will be spent disproportionately \n     in DC because so many Federal buildings are located here.\n\n  One would expect DC would receive more Federal money because of the \nFederal enclave that exists in the District. But the point of the \nrepresentative is to note that all of that benefits the residents of \nthe District as well, unlike that money that goes to the States. So \nstraight from the nonvoting District's representative, you have the \nfact that the Congress has clearly been very generous toward the \nDistrict. It is in no way underrepresented and certainly doesn't \ndeserve to have an additional Member of Congress, whose goal it would \nbe to expand the District's share of Federal spending.\n  Even if giving the District a dedicated representative in the House \nwere sound policy, let me return to the argument about the \nconstitutionality. This, the proponents appreciate, is the soft \nunderbelly of this legislation. There are arguments they adduce to \nsupport its constitutionality. I submit they are weak and will not \nsucceed in court. I appreciate the fact that the sponsors of the bill \nsupport the necessity of an expedited hearing to get the legislation \nheard and a decision made by the courts as to its constitutionality. \nThat is the least we would owe the representatives of the District, as \nwell as the other citizens of the country.\n  Congress has long recognized we can only grant District residents the \nability to participate in Federal elections through constitutional \namendment. Prior to 1961, for example, District residents were not \npermitted to vote in Presidential elections. Article II, section 1 of \nthe Constitution provides that the electors from each State should be \ncomprised of the number equal to the State's combined congressional \ndelegation. In the face of this express constitutional language, \nCongress recognized that a change to the law would require a change to \nthe Constitution itself. That is why, when we granted DC residents the \nright to participate in Presidential elections, we went about it the \nright way--by passing the 23rd amendment to the Constitution.\n  Just as article II of the Constitution, which deals with the \nPresidency, limited the right to appoint Presidential electors to the \nState, article I, which deals with Congress, clearly and repeatedly \nlimits representation in the House and Senate to the State. Article I \nsays the House ``shall be composed of members chosen every second year \nby the people of the several states, and the electors in each state \nshall have the qualifications requisite for electors of the most \nnumerous branch of the state legislature.'' Obviously, that doesn't \napply to the District of Columbia. It requires that each \nrepresentative, ``when elected, be an inhabitant of that state in which \nhe was chosen.'' It mandates that ``each state . . . have at least one \nRepresentative,'' and it provides that ``when vacancies happen in the \nRepresentation for any state, the executive authority thereof shall \nissue writs of election to fill such vacancies.'' Again, it could not \nhave application to the DC.\n  The import of these provisions was recognized by the legal scholar, \nJonathan Turley, in a law review article published last year. In it he \nconcludes:\n\n       It would be ridiculous to suggest that the delegates to the \n     Constitutional Convention or ratification conventions would \n     have worked out such specific and exacting rules for the \n     composition of Congress, only to give the majority of \n     Congress the right to create a new form of voting members \n     from federal enclaves like the District. It would have \n     constituted the realization of the worst fears for many \n     delegates, particularly Anti-Federalists, to have an open-\n     ended ability of the majority to manipulate the rolls of \n     Congress and to use areas under the exclusive control of the \n     Federal Government as the source for new voting members.\n\n  Indeed, congressional Democrats, in 1978--and Republicans as well--\nrecognized that giving the District of Columbia a dedicated House \nMember would require amending the Constitution. That year, Congress \npassed an amendment giving District residents a voting seat in the \nHouse. When the House Judiciary Committee, under the leadership of \nChairman Peter Rodino, reported out the amendment, the accompanying \nreport recognized that ``if the citizens of the District are to have \nvoting representation in the Congress, a constitutional amendment is \nessential; statutory action alone will not suffice.''\n\n  I am certainly not alone in concluding that this bill, though well-\nintentioned, violates the plain language of the Constitution. The very \ncourt that will hear challenges to this bill under its expedited \njudicial review provision has already ruled that District residents do \nnot have a constitutional right to congressional representation. In \nAdams v. Clinton, decided in 2000, a three-judge panel of the Federal \nDistrict Court for the District of Columbia had concluded that the \nConstitution plainly limited congressional representation to the \nStates. Here is what the court said:\n\n       The overlapping and interconnected use of the term \n     ``state'' in the relevant provisions of article I, the \n     historical evidence of contemporary understandings, and the \n     opinions of our judicial forebears, all reinforce how deeply \n     Congressional representation is tied to the structure of \n     statehood. . . . There is simply no evidence that the Framers \n     intended that not only citizens of the States,\n\n[[Page S2395]]\n\n     but unspecified others as well, would share in the \n     congressional franchise.\n\n  The District residents who brought suit in Adams v. Clinton appealed \ntheir case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, and the Supreme Court \nallowed the trial court's ruling to stand.\n  The Senate should not be passing legislation that we believe is \nunconstitutional. We should not pass the buck to the Federal courts \nbecause we feel good about a particular case to be made and want to \nexpress our feelings about it, in the firm judgment that the court will \nsave us from ourselves and declare our action unconstitutional. When we \nneglect our duty to the Constitution, we fail to uphold the oath that \nwe take as Senators to support and defend our great founding documents.\n  My friends in the Senate who support this legislation rely \nessentially on two arguments, neither of which, I submit, outweighs the \nclear mandate in article II. First, they claim that another provision \nin the Constitution, the so-called District clause, allows Congress to \nessentially grant any sort of legislation relating to the District of \nColumbia, including even legislation to give DC residents a voting \nHouse Member. This clause doesn't do that. What it does is permit \nCongress to pass laws to provide for the general welfare of District \nresidents. The bill, however, does not propose to provide for the \nwelfare of District residents; it seeks to alter the fundamental \ncomposition of the House of Representatives.\n  This clause not only does not allow the Congress to change the law \nwithout a constitutional amendment; it is, in effect, a logical \nextension of the fact that the District requires some separate entity \nto make the laws and provide for its needs, and that, of course, as \nidentified in the Constitution, is the Congress. So, far from \nsupporting the case, it actually confirms the argument that the \nDistrict, not being a State, is not entitled to representation as a \nState.\n  Second, proponents of the bill correctly point out that there are \ncertain instances in the Constitution where references to citizens of \nthe States has been interpreted to include residents of the District of \nColumbia. Many of these cases, though, involve individual rights, and \nit is obvious that DC residents do not lose their rights as citizens of \nthe United States by choosing to live in the District. For example, \nthey retain the right to trial by jury, and they may bring civil suits \nin Federal court against citizens of other States and so on. The bill \nis not a bill about individual rights, such as free speech, the right \nto own firearms or to due process of law. It is a bill about the makeup \nof House of Representatives. It is about the delicate balance our \nconstitutional Framers struck in affording representation to the States \nin the House and the Senate, and it is about the fundamental structure \nof our Government.\n  Finally, there is actually nothing standing in the way of full \nrepresentation in the Congress for residents of the District. In fact, \nthere have been previous offers, and there will be another offer in the \ncontext of the debate on this bill to allow the residents of the \nDistrict of Columbia to vote as a congressional district of the State \nof Maryland. The retrocession amendment would also allow representation \nin the Senate as well. This is essentially what residents of Virginia \nhad when the land was retroceded to the State of Virginia that had \noriginally been carved out as part of the 10-mile square of the \nDistrict of Columbia. Up to now, the residents of the District have not \nseen fit to take advantage of this offer to have full representation in \nthe Congress as residents of the State of Maryland. But they will have \nthat opportunity again when an amendment is proposed in the context of \nthis legislation.\n  The bottom line is this: The District of Columbia residents do not \nsuffer from a lack of representation in terms of the general welfare of \nthe District. The Congress has been enormously generous and has ceded \njurisdiction to the city of the District of Columbia and provided \nfunding and other legislation to govern the District as called for \nunder article I.\n  Secondly, the Constitution of the United States could not be clearer \nabout the fact that representation is limited to the States of the \nUnion.\n  The District of Columbia being a Federal enclave, not being a State, \ntherefore, is not entitled to congressional representation, so the \nFederal District Court of the District of Columbia has held. The \nSupreme Court has declined to review that ruling, allowing it to stand. \nIt is my firm belief when this legislation, if it is passed, is \nchallenged, it will, in fact, be declared unconstitutional. Because of \nthat, it seems to me those of us in the Congress who respect the \nConstitution and this argument should oppose the legislation on the \ngrounds that we should never pass legislation that we believe to be \nunconstitutional in the hopes that the Congress will be overruled by \nthe Court and the Court will save us from the action we take.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time on my side and see if anybody \nelse on the other side wishes to speak.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, our vote today affects one of \nthe core issues of our democracy--the right to vote. It is a \nfundamental American principle that every citizen should have the right \nto vote and to participate in our democracy. Yet the nearly 600,000 \nresidents of the District of Columbia have no voting representative in \nCongress. Americans give up their right to vote for Members of Congress \nwhen they move to the Nation's Capital. It is long past time for us to \nfinally correct this basic wrong, and I commend Senators Lieberman and \nHatch for their strong leadership on this legislation.\n  The basic injustice is clear. Already this year, District of Columbia \nresidents have paid over $500 million in Federal taxes. Annually, they \nhave the second highest per capita tax burden in the Nation. But they \nare denied the basic right of congressional representation taken for \ngranted by other taxpaying Americans.\n  DC residents have fought and died to protect our Nation in every war \nin which America has participated since our Nation was founded. Since \nWorld War I, over 192,000 residents of the District of Columbia have \nserved in our Armed Forces, and more than 1,600 DC residents have given \ntheir lives in service to our Nation. Since the start of the current \nwars in Iraq and Afghanistan, nearly 3,000 DC residents have been \ndeployed in those countries and dozens of DC residents have been \nwounded or killed. There is no reason to deny representation in \nCongress to these patriotic veterans.\n  I have long been a strong supporter of DC representation in Congress. \nIn 1978, the District's nonvoting Delegate in the House, Walter \nFauntroy, our Senate majority leader, Robert Byrd, and I worked with \nmany others to pass a constitutional amendment to extend full voting \nrights to Americans living in the Nation's Capital. Congress passed \nthat constitutional amendment, but too few States ratified it, and it \nnever took effect.\n  Although I strongly supported that constitutional amendment, I do not \nbelieve that a constitutional amendment is the only valid option. In \n1978, we were following the precedent of the 23rd amendment, which was \napproved by Congress in June 1960 and was ratified by the States in \nMarch 1961 and which gave citizens of the District of Columbia the \nright to vote in Presidential elections. At the time, there was little \nopposition in the House to the amendment giving the District \ncongressional representation, and the Republican leaders in the Senate \nactively supported it. It passed the House by a vote of 289 to 127. The \nSenate passed it by a vote of 67 to 32, narrowly above the two-thirds \nmajority required for a constitutional amendment. Needless to say, we \nwere deeply disappointed by the failure of the States to ratify the \namendment, and that failure planted the seeds for the serious \nconsideration now of the statutory option for achieving the goal.\n  As the House and Senate hearings on the current bill make abundantly \nclear, the Constitution's District clause provides a valid means for \nacting by statute to grant citizens of the District of Columbia the \nright to vote in the House of Representatives. In testimony on the \nbill, numerous constitutional scholars have explained that article I, \nsection 8 of the Constitution grants Congress the authority ``to \nexercise exclusive Legislation, in all Cases whatsoever, over'' the \nDistrict of\n\n[[Page S2396]]\n\nColumbia. The Supreme Court has ruled that Congress's exclusive \nauthority over the District of Columbia is broad and ``national in the \nhighest sense.'' O'Donoghue v. United States, 289 U.S. 516, 539-40, \n1933.\n  Madam President, at this very moment as the Senate debates whether DC \ncitizens deserve a vote in Congress, many brave Americans born in the \nDistrict of Columbia are fighting for democracy in Iraq. If we are for \ndemocracy in Iraq and Afghanistan, we cannot oppose democracy in the \nDistrict of Columbia. If we believe in the principles of ``one person, \none vote'' and government by the consent of the governed on which our \nNation was founded, we must support this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for cloture on the motion to proceed to \nthis long overdue legislation and to support final passage of the bill \nso that we can finally correct this historic wrong.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I rise today to discuss the District of \nColumbia House Voting Rights Act.\n  This legislation, if passed, is an unprecedented action. For the \nfirst time in history, Congress will grant the District of Columbia a \nvoting seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. For decades, citizens \nof the District of Columbia have fought for their right to vote in \nCongress.\n  But this legislation sets precedence in another way. The bill we \ndiscuss today does not provide merely one additional seat in the House \nof Representatives. It adds two. The second seat is given to Utah.\n  For the first time in history, Congress will specifically set out in \nlegislation an additional seat in Congress for an existing State.\n  This measure is included in this bill not because of the belief that \nthe people of Utah are in the same position as those living in the \nDistrict of Columbia. Instead, this additional seat is included in the \nlegislation in an effort to balance the supposed political makeup of \nthe two new districts--one Republican and one Democratic.\n  I do not support the reasons behind this second additional seat, and \nthus, I cannot vote in support of this bill.\n  The State of Utah failed to obtain an additional seat in the last \napportionment by a narrow margin. Many in the State felt the \nreapportionment was unfair. In fact, the State of Utah took its \nargument all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court but lost that battle in \ncourt.\n  But Utah is not unique. The people of the State of Montana can \nrelate. Mr. President, I would like to share with you today Montana's \nstory.\n  In the 1910 reapportionment, with a population of 243,000, Montana \ngained an additional seat in the House of Representatives, for a total \nof 2 seats. But 80 years later following the 1990 census, 8 States \ngained a total of 19 additional seats in the House of Representatives, \nand 13 States lost an equal number.\n  Montana was one of those States. With a population of over 800,000, \nMontana lost 1 seat, reducing its voice in the House in half. Losing \nthis seat established the State of Montana as the largest single \ncongressional district in the United States.\n  In 1990, the average size of the 435 congressional districts was \n572,466 people. From 1910 to 1990, Montana's population increased by \n563,000 people roughly the size of a modern congressional district.\n  Yet in 1990, Montana lost a congressional seat. In fact, if Montana \nhad retained its two districts, each would have been closer to the \nideal, average district size than the single congressional district.\n  The State of Montana--just like Utah--sued the U.S. Department of \nCommerce, asserting the reapportionment was unconstitutional. A three-\njudge district court panel ruled in favor of the State of Montana. The \ndistrict court held that the principle of equal representation for \nequal number of people as applied to State districting by the U.S. \nSupreme Court in 1964, should also be applied to the apportionment of \nseats among the States.\n  The U.S. Government appealed the decision. On March 2, 1992, the U.S. \nSupreme Court held oral arguments on the case. I attended the oral \narguments, sitting behind then-attorney general for Montana Marc \nRacicot, as he argued on behalf of the State of Montana.\n  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court reversed the district court \ndecision, upholding the reapportionment and Montana's lost seat.\n  The people of Montana accepted that fate and patiently waited for the \nnext reapportionment, hoping to obtain the second seat Montana lost 10 \nyears earlier. Early estimates were promising. The 1995 projection for \n2000 census estimated that Montana would regain its second seat.\n  However, Montana came up short in the 2000 census. Though Montana's \npopulation grew by 12.9 percent, nearly matching the national rate, \nMontana's congressional representation remained the same. In fact, the \nState came up only 8,000 people short of the number needed, just nine-\ntenths of 1 percent of the State's population. Only Utah missed gaining \nanother seat with a narrower margin.\n  Marc Racicot, then-Governor of Montana in 2000, said the unfairness \nof having such a large district was obvious. The ability of one person \nto represent over 900,000 is substantially strained, he said.\n  Today, the State of Montana remains the single most populated \ncongressional district in the United States, at a population over \n947,000--far larger than the average population per district of \n625,000.\n  But mere population doesn't tell the whole story.\n  The State of Montana is the fourth largest State in the country. With \nover 145,000 square miles, Montana is bigger than the District of \nColumbia, Maryland, Virginia, and North Carolina combined. It is larger \nthan all of New England.\n  Though Montana may not be the biggest congressional district based on \nland mass--Alaska has us beat--Montana's population is spread out more \nevenly across the State's vast area. Billings, Montana's largest \n``city,'' only just recently surpassed 100,000 people.\n  In Montana, we don't distinguish between rural and nonrural. Rural is \na matter of degree, as it compares to an increasingly more urban and \nsuburban Nation.\n  This bill should be about the District of Columbia and the merits of \nawarding the taxpayers of the District their right to vote in Congress. \nIndeed, the bill itself is called the District of Columbia House Voting \nRights Act. But to strike a political deal to maintain the status quo \nin the Halls of Congress is something I cannot support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado.) The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Arizona, Mr. \nKyl, that Senator Durbin, the senior Senator from Illinois, is on his \nway to speak for 5 minutes. Senator Kyl has raised some important \nconstitutional questions. I spoke to them briefly in my opening \nstatement. Senator Hatch spoke at more length. It will undoubtedly \nconsume a great deal of discussion, assuming we invoke cloture when we \nvote in approximately 15 minutes. I will wait to respond until then and \nremind my colleagues, of course, that on the constitutional question, I \nthink it is at least arguable--I believe it is more than arguable. I \nbelieve the proposal before the Senate today is clearly constitutional \nand has been acknowledged as such by a wide array of experts--left, \ncenter, right--but that will be determined by the Chamber.\n  I remind my colleagues what we are voting on today is whether we are \ngoing to take up this bill. The basic reality is that a grave injustice \nhas been done to the residents of this District. Mr. President, 600,000 \nAmericans do not have voting representation in Congress just because \nthey happen to live in our Nation's Capital, the only democracy in the \nworld where that is so. It is an embarrassment. I think my friends who \noppose this bill agree; we just disagree on the constitutionality of \nthis proposal.\n  I ask everyone, please vote for cloture. Let's at least give the \nresidents of the District their day in the Senate and hopefully we will \ngo on to enact this legislation. But this bill certainly at least \ndeserves to be debated.\n  I reserve the remainder of the time on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I understand the time on the Democratic side \nhas expired, but when Senator Durbin arrives, I will yield him \nRepublican time\n\n[[Page S2397]]\n\nto make his statement, if he would like to do that.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. I thank my friend for his generosity.\n  Mr. KYL. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding there is a vote \nscheduled for 11:15 a.m.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I don't know if any time has been allotted between now \nand 11:15.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I say to the Senator from Illinois, we \nactually used all our time. Senator Kyl graciously offered the Senator \nfrom Illinois the final 5 minutes of their time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut does have 1 \nminute remaining.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. One minute of mine and four of his.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank my gracious colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, the Senate is debating whether to have a \nvote this week on a very important bill called the District of Columbia \nHouse Voting Rights Act of 2009. This bill would finally give voting \nrights to the people of the District of Columbia after 200 years. I am \na cosponsor and supporter of this measure; I have been since the \nearlier days of my service in the House.\n  I find it unimaginable in modern America that 600,000 Americans have \nno voice and no vote in the U.S. Congress. It is a fact. It reflects \ndecisions made long ago about whether the District of Columbia and its \nresidents would be represented in Congress. There is a good reason they \nshould be.\n  The right to vote is one of the most fundamental in the United \nStates. Over a century ago, the Supreme Court called the right to vote \n``a fundamental political right'' and a right that is ``preservative of \nall rights.''\n  It is unconscionable that we would ask the men and women in the \nDistrict of Columbia to fight and risk their lives so the people of \nIraq and Afghanistan have the right to vote, but we do not extend that \nsame right to the citizens of the District of Columbia.\n  Seven DC residents have died on the battlefields of Iraq and \nAfghanistan: SPC Darryl Dent, LCpl Greg MacDonald, MAJ Kevin Shea, LTC \nPaul Kimbrough, CPT Darrell Lewis, SGT Randy Lewis Johnson, Jr., and \nSPC Keisha Marie Morgan. They were unable to fully participate in \ndemocracy in the town from which they came.\n  Opponents of the DC voting rights bill say they have constitutional \nconcerns. They point to language in the Constitution that says the \nHouse of Representatives will be composed of Members chosen by ``the \npeople of the several States.'' They argue that the District of \nColumbia is a district, not a State.\n  I do not think that is a strong argument. Our Federal judiciary has \nlong treated the District of Columbia as a State for many purposes. For \nexample, DC residents pay Federal income tax, serve on Federal juries, \nand register for Selective Service. Why should the right to vote be \ndifferent?\n  Do opponents of DC voting rights believe that residents of America's \nCapital City should bear the full responsibilities of citizenship but \nnot deserve the full rights of citizenship?\n  It is not just Democrats who believe the DC voting bill is \nconstitutional. Many prominent Republicans agree. I am pleased that a \nhalf dozen of my Senate Republican colleagues have voted in the past \nfor this bill. Listen to the words of conservative constitutional \nscholar Kenneth Starr. It is not often I have quoted him. He is not \nsomeone with whom I frequently see eye to eye. He coauthored a \nWashington Post op-ed and said:\n\n       There is nothing in our Constitution's history or its \n     fundamental principles suggesting that the Framers intended \n     to deny the precious right to vote to those who live in the \n     capital of the great democracy they founded.\n\n  I conclude by saying that I have served in the Senate now for a \nlittle over 12 years and the House 14 years before. I have seen the \nCongress treat the District of Columbia many times in a way that I \nfound unacceptable, sometimes embarrassing. There are many Members of \nCongress whose obvious lifelong ambition is to serve as the mayor of a \ncity--they cannot wait to be the Mayor of the District of Columbia--by \nthe laws we pass on the floor of the House and Senate. We have denied \nto these people a voice in that process. We have made basic and \nfundamental decisions for the residents of this city which many of us \nnever would have imposed on the city we represent. But they have been \nused as a laboratory for political debate and political experiment.\n  It is time that the people of this great Capital City have a voice in \nthe Halls of Congress, at least in the House of Representatives. This \nbill is an important step forward in extending the opportunity for \nparticipation in our democracy and the opportunity for freedom. In this \n21st century, we can do no less. I hope the new day, the change we are \nseeing in America, will be seen in the District of Columbia soon when \nthey are given the right to have a voice in the Congress.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I may, before the vote goes off, I \nsimply wish to note that in addition to the names I indicated in my \nopening statement who are cosponsors of S. 160, Senator Specter of \nPennsylvania and Senator Schumer of New York have also joined.\n  And on behalf of my colleagues, I would note the presence in the \nChamber and welcome the Honorable Mayor of the District of Columbia, \nAdrian Fenty, and the honorable and eloquent and aggrieved Delegate \nfrom the District, Eleanor Holmes Norton.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order and pursuant to rule \nXXII, the Chair lays before the Senate the pending cloture motion, \nwhich the clerk will state.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     proceed to S. 160, the District of Columbia House Voting \n     Rights Act of 2009.\n         Harry Reid, Joseph I.

By unanimous consent, the mandatory quorum \ncall has been waived.\n  The question is, Is it the sense of the Senate that debate on the \nmotion to proceed to S. 160, the District of Columbia House Voting \nRights Act of 2009, shall be brought to a close? The yeas and nays are \nmandatory under the rule.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

SOLIS TO BE SECRETARY OF LABOR\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will go \ninto executive session and the clerk will report the nomination.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Hilda L. \nSolis, of California, to be Secretary of Labor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time on this nomination will be equally \ndivided until 4:30 p.m. today.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the Senate is not in order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will suspend. The Senate will be \nin order. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, the business before the Senate is now the \nnomination of President Obama's nominee as Secretary of Labor, U.S. \nRepresentative Hilda Solis.\n  My colleagues on the Senate HELP Committee worked together to move \nforward Hilda Solis's nomination. I have come to the floor today to \nurge the full Senate to join me in supporting her confirmation so we \ncan fill this critically important Cabinet position as soon as \npossible.\n  Today, America's families are facing incredible challenges. They are \nstruggling with record unemployment and a devastating economic crisis. \nThey need and they deserve an advocate in the administration who is \npassionate about public service and committed to fighting for them. \nRepresentative Solis is that person. I want to share today a part of \nher HELP Committee testimony. If confirmed, Hilda Solis wrote that we \nhave her solemn commitment to ``work hard every day to ensure that \nmiddle-class families do not lose hope.''\n  I thank Representative Solis for her willingness to answer President \nObama's call to serve. She has been very responsive to the questions \nthat were submitted to her by the HELP Committee. She has been a \ndedicated public servant, and she has an extensive public record of \nsupporting working families. Moving forward on this nomination this \nafternoon will send a crucial message to working families that we \nunderstand their needs and that they are absolutely essential to our \neconomic recovery efforts. We cannot afford to wait.\n  For anyone who is unfamiliar with her background, I would like to \nshare with you a little bit about Representative Solis. She was born in \nCalifornia and grew up as one of seven children. Her mother was an \nimmigrant from Nicaragua. Her father worked as a farmworker, a railroad \nworker, and a Teamsters shop steward in a battery recycling plant. He \nraised his family to understand that joining a union had helped them \nsecure a place in America's middle class. Her parents stressed values \nsuch as education and hard work, public service and commitment to \nfamily.\n  Even though they could not afford to go to college themselves, her \nmother and father sacrificed to make sure their children would reach \ntheir full potential.\n  With the support of her family and the help of Pell grants and \nstudent loans, Hilda Solis became the first in her family to graduate \nfrom college. Her sisters followed in her footsteps. One earned a Ph.D. \nin public health and two others became engineers. Thanks to the values \nshe grew up with, Hilda Solis always worked to give back to her \ncommunity. She has served as the director of the California Student \nOpportunity and Access Program, and as a college trustee, because she \nwanted to ensure that other students\n\n[[Page S2400]]\n\ncould have the same opportunity she did to get a college degree.\n  In 1992 she expanded her service to the public arena and was elected \nto the California State Assembly. In 1994, she became the first Latino \nState senator in California. As a State lawmaker, she wrote a record 17 \nlaws to protect victims of domestic violence. She championed worker \nrights. She helped small businesses, and she worked to strengthen the \neconomy.\n  Hilda Solis's achievements and service to students, to her State, and \nto the U.S. House of Representatives are proof that anything is \npossible in America, no matter what your background is. She is an \nexample of why we have to ensure that every child and every family has \na chance to succeed. Her experience is a quintessential example of the \nAmerican dream. I should add I feel a very close connection to her \nbecause her background is not that different from my own. I too am one \nof seven children of loving, committed parents who taught us that with \nhard work anything is possible in America. My family faced very tough \ntimes when I was young. When my dad developed MS, we depended on food \nstamps for a while. My brothers, sisters, and I all were able to go on \nfor college because of Pell grants and student loans.\n  Like Hilda Solis, I grew up believing that everyone can succeed if we \ngive them a fighting chance. That is part of the reason why I know she \nwill join me in fighting day and night for our working families in our \nstruggling economy today.\n  Not only is Hilda Solis the right choice to serve as Labor Secretary, \nI want to emphasize how critical it is for us to move forward and fill \nthis Cabinet position. For the last 8 years, working families have felt \nlike an afterthought of the previous administration. I can tell you, as \nchair of the Employment and Workplace Safety Committee, it is long past \ntime for a change. I am hopeful that the Department of Labor will soon \nhave a leader who stands ready to help the Department fulfill its very \ncore responsibilities to America's working men and women.\n  For years, I have said, if you do not invest in the growth and \ndevelopment of America's workforce, our families, our communities and \nour Nation will suffer in the long run. Now, today, with the \nunemployment at 7.6 percent, with 3 million jobs lost over the past \nyear, and literally thousands of more pink slips going out every month, \nwith hundreds of thousands of new unemployment insurance claims being \nfiled every week, workers need an advocate in the new administration \nwho will stand up for them. They need someone who believes, as I do, \nthat investing in them is investing in our future. They need someone \nwho believes that their Government should work for them during the good \ntimes and help them succeed during the hard times. They need someone \nwho will be their voice in every economic recovery discussion.\n  As we all work very hard to help our economy recover and grow again, \nI believe three things are very clear: First, we need to create new \njobs and help Americans who are out of work or underemployed find \nemployment that ensures they are able to stay in the middle class.\n  Secondly, we need to help low-skilled and low-earning workers get the \nskills they need to find family wage jobs in healthy industries, so \nthey can become part of the middle class.\n  And, third, we need to make smart investments that will create jobs, \nincrease worker training, and make us more productive and competitive \nin the global economy. I am confident that as Labor Secretary, Hilda \nSolis will join me in working to reach those goals.\n  Our working families deserve a workforce system that is innovative, \nthat is modern, and can meet the needs of the millions of unemployed \nand underemployed American workers. I am confident she is committed to \nmaking the reauthorization of our Nation's workforce system a top \npriority of her first year.\n  I look forward to working with her to help ensure families can \nbalance the competing needs of work and home by expanding job-protected \nleave and other family-friendly work policies.\n  To be fully productive, workers need to know that their employers and \ntheir Government are doing everything they can to ensure they are safe \nand they are healthy on the job.\n  Finally, I look forward to working with her to make OSHA and MSHA \nproactive agencies again where the health and the safety of our workers \nis their first priority. We have a lot of big challenges ahead of us in \nthis country, but we also have a very big opportunity.\n  I know that together we can help our workers access training for 21st \ncentury careers, including the emerging green jobs we hear so much \nabout; we can help our workers balance the needs of home and careers \nand help them keep safe on the job. We can work to protect their rights \nto organize and secure a better economic future for themselves; and, \nultimately, we can help our working families improve their quality of \nlife.\n  Now, more than ever, workers deserve a leader who is dedicated to \nseeing them succeed. I look forward to working with Secretary Solis and \nthe Department to do that. I encourage all of our colleagues to support \nthis critical nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I want to follow the comments of the Senator \nfrom Washington, being the ranking member on the committee that worked \non this nomination. I thank Senator Kennedy, Senator Murray, and other \nSenators on the committee for their help, cooperation, and due \ndiligence on this matter.\n  I would be remiss if I did not thank Secretary Elaine Chao for the \neffort she put in during the time she was in office. I would mention \nthat she made some of the first changes to OSHA and we made the first \nchange in MSHA in 28 years while she was in office. It was a very \nbipartisan effort that we made, worked on both sides of the aisle, and \ndone in 6 weeks, which is a record time for any of the committees \naround here to go through the regular process. There are other things \nwe need to do in both OSHA and MSHA. I hope we have a chance to work on \nthat.\n  I am here today to discuss the nomination of Representative Hilda \nSolis to serve as Secretary of Labor. This nomination followed regular \norder and worked through the committee process. Carefully reviewing \nnominations for Cabinet positions through the regular order is critical \nto fulfilling our constitutional advice and consent obligations.\n  As Senators, one of our most important responsibilities is confirming \nqualified and hopefully superior nominees to lead our executive \nagencies. In order to fulfill our responsibilities under the advice and \nconsent clause properly, we have developed a process for vetting the \nPresident's nominees, all Presidents' nominees.\n  This vetting process typically includes a committee hearing, which \nencompasses a review of the nominee's credentials; a background check \nto screen for conflicts of interest, often related to financial \nholdings or associations with outside groups; followed by a markup and \nfloor consideration, which is what we are doing today.\n  I am pleased that we are proceeding in this fashion with respect to \nthe nominee for the Secretary of Labor. Representative Solis has a \ndiverse background and a compelling personal story. Her life is one \nthat epitomizes the American dream. Her dedication to public service is \nadmirable, and it should serve as an example to young people \neverywhere.\n\n  Once confirmed, as chief Labor official, she is charged with \noverseeing job training programs, private pension plans, veterans \nemployment and training issues, protecting America's workers' \noccupational safety and health, as well as ensuring mine safety and \nhealth, to name a very few of the things.\n  The Labor Secretary manages an annual budget of approximately $53 \nbillion and nearly 17,000 full-time employees. Unfortunately, based on \nmy review of her background, I am concerned about a lack of management \nexperience that is needed to meet the demands of the job, even though I \nrecognize that it is the President's prerogative in selecting his \nCabinet.\n  In reviewing this nomination, we followed the same due diligence and \nbackground check that we follow for all nominees in both this \nadministration and the previous administration. Unfortunately, we were \nnot able to act on\n\n[[Page S2401]]\n\nthis nomination for over a month because the nominee had numerous \nerrors and omissions in the documents she filed with the committee in \nher application, as well as the financial disclosures to the House of \nRepresentatives, going back several years, and the Office of Government \nEthics.\n  Because of these errors, we had to reconstruct her application and \nher financial statements to remove the possibility of any conflict of \ninterest. If we had not faced these paperwork problems, we probably \nwould have been able to vote on her nomination in January.\n  One of the conflict of interest issues that concerns me most is \nRepresentative Solis's position as a treasurer, a position with \nfiduciary responsibilities, of a 501(c)(4), a not-for-profit lobbying \nfirm. As an accountant and the coauthor of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, I \ncan assure my colleagues that there is no such thing as an ``honorary'' \ntreasurer of a 501(c)(4) organization that lobbies Congress. So-called \n``honorary'' positions are reserved for board of director positions on \n501(c)(3) charitable organizations but not positions with a fiduciary \nresponsibility, such as treasurers or general counsels for 501(c)(4) \ngroups.\n  I was also deeply troubled to learn that this entity has filed \nlobbying disclosure paperwork with the House of Representatives that \nshows it lobbies in support of bills that Representative Solis \ncosponsored and in which she would be involved as the top Labor \nofficial in the executive branch.\n  To address these concerns, I have obtained from Representative Solis \na sworn affidavit that she has no check-writing or signing authority as \ntreasurer for this 501(c)(4) entity, nor does she have any control over \nthe ability to control this entity's expenditures for campaign ads. \nThis affidavit goes a long way to showing that no conflict of interest \nappears to have taken place.\n  In addition, the entity has filed amended filings with the Federal \nElection Commission that do not list Representative Solis as being \nresponsible for any monies going toward the campaign ads.\n  To avoid any future conflict of interest, I hope and expect that \nSpeaker Pelosi will immediately amend the House ethics rules to \nprohibit Members of Congress from serving in a position of fiduciary \nresponsibility for 501(c)(4) board organizations. It is a blatant \nconflict of interest, not allowed in the Senate, and the House of \nRepresentatives should prohibit it immediately.\n  Additionally, the press recently reported that there were unpaid tax \nliens related to Representative Solis's husband's small auto repair \nbusiness. It now appears that all of the outstanding liens are paid, \nand all of them were her husband's liens. I have obtained a letter from \nthe County of Los Angeles treasurer and tax collector verifying that \nthe county liens have been released.\n  My staff also held a conference call with officials from the State of \nCalifornia and received word that all outstanding state liens have been \nreleased. Of equal importance, I am concerned that Representative Solis \nsimply failed to fully respond to a host of very basic labor policy \nquestions posed at the committee in the hearing and in writing.\n  The nominee dodged legitimate questions relating to the Employee Free \nChoice Act, right-to-work laws, employment standards, and overtime \nregulations, to name a few. This is not a nomination for a judicial \nposition where a nominee quite understandably should not be expected to \nrespond to hypotheticals involving cases that might come before her. \nThis is a policy post, and policy questions deserve full answers from \nany nominee. I am disappointed that we did not receive them, and \nequally disappointed that her reticence to discuss them precluded us \nfrom having a more thoughtful and necessary discussion of her views.\n  I was very disappointed when President Obama issued an executive \norder that discriminates against the 94.7 percent of the construction \nworkers in Wyoming who are nonunion members, and 84.4 percent of \nconstruction workers nationwide. The order reverses the Bush policy of \nneutrality on Government contracts and instead encourages agencies to \nrequire their private contractors to engage in collective bargaining \nagreements on contracts of $25 million or more. During the confirmation \nproceedings, I asked the nominee whether she would support the neutral \nBush policy. Her response was that she had not studied it nor \nparticipated in discussions about repealing it. Now that it has been \nrepealed, I hope she will study the issue closely and urge the \nadministration not to further expand the executive order to smaller \ncontracts.\n  I am very concerned that the administration is choosing to limit \naccess to good construction projects at a time when construction \nunemployment is extremely high and a tremendous amount of taxpayer \ndollars is being spent on building projects. In many communities, the \nonly construction projects bid on may well be Federal and not be \nrestricted to 15.6 percent of construction workers who are \nunionized. This policy excludes many small and local contractors and \nalso disadvantages women and minority employees who are less likely to \nbe union members. Reserving the spoils of the stimulus bill for large \nunionized contractors seems to me the exact wrong policy for the \ncurrent economic crisis. I hope Secretary Solis will take a careful \nstudy of these concerns and advise the administration that a neutral \npolicy achieves the most equitable result and, even more importantly, \nwill ensure that taxpayers get the most for their money.\n\n  Finally, I would also like to mention that prior to her hearing, \nRepresentative Solis and I discussed the Workforce Investment Act and \nhow we need to reauthorize it immediately. I have been working on that \nfor about 4 years, and we passed it unanimously through the Senate \nbefore, and it would train 900,000 workers for higher skilled jobs. I \ndo not understand why we cannot get it through both bodies and get it \nconferenced and get it enacted. Instead of training people to get \nhigher skilled jobs, we keep sending the jobs over to India and China \nand other places. So at a time when our economy is being challenged to \ncreate jobs that will bolster our infrastructure and our competitive \nedge in the 21st century, the skills of our workforce have not kept \npace. We cannot afford to overlook the importance of providing lifelong \naccess to quality education and training in our workforce. That is why \nI strongly believe we must renew and improve the Workforce Investment \nAct. Governors from States all over ask for more flexibility so they \ncan actually use the money in that act. That is a law that would help \nprovide American workers with the skills necessary to compete in the \nglobal economy.\n  I look forward to working with Representative Solis in her new \nCabinet position as Secretary of Labor, and her staff, on this and many \nother labor and economic issues facing our country.\n  I know Members of the Senate are anxious to have a permanent Labor \nSecretary in place.

It took longer than I would have liked to \ncomplete the necessary vetting, and, again, I wish to thank all my \ncolleagues for their patience and help in allowing us to work through \nthe regular order to ensure we fulfill our duties under the \nConstitution. Now that we have done our due diligence, we can move to \nhave this nomination confirmed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe following documents: the affidavit from Representative Solis \nstating she did not have check-signing authority for American Rights at \nWork or control of their lobbying or campaign expenditures; and a \nstatement from the Los Angeles County treasurer and Tax Collector's \noffice stating that all liens relating to Representative Solis' \nhusband's small business have been released.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       Declaration of Hilda Solis\n\n       1.

SOLIS, OF CALIFORNIA, TO BE SECRETARY OF LABOR--\n                               Continued\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, we are on the Solis nomination this \nafternoon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following Senators on our side be \nrecognized to speak: Senator Menendez for 10 minutes, Senator Sanders \nfor 15 minutes, Senator Dodd for 15 minutes, and Senator Boxer for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. To speak in that order?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. No. These Senators requested that time, and we will go \nback and forth in the usual fashion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I rise today to give my strong support \nto President Obama's choice to lead the Department of Labor.\n  It is hard to stress enough how urgent it is for us to have a Labor \nSecretary at work in the face of this economic crisis: 3.6 million \nAmericans have lost their jobs since this recession began in December \nof 2007--almost 600,000 in the last month alone--workers are losing \ntheir health care, their pensions, and their life savings.\n  The American men and women who have been damaged the worst by the \nfinancial crisis we have had--the worst financial crisis in \ngenerations--need full unemployment benefits to carry their families \nthrough this period of transition and the benefit of job training to be \nable to meet the challenges of the 21st century economy.\n  Those who still have a job to go to every day need a champion for \ntheir rights and their safety. As the American people struggle through \nthese difficult economic times, it is more important than ever to have \na fully functioning and fully staffed Department of Labor.\n  At this moment, we need a Secretary of Labor who believes workers \nshould not be intimidated when they try to organize. We need a \nSecretary of Labor who believes that after decades of stagnation, it is \ntime for wages to rise. We need a Secretary of Labor who believes it is \nnot acceptable for women to make 78 cents for every dollar a man earns, \nfor African Americans to earn 80 cents and Latinos to earn 68 cents for \nevery dollar their white counterparts earn.\n  Some will argue that a recession is an inconvenient time to pay \nworkers a fair wage or to protect them from exposure to dangerous \nchemicals because the economy will suffer under the weight of \nadditional benefits or rights for employees. We need a Secretary who \nunderstands how false that argument is.\n  For 8 years, we have seen administration policies punish workers for \ntheir efforts and treat their rights in a way that ultimately can't \nsustain their hopes, dreams, aspirations, and their families.\n  The Bush administration virtually gutted the Department of Labor, \ndrastically cutting its budget, choosing instead to trust CEOs and big \nbusiness to look after the welfare of workers. In 8 years, the \nDepartment issued only one worker safety rule on its own accord. While \nthe Department was neglecting to address safety in the workplace, it \nfocused its attention on helping corporate interests weaken the rules \nfor overtime compensation. After 8 years, we have seen who actually \nbenefits from these policies: No one.\n  We now know that being pro-labor is pro-economic growth. We know a \nrising tide of wages can lift the ships of business as well, as \nAmerican workers are also the customers who purchase our products and \nservices. It is time we acted on a clear principle: An economy that \nworks is an economy that works for everyone.\n  I can think of no one better to take up the challenge than Hilda \nSolis. She has the best interests of American workers in her heart and \nher blood. She is the daughter of union workers, the first in her \nfamily to go to college. I had the privilege of serving with her in the \nHouse of Representatives. She has served the people of southern \nCalifornia in Congress for 8 years, not just advocating for their \nrights but for recovery, not just expanded help for workers but \ncreating jobs to expand the workforce. She knows that with the right \ninvestments, we will fuel the creation of millions of green jobs, bring \ndown energy costs and end our dependence on foreign oil.\n  She has won friends on both sides of the aisle, and even when they \ndon't agree with her on every issue, they cannot help but respect her \nwork ethic, her intelligence, and her integrity. I know very much so \nthat she is eminently capable to lead the Department of Labor. Also \npeople throughout the country cannot help but admire history in the \nmaking. Hilda Solis would be the first Latina to hold the position of \nSecretary in a President's Cabinet. That is incredibly powerful for \nyoung Latinas across this country, a growing part of America's \npopulation who will look to a Hilda Solis and say that in fact \neverything is possible.\n  I look forward to voting to confirm her today because America's \nworkforce and our economy cannot afford to wait.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Jersey for \nsupporting the nomination of Hilda Solis to be President Obama's choice \nto lead the Department of Labor. I too rise in support of this \nnomination. Having served in a President's Cabinet myself and gone \nthrough this arduous and difficult process of confirmation, I adhere to \nthe principle that a President should get the right to nominate his \nCabinet and should have the opportunity to name the people he chooses \nto work with. It is, obviously, up to the\n\n[[Page S2403]]\n\nSenate to confirm and ratify those nominations but, assuming \nqualifications, it is something that ought to be forthcoming.\n  I may have some policy differences with the nominee. I am sure that, \nfrom time to time, we may look at the world a little differently. I am \nsure I do not endorse everything my dear friend and colleague just said \nabout the prior 8 years punishing workers and things of that nature. \nBut I do believe it is important that we come together to recognize a \nfine American. Having looked at Congresswoman Solis's record, and the \ntestimony before the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, \nand her answers to the committee's questions, I am satisfied that she \ncarries the qualifications and will serve the Department of Labor with \ngreat distinction as Secretary.\n  Congresswoman Solis graduated from California State Polytechnic \nUniversity in Pomona and earned a Master's in Public Administration \nfrom the University of Southern California.\n  She worked in the White House for President Carter in the Office of \nHispanic Affairs, and was later appointed as a management analyst with \nthe Office of Management and Budget in the civil rights division.\n  As a member of the California State Senate back in 1996, she led a \nsuccessful effort to raise the State's minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.75 \nan hour.\n  As U.S. Representative for California's 32nd district, she authored \nlegislation that sought to protect and improve working conditions and \nthe rights of farm workers, garment workers, the construction industry, \njanitors, State and local employees, and many others.\n  She authored the Green Jobs Act of 2007, an effort aimed at promoting \njob creation and renewable energy, which was signed into law as part of \nthe 2007 omnibus.\n  I know there is a dynamic and unique relationship between the \nexecutive and legislative branches. We may not always see eye to eye on \nthe issues. We may modify the President's proposals significantly \nthrough the committee and amendment process. But we always respect each \nother's positions and priorities.\n  Congresswoman Solis has demonstrated hard work and experience. Her \nlife is an inspiration to many. In the areas of labor, health care, and \nthe environment, she has made her mark and has done a tremendous job to \nhighlight the issues and many problems throughout our country that \nurgently need attention. She has done that with competence, diligence, \nand tremendous determination. She will bring those same qualities to \nthe Department of Labor as the Secretary of Labor.\n  I had the pleasure of working with the prior Secretary of Labor, who \nhas a relationship with the Senate--Secretary Chao. She and I served in \nthe Cabinet together. She served for 8 years in that role. Sometimes we \nfaced many challenges, and I am sure that upon her confirmation, Hilda \nSolis will serve with distinction as well. But she will also be faced \nwith many challenges, particularly in this difficult labor environment. \nThere is no question, with unemployment at record highs, and continuing \nto rise, this is the time when the Secretary of Labor will be in a \nposition where leadership can emanate throughout this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the confirmation of Congresswoman \nHilda Solis to be the next Secretary of Labor. She will be making \nhistory as the first Hispanic woman to serve in a President's Cabinet. \nI understand something about that, and I look forward to working with \nher in that capacity. It is a great day for America when we can see \nthat people can rise as a result of the opportunities that this country \nopens up to all those who seek them.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator is recognized.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by saying that I have not \nsupported all of President Obama's nominations, but I am on the floor \ntoday to very proudly and enthusiastically support the nomination of \nHilda Solis to be our next Secretary of Labor.\n  As a former Member of the House, I have had the honor and privilege \nof working with Congresswoman Solis on a number of very important \nissues over the years. I consider Congresswoman Solis not only an \noutstanding Member of that body but also a very good friend.\n  In my view, there are very few Members of Congress who have spent as \nmany years as she has in the fight to expand the middle class, in the \nfight to address the problems of poverty, in the fight to make sure all \nof our fellow Americans have health care as a right. I believe very \nstrongly that Hilda Solis will make an excellent--excellent--Secretary \nof the Department of Labor.\n  When I left the House and moved to the Senate, I was delighted to \nwork with Congresswoman Solis to create the Green Jobs Workforce \nTraining Program. This important initiative will not only lead to the \ncreation of decent-paying jobs all over this country but will also help \nus combat the scourge of global warming and our dependence on foreign \noil and help us move aggressively away from fossil fuels.\n  Mr. President, as you well know, millions of Americans from \nCalifornia to the State of Vermont are caught up in the worst economic \ncrisis this country has faced since the Great Depression. Our people by \nthe millions are losing their jobs. Our people are losing their homes. \nThey are losing their health insurance. They are losing their pensions. \nThey are losing their ability to send their kids to college. And \nperhaps most significantly, they are losing their hope, their belief \nthat the American dream is still alive, that their kids will have at \nleast a good, if not better, standard of living than our generation \nhas.\n  Millions of American workers in recent years have seen their wages go \ndown, and they are working longer hours for lower wages. During the \nlast 8 years, some 7 million American workers have lost their health \ncare; millions are unable to find quality childcare despite the fact \nthat husband and wife are both working, and they just do not know what \nto do with their kids; and millions of Americans are wondering right \nnow whether the dream of a college education will, in fact, be \navailable to their kids.\n  What has happened over the last 8 years is, as the middle class has \nshrunk, poverty has increased, while the gap between the very wealthy \nand everybody else has grown wider. The United States of America can do \nbetter than that. Instead of seeing the middle class shrink and poverty \nincrease, we have to see poverty go down and the middle class expand.\n  The American people and the workers of this country are entitled to \nhave a Secretary of Labor who will stand with them, who will be \naggressive in fighting for the rights of workers from California to \nVermont. The truth is that no Secretary of Labor, no matter how great \nhe or she may be, is going to solve all of the important problems \nfacing our country. But what working people have a right to know is \nthat they will have a Secretary of Labor who, in fact, understands what \nlabor is about and is on the side of working people; a Secretary of \nLabor who is committed to protecting workers throughout the country \nfrom unscrupulous employers who try to steal their pay and threaten \ntheir health and safety to pad the bottom line and enrich the CEOs on \ntop. And God only knows we have seen a lot of that over the last 8 \nyears. For far too long, we have had a Labor Department that was more \ninterested in protecting the actions of bad, unscrupulous employers \nthan protecting the needs of hard-working employees. That has to \nchange. When President Obama nominated Hilda Solis for Secretary of \nLabor, I think he sent a signal all over the country that that is going \nto change, that the rights of workers are going to be protected.\n  There is perhaps no more challenging time to be Secretary of Labor \nthan at this very moment. The problems workers are experiencing are \nenormous. But, frankly, I cannot think of any person who is more up to \nthe task at hand than Hilda Solis. Her character and\n\n[[Page S2404]]\n\nher work ethic are impeccable. Most of all, she will be a tireless \nadvocate for working families throughout this country. For millions of \nAmerican workers struggling to make ends meet, Congresswoman Solis is, \nindeed, a breath of fresh air.\n  I will be strongly supporting the Secretary of Labor nominee Hilda \nSolis, and I hope all of my colleagues will as well.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, what is the business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nomination of Hilda Solis to be Secretary \nof Labor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak on behalf of \nCongresswoman Hilda Solis to be our new Secretary of Labor. Before I \nbegin, on behalf of all of us, regardless of which side of the \nproverbial aisle we sit on, I know we wish Senator Ted Kennedy the very \nbest. He will be back in a matter of days and once again will be \ninvolved in the daily business of the Senate. Were he here at this \nmoment, he would be adding his very strong and vibrant voice in support \nof this excellent nominee to be the new Secretary of Labor, Hilda \nSolis.\n  We all know these are tough economic times. It hardly needs to be \nsaid. The American people are living it every minute of every day. Too \nmany are facing--within minutes or hours--the loss of a job, the loss \nof a home, or the total evaporation of their retirement accounts. This \nwas showcased by one family I met over the weekend in my home State. \nThey saved for years and years to provide their children with the \nopportunity to get a higher education, just to see it all wiped out in \na matter of days. And with their children reaching the cusp of higher \neducation, they are left wondering what will happen. Despite all the \ncommitments they had made to those children and all their efforts to \nmake sure they were financially prepared, today they find themselves in \na very different position. Unemployment is rising. Incomes are \nstagnating, while the costs of health care and housing and education \nare skyrocketing. In my State, unemployment rates have risen from 4.8 \npercent in January of 2008 to 7.1 percent this past December. Every \nindication is these numbers are going to go up before they come back \ndown again. Hopefully, they will come back down soon again.\n  I know this evening we are all anticipating the remarks of our new \nPresident as he addresses the joint Houses of Congress in his first \nState of the Union Message. I have gotten to know President Obama well. \nWe served together in this body. We served on two committees together, \nand we campaigned for the Presidency both with each other and against \neach other for a brief period of time. I can tell you, he is an \noptimistic, positive, confident President; a reflection of who we are \nas a people.\n  This evening you are going to hear, in my view, a confident, \noptimistic President looking ahead to our future with hope, full of the \naspirations I know we all share as Americans.\n  But the difficult problems we have in front of us make the need to \nconfirm a Secretary of Labor more pressing than ever. The Department of \nLabor enforces the laws and regulations dealing with fair wages and \nhours, job training, workplace safety and health standards, \nunemployment, and family and medical leave--each absolutely essential \nto a productive, healthy workforce and economy.\n  Unfortunately, over the last 8 years, many of us have watched the \nDepartment of Labor with some concern as its focus moved away from the \nprotection of employees in too many cases and focused more effort on \nprotecting employers and denying workers their right to organize.\n  I do not view this as the Department's role, and I know Congresswoman \nSolis does not either. It certainly was not the intention of Congress \nwhen it created the Department in 1913 and wrote in the authorizing \nlanguage, and I quote:\n\n       The purpose of the Department of Labor shall be to foster, \n     promote and develop the welfare of the wage earners of the \n     United States, to improve their working conditions, and to \n     advance their opportunities for profitable employment.\n\n  Let me say, as an aside, the departing Secretary of Labor, Elaine \nChao, is a good friend of mine, and I have known her for a long time. \nOf course, her husband is our distinguished minority leader. She was, I \nthink, the only Cabinet officer to serve all 8 years of the Bush \nadministration.\n  Her job was, of course, to reflect the Bush administration's policies \nand judgments. I am not suggesting she disagreed with them, though I \nbelieve that from time to time she might have taken us on a different \npath, had she been in a position to solely decide what direction the \ncountry would go in. So when I express my disappointment over the \ndirection of the Department of Labor over the last few years, I do not \nwant it to reflect on the competency and the contribution Elaine made \nto our country.\n  However, looking at some of the decisions of the Department of Labor \nand the National Labor Relations Board under the last Administration--\nsuch as the outrageous overtime pay rules and the Kentucky River \ndecisions that stripped tens of thousands of workers of the right to \norganize--I find it hard to believe they were made with the charter in \nmind that I described to you.\n  At this moment of such wrenching economic turmoil, it is essential \nthat the Department of Labor recommit itself to protecting the rights \nof workers, and we need a strong leader such as Hilda Solis at the helm \nto do that.\n  The Department of Labor faces many challenges, not only in correcting \nwhat, in my view, were mistaken actions taken by the Bush \nadministration but also in advancing the cause of workers' rights. One \nof the most important is the administration of the Family and Medical \nLeave Act, which will mark its 16th anniversary this month.\n  Since becoming law, the Family and Medical Leave Act has helped more \nthan 60 million Americans take time off to care for a newborn or \nadopted baby, to help a parent through an illness, to get better \nthemselves, to keep an eye on their children, knowing that their job \nwill be there when the family problem diminishes.\n  I cannot think of how many occasions we have watched and supported \none of our colleagues here in the Senate who has missed votes and \ncommittee hearings, for days or weeks on end, to recover from an \nillness or care for a spouse or a child who needed their attention.\n  I think of my wonderful friend, the new Vice President of our \ncountry, and the Presiding Officer who spent years working with him. \nWhen tragedy struck Joe Biden's family at the outset of his Senate \ncareer, he spent a lot of time, as he should have, at home with his \nchildren, making sure they could get through that difficult time.\n  He was applauded, and properly so, by his colleagues and others. No \none ever suggested that Senator Joe Biden should not have his job back \nbecause he had missed work to be with his family.\n  I remember Jake Garn, my good friend and a former chairman of the \nBanking Committee, who donated a kidney to one of his daughters. He \nspent days away from here in order to take care of that child and to \nget back on his feet himself. No one suggested Senator Garn of Utah had \ndone anything but what a father should do in those circumstances. His \njob was never in jeopardy. His pay and his pension were not put at \nrisk. Yet, prior to the passage of the Family and Medical Leave Act, \nmillions of our fellow citizens struggled through similar situations \nevery single day without the security that their jobs would be there \nwhen they came back.\n  As the author of the Family and Medical Leave Act 16 years ago, I \ntake as much pride in that bill as anything I have done here in 30 \nyears. Nothing is healthier for a family, during a time of crisis, than \nto be together. These families deserve to get the support and backing \nthey need. I have worried over the past 8 years about the efforts of \nthe Department of Labor to water down, to minimize, to create obstacles \nin the\n\n[[Page S2405]]\n\npath of those who seek the family and medical leave protections.\n  FMLA has also benefitted businesses. With lower turnover and a boost \nto morale, 90 percent of employers told the Department of Labor in 2000 \nthat the Family and Medical Leave Act had a neutral or positive effect \non profits. No one should be forced in a crisis to make the impossible \nchoice between work and family. Which is why I am so excited about the \nprospect of Congresswoman Solis leading the Department of Labor. She is \na forceful advocate for working families and will bring to the job a \ngenuine understanding and passion for the issues that affect families \nso deeply.\n  I am also particularly encouraged by Hilda Solis's knowledge and \nenthusiasm for green job training. In the House of Representatives, \nwhere she served with distinction, she authored the Green Jobs Training \nAct, which will help train American workers for jobs in the renewable \nenergy and energy-efficiency industries. I share her belief that the \ncreation of good-paying, green-collar jobs is critical to both our \neconomic and energy security.\n  My own State of Connecticut is home to a number of exciting green \nenergy companies, including world leaders in the design and manufacture \nof hydrogen fuel cells. I know the Congresswoman will bring her \nexperience to the creation of new programs at the Department of Labor, \nwithin the Job Corps and elsewhere, to create a new generation of \nprofessionals. These programs will be critically important to our \nNation's ability to transform and reinvigorate our economy.\n  These are but a few of the many challenges that will face the \nDepartment of Labor in the coming days. Others include revitalizing and \nrestoring the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, \nmodernizing unemployment insurance, and preventing wage theft, which \nresults in as many as 2 to 3 million workers not being paid minimum \nwage and millions more being denied the overtime pay that they rightly \ndeserve.\n  I would like to briefly conclude these remarks by addressing some of \nthe issues being raised by some of my friends who have been critical \nand may, in fact, oppose this nomination. There have been questions \nabout Congresswoman Solis's responsiveness to HELP Committee inquiries \nand about her work in an unpaid position on the board of a nonprofit \nworkers advocacy organization. Congresswoman Solis has been very \nforthright and candid about all those issues. She has fully answered \nmore than 140 questions from committee members, including 121 from my \ncolleagues on the minority side.\n  Congresswoman Solis is a highly respected public servant, an \neminently qualified nominee to be Secretary of Labor, and, in my view, \ndeserving of support from every Member of this body. In these \nchallenging times, we need a Secretary of Labor as soon as possible. \nThe workers of our country need a strong leader at the Department to \nfight for them and to protect their rights.\n  Hilda Solis is that leader. I urge all my colleagues to support for \nthis nomination and to vote for her when the vote occurs later this \nafternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                              The Economy\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kentucky for \nhis leadership in the Senate. I wish to share a few remarks about where \nwe are financially in our country and what we need to do about it.\n  I am very pleased the President has said he intends to ensure we \neliminate the gimmicks that obfuscate the real nature of the financial \ncrisis the country has. I think we can make some real progress on that. \nHe would certainly have my support for that.\n  I also am pleased he has repeated publicly what he said to us Members \nof the Senate in private meetings, that he believes we have a challenge \nin these long-term entitlement programs. They are out of control, they \nare on autopilot, and they are growing at twice the rate, three or four \ntimes the rate sometimes, of inflation. That is the kind of expanding \ncost that cannot continue.\n  I believe he is sincere about that. I look forward to working with \nhim on that. But that is down the road. Let's be honest. I wish to be \nhonest here. I think he is correct on both these important issues, and \nI hope we can all work together. I would say we begin to ask when can \nwe begin to get a containment on spending.\n  I would point out to my colleagues the nature of the deficit we are \nnow facing. It is unlike anything we have ever had before. We are not \nhyping this. I am telling you what the facts are. This is a \nCongressional Budget Office chart. It shows what we have been doing. I \nwould briefly go over it. In 2004, the deficit hit $413 billion. That \nwas President Bush's largest deficit to date. He was severely \ncriticized for it. It amounted to 3.6 percent of total gross domestic \nproduct. It was the largest deficit in dollar terms since World War II, \nand he took a lot of heat for that. I was unhappy myself.\n  The next year, 2005, it dropped to $317 billion. In 2006 it dropped \nto $248 billion. In 2007 it dropped to $161 billion, which was 1.2 \npercent of GDP, heading in the right direction. The next year, 2008, \nwas the first full budget of the Democratic Congress, but President \nBush was still in office at that time. He proposed last spring to spend \n$150-plus billion to send out checks to everybody to make sure we did \nnot go into an economic slowdown.\n  I did not think that was a good idea. I did not vote for it. Now, I \nthink only about 15 of us voted no. But I think almost every economist \nnow in the hearings we have had in the Budget Committee showed it had \nalmost no impact on the economy. But that one expenditure almost \ndoubled the deficit. Then there were some other factors that went into \nit. It ended up at $455 billion, the largest deficit in the history of \nthe country. That was last September 30, when the fiscal year ended, \nthe 2008 fiscal year. Last September 30, we had a $455 billion deficit, \nthe largest since World War II; I think the largest in dollar terms \never. But what about this year? You can see that chart and how long \nthat line goes for the year we are in now, September 30, $1.371 \ntrillion, three times-plus the amount of money we had in a deficit in \n2008, the largest deficit in history.\n  It only includes about $185 billion from the stimulus package we \npassed. That is a historic event. It is not a little, bitty matter. \nThat was a big event. One reason that number looks so bad--and we ought \nto talk about it so we can get a real picture of why 2009 looks so much \nworse than the other years--is because the Congressional Budget Office \nhas the responsibility to ascertain how much money the Government is \nactually spending. So they score programs.\n  They scored the $700 billion Wall Street bailout, the TARP money, as \ncosting the taxpayers $247 billion. It will probably happen over a \nseries of years, but for some reason they decided to put it fully in \n2009. Maybe that is so they can blame President Bush for it, and he \ndeserves a lot of blame for it. He spent half of it. But they scored it \nall in 2009.\n  Then they also calculated the amount of money they believed the \ntaxpayers will absorb as a loss from our takeover of Freddie Mac and \nFannie Mae, those mortgage agencies of huge proportion that kicked off \nthe crisis. We have been bailing them out, people have not talked about \nthat very much, but we have been, and they score that at $240 billion. \nThey stick that in 2009.\n  They assume we will spend about $185 billion out of the $800 billion \nstimulus package we passed a few weeks ago, every penny of which went \nstraight to the debt because we were already in debt. Every dollar we \nspent increased the debt. So they come out with $1.371 trillion. That's \na big deal. In 2010, they expect the deficit to be $1.1 trillion based \non current law, more than twice as big as the biggest deficit we ever \nhad in 2008. They project by 2011 we will still have about $134 billion \nunspent from the stimulus package. That plus the regular deficit will \nshow us a deficit of $632 billion.\n\n  There are a couple things I wish to say. One is, the President has \npromised to cut the deficit in half by 2013. I do not think he used the \nfigure $530 billion. Somebody has used that figure, perhaps. But by \n2013 he promised he would cut it in half.\n  Well, if you cut $1.4 trillion in half, that is $700 billion. From \nthe normal\n\n[[Page S2406]]\n\noperating expectations, as calculated by the Congressional Budget \nOffice, we will have cut the deficit in half in 3 years. So that is \ngoing to happen. That is not a great promise to make, frankly. I would \nnote the $632 billion, other than the 2 previous years, represents the \nbiggest deficit in the history of the Republic. So we are still a long \nway from having financial responsibility here.\n  At one of our hearings, the chairman of the Budget Committee, Senator \nConrad, produced a New York Times article. It talked about the dramatic \nreduction in the trade surplus that China has. That is because they are \nnot selling as much as they were either. It was out of that surplus \nthat China was buying so many of our debt obligations. Where does the \nmoney come from to fund this debt? Well, just like you, you have to \ngive somebody a mortgage. They give you money; you give them a mortgage \nand promise to pay it back.\n  Well, China has been the biggest buyer, and Japan has been a big \nbuyer. Japan is already reducing its share of Treasurys. And China \ninevitably will because they do not have as much money, even if they \ndesire to buy them.\n  Also, some of the oil-producing countries had bought our Treasurys. \nOil is $40 a barrel this year instead of $140 a barrel. They do not \nhave as much money to buy them either. So I asked the witness, and the \nconsensus was that we are in an unusually beneficial time at this \nmoment to borrow because the world is unsure financially, and they are \nwilling to buy American Treasurys at 1 percent or less. But that is not \ngoing to continue. So during this year we are going to have to go out \non the market and find three times as many people to buy our Treasurys \nas we did last year. Next year, we are going to have over twice as many \nTreasurys for people to buy; and the next one, a record year also. We \nare out here getting people to buy this, and they are going to demand \nhigher interest, particularly if they are worried--which they probably \nwill be--that one way we are going to pay back this debt is by \ndeflating our currency, debasing our currency, and paying back the \ndollars in cheaper dollars than what we borrowed. Then the people who \nloan us money are going to get nervous and demand higher rates. So the \nCBO projects a significant increase in interest rates in the outyears.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber I think is relevant. It gives us \nsome idea of the omnibus bill we are going to be seeing rather soon. \nWhat we understand is that the Democratic leadership in the Congress is \ngoing to submit to us an omnibus bill to complete this fiscal year. On \ntop of the $800 billion we passed a couple weeks ago, they are going to \npropose one of the largest increases in discretionary spending in the \nhistory of the Republic.\n  For example, it is an 8-percent increase. This year's discretionary \nspending--in addition to the stimulus package we passed--is going to be \nan 8-percent increase. Now, those of you who know a little bit about \ninterest rates know if you get a 7-percent return on your money, the \nmoney will double in 10 years. So I would suggest at an 8-percent rate \nincrease, we are headed to more than doubling the discretionary \nspending in our country.\n  This is not good. President Bush was criticized, and sometimes \nrightly so, for excessive spending. But he did not propose an 8-percent \nincrease in non-defense discretionary spending any year he was in \noffice. So we could expect to see, if every year we had an 8-percent \nincrease in discretionary spending--it goes into the baseline each \nyear, and that is more than double what the current rate is. So within \n10 years, our basic spending for all the things we do--highways, \nagriculture bills, Department of Justice, prisons--everything we do in \nAmerica will double.\n  The only thing I am asking my colleagues is--and I will ask the \nPresident: I like what you are saying about confronting reckless \nspending. I do. But when?\n  I suggest with regard to this chart, maybe it will give us a little \nbit of an indication about the point I want to make now. Let me say \nsomething I believe to be a fact. I believe it is a fact that the $789 \nbillion we sent out 2 weeks ago as a stimulus package will never be \nsaved by any actions by this Congress or this President over the next 8 \nyears, if he stays the President for 8 years. He will not come close to \ndoing that.\n  I remember a few years ago Senator Judd Gregg, then chairman of the \nBudget Committee, proposed an idea to reduce Medicare spending--one of \nthese big entitlement programs--by $40 billion over 5 years. They \nworked on it for months, and they thought they could save money here, \nthere, and otherwise, and they could save $40 billion. We lost it on \nthe floor. A number of Republicans voted no. I think all the Democrats \nvoted no. We could not cut $40 billion out of Medicare. Actually, it \nwas not a cut. Medicare was increasing at 7 percent a year, and the \nreduction would have reduced the increase to about 6.5 percent a year. \nIt would have saved $40 billion and would have only reduced the growth \nfrom 7 percent or so to 6.5 percent or so. That is the way I remember \nthe numbers, and we could not pass that.\n  So we have added last week's $800 billion to the debt. This idea that \nsomehow in the future we are going to all have a conference and we are \ngoing to figure out a way to get our house back in financial order, and \nby reducing Social Security or Medicare, is a matter that is not in \nreality with what I am seeing.\n  Now, we could do more than Senator Gregg proposed. He tried to get \nsomething he thought everybody could agree on. But we could not. I \nthink you could save more, but I am saying: How much are we going to be \nable to reduce Medicare? Not that much if we are honest with ourselves. \nWe are not going to be able to reduce it that much. Over 20 or 30 \nyears, any savings, any integrity we bring to that process can mount up \nto hundreds of billions of dollars. There is no doubt about it.\n  But to think we are going to wipe out what we have done already, and \nthen to see the bill come forward with the fundamental operating \nlegislation for our Government that will be on the floor within a \nmatter of days, and to see that be an 8-percent increase--when the \ninflation rate is--what?--2 percent or less--four times the rate of \ninflation, this is fiscal responsibility? Give me a break. I am worried \nabout it.\n  So I will say, as we go forward, we will listen to some of the \nPresident's ideas tonight. He is such a fabulous spokesman for his \nvalues. He is so articulate. He is going to have a lot of support here. \nHe is saying some very good things. But I urge my colleagues, if you \napplaud those statements about financial responsibility, ending this \nreckless spending, ending the surge of debt, and bringing some \nfinancial accountability, we are going to have to stand up and vote. We \ncannot keep sending up huge discretionary spending bills. This is not a \nwar. These bills do not include homeland security and the Department of \nDefense. This is the basic operating of our Government. We are going to \nhave an 8-percent increase every year? Well, maybe we will not next \nyear, somebody will say. Maybe we won't year 2 or 3 when we are in \nbetter shape. Well, when do you start? Are you sure we are going to be \nserious 2 or 3 years from now if we are not serious today? Why would we \nbe more serious then than we are today?\n  Words, I have learned in this body, are less important than dollars \nand action that goes out the door. So let's be thinking about that. I \ndo not want to be a recalcitrant, but I have to tell you the truth. The \ntruth is, I am worried about where we are going. I hear words about \nconcern over rising debt that is the largest surge in debt this country \nhas ever seen. But I am not sure I am seeing any actions about it.\n  Combined--let me share this figure with you--the two bills, the \nomnibus spending bill we will be voting on soon and the stimulus we \nsaw, means we will spend 80 percent more money in 2009 than in 2008. My \ncolleagues need to know we will be spending 80 percent more money as a \nresult of these huge spending programs we have seen this year, which \nincludes the TARP, which includes the Freddie and Fannie bailout, and \nincludes the stimulus package.\n  Those are my concerns. I hope my colleagues will at least consider \nthe challenges we face. They are not small. They are quite large. We \nhave never seen anything like this kind of spending. It seems they are \ndetermined to help us work through this debt spasm\n\n[[Page S2407]]\n\nwe are in by borrowing record amounts of money. I am thinking we need \nto get away from borrowing sooner rather than later and get ourselves \non a path of sound money.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair recognizes the Senator from \nCalifornia.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, what is the current order?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nomination of Hilda Solis to be Secretary \nof Labor.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President. I am going to speak \nabout Hilda Solis, someone I know very well, and someone I am very \nproud of.\n  I could not help but hear the comments of Senator Sessions about this \nborrowing, and I do not know where Senator Sessions has been over the \npast 8 years, when we saw the debt go from $5 trillion to $10 trillion. \nAnd that was George Bush's program, supported by the Republicans. It \nwent to Iraq. It went to tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. All of \na sudden, there is this newfound worry because we believe it is time \nthe American people, who work for a living and who are struggling, get \na hand out of this recession.\n\n  As we will hear tonight from our new President, he understands that \nthere is a time to stimulate this economy and then, of course, in the \nlong term, as we Democrats did under Bill Clinton, get back to a \nbalanced budget.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, will the Senator from California yield?\n  Mrs. BOXER. In a moment.\n  We did it. We did it without one Republican vote. We passed the \nClinton budget. I have the names of the Senators. I was fortunate \nenough to have a good researcher give me those. What they said when we \npassed that budget--we passed that budget under Bill Clinton because Al \nGore, the Vice President, broke a tie. We couldn't get one Republican \nvote. And here is what they said, to a person: This budget is going to \nset us on the course of a recession. This budget is going to set us on \nthe course of deficit spending. Guess what. They couldn't have been \nmore wrong. That budget set us off on a course of the best economy \nknown to humankind in peacetime--23 million new jobs and a balanced \nbudget with a surplus. I remember looking at my children--because the \ndebt was on the way down so fast at that time under Bill Clinton and \nthe Democrats--and I said: What are we going to do? We can't buy \nTreasury bonds. There won't be any more. We won't have to borrow \nanymore. So it is extraordinary to me that my colleagues come up here \nnow and they say: We can't spend this money.\n  Yes, it is true people are hurting. My State has over 9 percent \nunemployment. There are pockets, I say to my friends, of 18 percent \nunemployment. I think the American people know there are no panaceas \nhere. They know it is going to be hard. They know we may make mistakes, \nbut they also know this: They want us to present hope to them--hope. \nFrankly, I wish to be associated with hope, not nope: Nope, we can't do \nthis; nope, we can't do that; nope, it would be better not to do this. \nThe American people--and I see what they are saying to people who ask \nthem--are patient, and they know it is going to take some time. Yes, we \nmay have to inject some funds into this economy because $1 trillion was \nlost out of this economy due to the recession. So yes, we are, in fact, \ninjecting hope into this economy. We will pay it back. We will get back \nonto a balanced budget. We will do it in time, and we will do it \nresponsibly.\n  I am happy to yield to my friend without losing my right to the \nfloor.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from California for \nallowing me to interrupt. Most Senators, a lot of times, don't like to \ndo that. She is a good advocate on the floor.\n  I would just say that we need to get away from the political \nsituation. As I showed in my chart, I would note to the Senator, the \nBush administration had the largest debt since World War II in 2004 and \nwas rightly criticized for that. After going down for 3 years, when we \nsent out the checks last year, it jumped to $455 billion, and we got \nnot much for it. This is $1.3 trillion this year, $1 trillion the next \nyear, $632 billion the next year, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice scoring. So I think this is a quantum leap higher than the \ndeficits we saw in previous years.\n  I know we are in a difficult time. I would just say I hope my \ncolleagues will share President Obama's commitment to deal with the \nlong-term structural problems we have. He is correct on that. He has a \ncommitment to quit using gimmicks, which we have been using in the \nSenate too often to mask how big the deficit is. Those are good steps, \nbut sooner or later we are going to need to reduce spending.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will take that as a question: Do I \nsupport President Obama's commitment to wrap his arms around the \ndeficit and to do it with us, Republicans and Democrats? You bet I do, \nbecause I did it before under Bill Clinton. Unfortunately, then, we \ncouldn't get one Republican vote. I praise my friend for showing the \ndeficits under George Bush. I do. But I have to simply say--and this is \na fact, this is a proven fact--that we didn't hear much from that side \nof the aisle when we had an open checkbook for Iraq. In fact, we didn't \nhear anything. They kept it open. We didn't hear much when they kept \ngiving tax breaks to people who earn over $1 million, and that is what \ngot us into this fix.\n  Right now, as a temporary measure, yes, we are going to have to spend \nsome. As I know President Obama will lay out tonight, he wants to jolt \nand jump-start this economy. We are going to do it.\n  I am so proud we were able to reach across party lines in this Senate \nand get three Republicans to join us. I am so pleased that in my home \nState, we got six Republicans to join the Democrats and pass a budget \nthere because when I went home--I went to Sacramento, our capital, and \nthey were in deadlock. I think one of the things that helped me and \nothers make the case was that we had to put party aside. We had to put \nideology aside. We had to put egos aside. We did it with the stimulus \nbill because we only had three options there and they only had three \noptions for the budget in California.\n  One option is do nothing and be the party of nope instead of the \nparty of hope. Do nothing. Do nothing. Well, when you do nothing, that \nis not a passive act. Doing nothing is, it seems to me, a hostile act. \nIt is a hostile act on the working families of this country and of my \nState. So doing nothing, I believe, is irresponsible.\n  Now, the other thing one could say in light of the stimulus or a \nbudget one doesn't like is: I want to do it my way. My way or the \nhighway. Here is my bill. I have written it. It is great. I have the \nperfect solution. Well, clearly, I am going to be able to write the \nperfect bill for me. My friend from Delaware can write the perfect bill \nfor him. My friend from Georgia, I know he can write the perfect bill \nfor Georgia. They love him there, and he would reflect everything they \nwant. But at the end of the day, it doesn't work that way. That is also \nsaying nope.\n  So the only answer, it seems to me--the only answer--is for us to \ncompromise. That is what we did on the stimulus. That is what my State \nRepublicans did, six of them.\n  By the way, they got censured by the party in my State. I just can't \nbelieve it. I just can't believe it. There was anger because they said \nthey would never raise taxes and they signed a pledge. Well, you have \nto understand we are in uncharted waters with this downturn. There are \nhundreds of thousands of jobs lost every month. We all want to keep our \npledges, but once in a while you have to look inside yourself and say: \nHow can I help the people of my State?\n  So I say to those Republicans here who helped us, I say to the \nRepublicans at home in the State of California who helped us: Thank \nyou, thank you, thank you. Because there are moments when we do have to \ntake a risk in life for the greater good.\n  I am looking forward to hearing the President tonight because I think \nwhat he is going to do--because I have watched him--he is going to give \nus an honest assessment of where we are as a nation. He is not going to \nsugarcoat where we are. He is going to tell it like it is, but then he \nis going to offer hope. He has a lot to say on that because we did get \nthat first piece of the economic recovery bill through, the stimulus\n\n[[Page S2408]]\n\nbill--very important. I think he is going to show us through the \nhousing plan he has that it is going to help ordinary people. My friend \nfrom Georgia is here, and he worked so hard to get a tax credit in the \nstimulus bill for new home purchases. These are the kinds of things we \nneed to embrace, regardless of political party. I certainly embrace it.\n  Then he will talk about the banks. Speaking just for myself, I don't \nwant to nationalize a bank. I really do not. If you go back to the \nGreat Depression--I am reading a good book called ``The Defining \nMoment: FDR's Hundred Days.'' There was a big move not by the President \nbut by a lot of people to nationalize the banks, and FDR said: No, we \nshouldn't be running the banks. So I am very hopeful that we will be \nable to do some things by converting preferred stock to common stock, \nto help get these banks on their feet and doing what they need to do, \nwhich is to lend.\n  I have spent some time talking about our current situation, and \nneedless to say, what we have seen in the past 8 years or so--and \nespecially the past few years--is we have seen a real decline in the \nquality of life of our working families. Their voices have not been \nheard enough. That creates an imbalance in our lives.\n  Everybody talks about the powerful unions. The unions that represent \nworking men and women are representing fewer and fewer, and the voices \nof working men and women have gotten softer and softer. I think \nPresident Obama understands this, and he has given us a voice for \nworking men and women in selecting Congresswoman Hilda Solis to be the \nSecretary of Labor.\n  I wish to say to my friends who may not know Hilda as I know her--she \nis from my State and is an ally and a friend--she is one of the best \npeople you will ever meet. She is one of the most humble people you are \never going to meet. She is one of the most intelligent people. She has \nknowledge of politics and how to get things done. She knows how to \nreach out to people who don't agree with her. She has a strong \nunderstanding of the struggles of working families because she has seen \nit in her district in California.\n\n  Jobs lost since the beginning of the recession in December of 2007: \n3.6 million. Jobs lost in the last 3 months: 1.8 million. The \nnationwide unemployment rate is at 7.6 percent. In my State, it is 9.3 \npercent. Long-term unemployed Americans: 2.6 million. That is why the \nstimulus was so important--to give them a little extra help getting \nthrough this nightmare. Underemployed Americans--that means Americans \nwho are working at jobs for which they are overqualified--7.8 million \nAmericans are working at jobs for which they are overqualified. So we \ncan see this is not a recession that is just hitting a few pockets of \nAmerica; it is hitting hard and it is hitting deep.\n  Throughout her entire career, Congresswoman Solis has been a forceful \nadvocate for working men and women in California and throughout the \nNation.\n  She was born and raised in the San Gabriel Valley in southern \nCalifornia. She was instilled with the values of hard work. Her father \nemigrated from Mexico, and he worked as a Teamsters shop steward. Her \nmother came to the United States from Nicaragua and worked at a local \nfactory.\n  She was the very first Latina elected to the California State senate. \nShe led efforts there to pass a much needed increase in California's \nminimum wage. I can tell my colleagues this because I worked closely \nwith her on this issue.\n  In the 1990s, when she discovered that toxic sites were \ndisproportionately located near minority and low-income neighborhoods, \nshe wrote an environmental justice law to guarantee protections for \nthose communities. For her dedication to this cause, she became the \nfirst woman ever honored with the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage \nAward.\n  She was elected to represent California's 32nd congressional district \nin the year 2000. I have worked with her very closely on many \nenvironmental issues, on worker issues, and it is a delight to work \nwith her. I have worked with her on veterans issues. Before she got \ntapped to be Secretary of Labor, Hilda and I sat next to each other on \nthe plane, and she was telling me about an event she had where she \nholds a fair for the veterans in her community, in her district, and \nshe brings together all of the various entities in the Federal \nGovernment that could help those veterans. This is a woman with a heart \nof gold.\n  So I am confident that Hilda Solis will turn the many challenges we \nface into new opportunities for the American people. As Secretary, she \nwill continue to promote policies that will invigorate our economy, \nprotect our jobs, retrain our workforce. She will work for a \nsustainable energy future, which is going to mean lots of jobs and new \ntechnologies. She will ensure safe working conditions. She will enforce \nfairly the wage and hour laws we have on the books. We don't need more \nlaws on the books; we have laws on the books for wage and hour. She \nwill protect against worker discrimination. She will strengthen the \nmiddle class. Yet I think in her way she will make the case that people \nin the workplace should have a right to be represented. She will argue \nthat. She also plans to improve skills development and job search \nassistance for unemployed workers and create new career opportunities \nfor at-risk youth and our military heroes, as I mentioned.\n\n  I am so thrilled she was picked for this job. I was very surprised \nbecause I had no clue President Obama was going to tap her. But when he \ndid, I said to my family that this is a great choice. I think as \nMembers of the Senate from both sides of the aisle get to know Hilda, \nthey will soon trust Hilda. They will know they can talk to her about \nany subject, that she will listen, and that she will understand their \npoint of view. After all, this is a woman who has been in elected \noffice and she understands, as we all do, that there are differing \nviewpoints. She is not going to come in there and say: It is my way or \nthe highway, Senator, so don't bother explaining to me. She will work \nwith Senators. I know it because I have worked with her.\n  If anybody needed a personal recommendation for Hilda Solis today, I \nhope they will trust me because you know me, and I don't stand up for \nevery nominee, but I am so proud to stand for this one. I urge each and \nevery one of my colleagues--Republicans, Democrats, Independents--to \nplease support her nomination.\n  I thank my friend from Georgia, who I know has been waiting. I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). The Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the nomination of Hilda \nSolis to be Secretary of Labor. I do so as a Senator whose \nresponsibility, constitutionally, it is to advise and consent on the \nnominees of the President. I also do so as ranking member of the \nsubcommittee of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee \ndealing with occupational safety. I will vote to confirm Ms. Solis this \nafternoon, after a great deal of study, after a lot of interaction, and \na lot of direct conversations over issues about which Ms. Solis and I \nhave different points of view.\n  President Obama was elected, and it is his right to choose a Cabinet. \nIt is the Senate's responsibility to give advice and consent on those \nnominees. After the due diligence and the process this nominee has gone \nthrough, making sure she was properly vetted, it is my belief that she \nis worthy of the appointment of Secretary of Labor of the United States \nof America. I am going to cast that vote because I will expect, as \nranking member of the occupational safety subcommittee, the same type \nof conversation from the Secretary as we deal with some of the \ncontentious issues we both know lie before us in the months and years \nahead.\n  One is card check. I am adamantly opposed to card check. I believe \nthe right to a secret ballot is a fundamental right--not only at the \nballot box in November but as to the question of whether you were \norganized and unionized in work. I know that when labor unions were \nformed and labor legislation was originally passed, it was the union \nmovement that sought to ensure a secret ballot on behalf of the workers \nto make sure there was no intimidation from the company. That has \nserved us well in this country for over 90 years and will continue to \nserve us for many years ahead. I know Ms.\n\n[[Page S2409]]\n\nSolis differs on that, but I hope when the issue comes before us, she \nwill be as respectful in the arguments and debates we will bring \nforward as she will of her own opinion in that regard.\n  Secondly, as a Senator from the South and from the great State of \nGeorgia, I am very proud of the right to work statutes of our State. It \nhas served us well, as it has a number of States in this country that \nare right to work States. Those are States where an awful lot of \nmanufacturing has come and been born, and even in difficult times today \nnew manufacturing entities are coming to States, such as the Kia plant \ncoming to La Grange, GA. I know Ms. Solis was at least equivocal in her \nresponse as to whether she supported the right to work status for \nStates. I stand on the floor today and say unequivocally that I support \nthem, and I support my State of Georgia and the right to work of all of \nits workers.\n  With those points made, Ms. Solis's reputation and record and the \nhandling of her personal responsibilities, such as her taxes and her \nresponsibilities in the House, all pass muster in terms of the \nCommittee, and I will vote in favor of her confirmation when the vote \ncomes before us.\n\n\n                            Difficult Times\n\n  Mr. President, we are in difficult times. Tonight the President will \nspeak to all of us. I look forward to those remarks with great \nanticipation.\n  I told the President, when he appeared before our caucus just 3 weeks \nago for lunch, that every night I pray for his success. And I do. Our \npeople are in difficult times. We have difficult economic \ncircumstances. It is imperative that we move forward together as \nMembers of the House and Senate and the executive branch to find \nsolutions to the challenges before us.\n  Similar to most Members of the Senate, I have a few suggestions. I \nwish to offer four of them today as we lead up to the discussion \ntonight and the debate that will follow.\n  Some of the economic difficulties in the United States are self-\ninflicted by our own regulatory agencies. In particular, there are two \nareas I wish to discuss. First is the SEC. Last fall when the markets \nbegan to cascade down on Wall Street and when the financial stocks took \ntheir initial hit and the subsequent tumble, it was because of short \nsellers rushing to the market and shorting financial stocks and \naccelerating the decline of those values. I called Chris Cox, then the \nSEC Commissioner, and begged him to please implement the uptick rule, \nwhich would stop the short selling on the downside and protect the \nvalue of those equities.\n  Fortunately, they did declare a moratorium for 27 days and stopped \nthe short selling and things stabilized. Unfortunately, when that 27 \ndays was over, they reinstituted the former rule, short selling \naccelerated, and financial stocks deteriorated so that now they are 85 \nto 90 percent below their value of 18 to 24 months ago. It is \nimperative the SEC reinstitute the uptick rule to ensure we don't have \npeople coming into the marketplace and taking advantage of difficulties \nand suppressing the values of equities even greater than the market \nmight otherwise dictate.\n  Secondly, there has been a lot of speeches made on the floor about \nmark to market, and I will make one now. I am going to use specific \nexamples to show you how the imposition of mark to market is hurting \nour financial institutions desperately, and it is disproportionately \npenalizing the people we serve.\n  Mark to market basically takes the position that on any given day you \nare going to mark your assets based on their value of that day. Given \nthe clients we have seen in mortgage-backed securities and real estate, \nmarking to market has caused a tremendous decline in the asset side of \nthe ledger while liabilities continued to grow, which has caused \ncapital problems in the banking system and exacerbated the financial \nproblems we have today. In fact, mark to market should not be an \narbitrary and capricious writedown to zero but, rather, should be a \nrecognition of the transition of values in a down market or in an up \nmarket.\n  The Senate, in 2005, in dealing with the pension crisis and defined \nbenefit programs in America, asked businesses to come in one year and \nreplenish retirement funds because the decline in the stocks was \nunrealistic. So we passed legislation that provided for a smoothing, \nmeaning we amortized over years 3, 4, 5 or 6 the amount of money a \npension fund was short, to give a company the ability to invest capital \nin the fund to restore it but not to deplete all the capital the \ncompany had to operate.\n  Today, what is happening in our financial institutions, when the FDIC \ncomes in and says you are going to mark to market, and this real estate \nasset that might have been worth $20 million 2 years ago is worth $6 \nmillion today, you are going to take a $14 million hit on the asset \nside when, in fact, over time that asset might have brought 15, 16, 17, \n18 or maybe the original 20 percent because most real estate is \nabsorbed over time and not in one fell swoop. It is very important our \nfinancial institutions be able to recognize value in a realistic \nenvironment. Some will tell you we don't want to do what Japan did--and \nwe don't. Japan, in the 1990s, bought a lot of real estate and put it \non the books at what they paid for it. As values declined, they didn't \nchange the values in the books, and finally when they recognized them, \nthey were underwater.\n  That was an unrealistic approach. Equally unrealistic is today's \napproach of taking today's economy and saying: Well, because you cannot \nsell it for X today, that as its value went over time, we could smooth \nor amortize and approach it realistically. What is happening over and \nover again, mark to market is causing banks to do things that compound \nthe things we are facing in the Senate and in the House and in our \ncountry.\n  Last December, this body passed the ability for banks to carry back \nlosses against profitable years, pull back some of the money they paid \nin taxes and provide liquidity. Because of that advantage, which we did \nfor the right reasons, a number of banks took real estate assets in \nDecember of last year and wrote them off, even though they were \nperforming, so they could take the loss carryback against income in \nbetter years. But now they are coming against the properties as a \nnonperforming asset and marking it to market in order to call the loan, \nwith nobody out there willing to take them out. The unintended \nconsequences of mark to market and the loss carryback that this \nCongress passed made it almost impossible for the commercial real \nestate industry and the development industry and the single-family real \nestate industry to compete in the United States today.\n\n  So my suggestion is to install the uptick rule; second, stop the \nridiculous nature of mark to market from absolute to absolute, and put \nin a mechanism of amortization or smoothing so the absorption of those \nassets over time is more reflective of reality and less of the dire \nstraits we find ourselves in today.\n  Third--and I appreciate very much the Senator from California \nmentioning the housing tax credit--I am very pleased that in the \nstimulus bill that passed, the credit is now $8,000 rather than $7,500. \nI am glad it is not repayable now but, in fact, is an actual credit. I \nam sorry it was means tested and limited to incomes of $75,000 or \n$150,000, and I am sorry it was only for first-time home buyers.\n  I believe that until we fix housing, we can fix nothing else. We must \nfix housing first, and we must have an incentive and a reason for those \npeople to return to the marketplace and begin to absorb the houses that \nbecome vacant because of foreclosure, transfer or because of default.\n  So I hope we will continue to work on catalytic agents to inspire the \nconsumers to come back to the marketplace and buy. That is essential. I \nthink the tax credit of $15,000 for the purchase of any home by a \nfamily that occupies that home for 3 years is good for America, good \nfor a business, and it is a small price to pay for what it will bring. \nCBO estimates its cost at $34.8 billion. They also estimate it would \ncreate 700,000 sales and 587,000 jobs in 1 day. That is no bad payback \nwhen you consider we have thrown billions after billions at the banking \nsystem and the stimulus system.\n  Lastly--and I know the President will talk about mortgages today--I \nlistened to his remarks last week and am encouraged by some of the \nthings he said. I think there are some things we\n\n[[Page S2410]]\n\ncan do in terms of financing that can help us with our problem.\n  No. 1, we do have to get back to sound underwriting. The President's \nproposals of a threshold of 31 percent debt service to gross monthly \nincome illustrated that the President sees to it that we have \nfundamentals of qualifications under loans that are made, and I commend \nhim for that.\n  Secondly, I also recognize the fact that we can refinance loans that \nare in difficulty today at lower interest rates, amortize them over 30 \nyears, and, in fact, save people from foreclosure. Some we cannot save, \nbut some we can, and I am for that. But we have to remember, just as 1 \nin 10 houses in America is in default, 9 out of 10 are performing. To \nthose people who are performing, who are making their payments, who are \nliving by the rules, who are doing what is right, the same type of \nrefinance opportunities ought to be available to them as are available \nto someone who is in trouble.\n  I fully believe if we would direct Fannie Mae to issue debt with the \nfull faith and credit of the United States of America behind it, we \ncould generate a pool of resources to make loans for less than 5 \npercent on a 30-year basis in the United States of America, loans that \nmany people who are in trouble could actually find they could work \ntheir way through because it would lessen their monthly payment. But to \nthose who are paying their payments but have rates of 5\\1/2\\, 6, 7\\1/\n2\\, 8 percent, give them the same opportunity to reduce the cost of \ntheir debt service. Just because they are performing does not mean they \nshould be penalized in a time in which we have 10 percent \nnonperformance.\n  I stand here today on the floor of the Senate willing and able \nanytime, anyplace, anywhere to work with the President and work with \nthe Members of this Congress to address the fundamentals of our economy \nand the fundamental problems we face.\n  It is my sincere hope the SEC will take another look at the uptick \nrule and establish it. I think it will be an advantage to the market, \nadvantageous to investors, and I think it will stop an egregiously bad \nprocess.\n  Second, on mark to market, I don't want us to go the route of Japan, \nbut I want us to go the route we went in this body in 2005 on pensions \nand let's smooth and amortize those obligations without catastrophic \nwritedowns of assets which only cause difficulty in the financial \ncommunity.\n  Third, let's do fix housing first, and let's make sure we have a tax \ncredit that is meaningful, available across the board, fosters home \nownership, restores our marketplace, creates the 700,000 sales we need, \nand the 587,000 jobs we so desperately want.\n  Lastly, as we make available creative financing and inexpensive \nfinancing for those in trouble to work their way out of a difficult \nmortgage, let's not forget those who are playing by the rules, the 9 \nout of 10 who are making the payments. Let's make sure we make the same \nthing available to them so the rates at which they can refinance are \nequally competitive and as beneficial.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time. I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 3 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I simply wish to congratulate the \nSenator from Georgia for his leadership on housing. He has \nconsistently, since he arrived in the Senate 6 years ago, been the \nSenate's foremost spokesman for housing, and we badly need it today. \nHousing helped us get into the economic mess we are in in the country, \nand housing will help us get out of the economic mess.\n  As the Senator from Georgia has so succinctly said, there are a \nnumber of things we can do to keep us from going further down the hole \nand to help people who are in trouble and cannot pay their bills. But \nwe want to get out of the hole, and the way we get out of the hole is \nto give people who are creditworthy and have money the opportunity to \nbuy a home. The Isakson amendment, as originally passed by the Senate, \nprovided a $15,000 tax credit and would do that. It would create \ndemand.\n  The idea of low-interest mortgage rates which Republicans have \noffered to give millions of creditworthy Americans, for the next year, \nan opportunity to have a low-interest mortgage to buy a home or \nrefinance their home would help us get out of the housing hole. We are \nall in favor of helping those people who are hurting, but that is not \ngoing to end the economic crisis. We want to climb out of this economic \nmess, and the way to get out of it is to get out of the housing hole we \nare in. The way to do that is through the Isakson amendment that \ncreates a $15,000 tax credit for homebuyers and to provide a low \nmortgage interest rate.\n  I thank the Senator for his eloquence and his persistence. I hope \nmore and more Members on both sides of the aisle and this country will \nhear his call to fix housing first.\n  I yield the floor.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I am pleased and proud that the \nSenate today is taking up the nomination of Hilda Solis for Secretary \nof Labor. Representative Solis is an extraordinary person, with an \nimpressive background in public service. Anyone familiar with her work \nand her many accomplishments can attest that she is a truly \ninspirational leader. In the face of the current, unprecedented \neconomic crisis, her confirmation to this important position is \nespecially significant.\n  Each day, the headlines contain troubling new economic reports. \nAmericans lost 3 million jobs last year. Mr. President, 2.6 million \nhave been looking for work for more than 6 months, 2.3 million have \nlost their homes, 31 million rely on food stamps to put food on the \ntable.\n  But this economic crisis is not just about numbers on a page or a \nlead story on the evening news. It is about what is happening to \nmillions of working families. They are enduring tremendous hardships, \nand they know their friends and neighbors are suffering as well. The \nrecovery bill passed under President Obama's leadership is a \nsignificant step in the right direction, but we still have an enormous \nchallenge ahead of us.\n  To rebuild our economy, we must restore security for working people. \nThey need to know that they can get up and go to work in the morning \nwithout worrying about a pink slip, that they will earn a fair day's \npay for a fair day's work so they can support their families, and that \nthey can provide a better future for their children and a secure \nretirement for themselves.\n  Most of all, they want leaders in government who understand how \nimportant these basic necessities are. That is why Hilda Solis is the \nright choice for Secretary of Labor.\n  Representative Solis is from a hard-working American family. Her \nfather was a farmworker, a railroad worker, and a laborer in a battery \nrecycling plant. Her mother worked for 22 years on the assembly line in \na toy factory. She watched her parents sacrifice all their lives to \nbuild a better future for her and their other children. Because of \ntheir struggles, Hilda became the first person in her family to go to \ncollege.\n  Hilda Solis knows from deeply personal experience the challenges that \nAmerican families face, because she has lived these challenges herself. \nAnd she has brought the lessons she learned from those years to her \ncareer in public service.\n  Since her earliest days in public life, Hilda has put working \nfamilies first. Whether it's fighting to keep toxic waste out of poor \ncommunities, championing legislation to protect victims of domestic \nviolence, or leading efforts to train our workforce for the ``green \ncollar'' jobs of the 21st century, she has never turned away from a \nchallenge. She has never hesitated to stand up for what is right.\n  In 2000, she became the first woman to receive the Profile in Courage \nAward for her remarkable work as a California State senator. The award \nis\n\n[[Page S2411]]\n\ngiven each year to those people who have demonstrated the political \ncourage that President Kennedy so admired, and Hilda Solis exemplifies \nthese outstanding qualities. As I said at the time she received the \naward, ``The extraordinary successes of Hilda Solis as a member of the \nCalifornia legislature show the power of one person with vision, \nability, dedication, and courage to overcome even the most powerful \nforces of oppression and resistance.''\n  Now, again, Hilda has powerful forces to overcome, and tremendous \nchallenges ahead. I have every confidence that she is the right person \nfor the job. She is exactly who we need at the helm of such an \nimportant agency at this critical time for out country.\n  America's workers are the best in the world, and they deserve our \nbest efforts to help them through these difficult times. And they \ndeserve to have the best possible advocate on their side. Today, we \nwill do them a great service by confirming Hilda Solis.\n  She is a true hero for working families, and we are fortunate to have \nsomeone of her tremendous talents at the Department. I look forward to \nworking closely with our new Secretary of Labor to tackle the immense \nchallenges facing America's workers, and to bring job security and real \nopportunity for all Americans.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise today to support the nomination \nof my fellow Californian, Representative Hilda Solis, to be the next \nSecretary of Labor.\n  President Obama has selected Representative Solis to serve in his \nCabinet because she is an experienced, committed, and effective public \nservant.\n  Representative Solis has dedicated her life to public service and to \nimproving the lives of those in her community.\n  As the daughter of immigrants, Representative Solis epitomizes the \npossibilities of the American dream. Her parents worked hard to ensure \nthat she and her siblings could attain all that this country has to \noffer, and this nomination is proof that, in this country, anything is \npossible.\n  Representative Solis was the first member of her family to attend \ncollege and in 1979 earned her undergraduate degree in Political \nScience from the California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.\n  In 1981, she completed a master's degree in public administration at \nthe University of Southern California. Her career in public service \nstarted in President Carter's administration, where she served as the \nEditor-in-Chief of Publications in the Office of Hispanic Affairs.\n  After returning to California, she ran for office and was elected to \nthe Rio Hondo Community College Board in 1985.\n  In 1992, Representative Solis was elected to the State Assembly, and \n2 years later became the first Hispanic woman to serve in the \nCalifornia State Senate.\n  As the Chairwoman of the powerful California State Senate Industrial \nRelations Committee, she was instrumental in the successful battle to \nincrease the state minimum wage.\n  She has also been a tireless fighter for environmental justice. In \n1999, despite strong opposition from industry groups, legislation that \nshe authored was enacted to protect disadvantaged communities from the \nenvironmental toxins and pollutants that are disproportionately located \nin such areas.\n  Her effort earned her the Profile in Courage Award from the John F. \nKennedy Library Foundation in 2000, the same year she was elected to \nthe House of Representatives.\n  In Congress, Representative Solis has demonstrated her commitment to \nexpanding opportunities for job training, which is essential for our \neconomic recovery.\n  She truly understands the potential of clean energy and solar power \nto propel the economy of the 21st century. To this end, Representative \nSolis authored legislation to provide more than $100 million for \n``green collar'' jobs training and has been a pioneer in this arena.\n  Representative Solis is a woman of common sense and, I believe, sound \njudgment.\n  She understands that the Secretary of Labor must be responsive to the \nvoices of both management and labor. As Secretary of Labor, she will be \na champion for workers across America.\n  Given the economic crisis our Nation confronts, I am confident that \nRepresentative Solis will work to promote policies that ultimately will \ncreate jobs, benefiting businesses and workers across the board.\n  The economic challenges we face at this moment are considerable, and \nthe task at hand is substantial.\n  At a time when so many Americans are seeking jobs, it is critical \nthat we have a Secretary of Labor who is ready to tackle these problems \nand be responsive to the needs of all workers.\n  Representative Solis understands the struggles that so many Americans \nare facing. She knows how to get things done, and she knows that there \nis no time to waste.\n  Representative Solis is well prepared for the task at hand, and it is \ntime for the President to have his choice for Secretary of Labor \nconfirmed.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in confirming Representative Solis \nwithout further delay.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I thank all of my colleagues for their \nremarks today, including the distinguished ranking member of our HELP \nCommittee, the Senator from Wyoming, and the ranking member on my \nSubcommittee on Employment, the Senator from Georgia. We have all \nworked together on a number of issues that are important to the well-\nbeing of workers in this country, and today is no different as we \nconsider the nomination of Hilda Solis to serve as President Obama's \nLabor Secretary.\n  As a committee and as a body, we have done our due diligence in \nreviewing her nomination and materials. Now it is time to move forward.\n  Working families across the country are facing the hardest of \neconomic downturns. Most of them have never experienced anything like \nthis. It is affecting everyone across our country. Earlier today, we \nlearned that about 303,570 people in my home State of Washington were \nunemployed and looking for work in January. That is the largest number \never in my State. That is over 303,000 families who are now wondering \nhow they are going to be able to pay their bills or keep their house or \nafford health care or even save for retirement.\n  Workers in my State and across the country cannot afford to wait one \nmore day for an advocate in this administration who will make their \nvoice heard as we work to repair our country's economy. They cannot \nafford to wait any longer for a new leader at the agency that is \nresponsible for unemployment insurance, job training, and placement \nservices, protecting the health and safety of our workers on the job, \nand ensuring their rights in the workplace are protected. We have to \nhave a Labor Department that can move into high gear to meet workers \nwhere they are. Hilda Solis stands ready to answer that call.\n  Before I conclude, I want to take just a minute to thank a number of \npeople who helped us to get to this point. In addition to the \ndistinguished ranking member on the HELP Committee, Senator Enzi, and \nthe ranking member on our subcommittee, Senator Isakson, and all of \ntheir staff members, I wish to recognize and thank Senator Kennedy who \nis the chairman of our Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee. His dedication to America's working families is unmatched. \nAnd his staff, including Portia Wu and Lauren McFarren, have dedicated \ncountless hours to moving this nomination forward.\n  I also thank Senator Dodd, who chaired the HELP Committee executive \nsession that reported Representative Solis out of committee, bringing \nus a step closer to today's confirmation.\n  Let me also thank my staff who have worked so hard with me: Gerri \nFiala, Crystal Bridgeman, Mike Waske, Mike Spahn, and Stacy Rich. I \nappreciate all of their joint efforts to getting us here today.\n  Of course, I thank our great floor staff who worked tirelessly to \nhelp move this process forward.\n  Finally, I want to particularly thank Representative Hilda Solis for, \nonce again, answering the call to serve. We expect the final vote on \nher nomination shortly. I encourage all Senators and colleagues to \nsupport her confirmation on behalf of all the working\n\n[[Page S2412]]\n\nfamilies in our country who need a voice in Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of time and ask for the \nyeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, 14-year-old Aaron Eilerts from Eagle \nGrove, IA, tragically lost his own life last summer when a deadly \ntornado swept through Camp Little Sioux on January 11, 2008. One Iowan, \nAaron, and three Nebraska boys lost their lives that evening.\n  Fifteen years ago today, Bob and Carol Eilerts experienced the \noverwhelming joy and elation that parents treasure the day their child \nis born. The Eilerts undoubtedly took pride in shouldering the \nresponsibilities and sacrifices that parenthood brings. It was not long \nbefore his parents would realize their beloved son spread joy in \nservice to others, in ways big and small, with family, friends, \nneighbors, the elderly, and even total strangers.\n  As a Boy Scout, Aaron took to heart the tenets of his organization. \nThrough words and deeds, he upheld the Boy Scout Law, which prescribed \na Scout as ``trustworthy, loyal, helpful, friendly, courteous, kind, \nobedient, cheerful, thrifty, brave, clean, and reverent.'' Every Boy \nScout knows those words.\n  By all accounts, Aaron Eilerts lived and breathed the objectives of \nan honorable Boy Scout, which included character development, \ncitizenship, and personal fitness. As a parent and grandparent, I can \nappreciate the demands placed on our youth to excel in academics, \nnavigate social pressures, participate in extracurricular activities, \nand to just ``be.''\n  Similar to many young people growing up in small town Iowa, Aaron's \nextensive list of activities was impressive. Besides the Humboldt Boy \nScout Troop 108, Aaron participated in football, cross country, track, \nband, choir, theater, and art. Aaron also was an agent of the CIA; that \nis, ``Character in Action,'' a youth leadership character-building \norganization at Robert Blue Middle School. With so many irons in the \nfire, it is even more remarkable to consider the time and energy Aaron \ndevoted in service to others.\n  Consider a few of the community service projects this industrious 14-\nyear-old organized: hand-sewing pillowcases for pediatric patients, \nteachers, and others in need; making blankets for animals at the Humane \nSociety; volunteering at the local senior center and nursing home; \nperforming the National Anthem at local high school events; and making \nit a habit to do great deeds and simple acts of kindness just to make \nhis community a better place to live.\n  We can honor his legacy of service by following in the footsteps of \nthis local teenage legend. The Governor of Iowa, Chet Culver, has \nproclaimed today, February 24, as the first annual Aaron Eilerts Day of \nService and Giving. Scores of schools and service organizations across \nthe State of Iowa have made plans to participate. Inspired by this \nyoung man's spirit of service, thousands of school students across Iowa \nwill seize this opportunity to make their community a better place.\n  Just a few of the service projects underway today include shoveling \nsnow; sewing pillowcases to donate to hospitals, veterans facilities, \nand nursing homes; creating fleece tie blankets for shelters; packaging \nmeals in a box for local food pantries; conducting food and diaper \nservices and drives that are connected with that; and pumping gas and \ncleaning windshields at local service stations.\n  The Bible tells us in Acts 20:35:\n\n       It is more blessed to give than receive.\n\n  Many of us who contribute time, talents, and treasure in service to \nothers often find we are the ones who are blessed by giving. If I may \nsuggest, I believe Aaron Eilerts, if he were alive today, would agree.\n  Although he did not share the world stage of Mother Teresa, who \ndevoted her life to poverty in service to others, Aaron showed his \ncompassion for others on the stages of his hometown, from the senior \ncenters, to hospitals, school and community events. Mother Teresa is \nattributed with an observation that applies so well to this young man \nfrom Eagle Grove. Mother Teresa said:\n\n       Do not wait for leaders. Do it alone, person to person.\n\n  Aaron Eilerts was a product of small-town Iowa--a small town that \ntook pride in its community, and he took pride in his community. Eagle \nGrove takes pride in this young man, Aaron Eilerts, who was killed last \nJune.\n  I would like to extend, again, my sincerest condolences to the family \nand loved ones Aaron Eilerts has preceded into God's Kingdom. I also \nwould like to take this opportunity to extend an invitation to my \nfellow citizens from the other 49 States. I welcome you to join the \nState of Iowa, and Iowans generally, next year on February 24 to \nparticipate in the annual Aaron Eilerts Day of Service and Giving, as \ndeclared by Governor Culver of my State of Iowa.\n  Tragic circumstances abbreviated the life of this young Iowan with no \nwarning and with no opportunity for second chances.\n  Let Aaron's life and legacy of service inspire each of us to respond \nin our own neighborhoods and communities to the call of service of \ngiving.\n\n[[Page S2413]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/24/senate-section/article/S2413-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2413]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM ``BILL'' RAGGIO\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to honor my longtime colleague \nin Nevada government, State senator William ``Bill'' Raggio, for his \nextensive record of public service and community activism.\n  At this year's Governor's Points of Light Award Dinner, Senator \nRaggio will be honored with the inaugural ``Governor's Choice Award.'' \nThis award, which will be formally presented by Governor Jim Gibbons on \nFebruary 26, recognizes Senator Raggio for his commitment to community \nimprovement through volunteerism and philanthropy.\n  A longtime resident of Nevada, Bill has been a devoted and active \nmember of his community. As a young man during World War II, Senator \nRaggio served his community and his country honorably as a second \nlieutenant in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve. Upon return, he graduated \nfrom the University of Nevada at Reno before pursuing a law degree.\n  Since that time, Bill has been a tireless advocate for the people of \nNevada. He has served on the ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals and \nalso as the district attorney for Washoe County. In 1973, Bill made the \njump to the State senate, where his career has flourished and continues \ntoday. He has worked in various capacities in the State's legislative \nbody, and is currently the minority leader of the senate.\n  I can think of no better recipient of the ``Governor's Choice Award'' \nthan Senator Raggio. His 36 years of public service and selfless \nsacrifice are an example of how a single person can be an overwhelming \ninfluence for good in his community. There is no doubt that his wife \nDale and their children are extremely proud of him. Indeed, all \nNevadans have reason to be proud of Senator Raggio.\n  I congratulate Senator Raggio upon receiving this tremendous honor, \nand wish him all the best in his future undertakings.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, strong leadership at the Department of \nLabor is essential as the economy continues to worsen.\n  Workers who are struggling need leaders who have been there, who know \nwhat it is like to grow up in a working class household. Hilda Solis is \nthe right person to run the most important federal agency for workers \nwho need a helping hand. I strongly support her nomination.\n  Congresswoman Solis grew up in southern California and has for \ndecades fought for the rights of working men and women.\n  While a member of the California State Senate she led the fight in \n1996 to increase the State minimum wage.\n  Since her election to Congress in 2000, she has cochaired the \nbipartisan Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues and played a key \nrole in the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act in 2006.\n  Last year she helped lead the effort to provide workforce training \nfor ``green collar'' jobs.\n  She is also a nationally recognized leader on the environment, and \nfor that she became the first woman to receive the John F. Kennedy \nProfile in Courage Award in 2000.\n  Congresswoman Solis has articulated a strong vision for the \nDepartment. She is ready to lead the Department's efforts in: training \nand job placement for unemployed workers; building career ladders for \nat-risk youth, and expanding opportunities for our military heroes \nreturning from combat.\n  Over 2.6 million workers have lost their jobs since this recession \nbegan, and the end is not yet in sight.\n  America needs an active Department of Labor to help these workers \nretrain for the economy of the 21st century and find new work.\n  America needs Hilda Solis to take charge of the Labor Department and \nto get to work today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/24/senate-section/article/S2413-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2413-S2415]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  COMMITTEE ON BANKING, HOUSING, AND URBAN AFFAIRS RULES OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. DODD.

Mr. President, I rise today to acknowledge National \nPeace Corps Week and the many U.S. Peace Corps volunteers serving \nacross the globe.\n  There are currently 22 U.S. Peace Corps volunteers from Wyoming who \nare serving around the world. These men and women have joined a unique \norganization of people who are willing to make a personal commitment to \nlend a helping hand to those in the world who are less fortunate than \nus.\n  These Americans often live and work in challenging areas as they \npartner with their local counterparts to aid development. Peace Corps \nvolunteers have made significant contributions assisting people to \nimprove health care services, create business opportunities, promote \neducation, and develop resources.\n  Many people in the world today are suffering from political unrest, \nnatural disasters, disease, and a lack of economic opportunities. I \ncommend all the Peace Corps volunteers who leave behind the comforts of \nhome to live in different areas of the world and work to make the world \na better place.\n  The Peace Corps volunteers' reputation as ambassadors of good-will \ndemonstrates the ability of individuals to make a difference in our \nworld. As they work alongside people from different nations, these \nvolunteers have the opportunity to represent America and the values \nthat we hold dear. Additionally, our volunteers' knowledge of the \nunique challenges people face gives us insight into developing better \nrelations with other countries. I applaud their efforts and dedication.\n  I would like to recognize the men and women from Wyoming who are \ncurrently serving as U.S. Peace Corps volunteers: Lisa J. Balland, \nserving in Uganda; Thomas P. Burian, serving in Capre Verde; Bria M. \nChimenti, serving in Tonga; Jenna M. Dillion, serving in Senegal; \nHeather Dixon, serving in Gambia; Seth H.

As I am sure the senior Senator from \nNebraska would agree, this is a community worthy of the honor.

Would the senior Senator like to offer his \nthoughts on the honor this Nebraska county has received?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I thank the junior Senator \nfrom Nebraska. I, too, offer my praises to Hamilton County, NE, and to \nexpress how truly fitting this honor from the Progressive Farmer is. \nHamilton County has always been a place imbued with the strong values \nof our great State of Nebraska values of the family, a strong work \nethic, and the beauty that the State is known for. Aptly named for our \nNation's first Treasury Secretary--Alexander Hamilton--this county \nholds many of Nebraska's treasures.

Mr. President, Senate Standing Rules XXVI requires \neach committee to adopt rules to govern the procedure of the committee \nand to publish those rules in the Congressional Record not later than \nMarch 1 of the first year of each Congress. On February 24, 2009, a \nmajority of the members of the Committee on Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs' Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations adopted \nsubcommittee rules of procedure.\n  Consistent with Standing Rule XXVI, I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record a copy of the rules of procedure of the Permanent \nSubcommittee on Investigations.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, as Adopted\n\n\n                           february 24, 2009\n\n       1. No public hearing connected with an investigation may be \n     held without the approval of either the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member or the approval of a Majority of the \n     Members of the Subcommittee. In all cases, notification to \n     all Members of the intent to hold hearings must be given at \n     least 7 days in advance to the date of the hearing. The \n     Ranking Minority Member should be kept fully apprised of \n     preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings. \n     Preliminary inquiries may be initiated by the Subcommittee \n     Majority staff upon the approval of the Chairman and notice \n     of such approval to the Ranking Minority Member or the \n     Minority counsel. Preliminary inquiries may be undertaken by \n     the Minority staff upon the approval of the Ranking Minority \n     Member and notice of such approval to the Chairman or Chief \n     Counsel. Investigations may be undertaken upon the approval \n     of the Chairman of the Subcommittee and the Ranking Minority \n     Member with notice of such approval to all Members.\n       No public hearing shall be held if the Minority Members \n     unanimously object, unless the full Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs by a majority vote approves \n     of such public hearing.\n       Senate Rules will govern all closed sessions convened by \n     the Subcommittee (Rule XXVI, Sec. 5(b), Standing Rules of the \n     Senate).\n       2. Subpoenas for witnesses, as well as documents and \n     records, may be authorized and issued by the Chairman, or any \n     other Member of the Subcommittee designated by him or her, \n     with notice to the Ranking Minority Member. A written notice \n     of intent to issue a subpoena shall be provided to the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member of the Committee, or \n     staff officers designated by them, by the Subcommittee \n     Chairman or a staff officer designated by him or her, \n     immediately upon such authorization, and no subpoena shall be \n     issued for at least 48 hours, excluding Saturdays and \n     Sundays, from delivery to the appropriate offices, unless the \n     Chairman and Ranking Minority Member waive the 48 hour \n     waiting period or unless the Subcommittee Chairman certifies \n     in writing to the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member that, \n     in his or her opinion, it is necessary to issue a subpoena \n     immediately.\n       3. The Chairman shall have the authority to call meetings \n     of the Subcommittee. This authority may be delegated by the \n     Chairman to any other Member of the Subcommittee when \n     necessary.\n       4. If at least three Members of the Subcommittee desire the \n     Chairman to call a special meeting, they may file in the \n     office of the Subcommittee, a written request therefor, \n     addressed to the Chairman. Immediately thereafter, the clerk \n     of the Subcommittee shall notify the Chairman of such \n     request. If, within 3 calendar days after the filing of such \n     request, the Chairman fails to call the requested special \n     meeting, which is to be held within 7 calendar days after the \n     filing of such request, a majority of the Subcommittee \n     Members may file in the office of the Subcommittee their \n     written notice that\n\n[[Page S2416]]\n\n     a special Subcommittee meeting will be held, specifying the \n     date and hour thereof, and the Subcommittee shall meet on \n     that date and hour. Immediately upon the filing of such \n     notice, the Subcommittee clerk shall notify all Subcommittee \n     Members that such special meeting will be held and inform \n     them of its date and hour. If the Chairman is not present at \n     any regular, additional or special meeting, the Ranking \n     Majority Member present shall preside.\n       5. For public or executive sessions, one Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall constitute a quorum for the administering \n     of oaths and the taking of testimony in any given case or \n     subject matter.\n       One-third of the Members of the Subcommittee shall \n     constitute a quorum for the transaction of Subcommittee \n     business other than the administering of oaths and the taking \n     of testimony, provided that one member of the minority is \n     present.\n       6. All witnesses at public or executive hearings who \n     testify to matters of fact shall be sworn.\n       7. If, during public or executive sessions, a witness, his \n     or her counsel, or any spectator conducts himself or herself \n     in such a manner as to prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or \n     interfere with the orderly administration of such hearing, \n     the Chairman or presiding Member of the Subcommittee present \n     during such hearing may request the Sergeant at Arms of the \n     Senate, his or her representative or any law enforcement \n     official to eject said person from the hearing room.\n       8. Counsel retained by any witness and accompanying such \n     witness shall be permitted to be present during the testimony \n     of such witness at any public or executive hearing, and to \n     advise such witness while he or she is testifying, of his or \n     her legal rights; provided, however, that in the case of any \n     witness who is an officer or employee of the government, or \n     of a corporation or association, the Subcommittee Chairman \n     may rule that representation by counsel from the government, \n     corporation, or association, or by counsel representing other \n     witnesses, creates a conflict of interest, and that the \n     witness may only be represented during interrogation by staff \n     or during testimony before the Subcommittee by personal \n     counsel not from the government, corporation, or association, \n     or by personal counsel not representing other witnesses. This \n     rule shall not be construed to excuse a witness from \n     testifying in the event his or her counsel is ejected for \n     conducting himself or herself in such a manner so as to \n     prevent, impede, disrupt, obstruct, or interfere with the \n     orderly administration of the hearings; nor shall this rule \n     be construed as authorizing counsel to coach the witness or \n     answer for the witness. The failure of any witness to secure \n     counsel shall not excuse such witness from complying with a \n     subpoena or deposition notice.\n       9. Depositions.\n       9.1  Notice. Notices for the taking of depositions in an \n     investigation authorized by the Subcommittee shall be \n     authorized and issued by the Chairman. The Chairman of the \n     full Committee and the Ranking Minority Member of the \n     Subcommittee shall be kept fully apprised of the \n     authorization for the taking of depositions. Such notices \n     shall specify a time and place of examination, and the name \n     of the Subcommittee Member or Members or staff officer or \n     officers who will take the deposition. The deposition shall \n     be in private. The Subcommittee shall not initiate procedures \n     leading to criminal or civil enforcement proceedings for a \n     witness' failure to appear unless the deposition notice was \n     accompanied by a Subcommittee subpoena.\n       9.2  Counsel. Witnesses may be accompanied at a deposition \n     by counsel to advise them of their legal rights, subject to \n     the provisions of Rule 8.\n       9.3  Procedure. Witnesses shall be examined upon oath \n     administered by an individual authorized by local law to \n     administer oaths. Questions shall be propounded orally by \n     Subcommittee Members or staff. Objections by the witness as \n     to the form of questions shall be noted for the record. If a \n     witness objects to a question and refuses to testify on the \n     basis of relevance or privilege, the Subcommittee Members or \n     staff may proceed with the deposition, or may, at that time \n     or at a subsequent time, seek a ruling by telephone or \n     otherwise on the objection from the Chairman or such \n     Subcommittee Member as designated by him or her. If the \n     Chairman or designated Member overrules the objection, he or \n     she may refer the matter to the Subcommittee or he or she may \n     order and direct the witness to answer the question, but the \n     Subcommittee shall not initiate procedures leading to civil \n     or criminal enforcement unless the witness refuses to testify \n     after he or she has been ordered and directed to answer by a \n     Member of the Subcommittee.\n       9.4  Filing. The Subcommittee staff shall see that the \n     testimony is transcribed or electronically recorded. If it is \n     transcribed, the witness shall be furnished with a copy for \n     review pursuant to the provisions of Rule 12. The individual \n     administering the oath shall certify on the transcript that \n     the witness was duly sworn in his or her presence, the \n     transcriber shall certify that the transcript is a true \n     record of the testimony, and the transcript shall then be \n     filed with the Subcommittee clerk. Subcommittee staff may \n     stipulate with the witness to changes in this procedure; \n     deviations from this procedure which do not substantially \n     impair the reliability of the record shall not relieve the \n     witness from his or her obligation to testify truthfully.\n       10. Any witness desiring to read a prepared or written \n     statement in executive or public hearings shall file a copy \n     of such statement with the Chief Counsel or Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee 48 hours in advance of the hearings at which the \n     statement is to be presented unless the Chairman and the \n     Ranking Minority Member waive this requirement. The \n     Subcommittee shall determine whether such statement may be \n     read or placed in the Record of the hearing.\n       11. A witness may request, on grounds of distraction, \n     harassment, personal safety, or physical discomfort, that \n     during the testimony, television, motion picture, and other \n     cameras and lights, shall not be directed at him or her. Such \n     requests shall be ruled on by the Subcommittee Members \n     present at the hearing.\n       12. An accurate stenographic record shall be kept of the \n     testimony of all witnesses in executive and public hearings. \n     The record of his or her own testimony, whether in public or \n     executive session, shall be made available for inspection by \n     witness or his or her counsel under Subcommittee supervision; \n     a copy of any testimony given in public session or that part \n     of the testimony given by the witness in executive session \n     and subsequently quoted or made part of the record in a \n     public session shall be made available to any witness at his \n     or her expense if he or she so requests.\n       13. Interrogation of witnesses at Subcommittee hearings \n     shall be conducted on behalf of the Subcommittee by Members \n     and authorized Subcommittee staff personnel only.\n       14. Any person who is the subject of an investigation in \n     public hearings may submit to the Chairman of the \n     Subcommittee questions in writing for the cross-examination \n     of other witnesses called by the Subcommittee. With the \n     consent of a majority of the Members of the Subcommittee \n     present and voting, these questions, or paraphrased versions \n     of them, shall be put to the witness by the Chairman, by a \n     Member of the Subcommittee, or by counsel of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       15. Any person whose name is mentioned or who is \n     specifically identified, and who believes that testimony or \n     other evidence presented at a public hearing, or comment made \n     by a Subcommittee Member or counsel, tends to defame him or \n     her or otherwise adversely affect his or her reputation, may \n     (a) request to appear personally before the Subcommittee to \n     testify in his or her own behalf, or, in the alternative, (b) \n     file a sworn statement of facts relevant to the testimony or \n     other evidence or comment complained of. Such request and \n     such statement shall be submitted to the Subcommittee for its \n     consideration and action.\n       If a person requests to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee pursuant to alternative (a) referred to herein, \n     said request shall be considered untimely if it is not \n     received by the Chairman of the Subcommittee or its counsel \n     in writing on or before thirty (30) days subsequent to the \n     day on which said person's name was mentioned or otherwise \n     specifically identified during a public hearing held before \n     the Subcommittee, unless the Chairman and the Ranking \n     Minority Member waive this requirement.\n       If a person requests the filing of his or her sworn \n     statement pursuant to alternative (b) referred to herein, the \n     Subcommittee may condition the filing of said sworn statement \n     upon said person agreeing to appear personally before the \n     Subcommittee and to testify concerning the matters contained \n     in his or her sworn statement, as well as any other matters \n     related to the subject of the investigation before the \n     Subcommittee.\n       16. All testimony taken in executive session shall be kept \n     secret and will not be released for public information \n     without the approval of a majority of the Subcommittee.\n       17. No Subcommittee report shall be released to the public \n     unless approved by a majority of the Subcommittee and after \n     no less than 10 days' notice and opportunity for comment by \n     the Members of the Subcommittee unless the need for such \n     notice and opportunity to comment has been waived in writing \n     by a majority of the Minority Members.\n       18. The Ranking Minority Member may select for appointment \n     to the Subcommittee staff a Chief Counsel for the Minority \n     and such other professional staff members and clerical \n     assistants as he or she deems advisable. The total \n     compensation allocated to such Minority staff members shall \n     be not less than one-third the total amount allocated for all \n     Subcommittee staff salaries during any given year. The \n     Minority staff members shall work under the direction and \n     supervision of the Ranking Minority Member. The Chief Counsel \n     for the Minority shall be kept fully informed as to \n     preliminary inquiries, investigations, and hearings, and \n     shall have access to all material in the files of the \n     Subcommittee.\n       19. When it is determined by the Chairman and Ranking \n     Minority Member, or by a majority of the Subcommittee, that \n     there is reasonable cause to believe that a violation of law \n     may have occurred, the Chairman and Ranking Minority Member \n     by letter, or the Subcommittee by resolution, are authorized \n     to report such violation to the proper State, local and/or \n     Federal authorities. Such letter or report may recite the \n     basis for the determination of reasonable cause. This rule is \n     not authority for release of documents or testimony.\n\n[[Page S2417]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/24/senate-section/article/S2417-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2417-S2418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                    SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, In mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record:\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Thank you for this opportunity to talk about this issue.\n       I am not complaining. I have a wonderful life here in Idaho \n     that I could never afford in California. These are the facts \n     of my life.\n       I am a 46-year-old, divorced female with no children. I am \n     a high school graduate. I am not a minority. I am an American \n     citizen.\n       Like a lot of Idahoans, I work full time for a low wage. I \n     make $13.00 an hour without employee benefits. I buy my own \n     health insurance and contribute an inadequate amount to my \n     own IRA. I do own a modest town home in downtown Boise. I \n     have almost paid off my dream vehicle, a medium-sized pickup \n     truck. My monthly expenses are about $1,200 a month. This \n     does not include groceries, gas, clothes or entertainment. I \n     commute seven miles (round trip) to my job at Hewlett-Packard \n     five days a week. I eat my lunch at my desk. I love my job, I \n     love my home, I love my truck, I love Idaho!\n       Last year it was really tight. I kept my home heat at 60-65 \n     degrees during the winter. This year it is impossible for me \n     to make ends meet. The cost of gas and food has increased way \n     more than my salary. I am using my credit card, that I had \n     just paid off, to put gas into my truck. Dumb, but I got to \n     have gas to make my life work. We all do!\n       I have a small ``carbon footprint.'' And [now I am told to \n     conserve!]\n       I looked at taking the bus, Valley Ride. It would take me \n     one-and-a-half hours to take the bus to work and one-and-a-\n     half hours to go home at the end of the day. My time is too \n     valuable. I would rather go to the gym, ride my bike on the \n     greenbelt, play with my dog, mow my lawn, have a beer with my \n     buds.\n       I am furious! There is no reason on God's green earth why \n     this should be happening to Americans. We are the greatest \n     nation on earth with vast resources that our Government has \n     taken from us with their [moratoriums!]\n       Manmade global warming is nothing more that a leftist power \n     grab and I am sick of elitists telling the rest of us how to \n     live our lives! I want to take care of myself, not the \n     government! What we have going on [right now] is national \n     economic suicide! I appreciate all you try to do for Idaho \n     and the citizens of the United States. You have been a \n     wonderful Senator. I am very excited about having nuclear \n     power plants in Idaho. And I look forward to our State \n     creating more businesses, jobs and revenue by using our \n     state's renewable resources. Any chance Idaho has some \n     coal or oil we could exploit? Free market is the way to go \n     for all of America's needs!\n     Suzanne, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am sure you have received thousands of responses by now, \n     and I am sure I am not the first to come to you with these \n     concerns and ideas. I just hope that adding our ``story'' to \n     the mix, might add some additional light to the situation.\n       Who we are: We are a family of six. Our children are 5 \n     years and almost 3-year-old triplets. We own/operate a dairy \n     in Kuna.\n       Each trip into Boise costs us about $10 (round trip) in \n     gas. I used to do all my shopping at Walmart/Costco/Winco \n     since the price of groceries are cheaper there than at our \n     Kuna Paul's store. However, adding in the cost of gas now \n     makes tasks as simple as grocery shopping that much more \n     expensive. We are trying to last up to 2 weeks in between \n     shopping trips, just because of the cost of gas. We are \n     eating more frozen foods and less fresh foods.\n       Trips to the zoo or park have been completely eliminated.\n       My husband and I have been volunteering at St. Luke's NICU \n     for the last eight months, but have been finding it hard to \n     justify spending the $10 in gas each time we go, when we are \n     struggling just to pay for the groceries each month.\n       At our dairy, the cost to feed our own livestock is \n     astronomically high!! The past several months have all been \n     negative income months due entirely to the cost of grains. As \n     a dairy owner, the milk price is going to have to go higher \n     if dairies are going to survive.\n       My suggestions: Abolish the ethanol subsidies. It is \n     pushing our food prices higher and higher. The cost of grain \n     to make foods or to feed the livestock (that then becomes our \n     food) is pushing a lot of the grocery bills higher and \n     higher. If we have to, we can start riding bikes, but I do \n     not have much choice when it comes to feeding my family.\n       We need to become more self-sufficient for our own energy \n     needs. We need to start drilling. We need to start pushing \n     for more electric and hybrid cars. Could we even start a \n     program that would help convert gas engines into hybrids??? I \n     would gladly spend a couple thousand (probably would go on a \n     credit card honestly) right now to convert our family vehicle \n     into a hybrid!\n       Hopefully you have time to read this e-mail and if you did, \n     thank you so much!\n     Leslie.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am cutting back on fuel and fertilizer as much as I can. \n     But, as a person pushing seventy, being frugal and ``making \n     do'' is no problem and the challenge can be rather \n     enjoyable--a virtue, not a vice. This seems to not be the \n     case with the ``boomers'' and their progeny. They do not want \n     to do without and they look for simplistic answers from \n     politicians to a complex issue.\n       This is what I have seen in my lifetime: A doubling of \n     world population every 25 years; Rising standards of living \n     in large areas of the non-Western European-North American \n     world and rising demand for energy; Finite easily and cheaply \n     accessible oil and gas reserves; Unmistakable evidence of \n     serious environmental damage, in part due to profligate use \n     of fossil fuels; The swing in my lifetime away from efficient \n     affordable public transportation and towards an emphasis on \n     private motor transportation, truck haulage, and air travel; \n     A reversal of conservation measures and the encouragement of \n     alternative energy development began in the seventies.\n       There are no quick fixes. The feds and the states can \n     embark on a serious program of conservation. They can see \n     what the Europeans have done along these lines the past \n     thirty years. They can get really serious about public \n     transportation--especially rail--the most efficient way of \n     moving freight and people on land. More efficient engines as \n     well, and smaller vehicles.\n       Long term, we need a serious energy strategy that involves \n     alternatives, renewables, and changing lifestyles.\n       Can it be done? It better be done, but it will take some \n     real leadership on the national level.\n     Cleve, Bonners Ferry.\n                                  ____\n\n       Drill! Build new refineries! Stop cowering to the \n     environmental special interests! Stop selling this country's \n     sovereign nation down the tubes. Thank you for trying to do \n     something about this crisis.\n       The opportunity to have an open dialog regarding high \n     energy prices is a refreshing change. It is apparent to me \n     that by opening this door you are comfortable in the \n     understanding that elected officials serve the people \n     interest and not visa-versa.\n       My family is struggling. The increases we are seeing in the \n     cost of energy are directly affected ``every'' area of our \n     life. We are a simple middle-class family. Prior to this last \n     year, we had seen a steady increase in the cost of living. \n     However the sharp rise over the last year has been so \n     tremendous we have been forced cut way back.\n       Highlights from the previous 12 months: We have depleted \n     our savings accounts; We have accepted food donations; We \n     have removed a large majority of all non-essential expenses \n     in the home; We are using the economic stimulus check to pay \n     off our tax debt from last year.\n       Idaho's economy is not on an even par with California, \n     Florida, New York or Washington D.C. Wages are substantially \n     lower here. Yet the cost of living is skyrocketing. This is \n     directly due to the higher energy costs. Currently we do not \n     have an alternate source of power to move our industry. A \n     gallon of milk or a dozen eggs are produced, processed and \n     transported with the use of natural gas, coal and oil. These \n     are the three primary resources used by industrial nations to \n     sustain their viability.\n       We are losing our viability and limiting our innovation. If \n     you take a look at Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs theory, you \n     will see that human nature will move up or down based on \n     whether the needs at a given level are being met. The cost of \n     living is forcing our society to circle the wagons. People \n     are spending money on food that, in some cases, has doubled. \n     Basic services that were affordable in years past are not. \n     Small businesses are suffering. Large businesses are losing \n     the support of small businesses all of which has stalling \n     economic growth. Stalled economic growth creates a cascading \n     snowball pushing us closer and closer to the razor's edge. In \n     our country, we have always been considered a nation of \n     opportunity. We are falling backwards. Hope, vision, trust \n     and growth are losing ground to Fear and Anger.\n       As the cost of fuel go up, manufacturers push their costs \n     onto the markets and the markets just push those cost onto \n     the consumer. Initially the manufacturers and markets do not \n     feel a big squeeze because the consumer adjusts to the \n     market. My wife spent about six months adjusting to the \n     market before we gave up and drastically\n\n[[Page S2418]]\n\n     changed our consumer spending habits. Please inform your \n     fellow Senators that until energy cost go down you will see \n     very little of my money coming in from consumer based taxes \n     currently being levied because I refuse to buy ``anything!'' \n     if I cannot supply shelter and food for my family.\n       You should warn your fellow Senators that the markets that \n     lobby for their support are going to start screaming very \n     soon, if they are not already, to take action. If the \n     government is unwilling to move based on the requests of the \n     people they server maybe they will move when the markets \n     force them and the money generated from taxes starts to dry \n     up.\n       There is a groundswell out here of people that will, out of \n     necessity, organize to find ways to reduce cost without the \n     help of government and without the need to rely on markets. \n     Due to the lack of action by the government to allow for the \n     explore from additional resources, both the government and \n     the markets are going to see a major shift away from a \n     consumer-based economy.\n       Reduction in the cost of energy plus a increase the \n     investment in exploration plus increase the investment in \n     alternate energy sources equals Sustainability, Growth, \n     Innovation, Independence, Cost of living reduction, increased \n     revenue.\n       Please also remember to remind your fellow Senators that \n     ``We the People'' do not work hard to increase government \n     revenue. We work hard to sustain and/or increase personal \n     revenue.\n     Sean, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I think this country is going to go down the tubes because \n     no one will take action and are pandering to the extreme \n     environmentalists. Why do we think that the rest of the world \n     needs to take all the risks of oil drilling and we do not. \n     Yes, eventually our country could probably adjust to the lack \n     of oil we have now. But this happened way too fast and \n     adjustments just cannot happen fast enough. We need to have \n     our own supplies and we need to be taking steps now for our \n     own supplies and to develop alternatives. I back 100% the \n     drilling and even going to Alaska. Most people who have lived \n     there or know about the pipelines say that there is almost no \n     negative effects on wildlife. We cannot go on not taking our \n     own risks for our own oil.\n       My husband and myself live in a community that is 30 miles \n     from the nearest decent grocery store and jobs. We cannot \n     afford to go out and buy a high gas mileage car right now, so \n     what are we to do? We do not have a mass transit system \n     available to us--not even a bus. I am 65 and never thought \n     that I would see our life end the way it looks like it is \n     going to end. The US has lost its supremacy in this world and \n     we will soon be a second rate country, if not third world.\n       Thank you for asking common citizens their opinions. I do \n     not know of anyone that agrees with what is happening and the \n     burying of the heads in the sand. I hate what Pres. Bush has \n     done to this country, but I am very afraid of where we will \n     go under the extreme Democrats.\n                                                           Lesley.\n       My husband and I are both past retirement age, and we live \n     for the most part on a fixed income, which we supplement by \n     both of us working part-time. My husband is in very poor \n     health, but he has to work in order for us to get by \n     financially. The energy prices are having a great impact on \n     everyone that we know. They have driven up the cost of \n     everything. It does not matter what you buy--it costs more \n     every time you go to the store. Our children live in the \n     Logan, Utah area, the Boise area, and in Houston, Texas. We \n     are now to the point where we cannot go to watch our \n     grandchildren's ball games, school programs, recitals, Church \n     programs etc. We have older grandchildren, so there are \n     showers, weddings, missionary farewells and reports. We have \n     several family gatherings every year, and now we all feel \n     that we cannot afford to travel. I know that you share our \n     beliefs in the importance of the family and spending time \n     together. It no longer is a matter of choice--we cannot \n     afford to visit them, and they cannot afford to come home. \n     When I went to Rigby this morning, gas was $3.93. When I came \n     home an hour later, it was $4.05--a 12-cent raise, and we all \n     know it is just going to continue to go higher. Utah Power \n     has asked for a rate increase, and the cost of propane has \n     increased along with gas prices. Our income will only cover \n     so much expense no matter how much we try to cut back and cut \n     out.\n       We support using our own oil--uncapping existing wells, \n     drilling wherever there is oil, drilling in ANWR, and \n     drilling offshore. We support nuclear energy. We do not \n     support the manufacture and use of ethanol. Making ethanol \n     has pushed corn prices out of sight, which has affected \n     livestock prices, further increasing the cost of food. It \n     takes too much energy to produce ethanol for it to be \n     economically feasible. We have been sold the proverbial \n     ``bill of goods'' where ethanol is concerned.\n       Thank you for everything that you are doing to try to solve \n     the energy crisis. We appreciate your efforts very much.\n     Gary and Julie, Rigby.\n                                  ____\n\n       The gas prices have impacted our family significantly. We \n     have three vehicles that we use for transportation. Since the \n     price of gas has increased, we spend almost as much on gas as \n     we do for a house payment. That is excessive! All of our \n     transportation is to and from work and school, and running \n     errand such as doctor appointment and getting groceries.\n       We have tried to cut down the car usage by car pooling and \n     riding our bike when possible. This seldom works because our \n     schedules seldom correspond with each other and they are not \n     flexible enough to get them to work; we do not have a bus \n     service out by where we live so that is not an option; we do \n     not have a safe bike lane and/or sidewalks to ride our bikes \n     without competing for space with other vehicles that drive 40 \n     to 50 miles an hour even though the speed limit is 35. The \n     meeting places for the Share A Ride Program, are in the \n     opposite direction of where we need to be. We are prisoners \n     of our economy. This is both by gas prices and no other safe \n     alternative.\n       The money for gas has got to come from somewhere so we do \n     not go to movies, out to eat, or camping. We have not ever \n     been able to take a typical vacation because our occupations \n     do not pay the type of salary that would support that \n     lifestyle, so camping three times in the summer was our form \n     of vacation. We do not fly anywhere or drive anywhere outside \n     of Boise and Meridian. My husband's family lives in \n     Pocatello, and it has been almost one year since we have \n     visited them.\n       Everything has increased in price whether it is directly or \n     indirectly related to rising gas prices. I now hang my \n     clothes out on a clothesline instead of drying them in the \n     dryer; I raise vegetables in the garden instead of supporting \n     the farmer's market; I can anything and everything I can find \n     that is extra produce; we do not use the air conditioning at \n     all; we heat by burning wood in the fireplace. I am not sure \n     how we are going to afford the gas to pay for us to go and \n     cut our firewood for the coming winter.\n       All prices are increasing, businesses are failing, \n     unemployment is at an all-time high. It has hit the working \n     class the hardest. The rich get richer and the poor get \n     poorer. For my generation, I feel this is the beginning of \n     our Depression for America. The sad thing is, I do not even \n     see a glimmer of hope for things to change in the next 15 \n     years. By then I will be old enough to retire . . . but \n     retire to what?\n       Thank you for this opportunity to tell you how our family \n     has been affected by the increase in fuel prices.\n     Cathy, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a [conservative voter] and applaud you for taking on \n     this issue.

Now the gas is over $4.00 a gallon and this makes \n     it worse because I am spending most of my money buying gas to \n     get to work. This also drives up all the basic needs such as \n     food on the table also. All extra activities are not \n     happening period. This is making it difficult when my pay is \n     only $1.15 more an hour than what I made almost 20 years ago. \n     Prices on everything including government must slow down so \n     my wages can catch up. By the way, gas 20 years ago was far \n     less than $0.60 a gallon then.

Mr. President, Hilda Solis has a remarkable story of \nself-determination as the daughter of Mexican and Nicaraguan immigrants \nwho has been nominated by the President to serve as our nation's 25th \nSecretary of Labor. Congresswoman Solis was the first from her family \nto graduate from college and then went on to earn a master's degree in \npublic administration from the University of Southern California. In \n1992, she began her career in public service when she was elected to \nthe California State Assembly and has represented California's 32nd \nDistrict in the House of Representatives since 2000.\n  These are very tough economic times for all Americans. Today, the \nFederal Reserve Chairman, Ben Bernanke, said that he doesn't expect our \nlabor markets to improve until 2011. We will see the end of this \nrecession. However, as businesses fight to get back on their\n\n[[Page S2419]]\n\nfeet, we need to be preparing and training workers who have lost their \njobs so they can continue to succeed in our world economy. I hope that \nCongresswoman Solis, once confirmed, will make as a top priority the \navailability of adequate worker training programs for our labor force.\n  While I know that Congresswoman Solis and I have divergent views on \nmany of the issues she will consider as Labor Secretary, I am proud of \nher nomination as the first Latina to be considered for the position of \nSecretary of Labor. I do believe her nomination could have been \nconsidered sooner if the Congresswoman had not submitted documents to \nthe Committee and the House of Representatives that included errors and \nomissions, specifically regarding her position as Treasurer of a not-\nfor-profit lobbying firm. However, I am pleased that the nominee worked \nwith the Committee to correct these errors and omissions and hope this \nspirit of cooperation continues between Congresswoman Solis and the \nCongress when she serves as a member of the new administration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/24/senate-section/article/S2419-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2419-S2423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ADDRESS BY THE PRESIDENT DELIVERED TO A JOINT SESSION OF CONGRESS ON \n                        FEBRUARY 24, 2009--PM 8\n\n   The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was which was ordered to lie on the table.\n\n To The Congress of the United States:\n   I've come here tonight not only to address the distinguished men and \nwomen in this great chamber, but to speak frankly and directly to the \nmen and women who sent us here.\n  I know that for many Americans watching right now, the state of our \neconomy is a concern that rises above all others. And rightly so. If \nyou haven't been personally affected by this recession, you probably \nknow someone who has--a friend; a neighbor; a member of your family. \nYou don't need to hear another list of statistics to know that our \neconomy is in crisis, because you live it every day. It's the worry you \nwake up with and the source of sleepless nights. It's the job you \nthought you'd retire from but now have lost; the business you built \nyour dreams upon that's now hanging by a thread; the college acceptance \nletter your child had to put back in the envelope. The impact of this \nrecession is real, and it is everywhere.\n  But while our economy may be weakened and our confidence shaken; \nthough we are living through difficult and uncertain times, tonight I \nwant every American to know this:\n   We will rebuild, we will recover, and the United States of America \nwill emerge stronger than before.\n  The weight of this crisis will not determine the destiny of this \nNation. The answers to our problems don't lie beyond our reach. They \nexist in our laboratories and universities; in our fields and our \nfactories; in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of \nthe hardest-working people on Earth. Those qualities that have made \nAmerica the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history \nwe still possess in ample measure. What is required now is for this \ncountry to pull together, confront boldly the challenges we face, and \ntake responsibility for our future once more. Now, if we're honest with \nourselves, we'll admit that for too long, we have not always met these \nresponsibilities--as a Government or as a people. I say this not to lay \nblame or look backwards, but because it is only by understanding how we \narrived at this moment that we'll be able to lift ourselves out of this \npredicament.\n  The fact is, our economy did not fall into decline overnight. Nor did \nall of our problems begin when the housing market collapsed or the \nstock market sank. We have known for decades that our survival depends \non finding new sources of energy. Yet we import more oil today than \never before. The cost of health care eats up more and more of our \nsavings each year, yet we keep delaying reform. Our children will \ncompete for jobs in a global economy that too many of our schools do \nnot prepare them for. And though all these challenges went unsolved, we \nstill managed to spend more money and pile up more debt, both as \nindividuals and through our Government, than ever before.\n   In other words, we have lived through an era where too often, short-\nterm gains were prized over long-term prosperity; where we failed to \nlook beyond the next payment, the next quarter, or the next election. A \nsurplus became an excuse to transfer wealth to the wealthy instead of \nan opportunity to invest in our future. Regulations were gutted for the \nsake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market. People \nbought homes they knew they couldn't afford from banks and lenders who \npushed those bad loans anyway. And all the while, critical debates and \ndifficult decisions were put off for some other time on some other day.\n  Well that day of reckoning has arrived, and the time to take charge \nof our future is here.\n  Now is the time to act boldly and wisely--to not only revive this \neconomy, but to build a new foundation for lasting prosperity. Now is \nthe time to jumpstart job creation, re-start lending, and invest in \nareas like energy, health care, and education that will grow our \neconomy, even as we make hard choices to bring our deficit down. That \nis what my economic agenda is designed to do, and that's what I'd like \nto talk to you about tonight.\n  It's an agenda that begins with jobs.\n  As soon as I took office, I asked this Congress to send me a recovery \nplan by President's Day that would put people back to work and put \nmoney in their pockets. Not because I believe in bigger Government--I \ndon't. Not because I'm not mindful of the massive debt we've \ninherited--I am. I called for action because the failure to do so would \nhave cost more jobs and caused more hardships. In fact, a failure to \nact would have worsened our long-term deficit by assuring weak economic \ngrowth for years. That's why I pushed for quick action. And tonight, I \nam grateful that this Congress delivered, and pleased to say that the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act is now law.\n  Over the next 2 years, this plan will save or create 3.5 million \njobs. More than 90 percent of these jobs will be in the private \nsector--jobs rebuilding our roads and bridges; constructing wind \nturbines and solar panels; laying broadband and expanding mass transit.\n   Because of this plan, there are teachers who can now keep their jobs \nand educate our kids. Health care professionals can continue caring for \nour sick. There are 57 police officers who are still on the streets of \nMinneapolis tonight because this plan prevented the layoffs their \ndepartment was about to make.\n  Because of this plan, 95 percent of the working households in America \nwill receive a tax cut--a tax cut that you will see in your paychecks \nbeginning on April 1st.\n   Because of this plan, families who are struggling to pay tuition \ncosts will receive a $2,500 tax credit for all four years of college. \nAnd Americans who have lost their jobs in this recession will be able \nto receive extended unemployment benefits and continued health care \ncoverage to help them weather this storm.\n   I know there are some in this chamber and watching at home who are \nskeptical of whether this plan will work. I understand that skepticism. \nHere in Washington, we've all seen how quickly good intentions can turn \ninto broken promises and wasteful spending. And with a plan of this \nscale comes enormous responsibility to get it right.\n  That is why I have asked Vice President Biden to lead a tough, \nunprecedented oversight effort--because nobody messes with Joe. I have \ntold each member of my Cabinet as well as mayors and governors across \nthe country that they will be held accountable by me and the American \npeople for every dollar they spend. I have appointed a proven and \naggressive Inspector General to ferret out any and all cases of waste \nand fraud. And we have created a new Web site called recovery.gov so \nthat every American can find out how and where their money is being \nspent.\n  So the recovery plan we passed is the first step in getting our \neconomy back on track. But it is just the first step. Because even if \nwe manage this plan flawlessly, there will be no real recovery unless \nwe clean up the credit crisis that has severely weakened our financial \nsystem.\n\n[[Page S2420]]\n\n  I want to speak plainly and candidly about this issue tonight, \nbecause every American should know that it directly affects you and \nyour family's well-being. You should also know that the money you've \ndeposited in banks across the country is safe; your insurance is \nsecure; and you can rely on the continued operation of our financial \nsystem. That is not the source of concern.\n  The concern is that if we do not re-start lending in this country, \nour recovery will be choked off before it even begins.\n  You see, the flow of credit is the lifeblood of our economy. The \nability to get a loan is how you finance the purchase of everything \nfrom a home to a car to a college education; how stores stock their \nshelves, farms buy equipment, and businesses make payroll.\n  But credit has stopped flowing the way it should. Too many bad loans \nfrom the housing crisis have made their way onto the books of too many \nbanks. With so much debt and so little confidence, these banks are now \nfearful of lending out any more money to households, to businesses, or \nto each other. When there is no lending, families can't afford to buy \nhomes or cars. So businesses are forced to make layoffs. Our economy \nsuffers even more, and credit dries up even further.\n  That is why this Administration is moving swiftly and aggressively to \nbreak this destructive cycle, restore confidence, and re-start lending.\n  We will do so in several ways. First, we are creating a new lending \nfund that represents the largest effort ever to help provide auto \nloans, college loans, and small business loans to the consumers and \nentrepreneurs who keep this economy running.\n  Second, we have launched a housing plan that will help responsible \nfamilies facing the threat of foreclosure lower their monthly payments \nand refinance their mortgages. It's a plan that won't help speculators \nor that neighbor down the street who bought a house he could never hope \nto afford, but it will help millions of Americans who are struggling \nwith declining home values--Americans who will now be able to take \nadvantage of the lower interest rates that this plan has already helped \nbring about. In fact, the average family who refinances today can save \nnearly $2000 per year on their mortgage.\n  Third, we will act with the full force of the Federal Government to \nensure that the major banks that Americans depend on have enough \nconfidence and enough money to lend even in more difficult times. And \nwhen we learn that a major bank has serious problems, we will hold \naccountable those responsible, force the necessary adjustments, provide \nthe support to clean up their balance sheets, and assure the continuity \nof a strong, viable institution that can serve our people and our \neconomy.\n  I understand that on any given day, Wall Street may be more comforted \nby an approach that gives banks bailouts with no strings attached, and \nthat holds nobody accountable for their reckless decisions. But such an \napproach won't solve the problem. And our goal is to quicken the day \nwhen we re-start lending to the American people and American business \nand end this crisis once and for all.\n  I intend to hold these banks fully accountable for the assistance \nthey receive, and this time, they will have to clearly demonstrate how \ntaxpayer dollars result in more lending for the American taxpayer. This \ntime, CEOs won't be able to use taxpayer money to pad their paychecks \nor buy fancy drapes or disappear on a private jet. Those days are over.\n  Still, this plan will require significant resources from the Federal \nGovernment--and yes, probably more than we've already set aside. But \nwhile the cost of action will be great. I can assure you that the cost \nof inaction will be far greater, for it could result in an economy that \nsputters along for not months or years, but perhaps a decade. That \nwould be worse for our deficit, worse for business, worse for you, and \nworse for the next generation. And I refuse to let that happen.\n\n  I understand that when the last Administration asked this Congress to \nprovide assistance for struggling banks, Democrats and Republicans \nalike were infuriated by the mismanagement and results that followed. \nSo were the American taxpayers. So was I.\n  So I know how unpopular it is to be seen as helping banks right now, \nespecially when everyone is suffering in part from their bad decisions. \nI promise you--I get it.\n  But I also know that in a time of crisis, we cannot afford to govern \nout of anger, or yield to the politics of the moment. My job--our job--\nis to solve the problem. Our job is to govern with a sense of \nresponsibility. I will not spend a single penny for the purpose of \nrewarding a single Wall Street executive, but I will do whatever it \ntakes to help the small business that can't pay its workers or the \nfamily that has saved and still can't get a mortgage.\n  That's what this is about. It's not about helping banks--it's about \nhelping people. Because when credit is available again, that young \nfamily can finally buy a new home. And then some company will hire \nworkers to build it. And then those workers will have money to spend, \nand if they can get a loan too, maybe they'll finally buy that car, or \nopen their own business. Investors will return to the market, and \nAmerican families will see their retirement secured once more. Slowly, \nbut surely, confidence will return, and our economy will recover.\n  So I ask this Congress to join me in doing whatever proves necessary. \nBecause we cannot consign our Nation to an open-ended recession. And to \nensure that a crisis of this magnitude never happens again, I ask the \nCongress to move quickly on legislation that will finally reform our \noutdated regulatory system. It is time to put in place tough, new \ncommon-sense rules of the road so that our financial market rewards \ndrive and innovation, and punishes short-cuts and abuse.\n  The recovery plan and the financial stability plan are the immediate \nsteps we're taking to revive our economy in the short-term. But the \nonly way to fully restore America's economic strength is to make the \nlong-term investments that will lead to new jobs, new industries, and a \nrenewed ability to compete with the rest of the world. The only way \nthis century will be another American century is if we confront at last \nthe price of our dependence on oil and the high cost of health care; \nthe schools that aren't preparing our children and the mountain of debt \nthey stand to inherit. That is our responsibility.\n  In the next few days, I will submit a budget to the Congress. So \noften, we have come to view these documents as simply numbers on a page \nor laundry lists of programs. I see this document differently. I see it \nas a vision for America--as a blueprint for our future.\n  My budget does not attempt to solve every problem or address every \nissue. It reflects the stark reality of what we've inherited--a \ntrillion dollar deficit, a financial crisis, and a costly recession.\n  Given these realities, everyone in this chamber--Democrats and \nRepublicans--will have to sacrifice some worthy priorities for which \nthere are no dollars. And that includes me.\n\n  But that does not mean we can afford to ignore our long-term \nchallenges. I reject the view that says our problems will simply take \ncare of themselves; that says Government has no role in laying the \nfoundation for our common prosperity.\n  For history tells a different story. History reminds us that at every \nmoment of economic upheaval and transformation, this Nation has \nresponded with bold action and big ideas. In the midst of civil war, we \nlaid railroad tracks from one coast to another that spurred commerce \nand industry. From the turmoil of the Industrial Revolution came a \nsystem of public high schools that prepared our citizens for a new age. \nIn the wake of war and depression, the GI Bill sent a generation to \ncollege and created the largest middle class in history. And a twilight \nstruggle for freedom led to a nation of highways, an American on the \nmoon, and an explosion of technology that still shapes our world.\n  In each case, Government didn't supplant private enterprise; it \ncatalyzed private enterprise. It created the conditions for thousands \nof entrepreneurs and new businesses to adapt and to thrive.\n  We are a Nation that has seen promise amid peril, and claimed \nopportunity from ordeal. Now we must be that nation again. That is why, \neven as it cuts\n\n[[Page S2421]]\n\nback on the programs we don't need, the budget I submit will invest in \nthe three areas that are absolutely critical to our economic future: \nenergy, health care, and education.\n  It begins with energy.\n  We know the country that harnesses the power of clean, renewable \nenergy will lead the 21st century. And yet, it is China that has \nlaunched the largest effort in history to make their economy energy \nefficient. We invented solar technology, but we've fallen behind \ncountries like Germany and Japan in producing it. New plug-in hybrids \nroll off our assembly lines, but they will run on batteries made in \nKorea.\n  Well I do not accept a future where the jobs and industries of \ntomorrow take root beyond our borders--and I know you don't either. It \nis time for America to lead again.\n  Thanks to our recovery plan, we will double this Nation's supply of \nrenewable energy in the next 3 years. We have also made the largest \ninvestment in basic research funding in American history--an investment \nthat will spur not only new discoveries in energy, but breakthroughs in \nmedicine, science, and technology.\n  We will soon lay down thousands of miles of power lines that can \ncarry new energy to cities and towns across this country. And we will \nput Americans to work making our homes and buildings more efficient so \nthat we can save billions of dollars on our energy bills.\n  But to truly transform our economy, protect our security, and save \nour planet from the ravages of climate change, we need to ultimately \nmake clean, renewable energy the profitable kind of energy. So I ask \nthis Congress to send me legislation that places a market-based cap on \ncarbon pollution and drives the production of more renewable energy in \nAmerica. And to support that innovation, we will invest $15 billion a \nyear to develop technologies like wind power and solar power; advanced \nbiofuels, clean coal, and more fuel-efficient cars and trucks built \nright here in America.\n  As for our auto industry, everyone recognizes that years of bad \ndecision-making and a global recession have pushed our automakers to \nthe brink. We should not, and will not, protect them from their own bad \npractices. But we are committed to the goal of a re-tooled, re-imagined \nauto industry that can compete and win. Millions of jobs depend on it. \nScores of communities depend on it. And I believe the Nation that \ninvented the automobile cannot walk away from it.\n\n  None of this will come without cost, nor will it be easy. But this is \nAmerica. We don't do what's easy. We do what is necessary to move this \ncountry forward.\n  For that same reason, we must also address the crushing cost of \nhealth care.\n  This is a cost that now causes a bankruptcy in America every 30 \nseconds. By the end of the year, it could cause 1.5 million Americans \nto lose their homes. In the last 8 years, premiums have grown four \ntimes faster than wages. And in each of these years, one million more \nAmericans have lost their health insurance. It is one of the major \nreasons why small businesses close their doors and corporations ship \njobs overseas. And it's one of the largest and fastest-growing parts of \nour budget.\n  Given these facts, we can no longer afford to put health care reform \non hold.\n  Already, we have done more to advance the cause of health care reform \nin the last thirty days than we have in the last decade. When it was \ndays old, this Congress passed a law to provide and protect health \ninsurance for 11 million American children whose parents work full-\ntime. Our recovery plan will invest in electronic health records and \nnew technology that will reduce errors, bring down costs, ensure \nprivacy, and save lives. It will launch a new effort to conquer a \ndisease that has touched the life of nearly every American by seeking a \ncure for cancer in our time. And it makes the largest investment ever \nin preventive care, because that is one of the best ways to keep our \npeople healthy and our costs under control.\n  This budget builds on these reforms. It includes an historic \ncommitment to comprehensive health care reform--a down payment on the \nprinciple that we must have quality, affordable health care for every \nAmerican. It's a commitment that's paid for in part by efficiencies in \nour system that are long overdue. And it's a step we must take if we \nhope to bring down our deficit in the years to come.\n  Now, there will be many different opinions and ideas about how to \nachieve reform, and that is why I'm bringing together businesses and \nworkers, doctors and health care providers, Democrats and Republicans \nto begin work on this issue next week.\n  I suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process. It will be \nhard. But I also know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first \ncalled for reform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our \neconomy and the conscience of our Nation long enough. So let there be \nno doubt: health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will \nnot wait another year.\n  The third challenge we must address is the urgent need to expand the \npromise of education in America.\n  In a global economy where the most valuable skill you can sell is \nyour knowledge, a good education is no longer just a pathway to \nopportunity--it is a prerequisite.\n  Right now, three-quarters of the fastest-growing occupations require \nmore than a high school diploma. And yet, just over half of our \ncitizens have that level of education. We have one of the highest high \nschool dropout rates of any industrialized nation. And half of the \nstudents who begin college never finish.\n\n  This is a prescription for economic decline, because we know the \ncountries that out-teach us today will out-compete us tomorrow. That is \nwhy it will be the goal of this Administration to ensure that every \nchild has access to a complete and competitive education--from the day \nthey are born to the day they begin a career.\n  Already, we have made an historic investment in education through the \neconomic recovery plan. We have dramatically expanded early childhood \neducation and will continue to improve its quality, because we know \nthat the most formative learning comes in those first years of life. We \nhave made college affordable for nearly seven million more students. \nAnd we have provided the resources necessary to prevent painful cuts \nand teacher layoffs that would set back our children's progress.\n  But we know that our schools don't just need more resources. They \nneed more reform. That is why this budget creates new incentives for \nteacher performance; pathways for advancement, and rewards for success. \nWe'll invest in innovative programs that are already helping schools \nmeet high standards and close achievement gaps. And we will expand our \ncommitment to charter schools.\n  It is our responsibility as lawmakers and educators to make this \nsystem work. But it is the responsibility of every citizen to \nparticipate in it. And so tonight, I ask every American to commit to at \nleast 1 year or more of higher education or career training. This can \nbe community college or a four-year school; vocational training or an \napprenticeship. But whatever the training may be, every American will \nneed to get more than a high school diploma. And dropping out of high \nschool is no longer an option. It's not just quitting on yourself, it's \nquitting on your country--and this country needs and values the talents \nof every American. That is why we will provide the support necessary \nfor you to complete college and meet a new goal: by 2020, America will \nonce again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the \nworld.\n  I know that the price of tuition is higher than ever, which is why if \nyou are willing to volunteer in your neighborhood or give back to your \ncommunity or serve your country, we will make sure that you can afford \na higher education. And to encourage a renewed spirit of national \nservice for this and future generations, I ask this Congress to send me \nthe bipartisan legislation that bears the name of Senator Orrin Hatch \nas well as an American who has never stopped asking what he can do for \nhis country--Senator Edward Kennedy.\n  These education policies will open the doors of opportunity for our \nchildren. But it is up to us to ensure they walk through them. In the \nend, there is no program or policy that can substitute for a mother or \nfather who will\n\n[[Page S2422]]\n\nattend those parent/teacher conferences, or help with homework after \ndinner, or turn off the TV, put away the video games, and read to their \nchild. I speak to you not just as a President, but as a father when I \nsay that responsibility for our children's education must begin at \nhome.\n  There is, of course, another responsibility we have to our children. \nAnd that is the responsibility to ensure that we do not pass on to them \na debt they cannot pay. With the deficit we inherited, the cost of the \ncrisis we face, and the long-term challenges we must meet, it has never \nbeen more important to ensure that as our economy recovers, we do what \nit takes to bring this deficit down.\n  I'm proud that we passed the recovery plan free of earmarks, and I \nwant to pass a budget next year that ensures that each dollar we spend \nreflects only our most important national priorities.\n  Yesterday, I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit \nin half by the end of my first term in office. My Administration has \nalso begun to go line by line through the Federal budget in order to \neliminate wasteful and ineffective programs. As you can imagine, this \nis a process that will take some time. But we're starting with the \nbiggest lines. We have already identified two trillion dollars in \nsavings over the next decade.\n  In this budget, we will end education programs that don't work and \nend direct payments to large agribusinesses that don't need them. We'll \neliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq, and \nreform our defense budget so that we're not paying for Cold War-era \nweapons systems we don't use. We will root out the waste, fraud, and \nabuse in our Medicare program that doesn't make our seniors any \nhealthier, and we will restore a sense of fairness and balance to our \ntax code by finally ending the tax breaks for corporations that ship \nour jobs overseas.\n  In order to save our children from a future of debt, we will also end \nthe tax breaks for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. But let me be \nperfectly clear, because I know you'll hear the same old claims that \nrolling back these tax breaks means a massive tax increase on the \nAmerican people: if your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you \nwill not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: not one \nsingle dime. In fact, the recovery plan provides a tax cut--that's \nright, a tax cut--for 95 percent of working families. And these checks \nare on the way.\n  To preserve our long-term fiscal health, we must also address the \ngrowing costs in Medicare and Social Security. Comprehensive health \ncare reform is the best way to strengthen Medicare for years to come. \nAnd we must also begin a conversation on how to do the same for Social \nSecurity, while creating tax-free universal savings accounts for all \nAmericans.\n  Finally, because we're also suffering from a deficit of trust, I am \ncommitted to restoring a sense of honesty and accountability to our \nbudget. That is why this budget looks ahead 10 years and accounts for \nspending that was left out under the old rules--and for the first time, \nthat includes the full cost of fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan. For 7 \nyears, we have been a nation at war. No longer will we hide its price.\n  We are now carefully reviewing our policies in both wars, and I will \nsoon announce a way forward in Iraq that leaves Iraq to its people and \nresponsibly ends this war.\n  And with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and \ncomprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat al Qaeda \nand combat extremism. Because I will not allow terrorists to plot \nagainst the American people from safe havens half a world away.\n  As we meet here tonight, our men and women in uniform stand watch \nabroad and more are readying to deploy. To each and every one of them, \nand to the families who bear the quiet burden of their absence, \nAmericans are united in sending one message: we honor your service, we \nare inspired by your sacrifice, and you have our unyielding support. To \nrelieve the strain on our forces, my budget increases the number of our \nsoldiers and Marines. And to keep our sacred trust with those who \nserve, we will raise their pay, and give our veterans the expanded \nhealth care and benefits that they have earned.\n\n  To overcome extremism, we must also be vigilant in upholding the \nvalues our troops defend--because there is no force in the world more \npowerful than the example of America. That is why I have ordered the \nclosing of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, and will seek swift \nand certain justice for captured terrorists--because living our values \ndoesn't make us weaker, it makes us safer and it makes us stronger. And \nthat is why I can stand here tonight and say without exception or \nequivocation that the United States of America does not torture.\n   In words and deeds, we are showing the world that a new era of \nengagement has begun. For we know that America cannot meet the threats \nof this century alone, but the world cannot meet them without America. \nWe cannot shun the negotiating table, nor ignore the foes or forces \nthat could do us harm. We are instead called to move forward with the \nsense of confidence and candor that serious times demand.\n   To seek progress toward a secure and lasting peace between Israel \nand her neighbors, we have appointed an envoy to sustain our effort. To \nmeet the challenges of the 21st century--from terrorism to nuclear \nproliferation; from pandemic disease to cyber threats to crushing \npoverty--we will strengthen old alliances, forge new ones, and use all \nelements of our national power.\n  And to respond to an economic crisis that is global in scope, we are \nworking with the nations of the G-20 to restore confidence in our \nfinancial system, avoid the possibility of escalating protectionism, \nand spur demand for American goods in markets across the globe. For the \nworld depends on us to have a strong economy, just as our economy \ndepends on the strength of the world's.\n   As we stand at this crossroads of history, the eyes of all people in \nall nations are once again upon us--watching to see what we do with \nthis moment; waiting for us to lead.\n  Those of us gathered here tonight have been called to govern in \nextraordinary times. It is a tremendous burden, but also a great \nprivilege--one that has been entrusted to few generations of Americans. \nFor in our hands lies the ability to shape our world for good or for \nill.\n   I know that it is easy to lose sight of this truth--to become \ncynical and doubtful; consumed with the petty and the trivial. co But \nin my life, I have also learned that hope is found in unlikely places; \nthat inspiration often comes not from those with the most power or \ncelebrity, but from the dreams and aspirations of Americans who are \nanything but ordinary.\n   I think about Leonard Abess, the bank president from Miami who \nreportedly cashed out of his company, took a $60 million bonus, and \ngave it out to all 399 people who worked for him, plus another 72 who \nused to work for him. He didn't tell anyone, but when the local \nnewspaper found out, he simply said, ``I knew some of these people \nsince I was 7 years old. I didn't feel right getting the money \nmyself.''\n  I think about Greensburg, Kansas, a town that was completely \ndestroyed by a tornado, but is being rebuilt by its residents as a \nglobal example of how clean energy can power an entire community--how \nit can bring jobs and businesses to a place where piles of bricks and \nrubble once lay. ``The tragedy  was terrible,'' said one of the men who \nhelped them rebuild. ``But the folks here know that it also provided an \nincredible opportunity.''\n\n  And I think about Ty'Sheoma Bethea, the young girl from that school I \nvisited in Dillon, South Carolina--a place where the ceilings leak, the \npaint peels off the walls, and they have to stop teaching six times a \nday because the train barrels by their classroom. She has been told \nthat her school is hopeless, but the other day after class she went to \nthe public library and typed up a letter to the people sitting in this \nroom. She even asked her principal for the money to buy a stamp. The \nletter asks us for help, and says, ``We are just students trying to \nbecome lawyers, doctors, congressmen like yourself and one day \npresident, so we can make a change to not just the state of South \nCarolina but also the world. We are not quitters.''\n  We are not quitters.\n  These words and these stories tell us something about the spirit of \nthe people who sent us here. They tell us that even in the most trying \ntimes, amid the most difficult circumstances, there\n\n[[Page S2423]]\n\nis a generosity, a resilience, a decency, and a determination that \nperseveres; a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for \nposterity.\n  Their resolve must be our inspiration. Their concerns must be our \ncause. And we must show them and all our people that we are equal to \nthe task before us.\n  I know that we haven't agreed on every issue thus far, and there are \nsurely times in the future when we will part ways. But I also know that \nevery American who is sitting here tonight loves this country and wants \nit to succeed. That must be the starting point for every debate we have \nin the coming months, and where we return after those debates are done. \nThat is the foundation on which the American people expect us to build \ncommon ground.\n  And if we do--if we come together and lift this Nation from the \ndepths of this crisis; if we put our people back to work and restart \nthe engine of our prosperity; if we confront without fear the \nchallenges of our time and summon that enduring spirit of an America \nthat does not quit, then someday years from now our children can tell \ntheir children that this was the time when we performed, in the words \nthat are carved into this very chamber, ``something worthy to be \nremembered.'' Thank you, God Bless you, and may God Bless the United \nStates of America.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, February 24, 2009.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/24/senate-section/article/S2423-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:31 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 44.

A bill to amend the False Claims Act; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am here as part of what I am calling \n``Accountability in Government Week.'' I plan to introduce various \nbills this week that will strengthen oversight of Government programs, \nintegrity of taxpayer-funded initiatives, and bring sunshine to the \nexecutive, legislative, and judicial branches of our Government. These \nbills are important and will help all Americans better understand their \nGovernment in addition to making sure taxpayers' dollars are not lost \nto fraud, waste, and abuse.\n  The first bill I am introducing this week, and am introducing today, \nis the False Claims Clarification Act of 2009. I am glad to be joined \nby my original cosponsor, Mr. Durbin, the majority whip, the Senator \nfrom Illinois, who has worked closely with me in crafting this \nlegislation that will update the 1986 amendments to the False Claims \nAct I authored.\n  This legislation is similar to a version that was introduced in the \nlast Congress that cleared the Judiciary Committee by unanimous voice \nvote. We have made some updates to the bill that was the result of \nsitting down with various interested parties and hearing their \nconcerns. We made a commitment last Congress to move that bill through \nregular order to ensure that all interested stakeholders had a say. I \nbelieve this version of the bill not only clarifies the original intent \nof the 1986 amendments but also makes a number of modifications that \nstrengthen the False Claims Act and will help the Government recover \ntaxpayers' dollars lost to fraud and abuse for years to come.\n  Senator Durbin and I are also joined by other original cosponsors, \nincluding Senator Leahy, whom you recognize is the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, and Senator Specter, its ranking member, and \nSenator Whitehouse, a member of the committee. It is a bipartisan bill \nthat is about protecting taxpayers' dollars and strengthening the \nGovernment's hand in combating fraud.\n  A little history: Back in 1986, the Government was in a situation \nthat had some parallel to today's economic situation. Government \nmilitary expenditures were a significant portion of the budget, and \nthere was ample evidence of fraud and abuse in Government contracts. \nToday, we are facing an economic situation where the Government is now \non the hook for trillions of dollars in new Government spending in an \nattempt to jump-start our ailing economy. That is compounded by the \nfact that the Treasury Department has taken unprecedented steps to bail \nout financial institutions with hundreds of billions of taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  I am concerned this new Government spending has occurred too quickly \nand could be ripe with opportunities for fraud and abuse. I would say \nthere are 99 other Senators who can say the same thing. But that is the \nreason this legislation is timely and urgently needed.\n  The False Claims Act, which is also known as Lincoln's Law, was \noriginally passed by Congress in 1865 to combat war profiteering by \nGovernment contractors during the Civil War. The False Claims Act \nallowed individual citizen whistleblowers to go to court to collect \nGovernment money that was lost to unscrupulous contractors that were \nselling false or fraudulent goods to Union troops. This legal \nmechanism, known as qui tam--Q-U-I T-A-M, for you Latin lovers--is the \nkey component to the False Claims Act, allowing individual citizens to \nact as private\n\n[[Page S2425]]\n\n``attorneys general'' to help unearth fraud and recover lost money.\n  However, following World War II, the False Claims Act was weakened by \nan act of Congress which lowered the penalties, limiting the money the \nGovernment could recover from this fraud. This remained the case from \nthe end of World War II until 1986 with the False Claims Act. That is \nwhen I authored amendments to that act which restored the teeth and \nbreathed new life into a law that was designed to do nothing but to \nprotect all American taxpayers.\n\n  Now, since 1986 the Federal Government has recovered $22 billion from \nthose who defraud the Government. By working with qui tam \nwhistleblowers, the Justice Department has turned Lincoln's law into \nthe single most effective tool in the Federal Government's tool box to \nhelp protect taxpayers' dollars. However, it has been a hard fought \nbattle to get the False Claims Act to where it is today as deep-pocket \nGovernment contractors have spent hundreds of millions of dollars to \nlitigate the False Claims Act. As a result, various court \ninterpretations have limited the applicability and the reach of the \nFalse Claims Act, cutting off many worthy cases from ever going \nforward. Some of these cases have been around for quite a while, others \nmore recent. Yet the one thing these cases have in common is they \nthreaten to undermine both the spirit and the intent of the 1986 \namendments to Lincoln's law called the False Claims Act.\n  The first case that created problems for the False Claims Act was the \nTotten case where the DC Circuit Court of Appeals held that false \nclaims must be presented directly to the Government--in this case, \nemployees at Amtrak, which is a Government grantee--and were not \nactually presented to the Federal Government. As a result, the \nGovernment was precluded from recovering money lost to fraud and abuse \nperpetrated against Amtrak.\n  More recently, the Supreme Court held in Allison Engine Co. v. U.S. \nthat for liability to attach a defendant must not only make a false \nstatement but must intend to get the claim paid and approved directly \nby the Government based upon that false statement. While this sounds \nstraightforward, it creates a huge loophole in the False Claims Act \nbecause subcontractors who receive Federal money never actually submit \na claim directly to the Government because they do it through the \ncontractors. Instead, they pass the claim to the prime contractor who \nthen gives it to the Government. So under the Allison Engine decision, \nit could be virtually impossible to prove a False Claims Act case where \nthe subcontractor knowingly ripped off the taxpayers. In fact, a judge \nin my home State of Iowa dismissed a case based solely upon the Allison \nEngine decision, even without a motion from the defendant. This has \ncreated a significant problem for recovering taxpayers' dollars that \ntrickle down to subcontractors, particularly in Medicare and Medicaid \nPrograms where subcontractors are frequently utilized.\n  Further, this could become a bigger problem if the second tranche of \nTARP money--some people might refer to that as the bailout money--is \nused to purchase distressed assets through a third party broker as \noriginally envisioned.\n  Another case that is detrimental to the False Claims Act is Rockwell \nInternational Corporation v. U.S. In that case, the Supreme Court \ninterpreted an area of the False Claims Act known as the ``public \ndisclosure bar,'' which prohibits a false claims case from moving \nforward if the case was based upon publicly disclosed information such \nas a Government report, unless the whistleblower filing the case was \nthe ``original source'' of the information. Here, the Supreme Court \nheld that a qui tam whistleblower was barred from receiving a share of \nany money recovered unless they were the original source of all claims \nultimately settled.\n  This may not sound like a troublesome decision. However, the impact \nis that oftentimes a case is brought by a whistleblower on a certain \nset of facts and then expanded by the Department of Justice that \nultimately settles on other grounds. As a result, this case creates a \ndisincentive for a whistleblower to bring forth information about fraud \nas they may not get to share in any part of that recovery. That is the \nincentive under false claims: a whistleblower, not a lawyer, not in the \nJustice Department, to get a percentage of what is recovered as an \nincentive to get this information out there and get it prosecuted, \nparticularly if the Justice Department is overloaded or maybe doesn't \nwant to take the case.\n  Now, one last case I will mention is the Custer Battles case decided \nin 2006. In this case, a jury found that a defense contractor in Iraq \nhad defrauded the Government of $10 million. However, the judge \noverturned the jury's verdict, finding that the money lost was not U.S. \ntaxpayer money but was instead Iraqi money under the control of the \nU.S. Government. As a result of this case, the U.S. Government may not \nrecover for any fraud committed against the U.S. Government if the \nfunds are not American funds, even if the U.S. Government has been \nentrusted with the management of those funds, just as if money is \nsomehow not fungible. These decisions, which are by no means an \nexhaustive list, are contrary to the spirit and the intent of the 1986 \namendments. And who should know that? I should know it because I \nauthored this legislation.\n  This bill we are introducing today--a bipartisan bill by Senator \nDurbin and myself--seeks to clarify the False Claims Act so these \njudicial interpretations that have limited the False Claims Act are \noverruled. It is narrowly tailored--I wish to emphasize ``narrowly \ntailored''--to ensure that the intent of Congress in the 1986 \namendments is upheld, if nothing else.\n  The False Claims Clarification Act would correct these negative \ninterpretations in addition to making technical and clarifying \namendments. First, the bill would address the Totten decision by \nremoving the requirement that false claims be directly presented to the \nGovernment officials instead of tying the liability directly to \nGovernment money and property. It would also correct the Allison Engine \ndecision, ensuring that subcontractors who rip off the taxpayers will \nbe held accountable.\n  The bill would also address the Rockwell decision by requiring the \nAttorney General to file a timely motion to dismiss claims that violate \nthe public disclosure bar. By allowing the Attorney General to present \nto the court information about public disclosures up front in a case, \nthe bill would eliminate procedural uncertainties that exist now by \nallowing public disclosures to be addressed at any time during the \nproceeding.\n  The bill also clarifies that nontaxpayer funds under the control of \nthe U.S. Government subject to fraud are actionable under the False \nClaims Act. Thus, monies directly under the control of the U.S. \nGovernment subject to fraud that are currently outside the scope of the \nFalse Claims Act would now be covered. This would correct the problems \nthat have arisen following the decision of Custer Battles.\n  Additionally, the bill clarifies a split between the Federal Circuit \nCourts of Appeal that currently exists regarding whether a Government \nemployee may file a False Claims Act case. It takes a dissenting \nopinion from the Tenth Circuit and codifies that by allowing Government \nemployees to bring a False Claims Act case based upon information \nlearned in the course of their employment only when the employee: One, \ndiscloses the fraud to a supervisor; two, discloses the fraud to the \nInspector General of the agency; three, discloses the fraud to the \nAttorney General and then waits 18 months without Government action.\n  Further, it restricts a Government employee from bringing a False \nClaims Act case if they derive information for their case in an \nindictment or information, any ongoing criminal, civil, or \nadministrative investigation, or if they are an auditor, investigator, \nor attorney who has a duty--a duty--to investigate fraud. This ensures \nthat a Government employee can act as a relator, but only if he or she \nis truly bringing a claim that the Government has refused to \ninvestigate.\n  The bill makes some additional technical corrections that I am not \ngoing to go into. Finally, the bill includes a new section that will \nrequire the Attorney General to report to Congress on an annual basis \nregarding the use of the False Claims Act and any settlements made upon \nthese sorts of lawsuits. This has two purposes. It allows\n\n[[Page S2426]]\n\nCongress, first, to see if the Justice Department is utilizing the act \nconsistent with the spirit and intent; and, secondly, ensures that the \nseal provisions allowing the case to be privately sealed with the court \nare not being abused to the detriment of qui tam relators.\n  So the False Claims Act clarification bill is narrowly tailored to \nensure that the legislative intent of 1986 is truly understood. It will \nbring a level of reason and sanity instead of the current hodgepodge of \nlaws across various circuit courts of appeals. This bill is designed to \nprotect the American taxpayer from fraud and is timely, given the \nrecent actions to shore up the balance sheets of banks and private \nbusinesses across the country.\n  I am glad we have a bipartisan coalition ready to pick up where we \nleft off in the last Congress.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nGrassley in introducing the False Claims Act Clarification Act of 2009. \nThis bipartisan legislation takes important steps to modernize and \nstrengthen the federal False Claims Acts, FCA, and will help protect \nthe government and taxpayers from waste, fraud and abuse related to \ngovernment funds. Last Congress Senator Grassley and I introduced \nsimilar legislation, which was passed by voice vote out of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee. I look forward to working with Senator Grassley as \nwell as our fellow cosponsors, Senator Leahy, the Chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee; Senator Specter, the Ranking Member of the \nJudiciary Committee; and Senator Whitehouse, to see this important \nlegislation passed into law.\n  Since it was signed into law by President Lincoln in 1863, the FCA, \nor ``Lincoln's Law,'' has played a key role in enabling the federal \ngovernment and qui tam whistleblowers to prevent unscrupulous \ngovernment contractors from defrauding the nation's taxpayers. In 1986, \nSenator Grassley and Congressman Berman sponsored amendments to the FCA \nand its qui tam provisions that revitalized the effectiveness of the \nFCA as a fraud-fighting tool. Since 1986, the federal government and \nqui tam relators have worked together to recover over $21 billion in \nmonies that would otherwise have been lost to fraud, waste or abuse in \ngovernment programs. The recovery of this enormous sum is a victory for \ntaxpayers, and a demonstration of the success of the FCA and its qui \ntam model.\n  Senator Grassley and I first introduced FCA reform legislation in \nSeptember 2007 because several recent court interpretations of the 1986 \nFCA amendments had threatened to limit the Act's effectiveness. Our \nlegislation was designed to correct erroneous interpretations of the \nFCA's presentment clause in the 2004 D.C. Circuit case U.S. ex rel. \nTotten v. Bombardier Corp., and the FCA's public disclosure bar in the \n2007 Supreme Court case Rockwell International Corp. v. U.S. Our bill \nalso sought to make further clarifications to the FCA's scope and \napplication in keeping with the intent of the authors of the 1986 FCA \namendments.\n  In the time since we first introduced this bill last Congress, the \nneed to strengthen Lincoln's Law has become even more urgent. The \neconomic recession has required massive expansion of federal assistance \nto various industries, and this has created an increased opportunity \nfor waste, fraud and abuse by recipients of that assistance. As the \nfederal government moves ahead with various economic recovery measures, \nit is important that we have effective anti-fraud provisions in place \nto deter and catch those who would abuse public monies and the public \ntrust. We owe this to the American taxpayer.\n  Also, the False Claims Act Clarification Act of 2009 is further \nneeded in light of the Supreme Court's June 2008 decision in Allison \nEngine Co. v. U.S.\n\n[[Page S2429]]\n\nex rel. Sanders. In Allison Engine, the Supreme Court read the 1986 FCA \namendments to include a barrier to liability in subcontractor fraud \ncases that Congress did not intend. The Allison Engine Court held that \nin cases involving false claims submitted by a subcontractor to a prime \ncontractor for payment involving federal funds, the plaintiff must \nprove that the subcontractor intended for the false statement to be \nused by the prime contractor to get the government to pay its claim. \nOur legislation makes clear that subcontractors are liable for \nknowingly perpetrating fraud involving government funds, regardless of \nwhether that fraud was perpetrated directly upon the government or \nindirectly through another contractor. In light of the numerous levels \nof subcontractors used in many government contracting arrangements, \nthis statutory fix is necessary to ensure accountability no matter \nwhere in the contracting chain the fraud takes place.\n  The changes that our legislation would make to the FCA are narrowly \ntailored, but will have a significant impact in catching and deterring \nfraud. I commend Senator Grassley, the Senate architect of the 1986 FCA \namendments, for his devotion to ensuring the effective functioning of \nthe FCA, and I will continue to work with him to better combat waste, \nfraud and abuse in government programs.\n  In sum, the False Claims Act Clarification Act will enhance \nwhistleblowers' ability to shine a light on fraudulent conduct \ninvolving government funds, and to hold the perpetrators accountable \nthrough legitimate qui tam claims. The legislation we are introducing \ntoday will strengthen the legacy of Lincoln's Law, and I am pleased to \nserve as its lead Democratic cosponsor. I urge my colleagues to support \nits passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KERRY:\n  S. 463. A bill to impose limitations on certain expenditures by \nparticipants in the Troubled Asset Relief Program; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today I am introducing the TARP Taxpayer \nProtection and Corporate Responsibility Act of 2009. Recently, it was \nreported that the Northern Trust Corporation threw lavish events in \nconjunction with the Northern Trust Open. Last year, Northern Trust \nCompany received approximately $1.6 billion in funds from the Troubled \nRelief Asset Program and laid off almost 450 employees.\n  At a time when banks are not lending and need federal assistance, \nthey should not be treating themselves to lavish parties with \nperformances by Sheryl Crow. I supported the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act of 2008 because I believe that we need to help our \nfinancial institutions in order to stabilize our economy. However, I \nfirmly believe that every institution receiving funds has a \nresponsibility to appropriately use the federal assistance provided by \ntaxpayers.\n  I am sick of hearing about financial institutions that are receiving \nfunds and behaving inappropriately. CEOs need to exert leadership \nduring these trying economic times. If they don't, they should repay \ntaxpayers out of their own pocket. Now is not the time to be throwing \nlavish parties, giving out excessive bonuses, and spending on \nunnecessary renovations. It is time to focus on how best to restore the \neconomy and for the banks, this means responsible lending.\n  Northern Trust is not the first TARP recipient company to spend \nfoolishly, but I want it to be the last. For this reason I am \nintroducing the TARP Taxpayer Protection and Corporate Responsibility \nAct of 2009 which would prohibit TARP recipients from sponsoring, \nhosting, or paying for entertainment or holiday events during the year \nin which they receive assistance or the following year. The legislation \nwould give the Secretary of the Treasury the authority to issue waivers \nand would become effective as of March 1, 2009.\n  I applaud the action the Obama Administration has taken to address \nexecutive compensation and the provisions included in the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, but I believe we must do more. \nThe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act requires the Treasury \nDepartment to publish guidelines on the use of funds. However, I \nbelieve we need to do more than providing guidelines for the use of \nthese funds. As we all know, money is fungible and a TARP recipient can \nalways explain that TARP funds were not used for questionable purposes.\n  During these difficult economic times, we need to send a message to \nthe American people that we are responsible stewards of public funds. \nWe must try to help companies, but only if they operate in an \nappropriate and responsible manner which values the assistance of the \nAmerican taxpayer. At a time when banks are not providing enough \nlending to small businesses and others, they should not be throwing \nlavish parties at taxpayer expense, and the claim that these \n``parties'' came out of ``operating expenses'' rather than taxpayer \nfunds does not pass the laugh test.\n  I urge my colleagues to review this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself, Mr. Cochran, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Mikulski, \n        Mr. Casey, Mrs. Lincoln, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr. \n        Nelson, of Florida):\n  S. 464. A bill to amend the National and Community Service Act of \n1990 to improve the educational awards provided for national service, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce four bills today: The \nAmeriCorps: Together Improving Our Nation (ACTION) Act, the Semester of \nService Act, the Summer of Service Act, and the Encore Service Act--\nlegislation that would offer Americans the opportunity to serve their \ncommunities and work to improve their Nation.\n  As we have discussed time and time again, the challenges facing \nAmerica are mounting--from a struggling economy, to a broken health \ncare system, to challenges in our schools that put our children's \nfutures at risk.\n  These are problems that countless Americans have lived and struggled \nwith--that we here in this institution have debated for years, decade \neven. We can disagree amongst ourselves about how to solve them--and we \ncertainly have.\n  But what we can all agree on is the impact citizens can make when it \ncomes to facing some of our biggest challenges.\n  We know the extraordinary things ordinary citizens can accomplish for \nour communities when given the opportunity--the difference they can \nmake in our schools and nursing homes, in veterans' hospitals and in \nhelping those living on fixed incomes. With these four important pieces \nof legislation, we are offering citizens of all ages even more \nopportunities to be involved.\n  We already harness the enormous power of a dedicated group of \nindividuals looking for ways to serve their communities is through the \nremarkably successful AmeriCorps program. Last year alone, 75,000 \nAmeriCorps members gave back to our communities, serving in over 4,000 \nschools, faith-based and community organizations, and nonprofits across \nthe country. They also brought reinforcements--recruiting another 1.7 \nmillion community volunteers to work alongside them. Because of \nAmeriCorps, our communities have been strengthened, and our democracy \nfortified.\n  Unfortunately, as the hours AmeriCorps Members have contributed to \nour communities have increased, the Segal AmeriCorps Education Award \ncreated to help members pay for their college tuition has remained flat \nat $4,725. Meanwhile, the average college tuition has skyrocketed. The \neducation award previously paid for two years of college, but currently \nit does not even cover the cost of single year. I am introducing the \nAmeriCorps: Together Improving Our Nation, ACTION, Act, in part, to \nupdate the education award to keep pace with 15 years of tuition \nincreases.\n  The ACTION Act will raise the education award to $6,585 and increase \nthe award annually to match the average tuition at a 4-year public \nuniversity. That figure, $6,585 is the average cost of tuition at a \nfour-year public university according to the College Board. The Act \nwill also make the education award tax exempt to ensure that alumni are \nable to use their entire award to advance their education.\n\n[[Page S2430]]\n\n  The Summer of Service bill would reach the youngest Americans \ninterested in giving back to their communities, fostering a commitment \nto service that will last a lifetime. The Summer of Service Act would \ncreate a competitive grant program that would enable states and \nlocalities to offer middle school students an opportunity to \nparticipate in a structured community service program over the summer \nmonths. It would employ service-learning to teach civic participation \nskills, help young people see themselves as resources to their \ncommunities, expand educational opportunities and discourage ``summer \nacademic slide.'' Providing tangible benefits to their communities, \nSummer of Service projects would direct grantees to work on unmet \nhuman, educational, environmental and public safety needs and encourage \nall youth, regardless of age, income, or disability, to engage in \ncommunity service. The program would also grant participants with an \neducational award of up to $500 which can later be used to pay for \ncollege.\n  The Semester of Service Act also engages students in service-learning \nat the high school level. We talk so much about ways to improve \nacademic performance in our schools. Well, when service is integrated \ninto our students' curricula at school, young people make gains on \nachievement tests. Service-learning results in grade point averages \ngoing up, and feelings about high-school are that more positive.\n  And the benefits of service-learning go well beyond the classroom. \nWhen young people participate in service activities they feel better \nable to control their own lives in a positive way. They are less prone \nto engage in risky behavior, more likely to engage in their own \neducation, and far more aware of the career opportunities before them.\n  Indeed, research shows that for every dollar we spend on a service-\nlearning project, $4 worth of service is provided to the community \ninvolved. That means by authorizing $200 million for fiscal year 2009, \nas the Semester of Service Act does, our country will save more than \nhalf a billion dollars in service performed.\n  This legislation works by creating a competitive grant program that \ngives school districts, or nonprofits working in partnership with local \nschool districts, the opportunity to have students participate in a \nsemester of service in their junior or senior year for academic credit. \nThese students are required to perform a minimum of 70 hours of service \nlearning activities over 12 weeks, with at least 24 of those hours \nspent participating in field-based activities--outside of the \nclassroom.\n  By engaging both the public and private sector, Semester of Service \nteaches civic participation skills and helps young people see \nthemselves not merely as residents in their communities--but resources \nto them.\n  Perhaps, the greatest untapped resource in our communities are older \nAmericans. No one is more ready or more poised to make a difference--in \nour communities and throughout our country--than the gaining Baby \nBoomer generation.\n  In the next decade alone, the number of Americans 55 years and older \nis expected to grow another 22 percent. But for all the well-publicized \nchallenges that growth presents, it is time we also recognize something \nelse:\n  The opportunities it offers--if we seize them.\n  More than half of those considered a part of the Baby Boomer \ngeneration are interested in providing meaningful service to their \ncommunities. Countless older men and women who have given so much to \ntheir country throughout their lives want to serve as they enter their \nlater years.\n  They are living longer, healthier lives than any generation in \nhistory. And they recognize something elemental:\n  Life doesn't end at retirement. For many, it is only beginning--\nleading perhaps to a second career in the public or nonprofit sector.\n  We have so much to learn. Indeed, there can be no greater gift passed \non to future generations than the lessons of the past. But the truth \nis, we too often fail to draw upon the experience, knowledge and ideas \nof previous generations.\n  What is missing is the opportunity.\n  Giving older Americans those opportunities is what the Encore Service \nAct is all about. It creates an Encore Service Program that provides \nAmericans 55 years and older with opportunities to serve communities \nwith the greatest need--to volunteer in our nation's schools, to help \nkeep our neighborhoods clean, safe and vibrant, and so much more. In \nreturn for their service, which may include extensive training and a \nsignificant commitment of time, they can receive a stipend and \neducation award, much like AmeriCorps does for younger generations.\n  Best of all, that stipend can be transferred to children or \ngrandchildren. Imagine what that means for a grandmother or a \ngrandfather who could literally put thousands of dollars into their \nnewborn grandchild's college savings fund as a result of this program--\nfunds that can only be used after the child turns 18 and can be kept \nfor up to 20 years. Of all the new ideas in this legislation, perhaps \nthis one is the most exciting.\n  This legislation also creates an Encore Fellows program that places \nolder Americans in one-year management or leadership positions in \npublic or private not-for-profits. These year-long fellowships not only \nincrease the capacity of public service organizations already doing \ntremendous work in our communities, they also promote those who have \nalready had full, successful careers, perhaps in the private sector, to \nlend their expertise and experience to the cause of community or public \nservice.\n  The Encore Service Act also creates a Silver Scholars program that \nawards older Americans with an education scholarship of up to $1,000 in \nexchange for volunteering with public agencies or private nonprofits \nbetween 250 and 500 hours a year. As with the Encore Service Program, \nthey can use these awards for themselves or transfer them to children, \ngrandchildren or other qualified designees.\n  Lastly, this legislation expands the capacity and builds on the \nsuccess of current Senior Programs by raising the authorization funding \nlevels for the Foster Grandparent, Senior Corps and RSVP programs. We \nall know that seniors and these programs have already made a remarkable \ndifference in our communities. That is why our legislation raises \nprogram eligibility levels from 125 to 200 percent above poverty and \nensures that all programs will be open to any individual 55 years and \nolder.\n  Contrary to what some suggest, I believe the American people are \nstarved for opportunities to serve--and stand at the ready not just in \ntimes of crisis, but every day.\n  Americans are simply waiting to be asked to serve something greater \nthan themselves, as they originally were by President John F. Kennedy. \nIn introducing this legislation today, we once again remind all \nAmericans of that call to serve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/24/senate-section/article/S2430-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2430-S2431]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 53--AUTHORIZING A PLAQUE COMMEMORATING THE ROLE OF \n     ENSLAVED AFRICAN AMERICANS IN THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE CAPITOL\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. \nBennett) submitted the following resolution; which was referred to the \nCommittee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                               S.
