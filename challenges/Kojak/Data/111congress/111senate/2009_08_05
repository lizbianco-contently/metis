Debate will be controlled at \nalternating times, with the majority controlling the first hour, \nstarting at 11 o'clock, and the time between 2 and 3 p.m. will be \nequally divided and controlled, with the majority controlling the first \n30 minutes and the Republicans controlling the final 30 minutes.\n  Because of the special caucus the Democrats are having, we will be in \nrecess from 3 until 5 p.m. When the Senate reconvenes, the Senate will \nresume the 1-hour alternating blocks of time, with the Republicans \ncontrolling the first hour.\n  In addition to the Supreme Court nomination that we need to deal \nwith, there are two major items we need to complete before we leave for \nthe August recess. First, we have to have some way of moving forward on \nthe travel promotion and on the cash for clunkers. If we don't work \nsomething out on cash for clunkers, I will file a cloture motion this \nevening, which means we will have to have a cloture vote on Friday. If \npeople want to use the 30 hours, it goes over until Saturday. I don't \nthink that is the case. I have had a number of very good conversations \nwith the Republican leader, and we all acknowledge that a significant \nmajority want to move forward with this legislation that has resulted \nin the sales, in a period of days, of almost 300,000 vehicles. For us, \nthe taxpayers, it creates jobs, helps our manufacturing base and helps \nthe taxpayers, in effect, who loaned money to these two manufacturers. \nThis will help them repay that money. It has been stimulative, and we \nrecognize that.\n  That having been said, some people still don't like the program. So \nwe have to figure a way to move through that. It is my understanding \nthat the Democrats have one amendment. I have explained it to the \nRepublicans. The Republicans have a long list of\n\n[[Page S8786]]\n\namendments. They are going to have to whittle that down to a reasonable \nnumber so we can deal with them soon. I hope we can work something out \nso that we can meet our responsibilities.\n  We also have a number of nominations that have been held up as a \nresult of the Supreme Court nomination. We hope all of that can be \ntaken care of as soon as she is confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8786-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8786]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  MEASURE PLACED ON CALENDAR--S. 1572\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I want to call to the attention \nof the Senate, and thank the Pentagon for its dogged pursuit in finding \nthe evidence of CPT Scott Speicher, U.S. Navy, the pilot of the F-18 \nHornet who was shot down on the first night of the gulf war back in \n1991.\n  This saga has evolved over the last 18 years. The Pentagon became lax \nin the 1990s and did not pursue the finding of evidence, and there were \nall kinds of reports that Captain Speicher may have been alive and held \nin a prison. You can imagine the trauma, the emotional ups and downs, \nthat occurred to the family, which included the children who were quite \nyoung at the time and are now at the age that they are in college. \nFortunately, the Pentagon, about 8 or 9 years ago, got serious about \nthe search. When we invaded Iraq in 2003, they even created a search \nteam. Again, there were all of these false leads that there had been \nthe sighting of a pilot. An Iraqi refugee said he saw an American pilot \nin a prison. It went on and on.\n  Of course, the hopes of the family were that CPT Scott Speicher was \ngoing to be found alive.\n  Our Pentagon even went so far--and I commend them--that one of the \nfirst sets of questions on the debriefing of any Iraqi detainee--and \nespecially the high-value detainees--the question would be asked, ``Do \nyou know about an American pilot?'' All of these leads turned out to be \nfalse or they led to nothing. So it was that we expected that what \nwould happen to find the final evidence would be a Bedouin tribe that \nwould have been in the area of the Iraqi desert at the time Captain \nSpeicher punched out, or ejected, from his jet that was hit.\n\n  The irony was that Scott was not even supposed to fly that first \nattack wave, but another member of the squadron got sick and he filled \nin. Either he was hit with a ground-to-air missile or somehow in the \naerial combat of the darkness of that night, and he ejected from his \nairplane. The rest has been a mystery until a Bedouin, thought to have \nbeen a younger child at the time, in 1991, remembered a pilot being \nburied. He could not identify the location, but knew of another Bedouin \nwho was an adult at the time, and that Bedouin ultimately led the \nmarines to the site and an extensive investigation and excavation that \noccurred on the Iraqi desert floor.\n  So all who have participated--the Army Reserve, Major Eames, who led \nthe Scott Speicher search party, and who extended his duty voluntarily \nfor an additional 6 weeks way back in 2003, because he was absolutely \nintent that he was going to find this downed pilot. For all of those, \nincluding the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the CNO, who have now \nbrought this to closure, because last weekend they found the remains of \nCaptain Speicher, with a positive identification through one of his \njawbones with his military dental records, to be confirmed even further \nby DNA evidence. We know now that Captain Speicher can be brought home \nand his family can have final closure.\n  I will conclude by saying that a mistake was made that we never want \nto repeat. Because of him being mistakenly declared dead at a press \nconference the next morning after that first night attack in the first \ngulf war--he was mistakenly declared dead by the Secretary of Defense--\nwe did not send a search and rescue mission. Every military pilot has \nto have the security of knowing that if he has to eject, a search and \nrescue mission is coming after him. That is the mistake we will not \nmake again.\n  For the family, and on behalf of them, I want to say to the Pentagon \nand to the other Senators who have participated in this 18-year quest \non behalf of Scott's family in Florida, thank you from the bottom of \ntheir hearts.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, if you look at the root cause of our \neconomic crisis today, most people would agree that it started in the \nhousing industry. People across America signed up for these new \nmortgages--adjustable rate mortgages--with terms that some people had \nnever seen before. Sometimes they were terms that turned out to be \nunrealistic for the person's income and the value of the property; and \nat the end of a reset period, what was an affordable mortgage became \nunaffordable. People were then faced with the grim reality that they \ncould not stay in their homes.\n  Some of the folks who entered into these mortgages signed up for bad \nmortgages. Others were misled into them. Some signed up for a mortgage \nand lost their jobs. The net result of it, though, was that we saw \nforeclosures across America in record numbers.\n  About 2 years ago, I started a legislative effort to change the \nBankruptcy Code. The Bankruptcy Code is a set of laws for those who \ndeclare bankruptcy, and those who go into it try to restructure their \ndebts and emerge from bankruptcy in a solid financial position.\n  When they go to court, virtually any secured asset, that is, a debt \nwhich has a security of the thing that is borrowed against, can be \nrestructured by the court. If it is a vacation home, a mortgage on a \nvacation home, a mortgage on a ranch or a farm, a secured debt on a \nboat, a car--things such as these can be restructured by the court to \ntry to come down to terms that are affordable based on the reality of \nthe income of the person filing bankruptcy. There is one exception to \nthis: the court cannot restructure the mortgage on a primary residence. \nOf all of the things we own, maybe the most important thing is our \nhome, and the law specifically precludes the bankruptcy court from \nrestructuring the mortgage. So, facing bankruptcy, you go in with your \nmortgage in foreclosure, and the court says: There is nothing we can \ndo. We might be able to do something about your vacation home, your \nfarm, or your ranch, but nothing about your home. So people end up \nhaving their homes foreclosed upon.\n  It struck me that we needed to change this because there was a time \nwhen people would borrow money for their home, take out a mortgage from \na bank down the street, from a banker they knew, and they would make \ntheir payments to that bank. That world changed when banks started \nselling the paper off to other banks and institutions, and then it went \nwild. It went\n\n[[Page S8787]]\n\nbeyond another bank or institution into groups of investors who bought \na piece of a share of your mortgage. Someone may have bought an \ninterest in the interest payments you were going to make in the fifth \nyear of your mortgage. So what started off as a bank down the street \nthat you knew personally at a closing turned out to be a group of \nfinancial institutions you didn't even know and never heard of and may \nnever, ever learn the identity of. So when time came for foreclosure, \nyou had to herd in all of these financial cats and try to get everyone \nto agree with what would happen next, and it became impossible.\n  Well, my idea 2 years ago was to change the Bankruptcy Code to allow \nthe bankruptcy court to restructure and rewrite the mortgage terms so \nthat a person could stay in their home just as they could continue to \nown a vacation home. It seemed to me a modest suggestion but one of \nvalue because it gave the court a voice in saying to all of these \ndifferent lenders that had a piece of your mortgage: You all better \ncome together and gather around the table because we are going to make \na decision in this court, and you just can't ignore it.\n  I introduced this almost 2 years ago. It had staunch opposition from \nthe banking industry. They did not want to give that power to the \nbankruptcy court, and they said: You anticipate only 2 million \nforeclosures in America, so we don't see the need for a change in the \nBankruptcy Code.\n  Really? A recent study by the Boston Federal Reserve found that, in \n2007 and 2008, just 3 percent of homeowners at risk of foreclosure \nreceived modifications that reduced their monthly payments. Just 3 \npercent of troubled homeowners received any real help.\n  Another study found that more mortgage modifications increased the \nmortgage balance than decreased the balance.\n  I called the bill on the floor, and I lost. Well, today, we are \nfacing over 9 million foreclosures in bankruptcy. The banking industry \nis still vehemently opposed to any type of change in the bankruptcy \nlaw, and when it comes to foreclosures in America, the situation is \ngoing from bad to worse.\n  This morning's New York Times business section has a headline: ``U.S. \nEffort Aids Only 9 Percent of Eligible Homeowners.'' The article is \nabout the voluntary efforts of mortgagors to renegotiate the terms of \nmortgages for people facing foreclosure. If a person is facing \nforeclosure because of a reset in mortgage terms and the foreclosure \ngoes through, it is a disastrous result for the family--they lose their \nhome; it is a disastrous result for the neighborhood because every time \na home goes into foreclosure, the neighbors' home values go down--this \nyear alone, foreclosures will drain more than $500 billion from \nneighboring home values; and it is a disastrous result for the bank. \nBanks don't win in foreclosure. I have heard estimates that they lose \nup to $50,000 for every foreclosure. So it would seem to me that the \navoidance of foreclosure is a good thing for everyone involved: the \nhomeowner, other people who own property in the neighborhood, as well \nas the bank. Yet it turns out that when we turn to the banks and say: \nSo do something about it voluntarily, their response to it is meager \nand disappointing.\n  The Treasury Department said on Tuesday that only a small number of \nhomeowners--235,247, or 9 percent of those eligible--had been helped by \nthe latest government program created to modify home loans and prevent \nforeclosures. A report released by Treasury officials identified \nlenders who had made slow progress in offering more affordable \nmortgages, naming Bank of America and Wells Fargo as among those \nfailing to reach large numbers of eligible borrows. While 15 percent of \neligible homeowners have been offered help through the mortgage \nmodification program, the low rate of actual mortgage reductions has \nfrustrated administration officials.\n  In a hearing two weeks ago in the Senate Judiciary Committee, we \nheard testimony from the National Consumer Law Center that I found \ntroubling. Housing counselors from all over the country have told \nstories of violations of the Administration plan by the servicers. \nHomeowners have been asked to pay fees to apply for a trial \nmodification and to waive their legal rights. Servicers have told \nhomeowners that homeowners need to skip payments to become eligible, \nwhich puts them even farther behind. Servicers have refused to offer \neligible homeowners a modification, and have offered modifications that \ndo not comply with the program guidelines--and that is for the \nhomeowners lucky enough to get someone at the servicers' call centers \nto answer the phone. Worst of all, servicers continue to pursue \nforeclosures even as they are supposedly working with homeowners on a \nmortgage modification.\n  This has to end. Whether the bankers and mortgage servicers are \nfailing because of intransigence or incompetence doesn't matter. Our \neconomy is hanging in the balance. They have to do much better.\n  The Times article goes on to note that some banks have done better \nthan others. Where Bank of America has modified only 4 percent of \neligible mortgages and Wells Fargo, 6 percent, CitiMortgage, a unit of \nCitigroup, fared better at 15 percent, and JPMorgan Chase is among the \nmost successful, modifying loans for 20 percent of eligible borrowers.\n  In the previous administration, the Secretary of the Treasury, Hank \nPaulson, called me and told me what they were going to do to try to \nrescue the banks.\n  I said: Hank, you have to get to the heart of this. It is the \nforeclosure crisis. What are you going to do about the people losing \ntheir homes?\n  He said that they were not going to do anything except a voluntary \nprogram.\n  The voluntary program of the Bush administration didn't work and now \nthe voluntary program of this administration is not working. There are \nnot enough people who are facing foreclosure who realistically have an \noption of renegotiating the terms of their mortgages.\n  I credit President Bush and President Obama with offering the \nopportunity to lead to the industry. Frankly, they have failed. A few \nof these banks have done reasonably well, if you consider 20 percent of \nthose eligible being offered mortgage modification something to brag \nabout, but others are terrible.\n  So yesterday I along with Senator Reed and Senator Whitehouse sent a \nletter to the heads of the 38 banks and mortgage service companies that \nhave signed up for the Administration's Home Affordable Modification \nProgram. We are asking them a series of pointed questions that will \nhelp us understand what each servicer is doing to help homeowners avoid \npreventable foreclosures.\n  Most importantly, I am asking the servicers to make a commitment that \nthey will avoid scheduling a foreclosure on any homeowner who is \nactively working in good faith to work out a loan modification that is \nfair, reasonable, and sustainable.\n  Let me mention one other element that should be noted here. Two weeks \nago in Chicago, a group known as NACA--I believe that stands for the \nNeighborhood Assistance Corporation of America--held an opportunity at \nMcCormick Place for those facing foreclosure to come in and try to work \nout new mortgage terms. I was at another meeting, they invited me to \ncome over, and I was stunned as I walked into this huge hall filled \nwith literally thousands of people on a Saturday morning, thousands of \npeople facing mortgage foreclosure. On one side of the room sat a large \ngroup, about 1,000 people, and they were from Hispanic families; on the \nother side of the room, another 1,000 people, by and large African \nAmerican, with others--Asians, Whites, and others, but primarily \nAfrican American.\n\n  It is clear to me, as you look at the nature of the foreclosure \ncrisis, that many people in lower income and middle-income categories, \nparticularly those who have been the targets of predators in the past, \nwho were preyed upon with these mortgages and now face foreclosure, are \nalso people who are most likely to lose their jobs. They are in \nmarginal employment, and a slowing economy is going to hurt them first, \nwhich goes to my point: Not enough is being done. For those who are \nstill working and have a chance to pay on their mortgage, these banks \nshould be stepping up, showing a lot more commitment to renegotiating \nthe terms of their mortgage than they currently are.\n\n[[Page S8788]]\n\n  When I offered this change in the Bankruptcy Code to try to move this \nprocess forward, the banking associations--all of them--opposed it. \nOnly one bank, Citigroup, supported my efforts.\n  In fact, an interesting thing is that at one point in the \nnegotiations, we said to the independent community bankers, the \nhometown bankers we all know: We will exempt you. Because you have such \na small part of this problem portfolio, we will exempt you and just go \nafter the large banks that are responsible for this.\n  The so-called independent community banks said: No, we don't want any \npart of it. We are going to stick with our friends, the large banks.\n  That leads me to conclude that the independent community banks should \ndrop the word ``independent'' from their title. They are now part of \nthe larger bank operation when it comes to dealing with this \nforeclosure crisis.\n  Much the same can be said for credit unions. Given an opportunity to \navoid being even part of this change in bankruptcy modifications, they \nrefused to support us as well.\n  So the entire financial industry has stood back and said: We are not \ngoing to support--with the exception of Citigroup--any change in the \nBankruptcy Code, and quite honestly, we are not going to do much when \nit comes to renegotiating the mortgages.\n  I don't think this economy is going to get well until we deal with \nthis issue. I can take you to neighborhoods in Chicago and surrounding \ncommunities and tell you that they are flat on their backs because of \nmortgage foreclosures. It is very difficult, if not impossible, for \nthese communities to come back, these neighborhoods to come back.\n  There are things we need to do.\n  First, Congress should consider passing legislation to give \nhomeowners who can't afford their mortgage payments the right to remain \nin their homes for a period of time by paying fair market rent to a \nbank. Why not let a family stay in a home rather than let it get run \ndown and become a haven for criminal activities and other things when \nit is vacant? It is certainly no good assignment for a bank to be told: \nYou now have a foreclosed home, cut the grass and take care of the \nweeds and put plywood on the windows and try to keep the bad guys out. \nThat is what most of them face.\n  Second, Congress should consider providing matching funds for cities \nand States to create mandatory arbitration programs. They have done it \nin Philadelphia with some success; we ought to do it here and across \nthe Nation so that we move this toward arbitration, negotiation, and \nagreements for new modifications on mortgages.\n  Third, if these servicers of mortgages, some of which have taken \nbillions of dollars in taxpayer bailouts, refuse to meet the \nforeclosure reduction standards and goals they have signed up for under \nthis administration, they should be facing penalties. We gave them \ntaxpayers' money to save the banks. Some of them used it for bonuses \nfor their employees, and now they won't turn around and give a helping \nhand to people who are about to lose their homes? I am sorry, but if \nthere is any justice in America, that has to change.\n  Will I come back with bankruptcy modification? Well, let's see what \nhappens in the next few months. I want to be able to come to my \ncolleagues in the next 2 or 3 months and say: Alright, whether you \nsupport or oppose bankruptcy changes, when it comes to these mortgage \nmodifications, let's be honest about where we are today and where we \nneed to go. That is absolutely essential.\n  So I hope this situation starts to resolve itself. I hope some of \nthese banks that hold these mortgages get serious about helping people \nfacing foreclosure. It is the only way we are going to stabilize this \neconomy and get it moving forward.\n  I might add, the blip in the housing market we saw just a few weeks \nago is likely just that. There had been a temporary moratorium on many \nmortgage foreclosures, leading many people to believe there was a \nturnaround in the housing industry. But a new wave of mortgage resets \nis coming. This time it's the so-called ``option ARMs'' or ``pick-a-\npayment'' adjustable rate mortgages.\n  These are the ultimate exploding mortgages. They gave homebuyers the \noption of not even covering the interest some months, but after two or \nthree years, the monthly mortgage payment can skyrocket, often by 50 \npercent or more. An estimated 2.8 million option ARMs are scheduled to \nreset over the next 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  So I am looking for a turnaround in the housing industry. I don't \nthink we have quite seen it yet. I hope it comes soon.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8788-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8788]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Sonia \nSotomayor, of New York, to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court \nof the United States.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 2 p.m. will be equally divided in 1-hour alternating blocks of \ntime, with the majority controlling the first hour.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we began debate yesterday on this historic \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. Senator Reid, \nSenator Feinstein, Senator Menendez, Senator Whitehouse, and Senator \nBrown gave powerful statements--powerful statements--in support of \nJudge Sotomayor's long record, a record that makes her a highly \nqualified nominee and a record that brought about her receiving the \nhighest qualification possible from the American Bar Association. I \nthank those Senators for their statements.\n  In the course of my opening statement yesterday, I spoke about the \nvalue of real-world judging. Among the cases I discussed were two \ninvolving the strip searches of adolescent girls. I spoke about how \nJudge Sotomayor and Justice Ginsburg properly--properly--approached \nthose decisions in their respective courts.\n  Judge Sotomayor is certainly not the first nominee to discuss how her \nbackground has shaped her character. Many recent Justices have spoken \nof their life experiences as an influential factor in how they approach \ncases. Justice Alito, at his confirmation hearings, described his \nexperience as growing up as a child of Italian immigrants saying:\n\n       When I get a case about discrimination, I have to think \n     about people in my own family who suffered discrimination \n     because of their ethnic background or because of religion or \n     because of gender. And I do take that into account.\n\n  He was praised by every single Republican in the Senate for that.\n  Chief Justice Roberts testified at his confirmation hearing:\n\n       Of course, we all bring our life experiences to the bench.\n\n  Again, every single Republican voted for him.\n  Justice O'Connor echoed these statements when she said recently:\n\n       We're all creatures of our upbringing. We bring whatever we \n     are as people to a job like the Supreme Court. We have our \n     life experiences . . . So that made me a little more\n\n[[Page S8789]]\n\n     pragmatic than some other justices. I liked to find solutions \n     that would work.\n\n  Justice O'Connor explained recently:\n\n       You do have to have an understanding of how some rule you \n     make will apply to people in the real world. I think that \n     there should be an awareness of the real-world consequences \n     of the principles of the law you apply.\n\n  Just as all Democrats voted for Justice O'Connor, so did all \nRepublicans.\n  I recall another Supreme Court nominee who spoke during his \nconfirmation hearing of his personal struggle to overcome obstacles. He \nmade a point of describing his life as:\n\n       One that required me to at some point touch on virtually \n     every aspect, every level of our country, from people who \n     couldn't read or write to people who were extremely literate, \n     from people who had no money to people who were very wealthy.\n\n  And added:\n\n       So what I bring to this Court, I believe, is an \n     understanding and the ability to stand in the shoes of other \n     people across a broad spectrum of this country.\n\n  That is the definition of empathy. That nominee, of course, was \nClarence Thomas. Indeed, when President George H.W. Bush nominated \nJustice Thomas to the Supreme Court, he touted him as:\n\n       A delightful and warm, intelligent person who has great \n     empathy and a wonderful sense of humor.\n\n  Let me cite one example of a decision by Justice Thomas that I expect \nwas informed by his experience. In Virginia v. Black, the Supreme \nCourt, in 2003, held that Virginia's statute against cross burning, \ndone with an attempt to intimidate, was constitutional. However, at the \nsame time, the Court's decision also rejected another provision in that \nstatute. Justice Thomas wrote a heartfelt opinion, where he stated he \nwould have gone even further.\n  He began his opinion:\n\n       In every culture, certain things acquire meaning well \n     beyond what outsiders can comprehend. That goes for both the \n     sacred . . . and the profane. I believe that cross burning is \n     the paradigmatic example of the latter.\n\n  He went on to describe the Ku Klux Klan as a ``terrorist \norganization,'' while discussing the history of cross burning, \nparticularly in Virginia, and the brutalization of racial minorities \nand others through terror and lawlessness. Would anyone deny Justice \nThomas his standing or seek to belittle his perspective on these \nmatters? I trust not. Who would call him biased or attack him as Judge \nSotomayor is now being attacked? I trust no one would. Real-world \nexperience, real-world judging, and awareness of the real-world \nconsequences of decisions are vital aspects of the law. Here we have a \nnominee who has had more experience as a Federal judge than any nominee \nin decades and will be the only member of the U.S. Supreme Court with \nexperience as a trial judge.\n  I look forward to this debate. One of the Judiciary Committee's \nnewest members is now on the floor, Senator Klobuchar, the senior \nSenator from Minnesota. She has been a leader in support of this \nnomination. I see beside her the former Governor of my neighboring \nState of New Hampshire, then-Governor Shaheen, now Senator Shaheen. \nBoth of them are going to speak, so I will take no more time.\n  I yield the floor, first, to Senator Klobuchar.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the chairman. I thank him for \nthose strong remarks on behalf of Judge Sotomayor, strong remarks for a \nvery strong nominee.\n  More importantly, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I \nthank Senator Leahy, and Senator Sessions, for the way they conducted \nthe confirmation hearing, the dignity that was shown to the nominee in \nthat hearing. I think that was very important to the process. We may \nnot have agreed with the conclusions that some of our colleagues \nreached, but no one can dispute the hearing was conducted civilly and \nwith great dignity. This is a nominee who shows great dignity every \nstep of the way.\n  Today I will be speaking in support of Judge Sotomayor's nomination, \nbut first I am going to be joined by several of my esteemed fellow \nwomen Senators, including Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire, who is here \nalready, Senator Stabenow of Michigan, Senator Gillibrand of New York, \nand Senator Murray of Washington State.\n  We all know this nomination is history making for several reasons but \none of them, of course, is that Judge Sotomayor will be only the third \nwoman ever to join the Supreme Court of the United States of America.\n  We know she is incredibly well qualified. She has more Federal \njudicial experience than any nominee for the past 100 years. That is \nsomething that is remarkable. But I do think it is worth remembering \nwhat it was like to be a nominee for this Court as a woman even just a \nfew years ago.\n  It is worth remembering, for example, that when Justice O'Connor \ngraduated from law school, the only offers she got from law firms, \nafter graduating from Stanford Law School, was for legal secretary \npositions. Justice O'Connor, who graduated third in her class in law \nschool, saw her accomplishments reduced to one question: Can she type?\n  Justice Ginsburg faced similar obstacles. When she entered Harvard \nLaw School, she was 1 of only 9 women in a class of more than 500. The \ndean of the law school actually demanded she justify why she deserved a \nseat that could have gone to a man. Later, she was passed over for a \nprestigious clerkship, despite her impressive credentials.\n  Nonetheless, both of these women persevered and they certainly \nprevailed. Their undeniable merits triumphed over those who sought to \ndeny them opportunity. The women who came before Judge Sotomayor--all \nthose women judges--helped blaze a trail. Although Judge Sotomayor's \nrecord stands on her own, she is also standing on those women's \nshoulders.\n  I am pleased to recognize several women Senators who are here today \nto speak in support of Judge Sotomayor. The first is my great colleague \nfrom New Hampshire, Senator Shaheen.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here to join the \nsenior Senator from Minnesota, Ms. Klobuchar, and to speak also after \nthe senior Senator from Vermont, my neighbor, Senator Leahy, in support \nof Sonia Sotomayor.\n  This week, we have the opportunity to make history by confirming the \nfirst Hispanic and only the third woman to the U.S. Supreme Court. \nSenator Klobuchar spoke eloquently about the challenges women have \nfaced, and I am pleased to say I had the honor as Governor of \nappointing the first woman to the New Hampshire Supreme Court.\n  I come to the floor to speak in support of Sonia Sotomayor's \nnomination; however, not because of the historic nature of that \nnomination but because she is more than qualified to sit on the Supreme \nCourt. I am somewhat perplexed by why the vote on her nomination will \nnot be unanimous.\n  Judge Sotomayor is immensely qualified. The nonpartisan American Bar \nAssociation Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary, which has \nevaluated the professional qualifications of nominees to the Federal \nbench since 1948, unanimously--unanimously--rated Judge Sotomayor as \n``well qualified'' to be a Supreme Court Justice after carefully \nconsidering her integrity, professional competence, and judicial \ntemperament.\n  Her decisions as a member of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals are \nwell within the judicial mainstream of our country. A Congressional \nResearch Service analysis on her opinions concluded she eludes easy \nideological categorization and demonstrates an adherence to judicial \nprecedent, an emphasis on facts to a case, and an avoidance of \noverstepping the circuit court's judicial role. Described as a \npolitical centrist by the nonpartisan American Bar Association Journal, \nshe has been nominated to the Federal courts by Presidents of both \npolitical parties.\n  When President George H.W. Bush, in 1992, nominated Sonia Sotomayor \nto the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, this \nSenate approved her nomination by unanimous consent. When President \nClinton, in 1998, nominated her to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, \nthis Senate voted 67 to 29 to confirm her on an overwhelmingly \nbipartisan vote.\n  Her now-familiar personal story is no less impressive. The \nconfirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the highest\n\n[[Page S8790]]\n\nCourt of our country will inspire girls and young women everywhere to \nwork hard and to set their dreams high.\n  Americans look to lawmakers to work together to make the country \nstronger. They expect us to put partisanship aside to advance the \ninterests of the American people. If there is one issue we should be \nable to come together on, to put aside our differences on, it is the \nconfirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I look forward to having the opportunity to vote in support of her \nconfirmation with the majority of my colleagues.\n  I thank Senator Klobuchar. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, having looked at Judge Sotomayor's \nwhole record, as Senator Shaheen has pointed out, her 17 years on the \nbench and the fairness and integrity she will bring to the job, I am \nproud to support her nomination.\n  When Judge Sotomayor's nomination was first announced, I was \nimpressed by her life story, as was everyone else, which all of us know \nwell by now. She grew up, in her own words, ``in modest and challenging \ncircumstances,'' and she worked hard for everything she got.\n  Her dad died when she was 9 years old, and her mom supported her and \nher brother. One of my favorite images, as a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, from the hearing was her mother sitting behind her every \nmoment of that hearing, never leaving her side, the mother who raised \nher on a nurse's salary, who saved every penny she had to buy an \nEncyclopedia Britannica for her family. That struck me because I know \nin our family we also had a set of Encyclopedia Britannica that had a \nhallowed place in our hallway, and that is what I used to write all my \nreports.\n  Judge Sotomayor went on to graduate from Princeton summa cum laude \nand Phi Beta Kappa before graduating from Yale Law School.\n  Since law school, she has had a varied and interesting legal career. \nShe has worked as a private civil litigator, she has been a district \ncourt and an appellate court judge, and she has taught law school \nclasses.\n  But one experience of hers, in particular, resonates with me. \nImmediately after graduating from law school, she spent 5 years as a \nprosecutor at the Manhattan District Attorney's Office.\n  I want to talk a little about that because it is something she and I \nhave in common. I was a prosecutor myself, Mr. President. You know what \nthat is like, to have that duty. I was a prosecutor for Minnesota's \nlargest county. As a prosecutor, after you have interacted with victims \nof crime, after you have seen the damage that crime does to individuals \nand to our communities, after you have seen defendants who are going to \nprison and you know their families are losing them, sometimes forever, \nyou know the law is not just an abstract subject. It is not just a \ndusty book in the basement. The law has a real impact on the real lives \nof real people.\n  It also has a big impact on the individual prosecutor. No matter how \nmany years may pass, you never forget some of the very difficult cases. \nFor Judge Sotomayor, we know this includes the case of the serial \nburglar turned killer--the Tarzan murderer. For me, there was always \nthe case of Tyesha Edwards, an 11-year-old girl with an unforgettable \nsmile, who was at home doing her homework when a stray bullet from a \ngang shooting went through the window and killed her.\n  As a prosecutor, you don't have to just know the law, you have to \nknow the people, the families, and you have to know human nature.\n  Judge Sotomayor's former supervisor said she is ``an imposing and \ncommanding figure in the courtroom, who could weave together a complex \nset of facts, enforce the law, and never lose sight of whom she was \nfighting for.''\n  As her old boss, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau said: \nShe is a ``fearless and effective'' prosecutor.\n  Mr. President, before I turn this over to my colleague, the Senator \nfrom Michigan, who has just arrived, I thought it would be interesting \nfor people to hear a little more about Judge Sotomayor's experience as \na prosecutor, so you can hear firsthand from her own colleagues.\n  This was a letter that was sent in from dozens of her colleagues who \nactually worked with her when she was a prosecutor. They were not her \nbosses necessarily but her colleagues who worked with her. This is what \nthey said in the letter.\n\n       We served together during some of the most difficult years \n     in our city's history. Crime was soaring, a general sense of \n     disorder prevailed in the streets, and the popular attitude \n     was increasing violence was inevitable. Sonia Sotomayor began \n     as a ``rookie'' in 1979, working long hours prosecuting an \n     enormous caseload of misdemeanors before judges managing \n     overwhelming dockets. Sonia so distinguished herself in this \n     challenging assignment, that she was among the very first in \n     her starting class to be selected to handle felonies. She \n     prosecuted a wide variety of felony cases, including serving \n     as co-counsel at a notorious murder trial. She developed a \n     specialty in the investigation and prosecution of child \n     pornography cases. Throughout all of this, she impressed us \n     as one who was singularly determined in fighting crime and \n     violence. For Sonia, service as a prosecutor was a way to \n     bring order to the streets of a city she dearly loves.\n\n  Her colleagues go on in this letter:\n\n       We are proud to have served with Sonia Sotomayor. She \n     solemnly adheres to the rule of law and believes that it \n     should be applied equally and fairly to all Americans. As a \n     group, we have different world views and political \n     affiliations, but our support for Sonia is entirely \n     nonpartisan. And the fact that so many of us have remained \n     friends with Sonia over three decades speaks well, we think, \n     of her warmth and collegiality.\n\n  Mr. President, I see that my colleague from Michigan has arrived. I \nwill continue my statement when she has completed hers, but I am proud \nto have Senator Stabenow, the Senator from Michigan, here to speak on \nbehalf of Judge Sotomayor, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, first I am so pleased to be here with \nthe senior Senator from Minnesota, and I have appreciated her wonderful \nwords about Judge Sotomayor, as well as her advocacy on behalf of \nMinnesota. We have a lot in common, Minnesota and Michigan, and so it \nis always a pleasure to be with the Senator from Minnesota.\n  I rise today to strongly support the confirmation of Judge Sonia \nSotomayor as the next Justice of the Supreme Court. Over 230 years ago, \nAlexander Hamilton called experience ``that best oracle of wisdom.'' \nHis words continue to ring true today. Judge Sotomayor has over 17 \nyears of experience on the Federal bench. She will be the most \nexperienced Supreme Court Justice in over 100 years--a lifetime.\n  But it isn't just her years of experience that will make her a great \nJustice. It will be the experience of a uniquely American life--the \nAmerican dream. She was raised in a South Bronx housing project where \nher family instilled in her values of hard work and sacrifice. At the \nage of 9, her father--a tool-and-die worker--died tragically. After \nthat, her mother--a nurse--raised her the best she could. I would say \nshe did a pretty good job.\n  Her mom urged her to pay attention in school. She pushed Sonia to \nwork hard and to get good grades, which she did. She studied hard and \ngraduated at the top of her class in high school. It was through \neducation that doors opened for Judge Sotomayor, as they have opened \nfor millions of other Americans.\n  After law school, she went to work as an assistant district attorney \nin New York, prosecuting crimes such as murders and robberies and child \nabuse. She later went into private practice as a civil litigator, \nworking in parts of the law related to real estate, employment, \nbanking, and contract law.\n  In 1992, she was nominated by President George H.W. Bush and \nconfirmed by the Senate unanimously to serve as a district court judge. \nShe performed admirably, and President Clinton--having been nominated \nfirst by a Republican and then again by a Democrat--elevated her to the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  It is in part due to this enormous breadth of experience as a \nprosecutor, a lawyer in private practice, as a trial judge, and as an \nappeals court judge that the American Bar Association has given her \ntheir highest rating of ``well qualified.''\n  Judge Sotomayor's story is the American story--that a young person\n\n[[Page S8791]]\n\nborn into poverty can work hard, take advantage of opportunities, and \nthen succeed brilliantly and rise to the very top of their profession. \nJudge Sotomayor is really an inspiration to all of us. She is a role \nmodel for millions of young people of every race, class, creed, and \nbackground living in America today.\n  Last November, we demonstrated that every child in America really can \ngrow up to be President of the United States. Judge Sotomayor proves \nthat with hard work and dedication they can be a Supreme Court Justice \ntoo.\n  Mr. President, I strongly urge my colleagues to vote to confirm Judge \nSotomayor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for \nher strong words in favor of this very strong nominee.\n  I was talking earlier about the experience that Judge Sotomayor \nbrings to the bench as a prosecutor. For me, it means she meets one of \nmy criteria for a nominee because I am looking for someone who deeply \nappreciates the power and the impact that laws and the criminal justice \nsystem have on real people's lives. From her first day in the Manhattan \nDA's office, Judge Sotomayor talked about and understood how it was \nimportant to view the law as about people and not just the law.\n  But when you talk about people, it means you have to look at their \ncases, it means you have to look at the law, and you have to look at \nthe facts. One of the things we learned in the hearings was that \nsometimes Judge Sotomayor had to make very difficult decisions. When \nshe was a prosecutor, she had to turn down some cases. Although she \nwas, by all accounts, more aggressive than other prosecutors and took \non cases many wouldn't, when she was a judge she sometimes had to turn \ndown cases, turn away victims, as in the case involving the crash of \nthe TWA flight. She actually disagreed with a number of other judges \nand said as much as she found the victims' families and their case to \nbe incredibly sympathetic, the law took her somewhere else; that the \nfacts and the law meant something else.\n  You could see that in a number of her cases, which is part of the \nreason people who have looked at her record don't think of her as a \njudicial activist. They think of her as a judicial model--someone who, \nin her own words, has a fidelity to the law.\n  What are we looking for in a Supreme Court Justice? Well, I think \nactually one of Sonia Sotomayor's old bosses, Robert Morgenthau, said \nit best. He came and testified on her behalf, and he quoted himself \nfrom many years ago when speaking about what he was looking for when he \ntried to find prosecutors for his office. He said:\n\n       We want people with good judgment, because a lot of the job \n     of a prosecutor is making decisions. I also want to see some \n     signs of humility in anybody that I hire. We're giving young \n     lawyers a lot of power, and we want to make sure that they're \n     going to use that power with good sense and without \n     arrogance.\n\n  These are among the very same qualities I look for in a Supreme Court \nJustice. I, too, am looking for a person with good judgment, someone \nwith intellectual curiosity and independence but who also understands \nthat her decisions affect the people before her.\n  With that, I think comes a second essential quality--the quality of \nhumility. I am looking for a Justice who appreciates the awesome \nresponsibility they will be given if confirmed, a Justice who \nunderstands the gravity of the office and who respects the very \ndifferent roles the Constitution provides for each of the three \nbranches of government--something Judge Sotomayor was questioned on \nextensively in the hearing and made very clear she respects those three \ndifferent roles for the three different branches of government.\n  Finally, a good prosecutor knows their job is to enforce the law \nwithout fear or favor. Likewise, a Supreme Court Justice must interpret \nthe laws without fear or favor. I am convinced that Judge Sotomayor \nmeets all of these criteria.\n  She has been a judge for 17 years, 11 years as an appellate judge and \n6 years as a trial judge. President George H.W. Bush gave her the first \njob she had as a Federal judge in the Southern District of New York. \nHer nomination to the Southern District was enthusiastically supported \nby both New York Senators--Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan \nand Republican Senator Alfonse D'Amato. So she was first nominated by \nGeorge H.W. Bush, supported by a Republican Senator, and as Senator \nShaheen noted, confirmed unanimously by this Senate.\n  Judge Sotomayor, as I noted before, has more Federal judicial \nexperience than any nominee in the past 100 years. I think the best way \nto tell what kind of a Justice she will be is to look at what kind of a \njudge she has been. One person who knows a little something about Sonia \nSotomayor as a judge is Louie Freeh, the former Director of the FBI, \nwho served as a judge with her before he was the Director of the FBI. \nHe actually came--again, a Republican appointee--and testified for her \nat her hearing. He didn't just testify based on a review of her record, \nhe testified based on his own personal experience. He was actually her \nmentor when she arrived as a new judge. I want to read from the letter \nhe submitted to the Judiciary Committee.\n  Louis Freeh writes:\n\n       It is with tremendous pride in a former colleague that I \n     write to recommend wholeheartedly that you confirm Sonia \n     Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. \n     Judge Sotomayor has the extensive experience and the judicial \n     qualities that make her eminently qualified for this ultimate \n     honor and I look forward to watching her take her place on \n     the Nation's highest court.\n\n  Freeh goes on to say:\n\n       I first met Judge Sotomayor in 1992 when she was appointed \n     to the United States District Court for the Southern District \n     of New York. As the newest judge in the storied Courthouse at \n     Foley Square in lower Manhattan, we followed the tradition of \n     having the newly-minted judge mentored by the last arriving \n     member of the bench. Despite the questionable wisdom of this \n     practice, I had the privilege of serving as Judge Sotomayor's \n     point of contact for orientation and to help her get underway \n     as she took on a full, complex civil and criminal case \n     docket.\n       Into this very pressurized and unforgiving environment, \n     where a new judge's every word, decision, writing and \n     question is scrutinized and critiqued by one of the harshest, \n     professional audiences imaginable, Judge Sotomayor quickly \n     distinguished herself as a highly competent judge who was \n     open-minded, well-prepared, properly demanding of the lawyers \n     who came before her, fair, honest, diligent in following the \n     law, and with that rare and invaluable combination of legal \n     intellect and ``street smarts.''\n\n  Louis Freeh, a Republican-appointed judge, goes on to say:\n\n       To me, there is no better measure by which to evaluate a \n     judge than the standards of the former Chief Judge of the \n     U.S. District Court of Minnesota--\n\n  Mr. President, I like this part--\n\n     --and nationally renowned American jurist, Edward J. Devitt. \n     A former Member of Congress and World War II Navy hero, Judge \n     Devitt was appointed to the federal bench by President \n     Eisenhower and became one of the country's leading trial \n     judges and teacher of judges. A standard Jury Instruction \n     textbook (Devitt and Blackmun) as well as the profession's \n     most coveted award recognizing outstanding judges, the Devitt \n     Award, bears his name.\n       I recently had the honor of participating in the dedication \n     of a courtroom named for Judge Devitt. The judges and lawyers \n     who spoke in tribute to Judge Devitt very ably and \n     insightfully described the critical characteristics which \n     define and predict great judges. But rather than discuss \n     Judge Devitt's many decisions, particular rulings or the \n     ``sound bite'' analyses which could have been parsed from the \n     thousands of complex and fact specific cases which crossed \n     his docket, they focused on those ultimately more profound \n     and priceless judicial qualities.\n\n  He goes on to talk about those qualities of a good judge.\n\n       1. Judging takes more than mere intelligence;\n       2. Always take the bench prepared. . . .\n       3. Call them as you see them.\n\n  He then goes on to say:\n\n       Sonia Sotomayor would have gotten an ``A plus'' from the \n     ``Judge from Central Casting,'' as Judge Devitt was often \n     called by his peers.\n\n  I think that says it all. You have Louis Freeh here testifying in \nbehalf of Judge Sotomayor. As I read earlier, you have dozens of her \nformer colleagues, Republicans, Democrats, Independents, writing about \nwhat kind of prosecutor she was. Every step of the way she impressed \npeople.\n  I see we are now being joined by the Senator from New York, my \ndistinguished colleague, who also will be speaking in favor of Judge \nSotomayor.\n\n[[Page S8792]]\n\n  Senator Gillibrand had the distinguished honor to introduce Judge \nSotomayor when she so eloquently spoke at the hearing. I am very \nhonored to have her join us here today.\n  I will turn this over to Senator Gillibrand.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I am grateful to the senior Senator \nfrom Minnesota for her kind words and thank her for her extraordinary \nadvocacy on behalf of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. The Senator's words and \nreal belief in her contribution is extremely important.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  I stand today to speak on behalf of Judge Sonia Sotomayor and lend my \nstrong support to her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor will bring the wisdom of all her experiences to bear \nas she applies the rule of law, and will grace the Supreme Court with \nthe intelligence, judgment, clarity of thought and determination of \npurpose that we have come to expect from all great Justices on the \nCourt.\n  Much has been made of Judge Sotomayor's remarkable personal story. \nThere has been great import afforded to the characterization of a \n``wise Latina.'' Clearly, the life lessons and experiences of Justices \ninform their decisions as has been noted during the confirmation \nprocess time and time again.\n  Justice Antonin Scalia discussed his being a racial minority, in his \nunderstanding of discrimination. Justice Clarence Thomas indicated that \nhis exposure to all facets of society gave him the ``ability to stand \nin the shoes of other people across a broad spectrum of this country.''\n  Justice Samuel Alito described his parents growing up in poverty as a \nlearning experience and his family's immigration to the United States \nas influencing his views on immigration and discrimination.\n  As Americans, we honor the diversity of our society. As our esteemed \njurists have noted, the construct of the court is shaped by the diverse \nexperiences and viewpoints of each of its Justices. However, Sonia \nSotomayor's ethnicity or gender alone does not indicate what sort of \nSupreme Court Justice she will be. Rather, it is Judge Sotomayor's \nexperience and record that more fully informs us.\n  The breadth and depth of Judge Sotomayor's experience makes her \nuniquely qualified for the Supreme Court. Her keen understanding of \ncase law and the importance of precedent is derived from working in \nnearly every aspect of our legal system--as a prosecutor, corporate \nlitigator, civil rights advocate, trial judge and appellate judge. With \nconfirmation, Judge Sotomayor would bring to the Supreme Court more \nFederal judicial experience than any justice in 100 years and more \noverall judicial and more overall judicial experience than any justice \nin 70 years.\n  As a prosecutor, Judge Sotomayor fought the worst of society's ills--\nfrom murder to child pornography to drug trafficking. Judge Sotomayor's \nyears as a corporate litigator exposed her to all facets of commercial \nlaw including, real estate, employment, banking, contracts and agency \nlaw. Her pro bono work on behalf of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense Fund \ndemonstrates her commitment to our constitutional rights and the core \nvalue that equality is an inalienable American right.\n  On the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, \nJudge Sotomayor presided over roughly 450 cases, earning a reputation \nas a tough, fair and thoughtful jurist.\n  As an appellate judge, Sonia Sotomayor has participated in over 3,000 \npanel decisions and authored roughly 400 published opinions. As \nevidence of the integrity of her decisions and adherence to precedence, \nonly 7 cases were brought up for review by the Supreme Court, of \nreversing only 3 of her authored opinions, 2 of which were closely \ndivided.\n  In an analysis of her record, done by the Brennan Center for Justice, \nthe numbers overwhelmingly indicate that Judge Sotomayor is solidly in \nthe mainstream of the Second Circuit.\n  Judge Sotomayor has been in agreement with her colleagues more often \nthan most--94 percent of her constitutional decisions have been \nunanimous.\n  She has voted with the majority in over 98 percent of constitutional \ncases.\n  When Judge Sotomayor has voted to hold a challenged governmental \naction unconstitutional, her decisions have been unanimous over 90 \npercent of the time.\n  Republican appointees have agreed with her decision to hold a \nchallenged governmental action unconstitutional in nearly 90 percent of \ncases.\n  When she has voted to overrule a lower court or agency, her decisions \nhave been unanimous over 93 percent of the time.\n  Republican appointees have agreed with Judge Sotomayor's decision to \noverrule a lower court decision in over 94 percent of cases.\n  Judge Sotomayor's record is a testament to her strict adherence to \nprecedence--her unyielding belief in the rule of law and the \nConstitution. I strongly support Judge Sotomayor's nomination and \nfirmly believe she will prove to be one of the finest justices in \nAmerican history. I urge my fellow Senators to join me in voting for \nher confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Minnesota is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New York for \nher fine remarks. As she was talking, I was realizing she is a pioneer \nof sorts, being the first woman Senator from New York who took over as \nSenator having two very small children. I have seen them and they are \nsmall--babies--and she has been able to manage and do a fine job in her \nrole of Senator while being a pioneer as a mother at the same time in \nthe State of New York.\n  With that, it is a good segue to introduce my colleague from the \nState of Washington, Patty Murray, one of the first women to serve in \nthe Senate. I love her story because when Patty started running for \noffice she was working on some school issues and she went to the \nlegislature. One of the elected legislators actually said to her: How \ndo you think you are ever going to get this done? You are nothing but a \nmom in tennis shoes.\n  She went on to wear those tennis shoes and wear them right to the \nfloor of the Senate. I am proud to introduce to speak on behalf of \nJudge Sotomayor my colleague from the State of Washington, Patty \nMurray.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the senior Senator from Minnesota for all her \nwork helping to move this very critical and important nomination \nthrough the Senate. I am here to join her in support of the nomination \nof Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. States Supreme Court.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court is the final arbiter of many our nation's most \nimportant disputes.\n  And as the Constitution provides for a lifetime appointment to the \nCourt, a Supreme Court Justice has an opportunity to have a profound \neffect on the future of the law in America. That is why the \nConstitution directs that the Senate is responsible for providing \nadvice and consent on judicial nominees.\n  Naturally, I take my responsibilities in the nomination and \nconfirmation process very seriously.\n  But I take a special, personal interest in Supreme Court nominations.\n  It was watching Supreme Court confirmation hearings many years ago \nthat inspired me to challenge the status quo and run for the Senate.\n  I was deeply frustrated by the confirmation hearings of then-nominee \nClarence Thomas. I believed that average Americans did not have a voice \nin the process.\n  There were important questions--questions that needed to be \nanswered--that were never even raised to the nominee.\n  So, I have worked for years to be a voice for those average Americans \nwhen it comes to judicial appointments--and make sure those questions \nare asked.\n  I have had the opportunity to meet in person with Judge Sotomayor and \nask her the questions that will most affect all Americans, including \nworking families in Washington State.\n  I have examined her personal and professional history, and studied \nher 17-year record on the Federal bench.\n  I have followed her progress through the Senate Judiciary Committee \nand watched her answer a number of difficult questions.\n  And with all of this information and her answers in mind, I am \npleased to support her nomination.\n  By now, many Americans have heard the remarkable life story of Judge\n\n[[Page S8793]]\n\nSonia Sotomayor. Judge Sotomayor is truly the embodiment of the \nAmerican dream.\n  Though many Americans by now have heard Judge Sotomayor's story, some \npoints bear repeating.\n  Judge Sotomayor is the daughter of Puerto Rican parents. Her father \ndied when she was 9, and she and her brother were raised by her mother \nin a public housing project in the Bronx.\n  Sotomayor's mother, a nurse, worked extra hours so that she could pay \nfor schooling and a set of encyclopedias for her children.\n  After graduating from high school, Judge Sotomayor attended college \nat Princeton and law school at Yale.\n  She spent five years prosecuting criminal cases in New York, 7 years \nin private law practice, and 17 years as a Federal judge on the U.S. \nDistrict Court and Court of Appeals.\n  Judge Sotomayor's story is an inspiring reminder of what is \nachievable with hard work and the support of family and community.\n  Of course, a compelling personal story of triumph in tough \ncircumstances is not itself enough.\n  I have long used several criteria to evaluate nominees for judicial \nappointments: Are they ethical, honest, and qualified? Will they be \nfair, independent, and even-handed in administering justice? And will \nthey protect the rights and liberties of all Americans?\n  I am confident that Judge Sotomayor meets these criteria.\n  She has 17 years of Federal judicial experience and unanimously \nreceived the highest rating of the American Bar Association--which \ncalled her ``well qualified'' based on a comprehensive evaluation of \nher record and integrity.\n  And she has directly answered questions about her personal beliefs--\nand prior statements.\n  She has been clear with me, the Judiciary Committee and the American \npeople that her own biases and personal opinions never play a role in \ndeciding cases. More importantly, her 17 years on the bench stand as \nthe testament to this fact.\n  Judge Sotomayor has demonstrated her independence. She was nominated \nto the Federal district court by President George H.W. Bush and \nappointed to the U.S. court of appeals by President Clinton.\n  Judge Sotomayor has received rave reviews from her fellow judges on \nthe Second Circuit, both Republicans and Democrats, as well as strong \nsupport from a diverse cross section of people and organizations from \nacross the political spectrum.\n  Finally, it is clear to me that Judge Sotomayor is committed to \nprotecting the rights and liberties of all Americans. She understands \nthe struggle of working families. She understands the importance of \ncivil rights. Her record shows a strong respect for the rule of law and \nthat she evaluates each case based on its particular facts.\n  Having followed the criteria by which I measure judicial nominees, I \nam confident Judge Sotomayor will be a smart, fair, impartial, and \nqualified member of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I believe any individual or group from my home State could stand \nbefore her and receive fair treatment and that she will well serve the \ninterests of justice and the public as our next Supreme Court Justice.\n  I wish to come to the floor to join with many of my women colleagues \nin the Senate and let the people of Washington State know that, after \nreviewing her qualifications and her record and reviewing her \ntestimony, I am very proud to stand and support this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. I wish to first thank the Senator from Washington for \nher excellent remarks on Judge Sotomayor.\n  During this hour, we have heard from several of my colleagues, all \nstrongly supporting Judge Sotomayor. I have talked about, first of all, \nher growing up and her difficult circumstances. I spoke about her work \nas a prosecutor and the support she has received from her prosecutorial \ncolleagues.\n  I have talked about her work as a judge and read extensively from a \nletter from Louis Freeh, the former Director of the FBI and former \nFederal judge, about her work as a judge. Now, in the final part of my \ntalk, I wish to address some of the other issues that have been raised \nwith respect to Judge Sotomayor.\n  I have to say, I woke up this morning to the radio on my clock radio \nand heard one of my colleagues who decided he was not going to support \nher, in his words, because of the ``empathy standard.''\n  I kind of put the pillow over my head. I thought: He must not have \nbeen sitting in the hearing because she was specifically asked by one \nof the other Senators about how she views the cases. They specifically \nasked her if she agreed with President Obama when he said: You should \nuse your heart as well as the law.\n  She said: Actually, I do not agree with that. I look at the law and I \nlook at the facts.\n  So people can say all kinds of things about her, if they would like, \nbut I suggest they look at her record.\n  My colleagues in the Senate are entitled to oppose her nomination, if \nthey wish; that is their prerogative. But I am concerned some people \nkeep returning again and again to some quotes in the speeches, a quote \nshe actually said, a phrase, that she did not mean to offend anyone and \nshe should have put it differently.\n  When have you 17 years of a record as a judge, what is more \nimportant--those 17 years of the record of a judge or one phrase which \nshe basically said was not the words she meant to use. What is more \nimportant?\n  In the words of Senator Moynihan: You are entitled to your own \nopinion, but you are not entitled to your own facts. So let's look at \nthe facts of her judicial record. This nominee was repeatedly \nquestioned, and I sat there through nearly all of it. She was \nquestioned for hours and days about whether she would let bias or \nprejudice infect her judgment.\n  But, again, the facts do not support these claims. In race \ndiscrimination cases, for example, Judge Sotomayor voted against \nplaintiffs 81 percent of the time. She also handed out longer jail \nsentences than her colleagues as a district court judge. She sentenced \nwhite-collar criminals to at least 6 months in prison 48 percent of the \ntime; whereas, her other colleagues did so only 34 percent of the time.\n  In drug cases, 85.5 percent of convicted drug offenders received a \nprison sentence of at least 6 months from Judge Sotomayor, compared \nwith only 79 percent in her colleagues' cases.\n  A few weeks ago, I was in the Minneapolis airport and a guy came up \nto me, he was wearing an orange vest. He said: Are you going to vote \nfor that woman?\n  At first, I did not know what he was talking about. I said: What do \nyou mean?\n  He said: That judge.\n  I said: Actually, I want to meet her first. This is before I had met \nher. I said: I want to ask her some questions before I make a decision.\n  He said: Oh, I do not know how you are going to do that because she \nalways lets her feelings get in front of the law.\n  This guy needs to hear these statistics. He needs to hear the \nstatistics Senator Gillibrand was talking about, the statistics that \nwhen she had served on the bench with a Republican colleague, 95 \npercent of the time they made the same decision on a case.\n  So then I guess you must believe that these same Republican-appointed \njudges are letting their feelings get in front of the law if you take \nthat logic to its extreme. So 95 percent of the time she sided with her \nRepublican-appointed judge colleagues.\n  During her hearing, Judge Sotomayor was questioned about issues \nranging from the death penalty to her use of foreign law. That was \nrepeatedly mentioned that she might use foreign law to decide a death \npenalty case.\n  What do we have as the facts? What do we have as evidence? There was \none case she decided when the death penalty came before her, and she \nrejected the claim of someone who wanted to say the death penalty would \nnot apply when she was a district court judge.\n  She never cited foreign law. There was no mention of France or any \nkind of law anywhere in that decision. Those are the facts in her \njudicial record. In no place has she ever cited foreign law to help her \ninterpret a provision of the U.S. Constitution.\n  I believe that everything in a nominee's professional record is fair \ngame\n\n[[Page S8794]]\n\nto consider. After all, we are obligated to determine whether to \nconfirm someone for an incredibly important lifetime position. That is \nour constitutional duty and I take it seriously.\n  But that said, when people focus on a few items in a few speeches \nthat Judge Sotomayor has given, phrases which she has basically said \nshe would have said differently if she had another opportunity, you \nhave to ask yourself again: Do those statements--are they outweighed by \nthe record? Are they outweighed by the facts?\n  Check out all these endorsements of people who have actually looked \nat her record, have looked at how she has come out on decisions. You \nhave an endorsement from the National District Attorneys Association \nsupporting her; you have the support from the Police Executive Research \nForum; you have support from the National Fraternal Order of Police, \nnot exactly a raging liberal organization; you have the support of the \nNational Sheriffs Association. Again, these are the facts.\n  These are the facts my colleagues should be looking at. You have the \nsupport from the International Association of Chiefs of Police. You \nhave the support of the Major Cities Chiefs Association; she has the \nsupport of the National Association of Police Organizations; she has \nthe support of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys; we have \nletters supporting her from the Detectives Endowment Association; from \nthe National Black Prosecutors Association; from the National \nOrganization of Black Law Enforcement Executives. The list goes on and \non and on.\n\n  Those are the facts: Unanimous top rating from the ABA, the American \nBar Association. Those are the facts. I believe, if we want to know \nwhat kind of a Justice Sonia Sotomayor will be, our best evidence is to \nlook at the kind of judge she has been.\n  I wish to address one more matter that I mentioned at the Judiciary \nhearing, when we voted for Judge Sotomayor, and that has been a point \nthat irritated me. There have been some stories and comments, mostly \nanonymous, about Judge Sotomayor's judicial temperament.\n  According to one newspaper story about this topic, Judge Sotomayor \ndeveloped a reputation for asking tough questions at oral arguments and \nfor being sometimes brisk and curt with lawyers who were not prepared \nto answer them. Well, where I come from, asking tough questions, having \nvery little patience for unprepared lawyers is the very definition of \nbeing a judge. As a lawyer, you owe it to the bench and to your clients \nto be as well prepared as you possibly can be.\n  When Justice Ginsburg was asked about these anonymous comments \nregarding Judge Sotomayor's temperament recently, she rhetorically \nasked: Has anybody watched Scalia or Breyer on the bench?\n  Surely, we have come to a time in this country when we can confirm as \nmany to-the-point, gruff female judges as we have confirmed to-the-\npoint, gruff male judges. We have come a long way, as you can see from \nmy colleagues who came here during the last hour.\n  We know that when Sandra Day O'Connor graduated from law school 50-\nplus years ago, the only offer she got was from a law firm for a \nposition as a legal secretary. Justice Ginsburg faced similar \nobstacles. We have come a long way.\n  But I hope my colleagues in this case will also come a long way and \nlook at the record and look at the facts. As I have said, people are \nentitled to their own opinions, but they are not entitled to their own \nfacts.\n  In short, I am proud to support Judge Sotomayor's nomination. I \nbelieve she will make an excellent Supreme Court Justice. She knows the \nlaw, she knows the Constitution, but she knows America too.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. I ask unanimous consent that the Republican time for the \nnext hour be allocated as follows: 15 minutes to myself, 15 minutes to \nSenator Martinez, 10 minutes to Senator Bond, and 20 minutes to Senator \nCornyn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I rise to express my thoughts on the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be a U.S. Supreme Court Justice.\n  Votes on Supreme Court nominees are among the most important cast by \na Senator. These nominations warrant a full and in-depth debate. We \nare, after all, considering a lifetime appointment to the highest Court \nin the land.\n  I will not spend much time this morning going through the impressive \nbackground of Judge Sotomayor because I think all Members agree that \nher experience and her academic credentials meet the threshold of what \nthe American people expect in a Supreme Court Justice.\n  As an alumnus of two of the most prestigious schools in the Nation \nwith a lengthy judicial record, Judge Sotomayor is certainly a quality \nnominee for the post. I am also sure she has inspired many throughout \nher noble career.\n  More important than the Ivy League schools and the length of public \nservice, however, is the judicial record of a nominee and the decisions \nshe has made during her tenure on the bench.\n  While many see a lengthy judicial record as something that could only \nbe considered a positive factor in determining a nominee's suitability \nto serve on the highest Court in the land, others, including myself and \nmany of my constituents, see it as an opportunity for a panoramic view \ninto the decisionmaking process of a nominee.\n  Just as I looked into the background and experience of Judge Roberts \nand Judge Alito, I did the same thing with Judge Sotomayor. With all \nthe years she has served on the Federal bench, she has plenty of case \nmaterial to examine and consider.\n  Among the most important factors in determining one's suitability for \nthe High Court is the nominee's understanding and appreciation for the \nrole they are about to take on. Other than having the ultimate say in \nthe judicial branch's analysis of the case at hand, the proverbial last \nword, it is no different than a judge's role on any lower court.\n  I believe a judge's role is to adhere to the longstanding case \nprecedent and to apply the law according to a strict interpretation of \nthe Constitution. Let me say that again because I believe it is too \nimportant to go unheard.\n  I believe a judge's role is to adhere to the longstanding case \nprecedent and apply the law according to the strict interpretation of \nthe U.S. Constitution.\n  That is my understanding of the judge's role in our country. Others \nmay have different views, and they certainly are entitled to them. As I \nhave said, I am troubled by her decisions in cases where she has \nappeared to rely on something other than well-settled law to come to a \ndecision. My fear is that she was unable to separate her personal \nbelief system from that of the letter of the law.\n  In our one-on-one meetings, Judge Sotomayor gave me her assurances \nthat she would stick to the letter of the law. Her judicial record \nindicates otherwise, particularly in a couple of very significant \nplaces and recent occurrences. While my colleagues have mentioned both \nof them prior to me stating them again, today I think they bear \nrepeating. Both cases highlight how Judge Sotomayor adheres to \napplicable case precedent.\n  First is the Ricci case. I think it is important to take a close look \nat her decision in Ricci v. DeStefano. This is a case where she \ndismissed the claims of 19 White firefighters and one Hispanic \nfirefighter who alleged reverse discrimination based on the New Haven, \nCT, decision not to use the results of a promotional exam because not \nenough minorities would be eligible for promotion. In the Ricci case, \nshe rejected the firefighters' claim in a one-paragraph opinion. When \nquestioned about it in the confirmation hearing, she maintained she was \nbound by precedent. A potentially and ultimately legal landmark case \nwarranting a careful and thorough review of the facts at hand and the \nlaw to be interpreted, and Judge Sotomayor dismissed the claim in one \nparagraph. Clearly, a case with issues involving race and \ndiscrimination deserved more than a one-paragraph explanation and \nanalysis.\n\n[[Page S8795]]\n\n  Even the Obama Justice Department could not defend her actions and \nsubmitted a brief to the Supreme Court on the matter. In it, they \nagreed that the decision by Judge Sotomayor should be vacated and that \nfurther proceedings on the case were warranted. This is the Justice \nDepartment of the Obama administration.\n  When the Supreme Court issued their opinion in the case, they stated \nthat the precedent relied on for her decision did not exist. When \npressed in the confirmation hearing about her decision, she avoided \nciting the particulars and simply explained that she was following \nestablished Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent. The most \ntroubling thing for me to grasp about this response is the Supreme \nCourt says, in their reversal of her decision, that precedent for Ricci \ndid not exist at all. It was a 5-to-4 decision by the Supreme Court, \nbut all nine Justices disagreed with her reasoning--a unanimous \nrejection of her argument by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said \nprecedent did not exist.\n  Maloney v. Cuomo, a second amendment case, is another decision of \nJudge Sotomayor that troubles my impression of her ability to separate \nher own beliefs from that of the letter of the law. It was just decided \nthis year--so recently, in fact, that it has not even had a chance to \nbe reviewed by the Supreme Court.\n  Not to rehash the facts of the case in too much detail, but in \nMaloney v. Cuomo, Judge Sotomayor was faced with determining whether an \nindividual right--in this case, the right to bear arms--could also be \nenforced against a State. She decided the Maloney case after the \nhistoric Heller decision specifically concluded, without any \nexplanation, that the right to bear arms is, in fact, not a fundamental \nright--a conclusion no other court has ever reached. As a matter of \nfact, I cosponsored an amicus brief which supported the argument that \nthe right to bear arms is a fundamental right and one that could not be \ntaken away by government without the highest standard of review. This \nwas the argument that ultimately favored the Supreme Court in their \ndecision.\n  To me, a nonlawyer, her decision in Maloney stands directly contrary \nto what the Supreme Court had just concluded in the Heller case. So not \nonly did the Supreme Court set the precedent, she ignored the precedent \nof Heller in the ruling of the Maloney case. How could Judge Sotomayor \nso distinctly and openly come to the conclusion that bearing arms was \nnot, in fact, a fundamental right when the Supreme Court, just months \nbefore, ruled the opposite way? Where did her reasoning come from? I am \ntroubled by the lack of deference and adherence to the High Court's \ndecision, and it leads me to call into question the commitment she made \nto me in a one-on-one meeting.\n  Actions, in this case--actually, decisions--speak much louder than \nrhetoric. These are just two recent, clear examples of where her record \nas a judge, while lengthy, caused me to call into question her ability \nto apply case precedent to come to a decision that would affect the \nlives of North Carolinians and the whole Nation.\n  These two decisions I have cited are not examples of missteps early \nin her career or decisions based on lack of experience. These are \ndecisions Judge Sotomayor made after 17 years of experience on the \nFederal bench. These are decisions made within the last year or so by a \nseasoned Federal judge who is being considered for a lifetime \nappointment to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  My esteemed colleague from North Carolina mentioned in her speech \nsupporting Judge Sotomayor that the late Senator Jesse Helms, who was a \ndear friend of mine, supported the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to be \na judge on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. What Senator Helms did \nnot have when he reviewed her nomination, however, was the benefit of \nJudge Sotomayor's judicial record during her decade of service on the \nappellate court.\n  It is imperative that all Members of the Senate look at the cases \njudges have decided and not just say they have been through the \nconfirmation process in the Senate, therefore it should be automatic \nthe second time. Their decisions weigh on the relevance of their \nnomination and on their confirmation.\n  I am sure her impressive academic and professional resume influenced \nSenator Helms, and I am sure he gave her the benefit of the doubt \nwithout any reason to question how she might rule on the bench. I have, \nand the Senate has, the benefit of reviewing Judge Sotomayor's actual \ndecisions as a circuit judge, in addition to her statements to the \nrecord. I have the benefit of seeing if she stuck to the letter of the \nlaw as she stated she would do in testimony when nominated for the \nappellate court in 1998. She has not stuck to the letter of the law.\n  In 1998, she said, in response to a question from the current ranking \nmember of the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       Sir, I do not believe we should bend the Constitution under \n     any circumstance. It says what it says. We should do honor to \n     it.\n\n  Quite frankly, I believe she bent the Constitution when she ruled in \nthe Maloney case that the right to bear arms was not a fundamental \nright of the American people.\n  I have repeatedly said that the decisions made by the Supreme Court \naffect the lives of every American. After taking into consideration \nJudge Sotomayor's answers to my questions, reviewing her decisions that \nappear to have departed from the normal principles of jurisprudence, I \nfind little predictability in her decisions and the implications they \nmight have. I am concerned by the several examples where I believe \nJudge Sotomayor strayed from the rules of strict statutory construction \nand legal precedence and went with her own deeply-held beliefs, while \nproviding little in the way of explanations. Therefore, I am unable to \nsupport her nomination to the Supreme Court.\n  I realize, at the conclusion of the next several days, Judge \nSotomayor has the votes to be a Justice. I will continue to watch the \ndecisions she makes based upon the answers she provided to me. But as \nmost, if not all, have stated, this is a lifetime appointment. The \ndebate that happens over the next 48 hours will determine, in many \ncases, whether a change might happen in this nomination. We cannot end \nthis debate without the realization that we will live for generations \nto come with the decisions of this Court, the next Court, and the next \nCourt. It will be just as incumbent on Members of the Senate in the \nfuture to make sure that those nominees are debated thoroughly, that \ntheir records are reviewed in great detail, and that their pledge to \nprotect the Constitution and to follow it as a Justice is upheld. My \nhope is that I am incorrect about how Judge Sotomayor will, in fact, \nuse the Constitution. Today, I announce that I will vote against her.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the nomination of \nJudge Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. I am happy to have this \nopportunity, for I view it as a historic moment in many ways.\n  The confirmation of a Supreme Court nominee is one of the most solemn \nand unique duties in our constitutional system of government. The \nFramers, recognizing the risk of abuse inherent in a lifetime judicial \nappointment, created a process that brings together all three branches \nof the Federal Government. The Constitution, article II, section 2, \nrequires that a nominee to the Federal court must be selected by the \nPresident and then ``with the advice and consent of the Senate.'' These \nmoments must be appreciated and approached with a great deal of \nthoughtfulness and respect. This is all the more true when the \nappointment is to our highest Court, the Supreme Court.\n  There was a time when Members of the Senate seemed to better \nunderstand their role, when Senators expected a President of the other \nparty to pick a judge who would likely be different from someone they \nwould have picked. There are a couple of examples I would like to use.\n  Justice Ginsburg, a very talented person who served as general \ncounsel to the ACLU, was not likely to have been someone selected by a \nRepublican President. But yet she was confirmed with 95 votes. \nRepublicans knew she would be a liberal Justice, but she was also well \nqualified for the job.\n  There is another example; that is, Justice Antonin Scalia. He was \npicked by a Republican President and received\n\n[[Page S8796]]\n\n98 votes. Every Democrat knew or probably should have known that they \nwere voting for a conservative, but they also understood that then-\nJudge Scalia was incredibly qualified and should be serving on the \nSupreme Court, given that he had been nominated by a President and had \nthe requisite qualifications, which is really the essence of what this \nconfirmation process is and should be about.\n  But things have changed since those votes. They have changed from \nwhat is historically acceptable and what has been the long historic \ntradition of the Senate when it comes to Senate confirmations of \njudicial nominees. Over the past decade, I believe the Senate has lost \nsight of its role to advise and consent.\n  I notice another example. The nominations of Miguel Estrada, Chief \nJustice Roberts, and Justice Alito--all three of these illustrate how \npartisan politics have been permitted to overwhelm the fundamental \nquestion posed to the Senate, which is, Is this nominee qualified? Do \nyou give your advice and your consent?\n  My colleagues will recall that Mr. Estrada was first nominated by \nPresident George W. Bush to the DC Circuit in May of 2001. He was \nunanimously rated ``well-qualified'' for the bench by the American Bar \nAssociation.\n  Mr. Estrada was someone who had a very impressive history and \npersonal story and resume. He was a native of Honduras. Mr. Estrada \nimmigrated to this country at age 17, graduated magna cum laude and Phi \nBeta Kappa from Columbia University. He received his law degree from \nHarvard in 1986, where he was a member of the Harvard Law Review, and \nwent on to clerk on the Supreme Court for Justice Kennedy.\n  Mr. Estrada then entered private practice and was a very well-\nrespected lawyer working in a New York law firm and served as an \nassistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York, where I \nbelieve our nominee also served. But then Mr. Estrada took a job in the \nGeorge H.W. Bush administration as an Assistant Solicitor General. What \ndoes an Assistant Solicitor General do? They prepare and argue cases \nbefore the Supreme Court. What could be a better training ground, in \naddition to having a prior clerkship for a Court member, than to be an \nAssistant Solicitor General? As a longtime attorney, I always admire \ngreatly those who have served in that office because they are the very \nbest of the very best.\n  But politics intervened. He was branded a conservative. Through the \ncourse of an unprecedented seven cloture votes, Democrats in this body \nfilibustered his nomination. Time and again, they filibustered his \nnomination. It lingered for 28 months, until he finally withdrew--\nexhausted, wanting to get on with his life, knowing he needed to be \nable to continue to do work for clients, that he could not continue to \nbe in this limbo where he had been for 28 months because of the \nmisguided notion that he was just too conservative and so it was OK to \nfilibuster him. For 28 months he was hanging, dangling in the wind. \nThat was not right. It was not to the Supreme Court, but some feared \nthat someday he might be a Supreme Court candidate, he might have been \nthe first Hispanic serving in the Supreme Court, nominated, perhaps, by \na Republican President.\n  So while the nominations of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito \nended quite differently from Mr. Estrada's, the record is, frankly, \nequally disturbing.\n  During the debates on both Roberts and Alito, then-Senator Barack \nObama declared each man to be qualified to sit on the Supreme Court. Of \nthen-Judge John Roberts, Senator Obama said, right here on the Senate \nfloor:\n\n       There is absolutely no doubt in my mind Judge Roberts is \n     qualified to sit on the highest court in the land.\n\n  To which I would then say: So why won't you vote for him?\n  He then said of then-Judge Alito:\n\n       I have no doubt that Judge Alito has the training and \n     qualifications necessary to serve. He's an intelligent man \n     and an accomplished jurist. And there's no indication he's \n     not a man of great character.\n\n  But despite these emphatic statements of confidence, then-Senator \nObama voted against confirmation. Why? Because of his perception that \ntheir philosophy would not allow him to vote for them.\n  Given this record, some of my colleagues conclude that what is good \nfor the goose is good for the gander; that because of these recent \nprecedents, and despite her qualifications, they may still vote against \nJudge Sotomayor's confirmation. I could not disagree more heartily.\n  It is my hope that starting today, we will no longer do what was done \nto Miguel Estrada; that beginning today, no Member will pursue a course \nand come to the floor of this Chamber to argue against the confirmation \nof a qualified nominee.\n  So what about our current nominee? What makes her qualified? Well, \nfirst, I think we do have in Judge Sotomayor a very historic moment, an \nopportunity. It will be the first Hispanic to serve on the highest \nCourt of this land. It is a momentous and historic opportunity.\n  But that is not good enough. What makes her qualified? Well, I think \nexperience, knowledge of the law, temperament, the ability to apply the \nlaw without bias--these qualifications should override all other \nconsiderations when the Senate fulfills its role to advise and consent \nto the President's nominee, as dictated by the constitutional charge we \nhave. These are really the standards by which we as a body should \ndetermine who is qualified to serve on any Federal court, including the \nhighest Court of the land. These are the standards I have used in \nevaluating Judge Sotomayor's nomination to the Supreme Court. She has \nthe experience. She knows the law. She has the proper temperament.\n  Here is something that is very important: Her 17-year judicial record \noverwhelmingly indicates she will apply the law without bias. That is \nvery important because we could find someone who really is facially \nqualified but whose views might be, for some reason, so outside the \nmainstream, so different from what the norm of our jurisprudence would \nbe, that it might render them, while facially qualified, truly \nunqualified--that they really could not be relied on to look at a case \nand apply the facts and the evidence and apply the law to the evidence \npresented, that they would not follow the law, that they would not be \nfaithful to their oath because their views would be so extreme, so \noutside the mainstream, so completely beyond what would be the norm or \nconsidered to be the norm. But here in this person we have a 17-year \nrecord. She has written thousands of opinions. These opinions provide \nthe body of law of what she does as a judge--not what she said to a \ngroup of students one day, trying to encourage them in their lives and \nwhat they might be doing, not what someone might gain from reading an \nopinion that perhaps they would not agree with. It is not about whether \nwe agree with her outcomes, it is whether her opinions were reasoned, \nwhether they had a foundation in law, whether they were reasonable \ndecisions, whether she reached them on the basis of law and evidence \nthat are supported by sound legal thinking. Her worst critics cannot \ncite a single instance where she strayed from sound judicial thinking.\n  I believe she will serve as an outstanding Associate Justice to the \nU.S. Supreme Court, and she will be a terrific role model for many \nyoung people in this country.\n  Were I to have had my opportunity to pick, I may have chosen someone \ndifferent than Judge Sotomayor. But that is not my job. I do not get to \nselect judges. I get to give advice and consent. We sometimes confuse \nthe role of the Senate. Elections have their consequences. Some of her \nwritings and her statements indicate that her philosophy might be more \nliberal than mine, but that is what happens in elections.\n  When I was campaigning for my colleague and dear friend John McCain, \nI knew it was going to be important because there would be vacancies to \nthe Court. I knew I would be much more comfortable with a nominee whom \nJohn McCain would nominate than one my former colleague and friend, \nPresident Barack Obama, might nominate. The President has the \nprerogative, the obligation, the responsibility to choose his own \nnominees. Our job is to give advice and consent.\n  The President has chosen a nominee, and my vote for her confirmation \nwill\n\n[[Page S8797]]\n\nbe based solely and wholly on relevant qualifications. Judge Sotomayor \nis well qualified. She has been a Federal judge for 17 years. She has \nthe most experience of any person--on-the-bench judicial experience of \nany person--nominated for the Court in a century. In 100 years, there \nhas not been anyone who has been on the bench with such a distinguished \nrecord for such a long period of time. That is why, by the way, her \nrecord is really her judicial decisions. We do not have to wonder. We \ndo not have to sit around and try to divine whether someday she will \nanswer the siren call to judicial activism, as I have heard someone say \non the floor of the Senate. You do not have to wonder. You can wonder, \nand it might give you an excuse to vote against someone who is \notherwise qualified, but the fact is, with a 17-year record, you should \nhave a pretty good idea whether that siren call would have been \nanswered by now. To my estimation, it has not been.\n\n  She received the highest possible rating from the American Bar \nAssociation for a judicial candidate--equal to that of Miguel Estrada, \nequal to that of Chief Justice Roberts, and equal to that of Justice \nAlito. She has been a prosecutor. She has been, throughout her career, \nan outstanding lawyer. As a prosecutor, she was a pretty tough one too. \nWith less than a handful of exceptions, her 17-year judicial record \nreflects that while she may be left of center, she is certainly well \nwithin the mainstream of legal thinking.\n  Her mainstream approach is so mainstream that it has earned her the \nsupport of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce as well as the endorsement of \nseveral law enforcement and criminal justice organizations. She has \nbeen endorsed by the National Fraternal Order of Police, the National \nSheriffs' Association, and the International Association of Chiefs of \nPolice. I daresay she will be a strong voice for law and order in our \ncountry.\n  I disagree with Judge Sotomayor about several issues. I would expect \nto have disagreements with many judicial nominees of the Obama \nadministration but probably fewer with her than some I might see in the \nfuture. Although I might disagree with some of her rulings, we know she \nhas a commitment to well-reasoned decisions--decisions that seek, with \nrestraint, to apply the law as written. I do believe she will rule with \nrestraint. That has been her judicial history and philosophy. For \ninstance, I believe her view as expressed in her panel's Maloney v. \nCuomo opinion of whether the second amendment applies against State and \nlocal governments is too narrow and contrary to the Founders' intent. \nBut I also know there is significant and well-reasoned disagreement \namong the Nation's appellate courts on this issue. In other words, it \nis not out of the mainstream. On this issue, I accept the idea that \nreasonable people may differ.\n  This debate raises critical and difficult issues regarding the role \nof federalism in the application of fundamental constitutional rights. \nBut the confirmation process is not the proper place to relitigate this \nquestion, nor is Judge Sotomayor's judicial record on this issue \noutside the mainstream.\n  I believe her statements on the role of international law in American \njurisprudence reflect a view that is too expansive. Yet her judicial \nrecord indicates that, in practice, she has given only limited, if any, \nweight to foreign court decisions. For example, in Croll v. Croll, a \n2000 international child custody case involving the Hague Convention on \nInternational Child Abduction, Judge Sotomayor wrote a dissenting \nopinion in which she concluded that the holdings of the courts of \nforeign nations interpreting the same convention were ``not essential'' \nto her reasoning.\n  I believe some of the statements she has made in her speeches about \nthe role of one's personal experience are inconsistent with the \njudicial oath's requirement that judges set aside their personal bias \nwhen making those decisions. There are several of my colleagues who say \nthese statements demonstrate that Judge Sotomayor is a judicial \nactivist in hiding. This assertion, however, is not supported by the \nfacts. We can throw it out there, but it is not supported by the facts. \nThe relevant facts--her 17-year judicial record--show she has not \nallowed her personal biases to influence her jurisprudence. They can \ntalk about her speeches, but they cannot talk about a single solitary \nopinion in 17 years on the bench where that type of a view has been \ngiven life, where that type of a view has found itself into the pages \nof a single one of her opinions. I would rather put my trust and my \nexpectations for the future on her 17-year record of judicial decisions \nthan I would on one or two speeches she might have given over 10 or 15 \nyears.\n  Those who oppose Judge Sotomayor have yet to produce any objective \nevidence that she has allowed her personal bias to influence her \njudicial decisionmaking. Moreover, in her testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee, she reiterated her fidelity to the law, that as a \nJustice she would adhere to the law regardless of the outcome it \nrequired.\n  So based on my review of her judicial record and her testimony before \nthe Judiciary Committee, I am satisfied Judge Sotomayor is well \nqualified to sit on our Nation's highest Court. I intend to vote for \nher confirmation. I intend to also be very proud of her service on the \nSupreme Court of the United States where I think, again, she will serve \na very historic and unique role to many people in this Nation who I \nknow will look to her with great pride.\n\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the nomination of \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  Few positions carry more honor, or solemn duty, than becoming a \nJustice of the highest court of the greatest democracy.\n  Also, few duties carry more honor, or solemn responsibility, than \ngiving advice and consent on who should become a Justice on the highest \nCourt of the greatest democracy.\n  The walls of that Supreme Court form the vessel that holds the great \nprotections of our liberty.\n  Those black robes give life to the Constitution's freedoms and the \nflourishing of our ideas and beliefs.\n  If the Congress is the heart of our democracy, walking to the \ndrumbeat of the people, then the Supreme Court is our soul guiding us \non what is right and what is wrong.\n  In my role as a Senator voting to fill that vessel, issuing those \nrobes, I have always looked to the Constitution to guide my obligation \nto give advice and consent.\n  It is an obligation separate and apart from my role as a legislator, \nwhen I vote for or against legislation before this body.\n  Indeed, if the Constitution meant for us merely to vote on nominees, \nby simple or super majorities, it could easily have said so.\n  If we were meant to do nothing more than cast a vote based on whether \nwe agreed or disagreed with a nominee, where would we be then?\n  Would the halls of government be empty every time a President faced a \nCongress of the opposite party?\n  Would the Cabinet sit empty because of partisan divide?\n  Would vacancies to the Supreme Court go unfilled, because a majority \nof one party simply disagreed with the President of another?\n  Of course, that could not have been the intent of the Framers.\n  What kind of Justices would we have, with nothing more than partisan \nmajority divides?\n  Would a Senate controlled by the opposite party allow only the most \nmoderate of voices, or justices with no voice at all?\n  Would it approve only judges that said nothing, or wrote nothing with \nwhich the majority disagreed?\n  If some are saying that a Democratic President should not have a \nliberal Justice, does that mean a Republican President should not have \nconservative Justices?\n  That is not something I could support, for I surely supported \njudicially conservative Justices such as Roberts and Alito, Thomas and \nBork--Scalia certainly if I had been in the Senate at the time.\n\n[[Page S8798]]\n\n  That is the kind of Justice I support, a judge that calls balls and \nstrikes like an umpire, not letting their own personal views bias the \noutcome of the trial.\n  The statue of justice is blindfolded for a reason, so that she cannot \ntip the scales of justice with the prejudice of bias or belief.\n  But I have supported Justices with whom I disagreed on this \nphilosophy. Justices Breyer and Ginsberg come to mind.\n  They take a more active role in shaping their decisions, to fit an \nideal of their own vision.\n  I supported these nominees of a Democratic President, as did 86 of my \ncolleagues for Justice Breyer, and 95 of my colleagues for Justice \nGinsberg.\n  I hope those votes do not reflect a time that has slipped away, when \npartisanship did not infect every facet of our political life.\n  I could forget that time, as President Obama did when he was a \nSenator.\n  I could easily say, as Senator Obama said, that I disagree with a \nnominee's judicial approach, and that allows me to oppose the nominee \nof a different party.\n  Luckily for President Obama, I do not agree with Senator Obama.\n  I reject the Obama approach to nominees.\n  While I reject the way Senator Obama approached nominations, that \ndoes not mean that I support the way Judge Sotomayor approaches \njudging.\n  I disagree that the civil rights of a firefighter mean so little that \nthey do not deserve even a full opinion before an appeals court.\n  I disagree that we should inspire with suggestions that wisdom has \nanything to do with the sex of a person or the color of their skin.\n  I disagree that judges should ever consider foreign law when looking \nfor meaning in U.S. statutes or the U.S. Constitution.\n  I disagree that the second amendment's protection of an individual's \nright to bear arms does not apply to States.\n  But I do agree that Judge Sotomayor has proven herself a well \nqualified jurist.\n  I do agree that she has proven herself as a talented and accomplished \nstudent, Federal prosecutor, corporate litigator, Federal trial judge, \nand Federal appeals court judge.\n  She has the backing of many in the law enforcement community \nincluding the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Sheriffs \nAssociation, and the National Association of District Attorneys.\n  I do agree that Judge Sotomayor has proven herself as a leader of her \ncommunity, who inspires the pride and hopes of a large and growing \nportion of our American melting pot.\n  I do agree that Judge Sotomayor has proven herself as a symbol of \nbreaking through glass ceilings.\n  And I do agree that my choice for President did not win the last \nelection, and that our people's democracy has spoken for the change and \nthey are getting it. Elections do have consequences.\n  Now, hearing the call of that decision of our democracy does not mean \nthat I support the President in everything he has proposed.\n  I did not agree with a stimulus that has meant only more government \nspending and national debt as the unemployment continues to rise.\n  I do not agree with cap and trade legislation that will raise energy \ntaxes and kill millions of lost jobs without even changing the climate \nbecause China and India refuse to act the same.\n  I do not agree with a government takeover of health care that forces \nmillions of Americans off their current health care, drives health care \ncosts even higher for families, rations care, restricts access to the \nlatest cures and treatments, and puts health care decisions in the \nhands of government bureaucrats rather than doctors and patients.\n  But I do agree that the country is tired of partisanship infecting \nevery debate. The country is tired of every action by the Congress \nbecoming a political battle.\n  And so, I will not follow the hypocrisy of many of my Democratic \ncolleagues who refused to support Justices Roberts and Alito because \nthey disagreed with their judicial philosophy and now suggest that \nRepublicans not do the same.\n  I respect and agree with the legal reasoning of my colleagues who \nwill vote no, but I will follow the direction of the past, and my hope \nfor the future, with less polarization, less confrontation, less \npartisanship.\n  My friends in the party can be assured that I will work as hard as \nanybody to ensure that the next Presidential election has consequences \nin the opposite direction.\n  For my conservative friends, the best way to ensure that we have \nconservative judges on the bench is work to see that we elect \nPresidents who will nominate them.\n  Then we can resume filling the bench with more judges like Justice \nRoberts.\n  For my liberal friends I hope they remember this day when another \nqualified nominee is before the Senate who is conservative. The \nstandard set by Senator Obama should not govern the Senate.\n  As for Judge Sotomayor, she has the accomplishments and qualities \nthat have always meant Senate confirmation for such a nomination.\n  The Senate has reviewed her nomination and has asked her its \nquestions. There have been no significant findings against her. There \nhas been no public uprising against her.\n  I do not believe the Constitution tells me I should refuse to support \nher merely because I disagree with her.\n  I will support her. I will be proud for her, the community she \nrepresents and the American dream she shows possible.\n  I will cast my vote in favor of the nomination of Judge Sotomayor, \nand I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I wish to address the nomination of Judge \nSonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court as \nwell. I have spoken about this nomination several times, both here on \nthe Senate floor and on the Senate Judiciary Committee on which I \nserve. I have shared what I admire about Judge Sotomayor, including her \nlong experience as a Federal judge, her academic background, which is \nstellar, and her record of making decisions that for the most part are \nwithin the judicial mainstream. I have also explained before why I will \nvote against this nomination and I wish to reiterate and expand on some \nof those comments here today as all of us are stating our intentions \nbefore this historic vote which I suspect will be held sometime \ntomorrow.\n  First, I cannot vote to confirm a nominee to the U.S. Supreme Court \nwho restricts several of the fundamental rights and liberties in our \nConstitution, including our Bill of Rights. Based on her decision in \nthe Maloney case, Judge Sotomayor apparently does not believe that the \nsecond amendment right to keep and bear arms is an individual right. \nIndeed, she held in that case that the second amendment did not apply \nto the States and local jurisdictions that might impose restrictions on \nthe right to keep and bear arms. Then based on her decision in the \nDidden v. The Village of Port Chester case, she apparently does not \nbelieve that the takings clause of the fifth amendment protects private \nproperty owners when that private property is taken by government for \nthe purpose of giving it to another private property owner, in this \ncase a private developer. I am very concerned when the government's \npower to condemn property for a private purpose conflicts with the \nstated intention of the Framers of the Constitution that the right of \ncondemnation of private property only extend to public uses and then, \nand only then, when just compensation is paid.\n  Then based upon her decision in the Ricci case--this is the New Haven \nfirefighter case--which calls into question her commitment to ensure \nthat equal treatment applies to all of us when it comes to our jobs or \npromotions without regard to the color of our skin. Indeed, in that \ncase, because of her failure to even acknowledge the seriousness and \nnovelty of the claims being made by the New Haven firefighters, she \ngave short shrift to those claims in an unpublished order and denied \nFrank Ricci, Ben Vargas, and other New Haven firefighters an \nopportunity for a promotion, even though they excelled in a \ncompetitive, race-neutral examination, because of the color of their \nskin.\n  Fortunately, the Supreme Court of the United States saw fit to \noverrule\n\n[[Page S8799]]\n\nJudge Sotomayor's judgment in the New Haven firefighter case. Millions \nof Americans became aware, perhaps for the first time, of this \nnotorious decision and what a morass some of our laws have created \nwhen, in fact, distinguished judges like Judge Sotomayor think they \nhave no choice but to allow people to be denied a promotion based upon \nthe color of their skin for fear of a disparate impact lawsuit, even \nwhen substantial evidence is missing that such a disparate lawsuit \nwould have merit or likely be successful.\n  I cannot vote to confirm a nominee who has publicly expressed support \nfor many of the most radical legal theories percolating in the faculty \nlounges of our Nation's law schools.\n  We heard this during the confirmation hearings and, frankly, Judge \nSotomayor's explanations were unconvincing. Previously, she said there \nis no such thing as neutrality or objectivity in the law--merely a \nseries of perspectives, thus, I think undermining the very concept of \nequal justice under the law. If the law is not neutral, if it is not \nobjective, then apparently, according to her, at least at that time, \nthe law is purely subjective, and outcomes will be determined on which \njudge you get rather than what the law says.\n  She has said in one notorious YouTube video that it is the role of \njudges to make policy on the court of appeals. She has said that \nforeign law can get the ``creative juices flowing'' as judges interpret \nthe U.S. Constitution, and she has said, as we know, ethnicity and \ngender can influence a judge's decision and judges of a particular \nethnicity or gender can actually make better decisions than individuals \nof a different gender or ethnicity.\n  Third, I cannot vote to confirm a judicial nominee who testified \nbefore the Judiciary Committee that her most controversial decisions \nwere guided by precedent, when her colleagues on the Second Circuit, \nand indeed the Justices of the U.S. Supreme Court who reversed her, \nsaid just the opposite; or who testified that she meant the exact \nopposite of what she said--every time she said something controversial \nand was trying to explain that; or a person who testified that she had \nno idea what legal positions the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and \nEducation Fund was taking--even when she chaired the litigation \ncommittee of its board of directors.\n  The hearings before the Senate Judiciary Committee have a very \nimportant purpose, and that purpose is informed by article II of the \nU.S. Constitution that provides for advice and consent on nominations. \nIt is not to serve as a rubberstamp. I have heard colleagues say that \nelections have consequences, and the President won. Well, it is obvious \nand evident that elections have consequences and that President Obama \nwon. But that doesn't negate or erase the obligation each Senator has \nunder the same clause and article of the Constitution to provide advice \nand consent based on our best judgment and good conscience.\n  In the case of Judge Sotomayor, the question becomes: What will she \ndo with the immense power given to a member of the U.S. Supreme Court? \nWhat impact will she have on our rights and liberties over the course \nof a lifetime? Of course, this appointment is for life. In short, the \nquestion is, what kind of Justice will she be on the Supreme Court, \nwhere her decisions are no longer reviewed by a higher court as they \nwere as a Federal district court or a court of appeals justice. The \nquestion is, will she be the judge she has been as a lower court judge, \nmaking decisions which, by and large, have been in the mainstream, with \nsome notable exceptions, which I have talked about, or will she be \nuntethered? Will she be the Judge Sotomayor of some of her radical \nspeeches and writings, which cause me concern?\n  The answers to these questions, I regret, are no clearer after the \nhearings than before. The stakes are simply too high for me to confirm \nsomeone who could redefine ``the law of the land'' from a liberal, \nactivist perspective.\n  I respect different views of Senators on this nomination, and I have \nno doubt that Judge Sotomayor will be confirmed. But I am unwilling to \nabdicate the responsibility I believe I have as a Senator when it comes \nto voting my conscience and expressing my reservations. The Senate \ndeveloped our confirmation process for a very important purpose: to \nlearn more about the individual nominees. But over the last several \nweeks, I think we have also learned more about a rising consensus with \nregard to what we should expect from a judge. I will highlight two \nimportant lessons we have learned.\n  One is encouraging to me and one is worrisome. Let's start with the \ngood news. I believe Republicans and Democrats on the Judiciary \nCommittee, and indeed Judge Sotomayor herself, seem to say the \nappropriate judicial philosophy for nominees to the Federal bench is \none that expresses fidelity to the law and nothing else. Over years, we \nhave been debating whether we have an original understanding of the \nConstitution or some evolving Constitution, even though it can be \ninterpreted in different ways, even though the words on the paper read \nexactly the same. We went back and forth on the merits, or lack of \nmerits, of judicial activism--judges taking it upon themselves to \nimpose their views rather than the law in decisions. On many occasions, \nour disagreements over judicial philosophy were anything but civil and \ndignified.\n  I think of the nomination of Miguel Estrada to the District of \nColumbia Court of Appeals, which some have said is the second highest \ncourt in the land. Miguel Estrada, although an immigrant from Honduras \nwho didn't speak any English when he came to the United States, \ngraduated from a top university and law school in this country. He was \nfilibustered seven times an denied an up-or-down vote. One member of \nthe Judiciary Committee, disparaging Mr. Estrada's character, called \nhim a ``stealth missile, with a nose cone, coming out of the right \nwing's deepest silo.''\n  Samuel Alito, an Italian-American who is proud of his heritage, had \nto defend himself against false charges of bigotry--accusations that \nleft his wife in tears.\n  Then there was Clarence Thomas--perhaps the one we remember the \nbest--an African American nominee to the Supreme Court who described \nhis experience before the Judiciary Committee this way:\n\n       This is a circus. It's a national disgrace. And from my \n     standpoint as a black American, it is a high-tech lynching \n     for uppity blacks.\n\n  These nominees were accused at various times of certain offenses, \neven though the real crime, as we all know, was a crime of conscience. \nThey dared to be judicial conservatives--a philosophy that the nominee \nwe are talking about today and Senate Democrats now appear to embrace.\n  I hope the days of the unfair and uncivil and undignified Judiciary \nCommittee hearings are behind us. I hope our hearings are more \nrespectful of the nominees, as was this hearing for Judge Sotomayor. \nShe herself proclaimed that she could not have received fairer \ntreatment. I appreciated her acknowledging the fairness and dignity of \nthe process.\n  I hope the ``thought crimes'' of yesterday have now become the \nfoundation for a new bipartisan consensus, including the views that \nJudge Sotomayor affirmed at her hearing and that we affirmed as both \nRepublicans and Democrats, and the views that Judge Sotomayor rejected \nat her hearings and we rejected as both Republicans and Democrats.\n  Let me give a few examples of our new bipartisan consensus on the \nappropriate judicial philosophy for a nominee to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Judge Sotomayor, at her hearing, put it this way:\n\n       The intent of the Founders was set forth in the \n     Constitution. . . . It is their words that [are] the most \n     important aspect of judging. You follow what they said in \n     their words, and you apply it to the facts you're looking at.\n\n  I cannot think of a better expression of a modest and judicially \nrestrained philosophy that I embrace than what Judge Sotomayor said at \nher hearing. Both Republicans and Democrats appeared to be pleased with \nthat statement.\n  We agreed that foreign law has no place in constitutional \ninterpretation. Notwithstanding her earlier statements, Judge Sotomayor \nsaid at the hearing:\n\n       Foreign law cannot be used as a holding or a precedent, or \n     to bind or influence the outcome of a legal decision \n     interpreting the Constitution or American law.\n\n\n[[Page S8800]]\n\n\n  As I said, notwithstanding her earlier statements, I agree with that \nstatement she made at the hearing. I believe both Republicans and \nDemocrats were satisfied with that statement as well.\n  We agreed that ``empathy'' or ``what's in a person's heart''--to \nborrow a phrase from then-Senator Obama--should not influence the \ndecisions of a judge. I think we were all a little surprised when Judge \nSotomayor, at the hearing, rejected President Obama's standard. She \nsaid:\n\n       I wouldn't approach the issue of judging the way the \n     President does. . . . Judges can't rely on what's in their \n     heart. They don't determine the law. Congress makes the law. \n     The job of a judge is to apply the law. And so it's not the \n     heart that compels conclusions in cases--it is the law.\n\n  I agree with that statement, and indeed Republicans and Democrats \nalike appeared to embrace that statement of an appropriate judicial \nphilosophy. No one defended the statement that then-Senator Obama made \nwith regard to empathy or what is in a person's heart. I was encouraged \nto see that.\n  Mr. President, supporters of Judge Sotomayor appear willing to accept \nher statements that I have just quoted at the Judiciary Committee at \nface value. I hope they are right; I really do. I certainly intend to \ntake my colleagues' agreement with these statements at face value. I \nexpect future nominees to the Federal judiciary to conform to this new \nconsensus articulated by Judge Sotomayor at her hearing and embraced in \na bipartisan fashion by the members of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. President, I have no question about the outcome of this vote on \nJudge Sotomayor. I regret, for the reasons I have stated, that I cannot \nvote for her because I cannot reconcile her previous statements with \nher testimony at the Judiciary Committee hearing. Also, I wish Judge \nSotomayor well as she serves on the Supreme Court. The concerns that I \nraised here, and the uncertainty I have about regarding what kind of \nJustice she will be--I hope she will prove those concerns unjustified \nby the way she distinguishes herself as a member of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. I hope her tenure will strengthen the Court, as well as its \nfidelity to the plain meaning of the Constitution. I congratulate her \nand her loved ones on her historic achievement.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the hour of \nDemocratic speaking time be divided 30 minutes under my control, 15 \nminutes for Senator Lautenberg, and 15 minutes for Senator Dodd.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to comment \nabout the confirmation of Judge Sotomayor for Associate Justice to the \nSupreme Court and to comment on other subjects directly related to the \nconfirmation process and comment about the reality of judicial \nlegislation, about the emerging standard on rejecting the tradition of \ndeference to the President, with Senators' ideology being the \ndeterminant, the Court's reduced workload, the failure to decide major \ncases, the lack of public understanding of what the Court does, the \nneed for accountability and transparency, and the strong case to be \nmade for televising the Supreme Court.\n  For me, the confirmation of Judge Sotomayor is an easy one. During \nthe 11 confirmation proceedings I have participated in and others I \nhave studied, I know of no one who brings a stronger record than Judge \nSotomayor: summa cum laude at Princeton, Yale Law School, Yale Law \nJournal, prestigious New York firm, assistant district attorney with DA \nMorganthau who sings her praises, 17 years on the Federal bench.\n  The criticisms which were made against her, my judgment is they were \nvacuous. A great deal of time in committee was spent on her comment \nabout ``a wise Latina woman.'' My view is that she should have been \ncommended for that statement, not criticized. Why do I say ``commend''? \nWhy shouldn't a woman stand up for women's capabilities? In a society \nwhich did not grant women the right to vote until 1920, in a society \nwhich still harbors the tough glass ceiling limiting women, in a \nsociety where only two women have served on the Supreme Court, in a \nSenate where only 17 of the 100 Senators are women, I would expect a \nwoman to proudly speak up for women's competency.\n  To talk about being a Latino, well, what is wrong with a little \nethnic pride? And isn't it about time that we had some greater \ndiversity on the Supreme Court? Isn't it surprising, if not scandalous, \nthat it took until 1967 to have an African American on the Court, \nThurgood Marshall, and it took until 1981 to have the first woman on \nthe Court, Sandra Day O'Connor?\n  Judge Sotomayor is a role model and will be a broader role model if \nconfirmed. The conventional wisdom is that she will be confirmed. Isn't \nthere a greater assurance in a society as diverse as ours to have \nsomeone on the Court to represent that kind of diversity, all within \nthe rule of law?\n  A criticism was made of her with respect to the New Haven \nfirefighters case--very complex, very subtle, very nuanced on disparate \nimpact. The Supreme Court divided 5 to 4. So what is there to criticize \non Judge Sotomayor's standing for joining a per curiam opinion?\n  I asked a question of the New Haven firefighters who appeared: Do you \nhave any reason to believe that Judge Sotomayor operated in anything \nbut good faith? Both of the young firefighters candidly said they had \nno opinion on that subject.\n  Then there is the criticism about her conclusion, her judgment that \nsecond amendment rights are not incorporated within the 14th amendment \ndue process clause to be applied to the States. That is the precedent \nof the Supreme Court of the United States. It is not up to a certain \ncourt to rule differently when they are bound by the Supreme Court, \neven if it is an old case.\n  The distinguished seventh circuit agreed with Judge Sotomayor. The \nargument was made well. The ninth circuit has said second amendment \nrights are applicable to the States.\n  Since the hearing, the court en banc in the ninth circuit has granted \nreview of a decision by the three-judge panel with every indication \nthat the three-judge panel in the ninth circuit will be reversed.\n  So when you add up all of the comments and all of the criticism, \nnothing, in my judgment, is left standing.\n  The issue of judicial legislation is one which occupied the thinking \nand consideration of a number of those who were opposed to Judge \nSotomayor. But there is nothing in her record to suggest she will \nengage in judicial legislation.\n  When you take a look at the Supreme Court of the United States, that \nhas become the rule of the era, as opposed to rule of law where the \nCourt is supposed to interpret the Constitution and statutes and leave \nto the Congress and the State legislatures the job of establishing \npublic policy.\n  During the era of the Warren Court, there was a vast expansion of \nconstitutional rights. I was in the Philadelphia district attorney's \noffice at the time and literally saw the Constitution change day by \nday. In 1961, Mapp v. Ohio came down applying the fourth amendment \nprotection on search and seizure to the States. In 1963, Gideon v. \nWainwright, right to counsel; 1964, Escobedo v. Illinois; 1966, \nMiranda. Those were constitutional rights and changing values as \narticulated by Justice Cardozo in Palko.\n  But in more recent times, there has been a vast expansion of the \nSupreme Court, in effect, legislating. I refer specifically to the case \nUnited States v. Morrison which involved the issue of the legislation \nprotecting women against violence. Chief Justice Rehnquist handed down \nan opinion saying that the ``method of reasoning'' of the Congress was \ndeficient. The dissents on that 5-to-4 opinion laid out the vast record \nwhich supported the legislation.\n  The Supreme Court has adopted a standard of judging constitutionality \nas to whether the statute satisfies congruence and proportionality, a \nstandard which has emerged very recently. It defies understanding to \nquantify or\n\n[[Page S8801]]\n\nfigure out what congruence and proportionality means, except to give \nthe Supreme Court carte blanche, in effect, to legislate.\n  Two cases interpreting the Americans with Disabilities Act went 5 to \n4 in opposite directions between Titles I and II--one case holding one \nof them constitutional and the other was unconstitutional. Justice \nScalia, dissenting in one case, characterized congruence and \nproportionality to be a flabby standard which, in effect, allowed the \nCourt to legislate.\n  When Chief Justice Roberts appeared before the Judiciary Committee in \nresponse to questions from Senator DeWine and myself, he said it was up \nto the Congress to make findings of fact, that that was a peculiarly \nlegislative function because it is the Congress which has the hearings, \nthe ability to develop facts, and it is congressional responsibility.\n  Yet when the Voting Rights Act case was heard earlier this year, \nalthough decided on narrower grounds, every indication is being given \nthat Chief Justice Roberts' assurances to the Judiciary Committee are \nbeing reversed and that the Court, from all indicators, is on the verge \nof declaring the Voting Rights Act as unconstitutional, notwithstanding \nthe voluminous record which was created and the great care the Senate \noperated to come down with the voting rights legislation.\n  So when you have a criticism of the problem of judicial legislation, \nit is my view that you ought to look at what Judge Sotomayor has done \nin 17 years on the bench. And there is no indication at all of her \nsubstituting her values. But when you come to the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States, there is good reason to question what they are doing.\n  There is, simply stated, a lack of understanding as to what goes on \nin the Court.\n  The one comment I do have, other than full support for Judge \nSotomayor, was her reluctance to answer questions. One question which I \nasked her is illustrative. Chief Justice Roberts, in his confirmation \nhearing, when confronted with the light workload of the Court, said \nthat he thought the Court could take on more responsibility. I asked \nJudge Sotomayor if she agreed with that conclusion. Judge Sotomayor \nwould not answer the question. She said she would have to be more fully \nfamiliarized, even though the statistics which I quoted to her about \nthe Court's workload contrasted with 1886 when the Supreme Court \ndecided 451 cases; in 1985, there were only 161 written opinions; in \n2007, only 67 written opinions.\n  It seemed to me plain that the Court could undertake more work, as \nChief Justice Roberts had agreed, during his confirmation hearings. But \nthere has developed an attitude among nominees who appear before the \nJudiciary Committee that it is unsafe to answer questions because of \nwhat happened to Judge Bork.\n  As I have pointed out in committee, and it is worth repeating, it is \na myth that Judge Bork was defeated because he answered too many \nquestions. In the context of his writings and in the context of his \nrecord where he advocated original intent, it was necessary for Judge \nBork to speak up. Judge Bork was rejected because he had a view of the \nConstitution which was totally outside the constitutional continuum or \noutside the constitutional mainstream.\n  For example, in his testimony, he said that the equal protection \nclause applied only to race and ethnicity, but would not be extended to \nwomen, aliens, indigents, illegitimates, or others, in line with the \ndecisions of the Supreme Court of solid precedents on the application \nof the equal protection clause. Judge Bork disagreed with the clear and \npresent danger standard, established as far back as Justice Oliver \nWendell Holmes.\n\n  When it came to his doctrine on original intent, he was at a loss to \nexplain how you could desegregate the District of Columbia schools. On \nthe same day that Brown v. Board of Education was decided, there was a \ncompanion case captioned Bolling v. Sharpe applicable to the District \nof Columbia. Judge Bork was of the view that there was no application \nof the due process clause; that you couldn't incorporate any of the 10 \namendments and you couldn't incorporate the equal protection clause. \nBut the Supreme Court desegregated the DC schools on the basis of \nholding that the equal protection clause was part of due process and \ndue process did apply to the District of Columbia. Judge Bork was at a \nloss to answer that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of an op-ed I wrote for the New York Times, dated October 9, \n1987, which sets forth in some greater detail--which I do not have the \ntime to go into now--the reasons why I voted against Judge Bork and I \nthink the reasons why Judge Bork's nomination was defeated by the \nmargin of 58 to 42 when it came before the Senate for a vote.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 9, 1987]\n\n                        Why I Voted Against Bork\n\n                           (By Arlen Specter)\n\n       From the day in mid-July when Judge Robert H. Bork stopped \n     by for a courtesy call until I telephoned him last week to \n     say I would oppose his nomination, my goal was to figure out \n     what impact Judge Bork would have on the people who came to \n     the Supreme Court in search of their constitutional rights. \n     At the end, having come to like and respect Judge Bork, I \n     reluctantly decided to vote against him, because I had \n     substantial doubts about what he would do with fundamental \n     minority rights, about equal protection of the law and \n     freedom of speech.\n       From the beginning, it was evident that this nomination \n     process would be different from most. The traditional \n     courtesy call turned out to be much more because Judge Bork \n     was willing--really anxious--to discuss his judicial \n     philosophy. Unlike other nominees who had barely given name, \n     rank and serial number, he enjoyed the exchange and doubtless \n     figured that his extensive writings were so unusual that he \n     would have to talk if he were to have any chance at \n     confirmation.\n       Our first hour and a half meeting was interrupted by a \n     Senate vote, so he returned a few weeks later for a similar \n     session. In those discussions, I found a man of intellect and \n     charm, who said, in essence, that his writings were academic \n     and professorial and not necessarily indicative of what he \n     would do on the Court.\n       During the August recess, when I had a chance to read many \n     of his approximately 80 speeches, 30 law review articles and \n     145 circuit court opinions, I found a scholar and jurist \n     whose views and opinions were vast and complex. In voting to \n     confirm Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice \n     Antonin Scalia last year, I had already decided that a \n     nominee's judicial philosophy need not agree with mine. But I \n     also believed that a nominee's views should be within the \n     tradition of our constitutional jurisprudence. With that in \n     mind, I compared Judge Bork's views with those of other \n     conservative justices.\n       On freedom of speech, I was surprised to find that Judge \n     Bork in his writings rejected Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes's \n     standard of a ``clear and present danger,'' Chief Justice \n     Warren Burger's notion of constitutional protection for \n     commercial speech and Justice (now Chief Justice) Rehnquist's \n     Court opinion protecting a sexually explicit (as \n     distinguished from an obscene) movie from censorship.\n       In Judge Bork's earliest views, only political speech was \n     to be protected. He later modified that to include literature \n     and art that involved political discussion. In the \n     confirmation hearings, I was even more surprised to find him \n     change his position and commit himself to apply the Holmes \n     test even though he continued his strong philosophical \n     disagreement.\n       Judge Bork's views on equal protection of the law also \n     underwent a major change at the hearings. He committed \n     himself to apply current case law after having long insisted \n     that equal protection applied only to race and, more \n     recently, to ethnicity. His narrow position had put him at \n     odds with Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices Sandra Day \n     O'Connor and Scalia, as well as 101 years of Supreme Court \n     decisions that had applied equal protection to women, aliens, \n     indigents, illegitimates and others.\n       These significant shifts raised questions about Judge \n     Bork's motives and the depth of his convictions. But I felt \n     he should have a full opportunity to explain his new \n     positions because a person is entitled to change.\n       During a long Saturday session, I had an unusual \n     opportunity to explore at length some troubling aspects of \n     Judge Bork's jurisprudence. I was particularly concerned with \n     his writings on ''original intent.'' He had maintained that \n     judges had to base their opinions on the Framers' original \n     intentions. Without adherence to original intent, he said, \n     there was no legitimacy for judicial decisions. And without \n     such legitimacy, there could be no judicial review.\n       But Judge Bork conceded during the hearings that original \n     intent was often difficult, perhaps impossible, to discern. I \n     feared that this approach could jeopardize the fundamental \n     principle of constitutional law--the supremacy of judicial \n     review. Although Judge Bork himself never went so far, some \n     prominent political figures have suggested that the Supreme \n     Court should not be the ultimate arbiter of \n     constitutionality. Their\n\n[[Page S8802]]\n\n     cause--with which I deeply disagree--could be aided by a \n     Justice who questioned the legitimacy of judicial review.\n       I had also been concerned by Judge Bork's insistence on \n     ``Madisonian majoritarianism,'' the idea that, in the absence \n     of explicit constitutional limits, legislatures should be \n     free to act as they please. Conservative justices had \n     traditionally protected individual and minority rights even \n     without a specifically enumerated right or proof of original \n     intent where there were fundamental values rooted in the \n     tradition of our people.\n       Just this year, for example, Chief Justice Rehnquist and \n     Justices O'Connor and Scalia had found a right in the \n     Constitution for a prisoner to marry. But Judge Bork, at his \n     confirmation hearing, could still find no acceptable \n     rationale for the decision desegregating the District of \n     Columbia schools 33 years ago.\n       I was further troubled by his writings and testimony that \n     expanding rights to minorities reduced the rights of \n     majorities. While perhaps arithmetically sound, it seemed \n     morally wrong. The majority in a democracy can take care of \n     itself, while individuals and minorities often cannot. \n     Moreover, our history has demonstrated that the majority \n     benefits when equality helps minorities become a part of the \n     majority.\n       Despite these concerns, I was genuinely undecided--perhaps \n     leaning a little toward Judge Bork--when he finished his \n     impressive testimony at the end of the first week. He had \n     conceded that there was a ``powerful argument from a strong \n     tradition'' to find rights rooted in the conscience of the \n     people, although not specified in the Constitution. He had \n     also yielded to the ``needs of the nation'' on some \n     constitutional matters that did not fall within the Framers' \n     original intent. Perhaps his writings were only professorial \n     theorizing.\n       As I listened to the other witnesses during the second and \n     third weeks, and considered the implications of Judge Bork's \n     total approach, my doubts grew about the application of his \n     changed positions. For example, in Judge Bork's former view, \n     which he last expressed 20 days before his nomination, equal \n     protection should have been kept to concerns like race and \n     ethnicity. Considering the many subtle and discretionary \n     judgments involved, I felt it would be unfair to people who \n     sought equal protection in the Supreme Court to have their \n     cases decided by someone who had so long thought their claims \n     unprotected by the Constitution under standards that were so \n     elusive to apply.\n       Similarly, the hearings showed the great difficulty, if not \n     impossibility, of Judge Bork's applying the ``clear and \n     present danger'' standard to free speech cases. If there was \n     a critical turning point, it was Judge Bork's responses \n     regarding two cases.\n       The ``clear and present danger'' standard was restated by \n     the Court in 1969, in Brandenburg v. Ohio, and again in 1973, \n     in Hess v. Indiana. When Judge Bork committed himself to \n     accepting Brandenburg, I pressed as to how we could be \n     confident that he would apply that test to the next case, \n     which obviously would be different on the facts. He promised \n     he would, but then promptly insisted that he was not \n     committed to Hess because it was an ``obscenity'' case.\n       Judge Bork's disagreement on Hess, a ``clear and present \n     danger'' case, cast substantial doubt on his ability to apply \n     cases he philosophically opposed and had long decried.\n       The hearings brought a record 140,000 calls and letters to \n     my office. Wherever I went, it seemed that everyone had a \n     strong opinion. The pressure was pervasive. On the afternoon \n     the hearings ended, I talked again with Judge Bork for more \n     than an hour, and met later that evening with Lloyd Cutler, \n     the former adviser to Jimmy Carter, who had been a principal \n     supporter. My substantial doubts persisted, so I decided to \n     vote no.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Moving on to another subject, which perhaps is of the \ngreatest importance of what we see emerging from these hearings and the \nconfirmation proceeding, is an emerging standard on rejecting the \ntraditional deference to the President, with Senators substituting \ntheir own ideology in order to make the decision.\n  In the article I referred to on Bork, in the op-ed piece, I noted \nthat in voting as to Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia, I \ndecided the judicial philosophy of a nominee need not agree with mine. \nWhen the hearings came up as to Justice Clarence Thomas, I made the \nobservation that there might be an occasion, one day, when there would \nbe a partnership between the Senate and the President with respect to \nlooking at ideology. It has become accepted that elections do matter \nwhen the President moves to the nominating process. They are active \nparts in the Presidential campaigns, and the tradition has been to make \nthe deference to the President's ideology.\n  I suggest we are seeing, in the confirmation process of Judge \nSotomayor, in conjunction with the nomination process of Justice Alito, \nthat there is a shift in that standard and that judgment. The issue was \nframed by the comments of then-Senator Barack Obama now President \nBarack Obama when he was commenting about his judgment on the Alito \nnomination and then Senator Obama had this to say:\n\n       There are some who believe that the President, having won \n     an election, should have complete authority to appoint his \n     nominee and the Senate should only examine whether the \n     Justice is intellectually capable.\n\n  Senator Obama went on to say:\n\n       I disagree with this view. I believe it calls for \n     meaningful advice and consent, and that includes an \n     examination of the judge's philosophy, ideology.\n\n  In the Alito hearings, there is no doubt that in terms of academic, \nprofessional, and judicial competence, Justice Alito was well \nqualified--a Yale law graduate with a distinguished career in private \npractice, serving as a U.S. attorney for New Jersey, with 15 years on \nthe circuit court. Some concerns were expressed as to his ideology on \nhis view of a woman's right to choose; his dissenting opinion in \nPlanned Parenthood v. Casey in the Third Circuit. Only four Democrats \ncrossed the aisle to vote for Justice Alito. Today, according to the \nannouncements that have been made, about that many Republicans are \ngoing to cross the aisle to vote for Judge Sotomayor.\n  Some of those who have announced their intention to vote against \nJudge Sotomayor have long records for not having opposed any judicial \nnominee. It is a complex issue. There is a question of pressure from \nthe far right, from those who might be looking at primary opposition. \nThere is a question of partisanship, which has gripped this body with \nsuch intensity. But there is an overwhelming view that the approach of \nJudge Sotomayor and what she is likely to do on the Supreme Court is \nsomething which is contrary to their views as to when the matters ought \nto be decided.\n  It has long been accepted that you can't ask a Supreme Court nominee \nhow he or she will decide a specific case, but there is an opportunity \nto glean from many factors the disposition or inclination of the \nnominees. And although many in this body had, for a long time, as I \nview it, made decisions based upon their own ideology, contrasted to \nwhat they accepted the nominee to do on the Court, I think that view \nhas become crystallized and, as articulated by then-Senator Obama, is a \nview which has perhaps added weight now that it is President Obama.\n  Certainly, there are nominees whom I have voted for, if I were to \nhave been the President and made the selection, it would have been \ndifferent. If I were to have applied my own philosophy or ideology on \nthe vote to confirm or not, it would have been different. When Judge \nBork was so far out of the mainstream and had views so totally \nantithetical to the continuum of constitutional law--being out of the \nmainstream--it was different. But I think it is worth noting what is \nhappening to the confirmation process, as Senators are moving to \nutilize their own ideology in deciding how to vote--illustrated, as I \nsay, by Alito and the confirmation which we currently have--and not \ngiving the traditional and customary deference to the President.\n  Moving on to the subject of the Court's reduced workload and the \nfailure to decide major cases, in the context of the statistics which I \ncited--451 cases decided in 1886, 161 written opinions in 1985; the \nyear 2007, only 67 signed opinions; the Supreme Court having decided \nnot to hear the case involving the terrorist surveillance program, \nwhich posed a dramatic conflict between congressional authority under \narticle I to enact the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, with the \nPresident's asserted authority under article II as Commander in Chief \nto have warrantless wiretaps; the district court in Detroit declared \nthe terrorist surveillance program unconstitutional. The Sixth Circuit \nreversed 2 to 1 on the grounds of standing--with the dissent being much \nbetter reasoned--a doctrine to avoid deciding the case and the Supreme \nCourt denying cert. Similarly, on the conflict which was posed by \nlitigation brought by the survivors of victims of 9/11 against Saudi \nArabian princes, where the Congress had legislated in the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act to exclude torts, as when you fly an airplane \ninto the World Trade Center, the executive branch intervened. The \nDepartment of State objected through the Solicitor General to\n\n[[Page S8803]]\n\nthe court hearing the case, and that case was not decided. Many circuit \nsplits, which are detailed in a series of letters which I am going to \nask to be admitted into the Record, letters which I sent to Judge \nSotomayor, dated July 7, June 15, and June 25, detailing a great many \ncircuit splits which the Court has not decided.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record the letters I \nreferred to.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 2009.\n     Hon. Sonia Sotomayor,\n     c/o The Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judge Sotomayor: As noted in my letters of June 15 and \n     June 25, I am writing to alert you to subjects which I intend \n     to cover at your hearing. During our courtesy meeting you \n     noted your appreciation of this advance notice. This is the \n     third and final letter in this series.\n       The decisions by the Supreme Court not to hear cases may be \n     more important than the decisions actually deciding cases. \n     There are certainly more of them. They are hidden in single \n     sentence denials with no indication of what they involve or \n     why they are rejected. In some high profile cases, it is \n     apparent that there is good reason to challenge the Court's \n     refusal to decide.\n       The rejection of significant cases occurs at the same time \n     the Court's caseload has dramatically decreased, the number \n     of law clerks has quadrupled, and justices are observed \n     lecturing around the world during the traditional three-month \n     break from the end of June until the first Monday in October \n     while other Federal employees work 11 months a year.\n       During his Senate confirmation hearing, Chief Justice John \n     G. Roberts, Jr., said the Court ``could contribute more to \n     the clarity and uniformity of the law by taking more cases.'' \n     The number of cases decided by the Supreme Court in the 19th \n     century shows the capacity of the nine Justices to decide \n     more cases. According to Professor Edward A. Hartnett: ``. . \n     . in 1870, the Court had 636 cases on its docket and decided \n     280; in 1880, the Court had 1,202 cases on its docket and \n     decided 365; and in 1886, the Court had 1,396 cases on its \n     docket and decided 451.'' The downward trend of decided case \n     is noteworthy since 1985 and has continued under Chief \n     Justice Roberts' leadership. The number of signed opinions \n     decreased from 161 in the 1985 term to 67 in the 2007 term.\n       It has been reported that seven of the nine justices, \n     excluding Justices Stevens and Alito, assign their clerks to \n     what is called a ``cert. pool'' to review the thousands of \n     petitions for certiorari. The clerk then writes and \n     circulates a summary of the case and its issues suggesting \n     justices' reading of cert. petitions is, at most, limited.\n       At a time of this declining caseload, the Supreme Court has \n     left undecided circuit court splits of authority on many \n     important cases such as:\n       (1) The necessity for an agency head to personally assert \n     the deliberative process privilege;\n       (2) Mandatory minimums for use of a gun in drug \n     trafficking;\n       (3) Equitable tolling of the Federal Tort Claims Act's \n     statute of limitations period;\n       (4) The standard for deciding whether a Chapter 11 \n     bankruptcy may benefit from executory contracts;\n       (5) Construing the honest services provisions of fraud law; \n     and\n       (6) The propriety of a jury consulting the Bible during \n     deliberations.\n       One procedural change for the Court to take more of these \n     cases would be to lower the number of justices required for \n     cert. from four to three or perhaps even to two.\n       Of perhaps greater significance are the high-profile, major \n     constitutional issues which the court refuses to decide \n     involving executive authority, congressional authority and \n     civil rights. A noteworthy denial of cert. occurred in the \n     Court's refusal to decide the constitutionality of the \n     Terrorist Surveillance Program which brought into sharp \n     conflict Congress' authority under Article I to establish the \n     exclusive basis for wiretaps under the Foreign Intelligence \n     Surveillance Act with the President's authority under Article \n     II as Commander in Chief to order warrantless wiretaps.\n       That program operated secretly from shortly after 9/11 \n     until a New York Times article in December 2005. In August \n     2006, the United States District Court for the Eastern \n     District of Michigan found the program unconstitutional. In \n     July 2007, the Sixth Circuit reversed 2-1, finding lack of \n     standing. The Supreme Court then denied certiorari.\n       The dissenting opinion in the Sixth Circuit demonstrated \n     the flexibility of the standing requirement to provide the \n     basis for a decision on the merits. Judge Gilman noted, ``the \n     attorney-plaintiffs in the present case allege that the \n     government is listening in on private person-to-person \n     communications that are not open to the public. These are \n     communications that any reasonable person would understand to \n     be private. After analyzing the standing inquiry under a \n     recent Supreme Court decision, Judge Gilman would have held \n     that, ``[t]he attorney-plaintiffs have thus identified \n     concrete harms to themselves flowing from their reasonable \n     fear that the TSP will intercept privileged communications \n     between themselves and their clients. On a matter of such \n     importance, the Supreme Court could at least have granted \n     certiorari and decided that standing was a legitimate basis \n     on which to reject the decision on the merits.\n       On June 29, 2009, the Supreme Court refused to consider the \n     case captioned In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, \n     in which the families of the 9/11 victims sought damages from \n     Saudi Arabian princes personally, not as government actors, \n     for financing Muslim charities knowing those funds would be \n     used to carry out Al Qaeda jihads against the United States. \n     The plaintiffs sought an exception to the sovereign immunity \n     specified in the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976. \n     Plaintiffs' counsel had developed considerable evidence \n     showing Saudi complicity. Had the case gone forward, \n     discovery proceedings had the prospect of developing \n     additional incriminating evidence.\n       My questions are:\n       (1) Do you agree with the testimony of Chief Justice \n     Roberts at his confirmation hearing that the Court ``could \n     contribute more to clarity and uniformity of the law by \n     taking more cases?''\n       (2) If confirmed, would you favor reducing the number of \n     justices required to grant petitions for certiorari in \n     circuit split cases from four to three or even two?\n       (3) If confirmed, would you join the cert. pool or follow \n     the practice of Justices Stevens and Alito in reviewing \n     petitions for cert. with the assistance of your clerks?\n       (4) Would you have voted to grant certiorari in the case \n     captioned In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001?\n       (5) Would you have voted to grant certiorari in A.C.L.U. v. \n     N.S.A.--the case challenging the constitutionality of the \n     Terrorist Surveillance Program?\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2009.\n     Hon. Sonia Sotomayor,\n     c/o The Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judge Sotomayor: When we concluded our meeting which \n     lasted more than an hour, I commented that I would be writing \n     to you on other subjects which I intended to cover at your \n     hearing, and I appreciated your response that you would \n     welcome such advance notice.\n       In the confirmation hearing for Chief Justice Roberts, \n     there was considerable discussion about the adequacy of \n     congressional fact finding to support legislation. This issue \n     is again before the Supreme Court on the re-authorization of \n     the Voting Rights Act where the legislation is challenged on \n     the ground that there is an insufficient factual record. At \n     our hearing, I would like your views on what legal standards \n     you would apply in evaluating the adequacy of a Congressional \n     record. In the 1968 case Maryland v. Wirtz, Justice Harlan's \n     rationale would uphold an act of Congress where the \n     legislature had a rational basis for reaching a regulatory \n     scheme. In later cases, the Court has moved to a ``congruence \n     and proportionality standard.''.\n       In advance of the hearing for Chief Justice Roberts by \n     letter dated August 8, 2005, I wrote him in part: ``members \n     of Congress are irate about the Court's denigrating and, \n     really, disrespectful statements about Congress's competence. \n     In U.S. v. Morrison, Chief Justice Rehnquist, speaking for \n     five members of the Court, rejected Congressional findings \n     because of `our method of reasoning'. As the dissent noted, \n     the Court's judgment is `dependent upon a uniquely judicial \n     competence' which implicitly criticizes a lesser quality of \n     Congressional competence.'' In Morrison, there was an \n     extensive record on evidence establishing the factual basis \n     for enactment of the Violence Against Women legislation. In \n     dissent, Justice Souter noted ``. . . the mountain of data \n     assembled by Congress here showing the effects of violence \n     against women on interstate commerce,'' and added: ``The \n     record includes reports on gender bias from task forces in 21 \n     states and we have the benefit of specific factual finding in \n     eight separate reports issued by Congress and its committees \n     over the long course leading to its enactment.''\n       In a subsequent letter to Chief Justice Roberts dated \n     August 23, 2005, I wrote concerning Alabama v. Garrett where \n     Title I of the Americans with Disabilities Act was based on \n     task force field hearings in every state attended by more \n     than 30,000 people including thousands who had experienced \n     discrimination with roughly 300 examples of discrimination by \n     state governments.\n       Notwithstanding those findings, the Garrett Court concluded \n     in a five to four decision: ``The legislative record of the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act, however, simply fails to \n     show that Congress did in fact identify a pattern of \n     irrational state discrimination in employment against the \n     disabled.''\n       In another five to four decision, the Court in Lane v. \n     Tennessee concluded Title II of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act met the ``congruence and proportionality \n     standard''. There, Justice Scalia dissented attacking the \n     ``congruence and proportionality standard'' calling it a \n     ``flabby test'' and an ``invitation to judicial arbitrariness \n     and policy driven decision making'' adding: ``Worse still, it \n     casts this Court in the role of Congress's taskmaster. Under \n     it, the courts (and ultimately this Court) must regularly \n     check Congress's homework to make sure that it has identified \n     sufficient constitutional violations to make its remedy \n     constitutional and proportional. As a general\n\n[[Page S8804]]\n\n     matter, we are ill-advised to adopt or adhere to \n     constitutional rules that bring us into conflict with a \n     coequal branch of Government.''\n       During the confirmation hearing of Chief Justice Roberts, \n     he testified extensively in favor of the Court's deferring to \n     Congress on fact finding. In response to questions from \n     Senator DeWine, he testified: ``. . . The reason that \n     congressional fact finding and determination is important in \n     these cases is because the courts recognize that they can't \n     do that. Courts can't have, as you said, whatever it was, the \n     13 separate hearings before passing particular legislation. \n     Courts--the Supreme Court can't sit and hear witness after \n     witness after witness in a particular area and develop that \n     kind of a record. Courts can't make the policy judgments \n     about what type of legislation is necessary in light of the \n     findings that are made'' . . . ``We simply don't have the \n     institutional expertise or the resources or the authority to \n     engage in that type of a process. So that is sort of the \n     basis for the deference to the fact finding that is made. \n     It's institutional competence. The courts don't have it. \n     Congress does. It's constitutional authority. It's not our \n     job. It is your job. So the defense to congressional findings \n     in this area has a solid basis.''\n       In response to my questioning, Chief Justice Roberts said: \n     ``And I appreciate very much the differences in institutional \n     competence between the judiciary and the Congress when it \n     comes to basic questions of fact finding, development of a \n     record, and also the authority to make the policy \n     decisions about how to act on the basis of a particular \n     record. It's not just disagreement over a record. It's a \n     question of whose job it is to make a determination based \n     on the record'' . . . ``as a judge that you may be \n     beginning to transgress into the area of making a law is \n     when you are in a position of re-evaluating legislative \n     findings, because that doesn't look like a judicial \n     function.''\n       The Supreme Court heard oral argument in Northwest Austin \n     Municipal Utility District v. Holder on April 29, 2009 \n     involving the sufficiency of the Congressional record on \n     reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act. While too much cannot be \n     read into comments by justices at oral argument, Chief \n     Justice Roberts' statements suggested a very different \n     attitude on deference to Congressional fact finding than he \n     expressed at his confirmation hearing. Referring to the \n     argument that ``. . . action under Section 5 has to be \n     congruent and proportional to what it's trying to remedy,'' \n     Justice Roberts said that: ``. . . one-twentieth of 1 percent \n     of the submissions are not precleared. That, to me, suggests \n     that they are sweeping far more broadly than they need to, to \n     address the intentional discrimination under the Fifteenth \n     Amendment.'' Chief Justice Roberts went on to say: ``Well, \n     that's like the old--you know, it's the elephant whistle. You \n     know, I have this whistle to keep away the elephants. You \n     know, well, that's silly. Well, there are no elephants, so it \n     must work. I mean if you have 99.98 percent of these being \n     precleared, why isn't that reaching far too broadly.''\n       As a factual basis for the 2007 Voting Rights Act, Congress \n     heard from dozens of witnesses over ten months in 21 \n     different hearings. Applying the approach from Chief Justice \n     Roberts' continuation hearing, that would appear to satisfy \n     the ``congruence and proportionality standard''.\n       My questions are:\n       1. Would you apply the Justice Harlan ``rational basis'' \n     standard or the ``congruence and proportionality standard''?\n       2. What are your views on Justice Scalia's characterization \n     that the ``congruence and proportionality standard'' is a \n     ``flabby test'' and ``an invitation to judicial arbitrariness \n     and policy driven decision making''?\n       3. Do you agree with Chief Justice Rehnquist's conclusion \n     that the Violence Against Women legislation was \n     unconstitutional because of Congress's ``method of \n     reasoning''?\n       4. Do you agree with the division of constitutional \n     authority between Congress and the Supreme Court articulated \n     by Chief Justice Roberts in his responses cited in this \n     letter to questions posed at his hearing by Senator DeWine \n     and me?\n           Sincerely,\n     Arlen Specter.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 25, 2009\n     Hon. Sonia Sotomayor,\n     c/o The Department of Justice,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Judge Sotomayor: As noted in my letter to you dated \n     June 15, 2009, I am writing to alert you to another subject \n     which I intend to cover at your hearing. I appreciate your \n     comment at our meeting that you welcome such advance notice.\n       In an electronic era where the public obtains much, if not \n     most, of its news and information from television, there is a \n     strong case in my judgment that the Supreme Court of the \n     United States should have its public proceedings televised \n     just as the United States House of Representatives and United \n     States Senate are televised.\n       It is well established that the Constitution guarantees \n     access to judicial proceedings to the press and the public. \n     In 1980, the Supreme Court relied on this tradition when it \n     held in Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, that the right \n     of a public trial belongs not just to the accused but to the \n     public and the press as well. The Court noted that such \n     openness has ``long been recognized as an indisputable \n     attribute of an Anglo-American trial.''\n       The value of transparency was cogently expressed by Chief \n     Justice William Howard Taft who said: ``Nothing tends more to \n     render judges careful in their decision and anxiously \n     solicitous to do exact justice than the consciousness that \n     every act of theirs is subject to the intelligent scrutiny of \n     their fellow men and to candid criticism.''\n       In the same vein, Justice Felix Frankfurter said: ``If the \n     news media would cover the Supreme Court as thoroughly as it \n     did the World Series, it would be very important since \n     `public confidence in the judiciary hinges on the public \n     perception of it'.''\n       To give modern-day meaning, the term ``press'' used in \n     Richmond Newspapers would include television. Certainly \n     Justice Frankfurter's use of the term ``media'' would include \n     television in today's world. Televising the Supreme Court's \n     public proceedings would provide the ``scrutiny'' sought by \n     Chief Justice Taft.\n       Justices of the Supreme Court have been frequently \n     televised, including Chief Justice Roberts and Justice \n     Stevens appearance on ``Prime Time'' ABC TV, Justice Ruth \n     Bader Ginsburg's interview on CBS by Mike Wallace, Justice \n     Breyer's participation in Fox News Sunday and the debate \n     between Justice Scalia and Justice Breyer filmed and \n     available for viewing on the web.\n       Many of the justices have commented favorably on televising \n     the Court. Justice Stevens, in an article by Henry Weinstein \n     on July 14, 1989 said he supported cameras in the Supreme \n     Court and told the annual Ninth Circuit Judicial Conference \n     at about the same time that, ``In my view, it is worth a \n     try.'' During Justice Breyer's confirmation hearing in 1994, \n     he indicated support for televising Supreme Court \n     proceedings. He has since equivocated, but noted that it \n     would be a wonderful teasing device.\n       In December 2000, Marjorie Cohn's article noted Justice \n     Ruth Bader Ginsburg's support of camera coverage so long at \n     it was gavel to gavel. Justice Alito in his Senate \n     confirmation hearing said that as a member of the Third \n     Circuit Court of Appeals he voted to admit cameras; but added \n     that it would be presumptive of him to take a final position \n     before he had consulted with his colleagues, if confirmed, \n     promising to keep an open mind. Justice Kennedy, according to \n     a September 10, 1990 article by James Rubin, told a group of \n     visiting high school students that cameras in the Court were \n     ``inevitable.'' He has since equivocated, stating that if any \n     of his colleagues raise serious objections, he would be \n     reluctant to see the Court televised. Chief Justice Roberts \n     said in his confirmation hearing that he would keep an open \n     mind on the subject.\n       Recognizing the sensitivity of justices to favor televising \n     the Court in the face of a colleague's objection, there may \n     be a new perspective with Justice Souter's retirement since \n     he expressed the most vociferous opposition: ``I can tell you \n     the day you see a camera come into our courtroom, it is going \n     to roll over my dead body.''\n       In the 109th and 110th Congresses, with several bipartisan \n     co-sponsors, I introduced legislation providing for \n     televising public Supreme Court proceedings. Both bills were \n     reported favorably out of the Judiciary Committee, but were \n     never taken up by the full Senate. Sensitive to separation of \n     powers and recognizing the authority of the Supreme Court to \n     invalidate any such legislation, it should be noted that \n     there are analogous directives from Congress to the Court on \n     procedural/administrative matters such as setting the first \n     Monday of October as the beginning of the Court's term, \n     requiring six sitting justices to form a quorum and \n     establishing nine as the number of Supreme Court justices. In \n     May 2007, Associate Professor Bruce Peabody of the Political \n     Science Department of Fairleigh Dickinson wrote an article in \n     the Journal on Legislation concluding the proposed \n     legislation was constitutional.\n       There is obviously enormous public interest in Supreme \n     Court proceedings. When the case of Bush v. Gore was argued, \n     streets around the Supreme Court building were filled with \n     television trucks, although no camera was admitted inside the \n     chamber. Shortly before the argument, Senator Biden and I \n     wrote to Chief Justice Rehnquist urging that the proceedings \n     be televised and received a prompt reply in the negative; but \n     the Supreme Court did break recede by releasing an audiotape \n     when the proceedings were over and the Court has since \n     intermittently made audiotapes available. Such audiotapes are \n     obviously no substitute for television, but are a step in the \n     right direction.\n       The keen public interest is obvious since the Supreme Court \n     decides the cutting-edge questions of the day such as: who \n     will become president; congressional power; executive power; \n     defendants' rights--habeas corpus--Guantanamo; civil rights--\n     voting rights--affirmative action; abortion.\n       In 1990, the Federal Judicial Conference authorized a \n     three-year pilot program allowing television coverage of \n     civil proceedings in six federal district courts and two \n     federal circuit courts. The program began in July 1991 and \n     ran through December 31, 1994. The Federal Judicial Center \n     monitored the program and issued a positive final evaluation. \n     The Judicial Center concluded: ``Overall attitudes of judges \n     toward electronic media coverage of civil proceedings were \n     initially neutral and became more favorable after experience\n\n[[Page S8805]]\n\n     under the pilot program.'' The Judicial Center also said: \n     ``Judges and attorneys who had experience with electronic \n     media coverage under the program generally reported observing \n     small or no effects of camera presence on participants in the \n     proceedings, courtroom decorum, or the administration of \n     justice.''\n       I am especially interested in your experience when a trial \n     was televised in your courtroom under the pilot program.\n       My questions are: (1) Do you agree with Justice Stevens \n     that televising the Supreme Court is ``worth a try''? (2) Do \n     you agree with Justice Breyer that televising judicial \n     proceedings would be a wonderful teaching device? (3) Do you \n     believe, as expressed by Justice Kennedy, that televising the \n     Supreme Court is ``inevitable''? (4) What effect, if any, did \n     televising the trial in your Court have on the lawyers, \n     witnesses, jurors and you? (5) Do you think that televising \n     the trial in your Court was useful to inform the public on \n     the way the judicial system operates?\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arlen Specter.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, when the Federalist Papers were written, \nthe authors said that the Supreme Court was the least dangerous branch. \nI think if the Framers had seen the status of events in the year 2009, \nthey might have written that the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court \nespecially, was the least accountable branch--the least transparent \nbranch.\n  For many years, I have urged that the Supreme Court be televised. \nLegislation which I have introduced has twice been voted out of \ncommittee, and it is pending again. I think this is an especially good \ntime to take up the issue. The Congress has the authority to establish \nwhen the Supreme Court sits--the first Monday in October; what it takes \nto have a quorum; how many members there will be on the Court--contrast \nthat to what President Roosevelt tried to do to expand the number to \n15. We have authority on the timetable, under the Speedy Trial Act, to \nset time limits on habeas corpus, and it is my legal judgment that we \nhave the authority to call on the Supreme Court to be televised.\n  The Supreme Court has the final word on that subject, as they do on \nall others, and could invalidate legislation on the grounds of \nseparation of power. But in light of what is happening and the demand \nfor greater transparency, the televising of the House, the televising \nof the Senate; the fact that recently the highest court in Great \nBritain has admitted television cameras, it is time that should occur.\n  With the departure of Justice Souter, assuming the confirmation of \nJudge Sotomayor, the major opponent to televising the Court will no \nlonger be there. Justice Souter made the famous statement that the \ntelevision cameras would roll in over his dead body. When the nominees \nhave been questioned repeatedly, they have always been very concerned, \nalmost to a person, about being solicitous of the views of others. I \nconcede that Justice Souter's strong views might have been a \nconsiderable obstacle. Justice Stevens has said it is worth a try. \nJustice Ginsburg said it would be fine if it were gavel to gavel. Other \nJustices have been televised. It is worth noting that the Federal \nJudicial Conference authorized a 3-year pilot program for six Federal \ndistrict courts and two Federal circuit courts of appeals. The Judicial \nCenter concluded:\n\n       Overall, attitudes of judges toward electronic media \n     coverage of civil proceedings were initially neutral and \n     became more favorable after experience under the pilot \n     program. Judges and attorneys who had experience with \n     electronic media coverage under the program generally \n     reported observing small or no effects of camera presence or \n     participants in the proceedings, courtroom decorum, or the \n     administration of justice.\n\n  It is my suggestion it would be very healthy for our country to have \na little sunshine come into the Supreme Court.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I think it would be very beneficial to have a little \nsunlight to come into the Supreme Court so there could be a public \nunderstanding as to how far the Supreme Court is going now on judicial \nlegislation--that they are going beyond constitutional rights, that \nthey are reaching into statutes such as the statute protecting women \nagainst violence, to declare it unconstitutional notwithstanding a \nvoluminous record but based on the method of reasoning of Congress, as \nif our method of reasoning was deficient to theirs; or on the standard \nof congruence and proportionality, which is simply not understandable; \nor in the context of a workload which defies explanation, with so many \ncircuit splits going undecided.\n  It may surprise people to know that it was not until 1981 that the \nJudiciary Committee proceedings on nominations were televised. Seeing \nwhat a great appearance it is today, and of how much value--this is \nreally our only opportunity to speak to the Court, to speak to Chief \nJustice Roberts. Are you going back on your commitment that it is up to \nthe Congress to decide facts on a congressional record? Why are you \ndoing congruence and proportionality when no one understands it?\n  So while the judgment on Sonia Sotomayor, as I said initially, was \neasy for me to vote aye, there are many more perplexing issues that \nhave emerged, especially what I perceive to be an institutional change \nhere, with Senators substituting their own judgments and ideology for \nthe traditional deference allotted to the President.\n  Before I yield the floor, Mr. President, I have been asked to read an \naddendum statement, if I may? It is an introduction for a letter from \nmembers of the Supreme Court bar in favor of Judge Sotomayor:\n\n       The Committee recently received a letter of support for \n     Judge Sotomayor's nomination from over 45 regular \n     practitioners at the Supreme Court including a number of \n     former Solicitors General and Assistants to the Solicitor \n     General. Among those who joined this letter are a number of \n     highly respected Republican appointees such as Charles Fried, \n     nominated by President Reagan to be Solicitor General; John \n     Gibbons, the former Chief Judge for the Third Circuit Court \n     of Appeals who was nominated by President Nixon; and Tim \n     Lewis, nominated by President George H.W. Bush and confirmed \n     as a Judge for the Third Circuit Court of Appeals.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jefferson B. Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: As members \n     of the Supreme Court Bar including those of us who have had \n     the honor to represent the United States in the Court, as \n     Solicitor General or members of the Solicitor General's \n     professional staff--we respectfully support confirmation of \n     Judge Sonia Sotomayor as an Associate Justice of the United \n     States Supreme Court.\n       Judge Sotomayor would bring to the Court an impressive \n     background in the law. As an Assistant District Attorney in \n     New York for five years, she earned a reputation as a focused \n     prosecutor. In her seventeen years as a federal judge, she \n     demonstrated impartiality, clear thinking, and careful \n     attention to the facts and issues before her. Her legal \n     rulings are typically tailored to the facts and are \n     respectful of precedent and the rule of law. Throughout her \n     legal career, Judge Sotomayor has distinguished herself.\n       Judge Sotomayor's strong legal background and impressive \n     career make her an extremely well-qualified nominee for the \n     Supreme Court. We urge her speedy confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n       Donald B. Ayer, Jones Day LLP; Deputy Attorney General, \n     1989-90; Principal Deputy Solicitor General, 1986-88.\n       Timothy S.

Wright, Wiltshire & Grannis LLP; Assistant \n     to the Solicitor General, 1984-1994.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from New Jersey is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today is an auspicious day. I have had \n25 years of service now to the Senate. This is one of those moments \nwhen what we do will be recorded in history forever--the opportunity to \nnominate a distinguished jurist to the highest juridical post in this \ncountry.\n  I rise to express my strong support for President Obama's nomination \nof a distinguished jurist, Sonia Sotomayor, to become a Supreme Court \nJustice of the United States, confirming the continuity of our duty to \nthe Constitution and to fairness to all the people in our country, and \nthat obedience to the law continues uninterrupted.\n  In Newark, NJ, there exists a venerated courthouse that bears my \nname. On the entrance to this courthouse there is an inscription that \nsays:\n\n       The true measure of a democracy is its dispensation of \n     justice.\n\n  That summarizes my feeling about our beloved country. I authored that \nquote after considerable thought, and I truly believe it reflects a \nprincipal value upon which our Nation was founded. We must scrupulously \ninsist that these values endure throughout our government and our legal \nsystem and particularly in our Nation's highest Court.\n  Based on her history, my meeting with Judge Sotomayor, and her \ntestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I have no doubt that \nif confirmed, Judge Sotomayor will pursue the fair, wise, and unbiased \ndispensation of justice. That is why I believe we must confirm Judge \nSotomayor's appointment without delay.\n  When I had a private meeting with her, she confirmed her unwavering \ncommitment to the equity of our American justice system, her knowledge \nof the law, and her recognition of the enormous responsibility she has \nto fulfill to our country.\n  I conveyed to her the excitement we are hearing in my State of New \nJersey that President Obama's nominee grew up in a poor urban \nenvironment, in the Bronx--a close neighbor geographically with New \nJersey with a similar tradition of a people starting at the bottom and \nsucceeding through determination, education, and hard work.\n  We also discussed a shared admiration for Justice Benjamin Cardozo, \nwho was renowned for his integrity and his diligence in applying \nprecedent. I served for several years on the board of a law school \nbearing Justice Cardozo's name, where I saw the achievements of \nrenowned legal scholars. I feel so deeply that Sonia Sotomayor will be \nremembered one day as an outstanding member of the most revered and \nrespected Court in the world.\n  During our meeting, Judge Sotomayor and I came to realize we had a \ncommon thread through our personal histories. The phrase ``only in \nAmerica'' truly applies to Judge Sotomayor, and I can say that with a \nspecial understanding. Humble beginnings were the touchstones that \nenabled each of us to achieve beyond any parent's dream.\n  I grew up in Paterson, NJ, a hardscrabble mill town. My family lacked \nresources but left an inheritance of values with no valuables. My \nparents were brought to America by my grandparents seeking an \nopportunity to be free and to make a living. We were taught that we \nwere obligated, if we had the opportunity, to make sure we gave \nsomething back to the community in which we lived.\n  Judge Sotomayor's family moved here from Puerto Rico, and she grew up \nin a housing project where she saw, up front and close, the struggles \nof people living in poor areas. Like my father, Judge Sotomayor's dad \ndied at a very young age, and her mother, like mine, became a widow at \na very young age. She became a single mother, like mine. Judge \nSotomayor's mother had to raise her and her brother in the face of \nracial, social, and financial adversity. In fact, her mother worked two \njobs to support her children.\n  Despite the many difficulties, Judge Sotomayor has reached the \nhighest rung of our society. At Princeton and also at Yale Law School, \nshe achieved academic honors, and then she worked in the Manhattan \nDistrict Attorney's Office. As a district attorney, she prosecuted \nmurder, robbery, and assault cases, among others. From the DA's office \nshe became a corporate litigator and rose to partner at a prestigious \nNew York law firm. While there, she threw herself into her job and \nbecame an expert on trademark and intellectual property law. Her career \nthen led her to the bench, where she has been a Federal judge for the \nlast 17 years. That is a pretty good time for testing.\n  The truth is, Judge Sotomayor comes to this nomination process with \nmore judicial experience than any Supreme Court nominee in a century. \nThink about it when the detractors try to find ways to sully her \nreputation. But before she became a judge and long before she appeared \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, where she demonstrated a remarkable \ncommand of the law and comfort with her knowledge, Judge Sotomayor \ncarved out a reputation as a brilliant legal mind.\n  Yet, in one of the most scurrilous campaigns against a judicial \nnominee I have ever witnessed, the partisan attack mills begin to churn \nout piles of distortions and half-truths about Judge Sotomayor right \nafter the President picked her to be his nominee. They had their \ngunsights settled on whoever it might be. But in this instance, we have \none of the more distinguished scholars of the law to be able to be \nhonored and to honor us at the same time. They tried to paint her as a \nradical. They even tried to paint her as a bully. They even tried to \npaint her as lacking intelligence. But there was absolutely no place in \nher judicial record to use anything serious against her. They went down \nthe path of personal destruction; it has become a habit around here. \nThey picked through her speeches. They zeroed in on one sentence here \nand another there to try to discredit her as nothing more than an \naffirmative-action choice.\n  I want to get one thing straight. Judge Sotomayor represents the best \nthis country has to offer. She is a role model for all Americans, and \nshe is, deservedly so, a source of great pride for the Latino \ncommunity. By any standard, Judge Sotomayor is exceptionally well \nqualified to serve as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. With \n17 years of judicial experience and 12 of those on the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, she is well equipped for the task of Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  If confirmed, she will be the only member of the Supreme Court who \nhas previously worn a trial judge robe. The experience should not be \noverlooked.\n\n[[Page S8807]]\n\nRight now, Justice Souter, whom Judge Sotomayor would replace on the \nCourt, is the only Justice with a trial court background.\n  Earlier this year, before Justice Souter had even announced his \nretirement, Chief Justice Roberts said that the Court's dearth of trial \nbench knowledge was, here I quote, ``an unfortunate circumstance'' and \na ``flaw.'' Trial court judges handle civil and criminal cases and they \nsee firsthand the impact of the law on ordinary Americans.\n  While on the trial bench, Judge Sotomayor handled 450 cases. Put \ndirectly, her experience is varied, multifaceted. What is more, she was \nappointed to the bench by both Democratic and Republican Presidents. \nDid they have bad judgment? I think not. I think not. Her record proved \nthat. On any fair examination of her judicial record, including more \nthan 400 published opinions as a Federal appellate court judge, it \nshows she is balanced in her approach, takes in all the facts, and \nfollows precedent. Her legal reasoning has been consistently admired \nfor applying the law fairly, and her opinions reveal nothing more than \na strict adherence to the rule of law.\n  The American Bar Association has given her its highest rating, \ncalling her ``well qualified.''\n  That is a distinction of significant importance.\n  This nomination is an incredibly important moment for our country. \nThe Supreme Court makes decisions that determine the very contours of \nour country's future. It has a direct say on the rights or lack of \nrights that our children and grandchildren will have.\n  The Court decides whether big corporations have a stronger claim to \njustice than the little guy. The Court sets the table for government \npower, whether it goes unchecked or is responsible to the people. That \nis the domain. Critical. The rulings of the Court affect everyday \npeople from New Jersey and everyday Americans.\n  The Framers of the Constitution created a system of checks and \nbalances with three coequal branches. No one understands that better \nthan Judge Sotomayor, who said during her confirmation hearings, ``The \ntask of a judge is not to make law, it is to apply the law.''\n  After consideration, careful consideration, I conclude that I must \nvote ``yes'' on the confirmation of Judge Sotomayor. Judge Sotomayor \nhas consistently shown judicial restraint and she will prove to be a \nstrong and independent voice on that Court.\n  Like many Americans, I am sure I will not always agree with every \ndecision she makes. But I have the comfort of knowing, of believing, \nthat she will resolve legal questions with an open mind, will put the \nrule of law above any personal beliefs.\n  Her judicial record is unparalleled. Her professional and academic \ncredentials are impeccable, and her story is inspiring. I watched and \nlistened carefully to what she had to say during her confirmation \nhearings and when we met in person.\n  Her life has been one of breaking down barriers. I look forward to \nseeing her break one more. For those reasons I am honored to support \nJudge Sotomayor's breakthrough nomination.\n  I hope my colleagues will step up and vote their conscience and vote \ntheir beliefs and not inject any of the insignificant things we have \nseen discussed all over the place until this. I hope they will confirm \nher in an overwhelming majority, which is what she and the country \ndeserve.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise in strong support of the nomination \nof Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  I wish to thank Pat Leahy, my seatmate here in the Senate, the \nChairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his leadership. Let me also \nthank Jeff Sessions, who is the ranking Republican on the committee, \nand all members of the committee.\n  Those are pretty important jobs they have. Obviously they are \nconsidering nominees for the district court, the appellate court. But \nmoments when you consider a nominee to the Supreme Court do not happen \nevery day and are pretty significant moments.\n  I commend the committee for the speed with which they handled this. A \nlot of time these matters can get tied up for weeks on end, as we have \nseen in prior years. But I particularly commend Pat Leahy, who does a \ngreat job chairing the Judiciary Committee, and all members for their \nwork in this area.\n  Article II of the Constitution gives the Senate an awesome \nresponsibility for providing advice and consent on judicial \nnominations. Those who we confirm are in a lifetime position as one of \nthe nine men and women who will have the ability to literally shape \nevery phase of American law and society.\n  Other than authorizing war or amending the U.S. Constitution, this \nbody has no more important power than the one we exercise when we \nchoose to confirm a nominee to sit on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Clearly, then, the Constitution demands that we subject nominees to \nvery close scrutiny. But it does not tell us how. Each Senator must \ndetermine for himself or herself the appropriate criteria.\n  Over the years I have been here, I have had the privilege of \nlistening, not as a member of the Judiciary Committee, but as a Member \nof this body, to debates, and there have been some tremendous ones over \nthe years on various nominees. Most have been confirmed, some have not. \nBut it is usually a robust debate, an important debate, and the \nscrutiny of these nominees is the highest any nominee for any office \nreceives.\n  I have always relied on a three-part test.\n  The first test I apply, and have done this across the board over the \nyears: Does the nominee have the technical competence and legal skills \nto do the job?\n  Second: Does the nominee have the proper character and temperament to \nserve on the highest Court of our land?\n  And, third: Does the nominee's record demonstrate respect for and \nadherence to the principle underlying our legal system--that is, equal \njustice for all?\n  I am convinced, without any doubt or hesitation, that Judge Sotomayor \npasses all three tests with distinction.\n  As to Judge Sotomayor's competence: Her resume is that of experienced \nand accomplished jurist, one who will take her seat with more bench \nexperience, I might point out, as I am sure others have, than any other \nJustice currently serving on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  She graduated from Yale Law School in my home State of Connecticut, \nhas been a prosecutor and private attorney, and spent 17 years on the \nFederal bench as both a district court judge and an appellate court \njudge.\n  As to Judge Sotomayor's character: Her long list of enthusiastic \nrecommendations and her terrific performance before the Judiciary \nCommittee revealed her to be a remarkable woman of deep integrity. Her \nincredible life story, rising from a housing project in the Bronx to \nthe height of American jurisprudence, is truly an inspiration. And, of \ncourse, as someone who would be the first Latina and third woman to \nserve on the Court, Judge Sotomayor is an historic figure.\n  As to Judge Sotomayor's legal philosophy: Her writings and her \nthoughtful answers to difficult questions raised by our colleagues on \nthe Judiciary Committee make it clear that Judge Sotomayor is committed \nto the principle of equality that forms the foundation of America's \nsystem of jurisprudence.\n  For Judge Sotomayor, as for any nominee, that is enough to earn my \nvote, regardless of what I think about any particular decision. I voted \nto confirm Chief Justice Roberts, much to the consternation of people \nin my own party and others who felt we should object because we did not \nagree with Judge Roberts' decisions in a number of cases. But I applied \nmy three-part\n\n[[Page S8808]]\n\ntest and Justice Roberts passed. I have applied that test over the \nyears.\n  So while I have not agreed with every decision that the Chief Justice \nhas taken during his tenure on the bench, I would still tell you it was \na good choice, despite my disagreement with some of his decisions. It \nis the kind of quality you want on the Supreme Court.\n  I worry deeply in this body that if we start taking standards to \napply to the nominees for the Supreme Court, such as we appear to be \ndoing, I think we do damage to the tradition we must uphold in this \nbody of applying standards that go far beyond our particular concerns \nabout decisions here and there, or to listen to constituency groups to \nsuch a degree that they dominate the vote patterns here in the Senate.\n  Frankly, I do not think I am telling any of my colleagues anything \nthey do not know already. I do not think anybody in this Chamber \nbelieves that she is incompetent or temperamentally unsuited for the \njob, or that she does not believe in equal justice under the law.\n  The actual debate, however, has focused not on the nominee's enormous \nbody of exemplary work but a few examples from her career, selected for \ntheir ability to create controversy.\n  Out of thousands of decisions--and that is not hyperbole; she has \nbeen involved in thousands of decisions--if it were not amusing to me \nit would be disturbing to me. There are eight cases that were the \nsubject of debate in her nomination, eight cases out of thousands in \nwhich she rendered an opinion either as a joint participant in the \nopinion or as the sole decider in the case.\n  So out of thousands of cases, eight items were brought up. Frankly, \nyou could do that with anybody. But someone who has had 17 years on the \nbench, going through thousands of cases, if that is the basis for being \nagainst this nominee, I do not know if anyone can ever pass the test \nhere if that were the case, if you are looking for people with \nexperience and temperament and ability to judge.\n  She should not be confirmed just because of her ethnicity. As someone \nwho is proud that he speaks the Spanish language, served the Peace \nCorps in Latin America, in the Dominican Republic, and knows the area \nwhere Judge Sotomayor grew up in the Bronx, her nomination should not \nrest solely on ethnicity. And she would be offended if she thought it \nwere the case.\n  But it also is a moment of celebration as well, that we in this \ncountry respect diversity of our population. Many have said this is a \nremarkable story, and I appreciate the point they are trying to make. \nBut it is not terribly remarkable, it is America. And in America that \nstory is not remarkable. That is the great brilliance of our country. \nWe have a President of the United States who was raised by a single \nmother under difficult circumstances. Bill Clinton, whom we are talking \nabout today because of his heroic efforts to help release the two women \nwho were held in North Korea, had an equally compelling story. Ronald \nReagan had a compelling story.\n  There are many people who have risen to incredible heights in our \ncountry in success in the private and public sector who have come from \nsimilar circumstances as Judge Sotomayor. It is a great tribute to our \ncountry that people such as Judge Sotomayor can achieve the success she \nhas because we celebrate it in our country.\n  So it is more a reflection I think of today's political climate than \nit is on this terrific nominee who we have the privilege of voting for. \nThe legal and political issues raised during her confirmation hearings \nare complex and interesting, as they should be. But the decision \ncurrently facing the Senate is not a hard call, in my view. I have been \nhere when there have been hard calls. This is not a hard call. This \nought to be an easy call for Members here.\n  She is a brilliant jurist. She is a remarkable American. And she is \ngoing to make a fantastic Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. I could \nnot be prouder, when the time arrives, to cast my vote in favor of this \nnominee.\n  The Judiciary Committee has received letters of support from several \nState and local bar associations, including the New York City Bar, the \nWomen's Bar Association of the State of New York, and the Connecticut \nHispanic Bar Association.\n  The Connecticut Hispanic Bar Association, which honored Judge \nSotomayor in 1998 with its Achievement Award at its Annual Awards \nDinner, wrote:\n\n       Since being appointed to the bench, Judge Sotomayor has \n     compiled an exemplary and distinguished record.

Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: As president of the Women's Bar Association \n     of the State of New York (WBASNY), I am pleased to present \n     the attached statement in support of the confirmation of \n     Judge Sonia Sotomayor--a WBASNY member--to the United States \n     Supreme Court. Her outstanding experience, her philosophy of \n     judicial moderation, and her distinctive perspective, as \n     demonstrated by her legal opinions, make her superbly \n     qualified for this service.\n       I respectfully request that WBASNY be given the opportunity \n     to testify about Judge Sotomayor during the U.S. Senate \n     confirmation hearings.\n           Sincerely,\n                                           Cynthia Schrock Seeley.\n\n            WOMEN'S BAR ASSOCIATION OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK\n\n             Statement in Support of Judge Sonia Sotomayor\n\n                             June 30, 2009\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       The Women's Bar Association of the State of New York \n     (``WBASNY''), representing more than 3,800 attorneys, judges, \n     and law students from across the State of New York, is \n     honored and proud to support President Obama's nomination of \n     Second Circuit Judge Sonia Sotomayor--a WBASNY member--to the \n     United States Supreme Court. Judge Sotomayor's wealth of \n     experience, keen intelligence, and moderate judicial \n     philosophy make her extremely well-qualified to serve as an \n     Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n\n\n                         Outstanding Experience\n\n       Judge Sotomayor has superb educational credentials and more \n     than sixteen years' experience as a federal judge. After \n     graduating summa cum laude from Princeton University, she \n     served as an editor of The Yale Law Journal while pursuing \n     her law degree at Yale Law School. For the first five years \n     of her career, Judge Sotomayor was an assistant district \n     attorney for the County of New York, prosecuting such crimes \n     as murder, robbery, child abuse, police misconduct, and \n     fraud. New York District Attorney, Robert M. Morgenthau, \n     calls her a ``fearless and effective prosecutor,'' who \n     ``believes in the rule of law.'' After leaving the district \n     attorney's office, Judge Sotomayor worked for a private law \n     firm as a corporate litigator, where she handled complex \n     commercial cases, both international and domestic. Her work \n     focused on the areas of intellectual property, real estate, \n     employment, banking, contracts, and agency law.\n       In October 1992, Judge Sotomayor was appointed to the U.S. \n     District Court for the Southern District of New York by \n     President Bush and became the youngest judge on the Court. In \n     her six years as a district court judge, Judge Sotomayor \n     presided over approximately 450 cases, earning a reputation \n     as a ``sharp'' and ``fearless'' jurist. She was elevated to \n     the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in 1998 by \n     President Clinton, where she has participated in more than \n     3000 appeals and written approximately 400 published \n     opinions. Her colleagues on the Second Circuit bench have \n     praised her as ``a brilliant lawyer and a very sound and \n     careful judge'' who is ``fair and decent in all her \n     dealings.''\n\n\n             Judicial Philosophy--A Passion for Moderation\n\n       Judge Sotomayor's judicial opinions faithfully adhere to \n     applicable legal precedents, defer to legislative and \n     regulatory decision-making, and carefully examine the facts \n     of each case. Because she applies the same principled \n     analysis to each matter she reviews, her conclusions do not \n     fall into superficially predictable categories. Judge \n     Sotomayor's application of the law hews closely to \n     established law and precedents. Hers is a clear and \n     consistent voice for moderation that demonstrates an \n     appreciation for the far-reaching implications of appellate \n     decisions. Essentially limiting the scope of her own power, \n     Judge Sotomayor is a model of judicial restraint.\n       In dissenting from the Second Circuit's reversal of a \n     district court decision that dismissed an age discrimination \n     claim brought by a seventy-year-old clergyman, Judge \n     Sotomayor wrote that the majority opinion ``violate[d] a \n     cardinal principle of judicial restraint by reaching \n     unnecessarily the question of [the Religious Freedom \n     Restoration Act]'s constitutionality'' when the question\n\n[[Page S8809]]\n\n     had not been presented to the Court.'' Similarly, upon \n     reviewing an immigration asylum case that addressed China's \n     restrictive family planning policies, Judge Sotomayor wrote \n     that the majority opinion ``mark[ed] an extraordinary and \n     unwarranted departure from our longstanding principles of \n     deference and judicial restraint.''\n       Judge Sotomayor's awareness of the long-range effects of \n     judicial decisions undergirds her passion for judicial \n     restraint. Addressing an immigration asylum claim brought by \n     three women who had been subjected to female genital \n     mutilation in their native Guinea, Judge Sotomayor wrote that \n     a colleague's analysis of continuing persecution claims was \n     ``unnecessary . . . may never need to be decided, . . . [and] \n     . . . could have far reaching implications in other types of \n     cases.'' Reviewing a Fourth Amendment claim of illegal search \n     in the context of a plaintiff's suit for money damages, Judge \n     Sotomayor reminded her colleagues of the Supreme Court's \n     articulation of the applicable law: ``[T]he Supreme Court has \n     struck a careful balance between the vindication of \n     constitutional rights and government officials' ability to \n     exercise discretion in the performance of their duties. Our \n     case law, in subtle but important ways, has altered this \n     balance . . . In the vast majority of cases, including this \n     one, the particular phrasing of the standard will not alter \n     the outcome . . . [y]et the effect in future cases may not \n     always be so benign. . . . It is time to . . . reconcile our \n     . . . analysis with the Supreme Court's most recent, \n     authoritative jurisprudence.''\n\n\n                  Distinctive Common-Sense Perspective\n\n       Judge Sotomayor brings a distinctive common-sense \n     perspective to the Court, and an appreciation of the \n     differences among litigants' individual attributes and \n     experiences. In 2007, then-Senator Obama might have been \n     describing Judge Sotomayor when he said, ``Part of the role \n     of the Court is . . . to protect people who may be vulnerable \n     in the political process, the outsider, the minority, those \n     who are vulnerable, those who don't have a lot of clout.'' \n     While always adhering to established law and precedent, her \n     opinions and decisions reveal a special sensitivity to \n     challenges facing those whom WBASNY seeks to protect: women \n     and other groups for whom the equal administration of justice \n     has been elusive, such as immigrants, children, and the \n     disabled.\n       Judge Sotomayor is eminently qualified for the Supreme \n     Court without regard to gender. However, the members of \n     WBASNY believe that her gender enhances her other stellar \n     qualifications. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \n     recently stated that the Supreme Court needs another woman: \n     ``[T]here are perceptions that we have because we are women. \n     . . . Women belong in all places where decisions are being \n     made. I don't say (the split) should be 50-50. It could be \n     60% men, 40% women, or the other way around. It shouldn't \n     be that women are the exception.'' Similarly, Justice \n     Sandra Day O'Connor stated, ``Despite the encouraging and \n     wonderful gains and the changes for women which have \n     occurred in my lifetime, there is still room to advance \n     and to promote correction of the remaining deficiencies \n     and imbalances.'' Addressing an audience of WBASNY members \n     in 1999, Judge Sotomayor discussed the impact of her \n     gender on her own jurisprudence: ``Each day on the bench, \n     I learn something new about the judicial process and its \n     meaning, about being a professional woman in a world that \n     sometimes looks at us with suspicion. . . . I can and do . \n     . . aspire to be greater than the sum total of my \n     experiences but I accept my limitations. I willingly \n     accept that we who judge must not deny the differences \n     resulting from experience and gender but attempt . . . \n     continuously to judge when those opinions, sympathies and \n     prejudices are appropriate.''\n       Judge Sotomayor's decisions reflect an understanding of \n     ``women's issues'' and how they are essentially human issues. \n     Dissenting from an immigration decision, Judge Sotomayor \n     wrote, ``The majority concedes that both spouses suffer a \n     ``profound emotional loss'' as a result of a forced abortion \n     or sterilization, but it never sufficiently explains why the \n     harm of sterilization or abortion constitutes persecution \n     only for the person who is forced to undergo such a procedure \n     and not for that person's spouse as well. . . . [T]he \n     majority's conclusion disregards the immutable fact that a \n     desired pregnancy . . . necessarily requires both spouses to \n     occur, and that the state's interference with this \n     fundamental right ``may have subtle, far reaching and \n     devastating effects'' for both husband and wife. The \n     termination of a wanted pregnancy under a coercive population \n     control program can only be devastating to any couple, akin, \n     no doubt, to the killing of a child.''\n       In the same case, Judge Sotomayor addressed the Court's \n     obligation to consider the differences between Chinese asylum \n     seekers and U.S. citizens when making assumptions about \n     parties' actions: ``We simply have no foundation on which to \n     conclude that all couples have the financial resources to \n     escape at the same time, and as the government stated at oral \n     argument, it is not uncommon for Chinese couples to separate \n     and have one spouse go abroad in order to amass the necessary \n     resources to bring over the other spouse. I believe the \n     majority here is opining on a subject--imbued with \n     potentially significant cultural differences--with which it \n     has no expertise or empirical evidence.''\n       Judge Sotomayor has also demonstrated an understanding of \n     the particular difficulties women and girls face in our \n     society. In a case alleging discriminatory failure to promote \n     and retaliatory discharge, Justice Sotomayor held that the \n     plaintiff had failed to establish that she was discriminated \n     against on either basis.''' However, addressing the same \n     employee's claim of sexual harassment, Judge Sotomayor held \n     that testimony that the woman's supervisor repeatedly \n     commented that ``women should be barefoot and pregnant . . . \n     [and that he] would stand very close to women when talking to \n     them and would `look[ ] at [them] up and down in a way that's \n     very uncomfortable' '' was sufficient to entitle the \n     plaintiff to a jury trial on the question of whether she had \n     been subjected to a hostile work environment.\n       In a case involving strip searches of young girls admitted \n     to juvenile detention centers, Judge Sotomayor wrote that the \n     majority failed adequately to consider ``the privacy \n     interests of emotionally troubled children,'' most of whom \n     ``have been victims of abuse or neglect, and may be more \n     vulnerable mentally and emotionally than other youths their \n     age.'' She cautioned, ``We should be especially wary of strip \n     searches of children, since youth `is a time and condition of \n     life when a person may be most susceptible to influence and \n     to psychological damage.' ''\n       Dissenting from a dismissal of a claim that a school \n     district had discriminated against an African American child \n     in demoting him from first grade to kindergarten, Judge \n     Sotomayor wrote, ``I consider the treatment this lone black \n     child encountered . . . to have been . . . unprecedented and \n     contrary to the school's established policies.'' She found it \n     ``crucial'' that the student as ``the only black child in \n     this classroom and one of the very few black students in the \n     entire school.''\n       Addressing a claim brought by a father who was investigated \n     by the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitation \n     Services after his estranged wife accused him of sexually \n     abusing his three-year-old son, Judge Sotomayor first noted \n     that the U.S. Supreme Court has afforded constitutional \n     protection to parents' interest in the care, custody and \n     management of their children, then addressed the ``compelling \n     governmental interest in the protection of minor children, \n     particularly in circumstances where the protection is \n     considered necessary as against the parents themselves.'' \n     Carefully analyzing the actions of the social workers sued by \n     the father, and the applicable law available to guide the \n     actions of those social workers, Judge Sotomayor ultimately \n     held that despite problems with the investigation, ``we \n     conclude that defendants had a reasonable basis for their \n     substantiation determination and that they therefore did not \n     violate plaintiffs' constitutional rights.'' However, she \n     also provided clear guidance to child protection workers: \n     ``[F]rom this day forward, these and other case workers \n     should understand that the decision to substantiate an \n     allegation of child abuse on the basis of an investigation \n     similar to but even slightly more flawed than this one will \n     generate a real risk of legal sanction.''\n       Judge Sotomayor has also thoughtfully applied the law \n     governing the rights of disabled persons. In holding that the \n     court below had inaccurately formulated a jury charge in an \n     employment discrimination case, Judge Sotomayor wrote, \n     ``Taken as a whole, the charge suggests that an employer may \n     offer any accommodation that does not cause an undue \n     hardship, including reassignment to an inferior position, and \n     that the plaintiff is required to accept . . . . The district \n     court . . . erred.''\n       As a district judge for the Southern District of New York, \n     Judge Sotomayor considered a claim brought by a woman with a \n     learning disability who sought reasonable accommodations in \n     taking the New York State Bar Examination. Judge Sotomayor \n     conducted a total of twenty-five days of trial, reviewed \n     thousands of pages of exhibits and briefs, and heard \n     testimony from eight experts, finally concluding that the \n     plaintiff was entitled to accommodations of her disability in \n     taking the bar examination, and $7,500 in damages. Her \n     detailed and respectful treatment of the parties and \n     witnesses in a decision on a matter involving less than ten \n     thousand dollars in damages is testament to her commitment to \n     the fair and equal administration of justice to all who come \n     before her.\n       In another case, Judge Sotomayor considered a district \n     court's dismissal of the claim of a former employee who \n     alleged that he was discharged after he suffered a disabling \n     back injury. In a clear and erudite decision, Judge Sotomayor \n     addressed the interplay of three different disability \n     statutes, evaluated complex procedural issues, and analyzed \n     the potential liability of a parent corporation and a sister \n     corporation for employment discrimination. Her succinct \n     conclusion reinstated the employee's claim against his \n     employer, affirmed the dismissal of the claim against the \n     sister corporation, and resolved the procedural issues.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       Judge Sotomayor's jurisprudence defies easy categorization \n     because each of her decisions is characterized by careful \n     consideration of the law and the facts. Her clear and \n     compelling analyses and her fair treatment of the parties \n     epitomize the ideal qualities of a Supreme Court Justice. She \n     will bring balance and perspective to the Court and will \n     enhance the delivery of justice to all.\n\n[[Page S8810]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                                                       Connecticut\n\n\n                                     Hispanic Bar Association,\n\n                                      Hartford, CT, July 10, 2009.\n     Senator Patrick J.

In recognition of her accomplishments, the CHBA \n     honored Judge Sotomayor in 1998 with its Achievement Award at \n     its Annual Awards Dinner.\n       Since being appointed to the bench, Judge Sotomayor has \n     compiled an exemplary and distinguished record. She has \n     earned a stellar reputation as a defender of the rule of law \n     and praise for her thoughtful and thorough written opinions. \n     Moreover, in her over 11 years of service with the United \n     States Second Circuit Court of Appeals, she has participated \n     in over 3,000 decisions and authored approximately 400 \n     opinions on important issues of constitutional law, difficult \n     procedural matters, and complex corporate and business \n     issues.\n       Additionally, as you know, her personal story is similarly \n     compelling. Judge Sotomayor grew up in a working-class family \n     in New York City. She attended Princeton University on a \n     scholarship where she graduated summa cum laude and was \n     elected Phi Beta Kappa. She went on to earn her law degree at \n     Yale Law School where she was an editor of the Yale Law \n     Journal.

Hynes,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n The Association of the Bar of the City of New York Finds Judge Sonia \n           Sotomayor Highly Qualified for U.S. Supreme Court\n\n       New York, June 30, 2009.--Patricia M. Hynes, President of \n     The Association of the Bar of the City of New York, announced \n     that the Association has concluded that Judge Sonia Sotomayor \n     is Highly Qualified to be a Justice of the United States \n     Supreme Court.\n       The Association found that Judge Sotomayor demonstrates a \n     formidable intellect; a diligent and careful approach to \n     legal decision-making; a commitment to unbiased, thoughtful \n     administration of justice; a deep commitment to our judicial \n     system and the counsel and litigants who appear before the \n     court; and an abiding respect for the powers of the \n     legislative and the executive branches of our government.\n       In conducting its evaluation, the Association reviewed and \n     analyzed information from a variety of sources: Judge \n     Sotomayor's written opinions from her seventeen years on the \n     circuit court and district court; her speeches and articles \n     over the last twenty-one years; her prior confirmation \n     testimony; comments received from the Association's members \n     and committees; press reports, blogs and commentaries; \n     interviews with her judicial colleagues and numerous \n     practitioners; and an interview with Judge Sotomayor.\n       The Association determined that Judge Sotomayor possesses, \n     to an exceptionally high degree, all of the qualifications \n     enumerated in the Guidelines established by the Association \n     for considering nominees to the United States Supreme Court: \n     (1) exceptional legal ability; (2) extensive experience and \n     knowledge of the law; (3) outstanding intellectual and \n     analytical talents; (4) maturity of judgment; (5) \n     unquestionable integrity and independence; (6) a temperament \n     reflecting a willingness to search for a fair resolution of \n     each case before the court; (7) a sympathetic understanding \n     of the Court's role under the Constitution in the protection \n     of the personal rights of individuals; and (8) an \n     appreciation for the historic role of the Supreme Court as \n     the final arbiter of the meaning of the United States \n     Constitution, including a sensitivity to the respective \n     powers and reciprocal responsibilities of the Congress and \n     Executive.\n       The Association has been evaluating judicial candidates for \n     nearly 140 years in a nonpartisan manner based upon the \n     nominees' competence and merit. Although the Association had \n     evaluated a number of Supreme Court candidates over the \n     course of its history, in 1987 it determined to evaluate \n     every candidate nominated to the Supreme Court.\n       In 2007, the Executive Committee of the Association moved \n     from a two-tier evaluation system in which candidates were \n     found to be either ``qualified'' or ``not qualified'', to a \n     three-tier evaluation system. The ratings and the criteria \n     that accompany them are as follows:\n       ``Qualified.'' The nominee possesses the legal ability, \n     experience, knowledge of the law, intellectual and analytical \n     skills, maturity of judgment, common sense, sensitivity, \n     honesty, integrity, independence, and temperament appropriate \n     to be a Justice of the United States Supreme Court. The \n     nominee also respects precedent, the independence of the \n     judiciary from the other branches of government, and \n     individual rights and liberties.\n       ``Highly Qualified.'' The nominee is qualified, to an \n     exceptionally high degree, such that the nominee is likely to \n     be an outstanding Justice of the United States Supreme Court. \n     This rating should be regarded as an exception, and not the \n     norm, for United States Supreme Court nominees.\n       ``Not Qualified.'' The nominee fails to meet one or more of \n     the qualifications above.\n       The present review is the first time the Association has \n     utilized this three-tier system for a Supreme Court review.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nRepublican time for the next hour be allocated as follows: myself for \n10 minutes, Senator Barrasso for 10 minutes, Senator Crapo for 15 \nminutes, Senator Wicker for 10 minutes, and Senator Collins for 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I rise today to express my opposition, my \nconsidered opposition, to Judge Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  As Senators, I think we all know we have an obligation to ensure that \nour courts are filled with qualified and impartial judges.\n  While Judge Sotomayor has an impressive resume--that is a given--I am \nconcerned that her personal judgments and views will impact her \njudicial decisions. In addition, I find some of her rulings very \ntroubling.\n  During the Senate's debate on the nomination of Chief Justice John \nRoberts, then-Senator Obama stated:\n\n     that while adherence to legal precedent and rules of \n     statutory or constitutional construction will dispose of 95 \n     percent of the cases that come before the Court, so that both \n     a Scalia or Ginsburg will arrive at the same place most of \n     the time on those 95 percent of the cases, what matters on \n     the Supreme Court is those 5 percent of cases that are truly \n     difficult. In those cases, adherence to precedent and the \n     rules will only get you through the 25th mile of the \n     marathon. That last mile can only be determined on the basis \n     of one's deepest values, one's core concerns, one's broader \n     perspectives on how the world works, and the depth and \n     breadth of one's empathy.\n\n  Thus the entrance of the ``empathy'' issue to this debate. I \nrespectfully disagree with now-President Obama.\n  Judges must decide all cases in adherence to legal precedent and \nrules of statutory or constitutional construction. It does not mean if \nthey do that they do not have empathy. I agree--and I think everybody \nwould agree--everybody on the Supreme Court has empathy. But the role \nof a judge is not to rule based on his or her own personal judgments \nbut to adhere to the laws as they are written.\n  While Judge Sotomayor stated during her confirmation hearing that \n``it is not the heart that compels conclusions in cases, it is the \nlaw,'' I still have concerns regarding her ability to remain impartial. \nShe has made some statements in Law Review articles and speeches that \nare of serious concern. I\n\n[[Page S8811]]\n\nam not convinced that Judge Sotomayor will set aside her personal \njudgments and views.\n  While on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Sotomayor joined \na four-paragraph ruling on property rights. In Didden v. Village of \nPort Chester, the appellants claimed that a developer demanded $800,000 \nin order to avoid condemnation of the property by the city. When the \nappellants refused to pay the $800,000, they received a petition to \ninitiate condemnation. Although the Second Circuit Court of Appeals \ndismissed the case, it was noted that relief could not be granted based \non the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Kelo v. City of New London. \nThat four-paragraph ruling didn't even provide an in-depth analysis as \nto how the Kelo ruling applied to the facts at hand. In fact, the Kelo \ndecision acknowledges that ``a city no doubt would be forbidden from \ntaking land for the purpose of conferring a private benefit on a \nparticular party.''\n  The four-paragraph ruling in Didden is very troubling. In Kansas, \nland is gold; farmland is platinum. We have a healthy respect for \nproperty rights in Middle America. It also bothers me that a court \ncould make a broad statement without analyzing and applying the facts \nto case law.\n  Turning to firearm rights, Judge Sotomayor joined an opinion ruling \nthat the second amendment is not a fundamental right and, therefore, \ndoes not apply to State and local governments. It is likely that at \nsome point the second amendment's application to States could be argued \nbefore the Supreme Court. That could come very quickly. I would \ncertainly hope that should this matter be argued before the Supreme \nCourt, Judge Sotomayor would recuse herself. During her hearing, she \ndid not indicate whether she would recuse herself in any decision. That \nwas not, however, the case during the nomination hearings of Judges \nAlito and Roberts.\n  I do not discount the fact that Judge Sotomayor is a very \naccomplished judge and has an extensive judicial record. However, some \nof her statements, writings, and rulings concern me. They indicate her \npersonal judgments and views may impact her judicial decisions. We have \na constitutional obligation to ensure that our judges are impartial and \nfaithful to the law.\n  During Chief Justice John Roberts' confirmation hearing, he noted:\n\n       Judges and justices are servants of the law, not the other \n     way around. Judges are like umpires. Umpires don't make the \n     rules. They apply them. The role of an umpire and judge is \n     critical. They make sure everybody plays by the rules [not by \n     empathy], but it is a limited role. Nobody ever went to a \n     ball game to see the umpire.\n\n  I am not convinced that Judge Sotomayor will be an umpire and \nconsistently adhere to the rule of law as opposed to empathy.\n  For these reasons and others cited by some of my colleagues, I oppose \nher nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I have three criteria in evaluating an \nindividual to fill a vacancy on the Supreme Court. First, select the \nbest candidate for the job. Second, the Justice must be impartial and \nallow the facts and Constitution to speak. Third, a Justice's \nresponsibility is to apply the law not to write it.\n  I have reviewed Judge Sotomayor's record, and I met with her to learn \nmore about her. I want to take a moment to share my thoughts on Judge \nSotomayor's nomination.\n  Judge Sotomayor has a compelling life story. She was raised in public \nhousing projects in the Bronx. She was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes \nat age 8. Her father died when she was 9, and she was subsequently \nraised by her mother. Judge Sotomayor graduated valedictorian of \nCardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx. She graduated summa cum \nlaude from Princeton. She earned her juris doctorate from Yale Law \nSchool, where she was editor of the Yale Law Review. After graduating \nfrom law school, Judge Sotomayor worked as an assistant district \nattorney in New York City for 5 years. She then worked in private \npractice for 7 years.\n  In 1991, Judge Sotomayor was nominated to the Federal bench by \nPresident George Herbert Walker Bush. In 1998, President Clinton \nnominated her to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals where she \ncurrently sits.\n  I believe Judge Sotomayor has the legal experience and the skills to \nbe considered for the Supreme Court. During the confirmation process, \nquestions were raised about her ability to make decisions on the facts \npresented not on events and facts that became ingrained during her \nlife. Judges must be impartial and allow the facts and the Constitution \nto speak not their personal experience. For America's judicial system \nto work, judges must always remain impartial.\n  At her confirmation hearing, Judge Sotomayor stated that her judicial \nphilosophy is ``fidelity to the law.'' This is in contrast to her \nextensive commentary over the past 15 years, a commentary that \nemphasizes personal experience over impartiality in a judge's \ndecisionmaking. The contrast is especially troubling when a judge, as \nwas the situation in the case of Ricci v. DeStaphano, fails to \narticulate the reasons for the decision.\n  In the Ricci case, the firefighters case, an exam was used as part of \nthe promotion process. The exam consisted of a written test as well as \nan oral test. It was prepared by Industrial Organizational Solutions, a \nprofessional testing firm. The test measured individual knowledge, \nindividual skills, and individual abilities related to the specific \nposition being filled.\n  The highest scores on the written exam were achieved overwhelmingly \nby White firefighters. After the results were posted, the city of New \nHaven, CT, did not like the results and decided at that point to not \nuse the exam. Several officers sued. They sued the city for taking this \naction.\n  Who were the officers who sued? One was Frank Ricci, the lead \nplaintiff. He was a career firefighter. He is dyslexic. To study, he \nhired and paid someone to read the recommended study books onto an \naudio tape so he could listen to the tapes. He studied up to 13 hours a \nday. He gave up a second job, time with his family.\n  Lt Ben Vargas was another officer who sued and testified at Judge \nSotomayor's confirmation hearing. He also has a career as a \nfirefighter. He grew up in Fair Haven, which is a neighborhood of New \nHaven. His father was a factory worker. His family spoke Spanish at \nhome, making school a challenge for him. He is the father of three \nboys. One of the reasons he joined the lawsuit:\n\n       I want them [my three sons] to have a fair shake, to get a \n     job on their merits.\n\n  The district court ruled against the firefighters. Judge Sotomayor's \ncourt upheld the lower court ruling dismissing the case. Judge \nSotomayor's court issued a one-paragraph opinion summarily dismissing \nthe appeal. Her court failed to cite any precedents for this decision.\n  In June of 2009, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed Judge Sotomayor's \nopinion. The Supreme Court stated:\n\n       The City made its employment decision because of race. The \n     City rejected the test results solely because the higher \n     scoring candidates were white.\n\n  The Supreme Court went on to say:\n\n       The process was open and fair. The problem of course is \n     that after the tests were completed, the raw racial results \n     became the predominant rationale for the City's refusal to \n     certify the results.\n\n  The Supreme Court's 34-page majority opinion, fully analyzing the \nfacts and the legal issues, stands in stark contrast to the one-\nparagraph ruling by Judge Sotomayor. The lack of a detailed explanation \nby the judge's court on an issue that the Supreme Court said was not \nsettled law is one I find troubling. More importantly, it raises doubt, \nfairly or unfairly, as to why Judge Sotomayor's court ruled the way it \ndid. Through her own words, Judge Sotomayor's ability to completely \ndisown personal beliefs and biases to reach a decision is in question.\n  I have additional concerns about the principles Judge Sotomayor will \napply in deciding future cases involving important issues such as the \nsecond amendment. In a 2009 second amendment case decided by Judge \nSotomayor's court, her court ruled that the second amendment did not \napply to the States. The court cited Supreme Court cases from the 1800s \nas precedent. But Judge Sotomayor's court went further. They ruled that \nthe second amendment right is not a fundamental right, thereby allowing\n\n[[Page S8812]]\n\nStates and local authorities broad powers to deny individuals the right \nto bear arms. The court's ruling that the second amendment right is not \na fundamental right can't be reconciled with recent decisions on other \ncourts.\n  The U.S. Supreme Court, in a 2008 case, was asked to decide whether \nthe District of Columbia could deny its citizens rights afforded to \nthem under the second amendment. In its ruling, which was issued before \nJudge Sotomayor's 2009 decision, the Supreme Court said the second \namendment confers an individual's right to keep and bear arms. The \nCourt rightfully overturned the laws of the District of Columbia that \ndenied citizens of the District the right to own a firearm.\n  In a 2009 ruling from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, the court \nconcluded that the series of 19th century Supreme Court cases cited by \nJudge Sotomayor were not controlling on the issue of whether the second \namendment establishes a fundamental right. The Ninth Circuit Court \nconcluded the Constitution did confer that right. The court ruled that \nthe second amendment right to bear arms is a fundamental right of the \npeople, and it is to be protected.\n  Judge Sotomayor, if confirmed, will receive a lifetime seat on the \nhighest Court of the land. Her decisions may impact Americans and \nAmerica for generations to come. Every American has the right to know \nwhat standard Judge Sotomayor will apply in judging future cases--\nfidelity to the law, as she stated in the hearings or, as she has \nstated in the past: ``My experience will affect the facts I choose to \nsee.''\n  The Senate should know with absolute certainty the standard that \nJudge Sotomayor will use before confirming her to the Supreme Court. \nWithout having that certainty, I am unable to support her nomination to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss President Obama's \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  First, I want to say I appreciate the efforts of my colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee to hold thorough hearings and to process this \nnomination.\n  There is no doubt that Judge Sotomayor's resume is impressive, with \ndegrees from Princeton and Yale Law School. She then worked as an \nassistant district attorney, and later in private practice before \nserving as a U.S. district court judge, and currently as a U.S. circuit \ncourt judge.\n  It is unfortunate the Senate confirmation process has reached a point \nwhere nominees with such extensive backgrounds are no longer \ncomfortable candidly discussing their judicial philosophy and views on \nkey issues.\n  To date, I have received over 1,000 letters, e-mails, and phone calls \nfrom Idaho constituents who are overwhelmingly opposed to Judge \nSotomayor's nomination. Many of the concerns raised in this \ncorrespondence are similar to concerns I personally have about the \nnomination--concerns relating to the second amendment right to bear \narms, concerns relating to judicial activism, concerns relating to \nwhether foreign law should be utilized in interpreting U.S. statutes \nand our Constitution.\n  It was my hope that through the committee hearings and my personal \nmeeting with Judge Sotomayor and other evaluation of her writings and \nher judicial decisions that these concerns and those of my constituents \ncould be addressed. Unfortunately, though, when it came to the key \nissues, Judge Sotomayor's testimony often lacked the substance \nnecessary and was even contradictory to her own previous statements, \nrulings, and writings.\n  I would like to discuss some of those areas of concern. Before I do \nso, though, I want to make it very clear that with this nomination, \nmany are very rightfully proud that for the first time in our country's \nhistory we have a Latina nominated to our highest Court. And it must be \nnoted that she is receiving and being afforded a clean up-or-down vote \non the floor of the Senate this week.\n  As I indicated at the outset, it is unfortunate the confirmation \nprocess in the Senate has deteriorated so much over the last few years \nthat others have not received similar opportunities. I am referring in \nthis example to Miguel Estrada. Like Judge Sotomayor, Judge Estrada was \nrated unanimously ``well qualified'' by the American Bar Association \nwhen President Bush nominated him to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nDC Circuit.\n  The DC Circuit is often considered to be a stepping stone for Supreme \nCourt nominations, and at that time many thought Judge Estrada would be \na strong nominee, that he might be the first Latino nominated to the \nSupreme Court. Judge Estrada would have deserved such an opportunity as \nJudge Sotomayor does. Unfortunately, some on the left feared that \nscenario, and as a result there was a filibuster and Judge Estrada was \nnever even allowed to have an up-or-down vote on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  I make this point now just to remind us all that although there are \nmany here who have concerns about some of the positions and \nphilosophies Judge Sotomayor has, there has been no effort to deprive \nher of an opportunity for an up-or-down vote on the floor of the Senate \non her nomination. It is important our country recognize this.\n  Let me now turn to some of the issues I indicated earlier that are of \nconcern. I know a number of my colleagues have spoken already about the \nissue of the second amendment right to keep and bear arms. That is one \nof my most significant concerns.\n  On July 27, 2008, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in District of \nColumbia v. Heller that the second amendment to the Constitution \nprotects an individual's right to keep and bear arms unconnected with \nservice in a militia, and to use those arms for traditionally lawful \npurposes, such as self-defense within the home.\n  This ruling affirmed what common sense has told us all for a long \ntime: that the second amendment was intended to ensure access to all \nlaw-abiding citizens for self-defense and recreation. Unfortunately, \ndespite this ruling in Heller, Judge Sotomayor ruled in the Maloney \ncase that the second amendment does not apply to the States.\n  Even the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which has jurisdiction over \nmy home State of Idaho and is often considered one of the most liberal \ncourts in the land, has ruled the opposite way in a similar case, \nmaking it clear that second amendment rights are binding on the States.\n  In Nordyke v. King, the Ninth Circuit held that the right to bear \narms is ``deeply rooted in this Nation's history and tradition.'' \nAdditionally, the court found that the ``crucial role this deeply \nrooted right has played in our birth and history compels us to \nrecognize that it is indeed [a] fundamental [right].''\n  Furthermore, and again even after the Supreme Court's ruling in \nHeller, Judge Sotomayor held that the second amendment does not protect \na fundamental right.\n  With regard to whether the second amendment applies to States, I do \nnot believe any reasonable person believes that other freedoms \ncontained in the Bill of Rights do not apply to the States, such as \nfreedom of religion, freedom of speech, or freedom of the press. Why is \nthere a different standard or effort to try to keep the second \namendment right to bear arms from being freely available to all \nindividuals in the United States?\n  The Supreme Court has held in a series of opinions that the 14th \namendment incorporates most portions of the Bill of Rights as \nenforceable against the States. Despite that Heller addressed firearms \nlaws in the District of Columbia and not in a particular State, the \nSupreme Court used State constitutional precedents for its analysis in \nHeller. In fact, the Court's ruling was based in part on its reading of \napplicable language in State constitutions adopted soon after our Bill \nof Rights itself was adopted and ratified. By doing so, the Supreme \nCourt recognized that the second amendment was, in fact, a fundamental \nright guaranteed under the Constitution.\n  On the issue of whether the second amendment right to bear arms is a \nfundamental right, I am extremely concerned that a nominee for the \nhighest Court in our land would make such an argument. I am very \nconcerned that a nominee for the highest Court in our\n\n[[Page S8813]]\n\nNation could so construe the second amendment right to bear arms. This \ndisregard of history and legal precedent is, to me, a clear sign of a \npenchant toward judicial activism.\n  As I have said, to reach her decision in Maloney, Judge Sotomayor had \nto, and did, make a judicial finding that the second amendment right to \nbear arms is not a fundamental right. In contrast, the Ninth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, in a footnote, said it as well as I think it can be \nsaid. The Ninth Circuit Court said:\n\n       The county--\n\n  Which in this case was the defendant which was seeking to implement \nsome restrictions that were an infringement on the right to bear arms--\n\n       The county and its amici--\n\n  Those others who have filed briefs on the county's behalf--\n\n     point out that, however universal its earlier support, the \n     right to keep and bear arms has now become controversial.\n\n  Again, this is the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals speaking.\n\n       But we do not measure the protection the Constitution--\n\n  The Constitution--\n\n     affords a right by the values of our own times. If \n     contemporary desuetude sufficed to read rights out of the \n     Constitution, then there would be little benefit to a written \n     statement of them. Some may disagree with the decision of \n     [our] Founders to enshrine a given right in the Constitution. \n     If so, then people can amend the document. But such \n     amendments are not for the courts to ordain.\n\n  That is the kind of correct analysis the Supreme Court has clearly \nguided us to with regard to the second amendment right to bear arms.\n  Throughout Idaho and across the United States, many millions of \nAmericans believe the second amendment is a fundamental right, and I am \none of those. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will decide whether the \nsecond amendment is incorporated by the 14th amendment to apply to the \nStates. When that case is taken up, the Court will decide just how \n``fundamental'' the second amendment is and whether States and \ncommunities can take away Americans' right to bear arms any time they \nwant.\n\n  I cannot support a nominee to the Supreme Court who does not \nrecognize this fundamental right in our Constitution. For this reason, \nI must oppose the nomination of Judge Sotomayor.\n  In addition, with regard to the role of a judge and judicial \nactivism, when it comes to her views on the proper role of a judge, \nonce again Judge Sotomayor's testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee appears to directly contradict her publicly stated words and \nphilosophy expressed prior to her nomination.\n  In 2003, when discussing her gender and heritage, Judge Sotomayor \nsaid:\n\n       My experiences will affect the facts I choose to see as a \n     judge.\n\n  In another previous speech, she said:\n\n       Personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to \n     see.\n\n  This is simply shorthand for judicial activism and making policy \nrather than applying the law--exactly what the Ninth Circuit said \ncourts were not to do. To defend against this very notion, however, \njustice is supposed to be blind. Indeed, Lady Justice is depicted with \na blindfold. To judge by selectively choosing which facts to emphasize \nis akin to lowering the blindfold and taking a peek, thereby rejecting \nequal justice under the law. Those who are called to judge must adhere \nto the rule of law no matter what they personally think the law should \nbe or what the outcome of a particular case should be.\n  After she was nominated to the Supreme Court, Judge Sotomayor told \nthe Judiciary Committee:\n\n       My personal and professional experiences help me listen and \n     understand, with the law always commanding the result in \n     every case.\n\n  So we are left to wonder what has caused this contradiction, and \nwhether she still believes that judges may choose to see the facts they \nwant to see to get the result they want to get.\n  Also, I indicated I had a concern about foreign law. Another very \npuzzling contradiction in Judge Sotomayor's testimony involves the \nissue of judges looking to foreign law when deciding cases.\n  In her testimony before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Sotomayor \nsaid:\n\n       I have actually agreed with Justices Scalia and Thomas on \n     the point that one has to be very cautious even in using \n     foreign law with respect to the things American law permits \n     you to.\n\n  However, in March of this year, in a speech to the ACLU of Puerto \nRico, she did not seem to agree with Justices Scalia and Thomas when \nshe said:\n\n       And that misunderstanding is unfortunately endorsed by some \n     of our Supreme Court justices. Both Justice Scalia and \n     Justice Thomas have written extensively criticizing the use \n     of foreign and international law . . . in Supreme Court \n     decisions. How can you ask a person to close their ears? \n     Ideas have no boundaries. Ideas are what set our creative \n     juices flowing. They permit us to think, and to suggest to \n     anyone that you can outlaw the use of foreign or \n     international law is a sentiment that's based on a \n     fundamental misunderstanding. What you would be asking \n     American judges to do is to close their minds to good ideas. \n     . . .Unless American courts are more open to discussing the \n     ideas raised by foreign cases, and by international cases, we \n     are going to lose influence in the world.\n\n  Mr. President, I do not agree. In fact, that a nominee to the highest \nCourt in our land would say that our Constitution and our statutes in \nAmerica may be interpreted by reliance on foreign law is alarming.\n  The Supreme Court is charged with deciding the constitutionality of a \nlaw or interpreting it in the context of our American system of \njustice, not in accordance with selectively chosen foreign laws, which \nare numerous, contradictory, and often inconsistent with American \njurisprudence. How else would a judge choose among these various \nforeign laws and precedents other than selecting those that align with \nthat judge's personal opinion?\n  Mr. President, I have raised three issues today that have caused me \nvery significant concern: Judge Sotomayor's interpretation of the \nsecond amendment right to keep and bear arms, clearly written after the \nSupreme Court of the United States has given the guidance necessary for \nus to resolve the issue; her penchant toward choosing facts, enabling a \njudge or Justice, in this case, to reach the outcomes they want \nregardless of the way the law should be applied and the outcome that \nthe law would otherwise require; and her willingness to allow American \njurisprudence to be determined at the highest levels in our land by \nreliance on foreign law, foreign cases, and foreign precedent.\n\n  For these reasons, I cannot support President Obama's nomination of \nJudge Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. When we get to the vote on it \nthis week, I will cast a ``no'' vote. I recognize the likelihood is her \nnomination will proceed and be confirmed, but it is my keen hope and \nconviction the issues I have raised and that many others have raised \ntoday will be heard and that, regardless of the outcome of the vote in \nthe Senate this week, Judge Sotomayor, if she is confirmed, and all \nJustices on the Supreme Court will continue to recognize the \nfundamental nature of our right to bear arms under the second \namendment; that they will focus on the proper role of judges not in \ncreating law but in interpreting the law, and that they will decline to \nrely on foreign law to interpret and to create American jurisprudence.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WICKER. Mr. President, I wish to begin by thanking the members of \nthe Judiciary Committee for conducting a thorough, fair, and respectful \nconfirmation hearing. Judge Sotomayor herself stated that the hearing \nwas as gracious and fair as she could have hoped. I consider that \nstatement to be a tribute to Senators Leahy, Sessions and the committee \nmembers and their staffs and I commend them.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution states that the President \nshall nominate--by and with the advice and consent of the Senate--\nJudges of the Supreme Court. The constitutional duty of ``advice and \nconsent'' given to the Senate is of profound importance, particularly \nwhen considering a lifetime appointment to the Nation's highest Court. \nIn reviewing Judge Sotomayor's nomination, I have taken this obligation \nvery seriously.\n\n[[Page S8814]]\n\n  Following Judge Sotomayor's nomination by the President, I, as did \nnearly all my colleagues in this Chamber, had a private, one-on-one \nmeeting with her. We had a very cordial conversation, one in which I \nfound Judge Sotomayor to be likeable and gracious. I appreciated \nlearning more about her background. Make no mistake, Judge Sotomayor \nhas a great personal and professional story to tell. She is proud of \nit, and she certainly should be. But in the instance of a Supreme Court \nnominee, the constitutional duty of advice and consent given to the \nSenate is not about personalities, likeability or life stories. It is \nabout judicial philosophy and adherence to impartiality and fidelity to \nthe law.\n  After careful consideration of her record, I was left with a number \nof irreconcilable concerns. I am deeply troubled by what I see as Judge \nSotomayor's aversion to impartiality. The judicial oath requires judges \nto:\n\n       Administer justice without respect to persons, and do equal \n     right to the poor and to the rich, and . . . faithfully and \n     impartially discharge and perform all the duties incumbent \n     upon [them] under the Constitution and laws of the United \n     States.\n\n  To be clear, the oath requires judges to be impartial with respect to \ntheir social, moral and political views and to apply the law to the \nfacts before them. In other words, provide equal justice under the law.\n  Yet Judge Sotomayor appears to believe in a legal system where \ndecisions are based upon personal experiences and group preferences, \nnot the letter of the law. Judge Sotomayor has said on repeated \noccasions that she:\n\n       Willingly accept[s] that judge[s] must not deny the \n     differences resulting from experience and heritage but \n     attempt . . . continuously to judge when those opinions, \n     sympathies, and prejudices are appropriate.\n\n  These are her own words. She has stated many times, during more than \na decade, that her background and personal experiences will affect the \nfacts she chooses to see as a judge. In our brief meeting in June, \nJudge Sotomayor stated this notion a slightly different way, by saying \nher Latina heritage caused her to ``listen a different way.'' I find \nthese to be disconcerting statements which seem to conflict with the \nimpartiality that I and an overwhelming majority of Americans believe \nis essential to our judicial system and even the very bedrock \nprinciples our Nation was founded upon.\n  In looking at her rulings, I noted that the Supreme Court has \ndisagreed with Judge Sotomayor in 9 out of 10 cases it has reviewed and \naffirmed her in the remaining case by a narrow 5-to-4 margin. This \nrecord was demonstrated most recently in the Ricci case, where a \nmajority of Justices of the Supreme Court rejected Judge Sotomayor's \npanel decision. This is a case in which a group of firefighters who had \nstudied for months and passed a test were denied promotion because not \nenough minority firefighters had done as well. In a one-paragraph, \nunsigned, and unpublished cursory opinion, Judge Sotomayor summarily--\nalmost casually--dismissed the claims of these firefighters who had \nworked hard for a promotion.\n  When discussing the qualifications he would look for in replacing \nJustice Souter, President Obama said:\n\n       I view the quality of empathy, of understanding and \n     identifying with people's homes and struggles as an essential \n     ingredient for arriving at just decisions and outcomes.\n\n  Empathy is a great personal virtue, but there is a difference between \nempathy as a person and empathy as a judge. Judges should use the law \nand the law only, not their personal experiences or personal view or \nempathy. Personal biases and empathy have no place in reaching a just \nconclusion under the law. Ricci is an example of where Judge Sotomayor \nclearly failed this important test.\n  In addition, I am deeply concerned about Judge Sotomayor's decision \nin Maloney v. Cuomo, a second amendment case that could very easily be \ndecided by the Supreme Court in the next year. In last year's Heller \ndecision, the Supreme Court ruled that the second amendment guarantees \nan individual right to keep and bear arms. Yet, in Maloney, Judge \nSotomayor relied on 19th century cases, arguably superseded after \nHeller, to summarily hold that the second amendment does not apply to \nthe States. If Judge Sotomayor's decision is allowed to stand, the \nStates will be able to place strict prohibitions on the ownership of \nguns and other arms. In refusing to confirm that the second amendment--\na right clearly enumerated in the Bill of Rights--is a fundamental \nright that applies to all 50 States and, thus, to all Americans, Judge \nSotomayor shows an alarming hostility to law-abiding gun owners across \nthe country. That is a view that is certainly out of the mainstream in \nthis Nation.\n  What is perhaps even more troubling is that Maloney is another \nexample where Judge Sotomayor joined an unsigned, cursory panel \ndecision. If she is confirmed to the Supreme Court, Judge Sotomayor \nwill routinely hear cases raising fundamental constitutional issues \nsuch as Maloney. Those are the types of cases the Supreme Court hears. \nThat is why issues of this nature make it to the Supreme Court. Yet \nJudge Sotomayor has a record of routinely dismissing such cases with \ndifficult constitutional questions of exceptional importance to \nAmericans with little or no analysis.\n  As an appeals court judge, Judge Sotomayor and her rulings are \nsubject to a safety net: Her cases can be reviewed by the Supreme \nCourt. In Ricci, the firefighters whose promotions were denied could \nappeal the decision and receive impartial justice. There is no backstop \nto the Supreme Court. Therefore, Judge Sotomayor's elevation to our \nNation's highest Court takes on much more significance than her \nprevious selection to the appeals court.\n  So let me be clear: I have tremendous respect for Judge Sotomayor's \nlife story and professional accomplishments. I commend her for her \nachievements, and I wish her well in the future. However, I am not \nconvinced she understands the proper role of the courts in our legal \nsystem. Her record and her pronouncements are those of someone who sees \nthe court as a place to legislate and make policy. I am not convinced \nJudge Sotomayor truly believes in the bedrock of our judicial system, \nwhich is impartiality under the law. Therefore, I must withhold my \nconsent and vote no on her confirmation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise in support of the nomination of \nSonia Sotomayor to serve as an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  The Constitution grants the President the power to nominate and \nappoint individuals to the Federal judiciary. It also gives the Senate \nthe power of advice and consent to such appointments. It does not, \nhowever, provide any specific guidance to the Senate on how we should \nexercise this important power.\n  In a democracy, discourse and disagreement are inevitable. Some, \nincluding myself, would say that these ingredients are not only \nexpected, they are necessary for the healthy continuation of our \nvibrant, dynamic democracy.\n  Given this backdrop, disputes regarding the scope of the Senate's \npower of ``advice and consent'' are not uncommon or unexpected whenever \nthe President puts forth a nominee for the Supreme Court. In fact, the \nink on our Constitution was barely dry when the Senate rejected John \nRutledge, one of President Washington's 13 nominees to the Supreme \nCourt. Some Senators suggested they had voted against Mr. Rutledge out \nof a concern that he was losing his sanity. But the main reason for \nopposition to Mr. Rutledge appears to have been the nominee's \nopposition to the Jay Treaty with Great Britain--a treaty popular with \nthe federalist-controlled Senate.\n  Since Mr. Rutledge's rejection by the Senate in 1795, Senators have \ncontinued to grapple with the criteria applicable to their evaluation \nof Supreme Court nominees and the degree of deference that should be \naccorded to the President.\n  There is no easy answer to this difficult question. Some argue that \ncloser scrutiny by the Senate and less deference to the President is \nrequired when confirming judicial nominees, not only because Federal \njudges are in a separate branch of government but also because they \nhave lifetime appointments. Thus, constitutional law scholar John \nMcGinnis concludes that the text of the Constitution gives the\n\n[[Page S8815]]\n\nSenate ``complete and final discretion in whether to accept or approve \na nomination.''\n  Many other legal scholars, however, articulate a more constrained \nrole for the Senate. They argue that the Senate's power should be \nexercised narrowly, giving extraordinary deference to the President. \nUnder this standard, the Senate would not reject judicial nominees \nunless they were clearly unqualified to serve.\n  Citing Alexander Hamilton's Federalist 76, those who would constrain \nthe Senate's review of judicial nominees explain that the ``advice and \nconsent'' responsibility was only intended as a safeguard against \nincompetence, cronyism, or corruption. As Dr. John Eastman testified \nbefore the Judiciary Committee in 2003, the Senate's power of ``advice \nand consent'' does not give ``the Senate a coequal role in the \nappointment of Federal judges.''\n  The constitutional arguments on both sides of this question of how \nmuch deference to give the President are enlightening. But, as is so \noften the case, my personal belief is that the truth lies between the \ntwo extremes. As a Senator, I have afforded considerable deference to \nboth Democratic and Republican Presidents on their Supreme Court \nnominees. In considering judicial nominees, I carefully consider the \nnominee's qualifications, competency, personal integrity, judicial \ntemperament, and respect for precedent. Those are the tests I have \napplied to Sonia Sotomayor. Having reviewed her record, questioned her \npersonally, and listened to the Judiciary Committee hearings, I have \nconcluded that Judge Sotomayor should be confirmed to our Nation's \nhighest Court.\n  My decision to support this nominee does not reflect agreement with \nher on all of her rulings as a judge serving on the Second Circuit \nCourt of Appeals. I disagreed, for example, with the perfunctory manner \nin which Judge Sotomayor has disposed of one case of constitutional \nconsequence. Her panel's cursory analysis of the complex and novel \nquestions about the 14th amendment's equal protection clause and title \nVII in the Ricci case--the case involving the New Haven firefighters, \nwhich has been called a reverse discrimination case--was as unfortunate \nas the decision itself. Indeed, in contrast to her panel's one-\nparagraph opinion, the Supreme Court, in this case, needed nearly 100 \npages to debate and resolve just the statutory question presented--\nnever mind the difficult constitutional questions that were set aside \nfor another day.\n  But my concerns about a handful of Judge Sotomayor's rulings, as well \nas some of her prior comments over the course of her 17 years on the \nFederal bench, do not warrant my opposing her confirmation. Upon \nreading some of her other decisions, talking personally with her, \nquestioning her at length, and hearing her response to probing \nquestions, I have concluded that she understands the proper role of a \njudge and that she is committed to applying the law impartially, \nwithout bias or favoritism. Specifically, in her testimony before the \nJudiciary Committee, Judge Sotomayor reaffirmed that her judicial \nphilosophy is one of ``fidelity to the law.''\n  She pledged ``to apply the law,'' not to make it. She testified that \nher ``personal and professional experiences'' will not influence her \nrulings.\n  There is no question in my mind that Judge Sotomayor is well \nqualified to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. She has \nimpressive legal experience. She has excelled throughout her life, and \nshe is a tremendously accomplished person. Indeed, the American Bar \nAssociation Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary--after an \nexhaustive review of her professional qualifications, including more \nthan 500 interviews and analyses of her opinions, speeches, and other \nwritings--unanimously rated her as ``well qualified.''\n  Based on my personal review--a careful review--of her record, my \nassessment of her character, and my analysis of her adherence to \nprecedent, Judge Sotomayor warrants confirmation to the High Court.\n  I know I will not agree with every decision Justice Sotomayor reaches \non the Court, just as I have disagreed with some of her previous \ndecisions. I believe, however, that her legal analyses will be \nthoughtful and sound and that her decisions will be based on the \nparticulars of the case before her. My expectation is that Justice \nSotomayor will adhere to Justice O'Connor's admonition that ``a wise, \nold woman and a wise, old man would eventually reach the same \nconclusion in a case.''\n  Based on her responses to the Judiciary Committee, Justice Sotomayor \nwill avoid the temptation to usurp the legislative authority of the \nCongress and the Executive authority of the President. As Chief Justice \nJohn Marshall famously wrote in Marbury v. Madison, the Court must \n``say what the law is.'' That, after all, in a nutshell, is the \nappropriate role for the Federal judiciary. For a judge to do more \nwould undermine the constitutional foundations of the separate \nbranches.\n  I will cast my vote in favor of the confirmation of Judge Sotomayor, \nas I believe she will serve our country honorably and well on the \nSupreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise today in wholehearted support of \nthe historic nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to become an Associate \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I have two words to summarize my feelings about this nomination: It's \ntime. It is time we have a nominee to the Supreme Court whose record \nhas proven to be truly mainstream. It is time we have a nominee with \npractical experience in all levels of the justice system, whose \nupbringing in a Bronx housing project, whose experience as a \nprosecutor, litigator, and district court judge has enabled her to see, \nas she said in her own statement, ``the human consequences'' of her \ndecisions. And it is time that we have a nominee who is Hispanic, a \nmember of the fastest growing population in America. Finally, it is \ntime that we have a frank discussion about what is preventing so many \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle from supporting Judge \nSotomayor.\n  In short, this is the time, and it is time. It is time we have a \nmoderate nominee. It is time we have someone with a great family \nhistory, an American family history. It is time we confirm the first \nHispanic Justice to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Let's start with Judge Sotomayor's record, which is most important. \nSeveral of my Republican colleagues said, as they cast their votes \nagainst her in the Judiciary Committee, that they did not know what \nkind of Supreme Court Justice they might be getting in Judge Sotomayor. \nI find this conclusion to be confounding. Judge Sotomayor is hardly a \nriddle wrapped in mystery inside an enigma. No matter what cross \nsection we take of her extensive record, down to examining individual \ncases, we see someone who has never expressed any desire or intention \nto overturn existing precedent, nor have my colleagues been able to \npoint to any such case.\n  Instead, we see someone who lets the facts of each case guide her to \nthe correct application of the law. We see someone who does not put her \nthumb on the scales of justice for either side, even if any sentient \nhuman being would want to reach a different result for a sympathetic \nplaintiff.\n  We know more about Judge Sotomayor than we have known about any \nnominee in 100 years. The 30,000-foot view of her record, gleaned from \nnumerous studies about the way she has ruled in cases for 17 years--and \nthat is the best way to tell how a judge is going to be, to look at \ntheir previous cases--when you look at those cases, it tells plenty \nabout her moderation.\n  She has agreed with her Republican colleagues 95 percent of the time. \nShe has ruled for the government in 83 percent of immigration cases, \npresumably against the immigrant. She has ruled for the government in \n92 percent of criminal cases, against the criminal. She has denied race \nclaims in 83 percent of cases. She has split evenly in a variety of \nemployment cases.\n  No matter how we slice and dice these cases, we come up with the same \nconclusion about her moderation.\n\n[[Page S8816]]\n\n  Within the category of criminal cases she decided, she ruled for the \ngovernment 87 percent of the time in fourth amendment cases. This is \nimportant because the fourth amendment is an area where decisions are \nhighly fact based and judges have discretion to decide when police have \noverstepped their bounds in executing searches and seizures. But she \nhas not abused this discretion. In the overwhelming number of cases, \nshe sides with the government, deciding each case carefully based on \nthe facts before her.\n  Let's also look further at her immigration asylum cases. There she \nruled for the government, against the petitioner for asylum, in 83 \npercent of the cases. That is also telling of her modulated approach to \njudging. Asylum law, as her colleague Judge Newman has pointed out, \ngives judges a great deal of discretion to decide who can be granted \nasylum to stay in the United States. Judge Sotomayor has not abused \nthis discretion a jot.\n  Given her upbringing in a Hispanic neighborhood of the Bronx, we \nmight expect that her personal background would make her more, to \nborrow a term, empathetic to an immigrant seeking asylum. But the cases \nshow that any perceived empathy did not affect her results. In fact, \nher 83-percent record puts her right in the middle of judges in her \ncircuit.\n  Even in the realm of sports cases, which are always contentious and \nclosely watched, Judge Sotomayor has shown her evenhandedness. She \nruled for the professional football league in an antitrust case brought \nby a player and against Major League Baseball when she ruled for the \nplayers and ended the baseball strike.\n  I can go on. Judge Sotomayor voted to deny the victims of TWA flight \n800 crash a more generous recovery because that was ``clearly a \nlegislative policy choice, which should not be made by the courts.'' If \nyou have empathy, you certainly are going to decide with the victims. I \nmet some of their families. She did not. The law did not allow her.\n  Judge Sotomayor ruled against an African-American couple who claimed \nthey were bumped from a flight because of their race. Again, against a \ncouple, a case called King, that said they were racially discriminated \nagainst. She did not think the facts merited their suit.\n  Judge Sotomayor rejected the claims of a disabled Black woman who \nsaid she was unfairly denied accommodations that were provided to White \nemployees.\n  My Republican colleagues did not ask her about these cases. Instead, \nthey looked at her speeches, not her cases, and decided that Judge \nSotomayor believed it was the proper role of the court of appeals to \nmake policy, and they condemned her roundly for this view.\n  Then they criticized her for not making policy in cases where they \ndisagreed with the outcome. This occurred in three cases--in Ricci, \nwhich involved the New Haven firefighters, a second amendment case, and \na case involving property rights. I guess from the point of view of my \nRepublican colleagues, judicial policy making is a bad thing except \nwhen it is not.\n  In each of these three cases they criticized, where they criticized \nthe short opinions which she did not even write for herself, they said \nthe ruling showed she was unable or unwilling to grapple with major \nconstitutional issues. But in each of these cases, Judge Sotomayor \nagreed with the other two members of her court that the second circuit \nor Supreme Court precedents squarely dictated the result. There was no \nneed for a fuller explanation. In fact, second circuit rules forbade \npanels from revisiting squarely divided precedents. In other words, in \nthese cases, she was avoiding making policies. The cases were governed \nby the precedents. She was bound. They were decided by settled law. It \nwas just the fact my friends across the aisle do not like what the \nsettled law was. So we are getting awfully close to a double standard \nhere.\n  In Ricci, they wanted her to overturn the second circuit \ndiscrimination law. And in the gun case, they wanted her to ignore a \n100-year-old precedent that governs how the second amendment is applied \nto the States.\n  In the property rights case, they wanted her to ignore the law that \ngoverned the statute of limitations.\n  My colleagues asked Judge Sotomayor about an EPA case. In that case, \nshe ruled the EPA had mistakenly considered a certain factor in \ndeciding whether a company had used the ``best technology available'' \nto clean water. Even though she gave deference to EPA's interpretation \nof the law, Judge Sotomayor ruled against the government.\n  Yet, my friend, Senator Sessions of Alabama, stated that one of his \nreasons for opposing Judge Sotomayor is that she exhibits liberal \nprogovernment ideology. It appears that being progovernment is a bad \nthing, except when it is not.\n  Let's talk about her answers to questions. Some of my friends on both \nsides of the aisle have said Supreme Court nominees need to be more \nforthcoming during the confirmation process. They fear that the \nhearings have become a little more than a choreographed Kabuki dance in \nwhich, as Senator Specter observed some time ago, nominees answered \njust enough questions to get confirmed.\n  I have shared this concern as well. It is too easy for a candidate \nwho wishes to hide his or her ideology to decline to answer questions, \nto submit to cautious coaching, and to offer meaningless platitudes--\npromises that they would keep an open mind, respect the law, give \neveryone an equal chance. Of course, they would.\n  Candidates with little to hide, not surprisingly, have answered more \nquestions than stealth nominees who have truly been outside the \nmainstream. Examples of candidates who had nothing up their sleeves and \nanswered questions in a straightforward manner include Judge Stephen \nBreyer in 1994. He answered the question posed by Senator Hatch: ``Do \nyou believe that Washington v. Davis is settled law; and second, do you \nbelieve it was correctly decided?'' And then-Judge Ruth Bader \nGinsburg--despite criticisms that she begged off too many questions--\nanswered questions about abortion precedent and Casey.\n  Justices Alito and Roberts, in stark contrast, declined to answer \nquestion after question after question. Then-Judge Roberts would not \nanswer the most basic questions about settled commerce clause \njurisprudence. Then-Judge Alito would not say whether he thought the \nconstitutional right to privacy included the holding of Roe.\n  I think we can see now, and I will discuss this in more detail, that \nthis was part of a strategy to play an ideological shell game.\n  Now we are presented with a candidate whose views are truly moderate, \nas proven through the most copious records in 100 years. Nonetheless, \nmy friend, Senator Grassley, of Iowa believes that ``Judge Sotomayor's \nperformance at her Judiciary Committee hearing left me with more \nquestions than answers.'' I have to respectfully disagree.\n  But Judge Sotomayor, again, in addition to her full and transparent \nrecord, proved in her answers that she is not a stealth candidate. On \nabortion and the holding of Roe, when asked by Senator Franken: ``Do \nyou believe that this right to privacy includes the right to have an \nabortion?'' Judge Sotomayor answered clearly and to the point: ``The \nCourt has said in many cases--and as I think has been repeated in the \nCourt's jurisprudence in Casey--that there is a right to privacy that \nwomen have with respect to the determination of their pregnancies in \ncertain situations.'' Clear. To the point.\n  When then-Judge Roberts was asked this question, he replied:\n\n       Well, I feel I need to stay away from a discussion of \n     particular cases. I'm happy to discuss the principles of \n     stare decisis, and the Court has developed a series of \n     precedents on precedent, if you will. They have a number of \n     cases talking about how this principle should be applied.\n\n  So who spoke clearly to the question? If you don't believe Judge \nSotomayor did, how could you vote for Judge Roberts?\n  On property rights, when asked by Senator Grassley about her \nunderstanding of the Court's holding in Kelo, Judge Sotomayor explained \nfully her understanding of the Court's holding, and there is a quote. \nWhen asked about his view of Kelo, then-Judge Alito declined to discuss \nthe case. There are many more examples of how Judge Sotomayor answered \nquestions about existing cases in much fuller detail\n\n[[Page S8817]]\n\nthan the past two nominees and certainly about the key cases--property \nrights and abortion--which we debate, as we should, in this body.\n  As I said at the outset, it is time. It is time for a searching \nexamination of why some of my colleagues are still determined to vote \nagainst Judge Sotomayor. She has a remarkably moderate record, she is \nhighly qualified, she answers questions, and she is a historic choice \nwho will expand the diversity of the Court.\n  What nominee of President Obama's would my Republican colleagues vote \nfor--one who would have reached out and found that the right to bear \narms should be incorporated to apply to the States, despite 100-year-\nold precedent to the contrary; one who would have ignored the Second \nCircuit precedent and prohibited the city of New Haven from trying to \nfix a promotional exam to give minorities a better chance at \nadvancement; one who declined to answer questions about existing \nprecedence? In other words, an activist who was intent on changing the \nlaw?\n  Of course, we now turn to the last refuge of objection to Judge \nSotomayor: her statements outside the courtroom. I have always been a \nstrong advocate of the principle that we consider carefully each \nnominee's entire record, including speeches and other judicial \nwritings. But Judge Sotomayor is different than most because she has an \nenormous judicial record to review and consider. She is not a stealth \ncandidate. There is a push and pull here in terms of what is important \nto evaluate with respect to each individual nominee. With 17 years of \njudicial opinions, 30 panel opinions, and 3,000 cases in total, how \nmuch emphasis should we put on the three words ``wise Latina woman,'' \nwhether we disagree with them or not?\n  I would submit the answer should be, compared to her copious record, \nnot much. Nonetheless, by my count, my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle asked no fewer than 17 questions about her ``wise Latina \nwoman'' comment. In contrast, they asked questions of about 6--6--of \nJudge Sotomayor's cases over the course of the 3 days; 6 cases out of \n3,000 in 17 years of judging.\n  I don't agree with this approach to analyzing her record. \nNonetheless, I agree with my colleague, Senator Graham--who is voting \nfor her after engaging in arguably the most searching examination of \nher speeches--that we are entitled to know who we are getting as a \nnation. He is absolutely right. Certainly it is appropriate to look at \nher speeches, but let us give them proper weight and proper context.\n  And let us be clear about another thing: Judge Sotomayor is no Robert \nBork. She is no Judge Roberts or Judge Alito. She has not made comments \noutside the courtroom that indicate her strong views on abortion or her \nviews that the power of Congress must be severely curtailed or that a \nsubstantial body of first amendment jurisprudence should be overturned. \nAgain, if the standard is extrajudicial statements, my colleagues seem \nto be using a different standard for Judge Sotomayor than the standard \nthey used for judges such as Roberts, Alito, and Thomas.\n  But let me give my friends some reassurance. The proof is in the \npudding. Judge Sotomayor is and always has been a moderate judge. \nSimilar to many judges across the country, she has remained neutral in \nrace cases, in spite of her race; in gender cases in spite of her \ngender; in first amendment cases in spite of racist and repugnant \nspeakers. The scales of justice in her courtroom are not weighted.\n  Let me now conclude by discussing the precedent set by past \nnominations--more broadly, where I think my colleagues are headed and \nwhere we ought to be going instead. In 2001, I wrote an op-ed arguing \nthat we need to take ideology into account when evaluating judges. I \nwrote that op-ed because I was astounded by the nominees President \nBush's administration was sending to the Senate.\n  The conservative movement had captured Congress and the White House \nfor the first time. But even though conservatives--strong \nconservatives, hard-right conservatives--controlled these two branches, \nthe hard right was not able to move the country as far to the right as \nthey had hoped. So they turned to the judiciary. They couldn't do it \nwith the President, even though they had elected him. They couldn't do \nit with the House or the Senate, even though, again, the hard right had \npredominated. So they turned to the one unelected branch--the \njudiciary--to advance the agenda they weren't able to move through the \ndemocratically elected branches of government.\n  The Bush administration complied with the hard right and nominated \njudges who were so far out of the mainstream it would have been \nirresponsible for us to confirm them blindly. So we asked them \nquestions about their judicial philosophy and their ideology, and our \nquestions were not met with thorough answers or with a demonstrated \nrecord of mainstream judging but with banalities or even obstinate \nsilence.\n\n  If we tried to rank the ideology of nominees on a scale of 1 to 10, \nwith 1 being all the way to the right, such as Judge Thomas, and 10 \nbeing all the way to the left, such as Justice Brennan, I think the \nBush nominees to the Supreme Court and court of appeals were almost \nexclusively 1's and 2's--way over. If you looked at President Clinton's \nnominees, they were somewhat left of center. But not much, mainly sixes \nand sevens--prosecutors, partners in law firms--not lawyers who had \nspent their careers in activist causes.\n  President Obama has taken a different approach. He is trying to \nreturn the Court to the middle, to the pre-Bush days, the days of \nhaving judges who may not be exactly what the right wants in a judge or \neven what the left--the far left--wants in a judge. We are returning to \nthe days where judges were fives and sixes and sevens--maybe fours. \nThey were squarely in the mainstream. We are returning to the days when \njudges put the rule of law first.\n  Somehow my Republican colleagues are aghast. The only judges they \nseem to want to vote for are ones and twos--judges who are on the hard \nright. The President is not going to nominate judges who have that \nview. After all, elections do matter.\n  My colleagues say they do not want activist judges. What they mean is \nthey do not want judges who will put the rule of law first. They only \nwant judges who will impose their own ultraconservative views. An \nactivist now seems to be not someone who respects the rule of law but \nsomeone who is not hard right. If you are mainstream, even though you \nare interpreting the law, you are an activist because you will not turn \nthe clock back.\n  We must and will continue to fight for mainstream judges.\n  I have heard some say this fight isn't about Judge Sotomayor, given \nher proven record of mainstream judging and fidelity to the law. These \ncommentators argue that Republicans are laying down their marker for \nPresident Obama's next nominee. I don't know who that nominee will be, \nbut I am confident it will be a qualified candidate who is \nsignificantly more in the mainstream, if you take the mainstream being \nthe actual place where the middle of America is--more in the mainstream \nthan Justices Thomas or Scalia or Roberts or Alito or some of the \nnominations we considered under the Bush administration, such as Miguel \nEstrada or Janice Rogers Brown or Charles Pickering. I am confident the \nnext nominee will be consistent with the nominees President Obama has \nbeen sending us--moderate, mainstream, and rule of law.\n  At one point, the Republican Party argued for precedent and for \nstrict construction because they wanted to push back on certain new \nprecedents they thought were beyond the Constitution--precedents such \nas Roe and Miranda. But things have changed. Americans have accepted \nRoe and Americans have accepted Miranda. Now my colleagues want to \nchange the law, so they have changed their methodology without changing \nthe nomenclature. They still call judges activist, even though they \nwant to stick to established law. I think it is a shame.\n  It is a shame that some of my colleagues can't put aside their own \npersonal ideology and vote for a judge whom they might not have chosen \nbut who is unquestionably mainstream. It is a shame we will not have \nthe kind of nearly unanimous vote in favor of this nominee that judges \non both sides of the aisle--from Justice Ginsburg to Justice Scalia--\nhave received in the past. I think it is a shame the debate about this \nhistoric nomination has\n\n[[Page S8818]]\n\nbeen distilled to disputes over snippets of speeches.\n  But we are not going to let that stop the national pride we take in \nthis moment. We are not going to let it stop us from confirming, by a \nbroad and bipartisan margin, Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be the first \nHispanic Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In conclusion, as John Adams said: ``We are a Nation of laws, not of \nmen.'' But if the law were just words on parchment, it would never \nevolve to reflect our own changing society. ``Separate but equal'' \nwould never have been understood to be ``inherently unequal.'' Equality \nfor women would never have been viewed as guaranteed under the \nConstitution's promise of equal protection under law. In fact, the \nsecond amendment might never have been viewed to extend beyond the \nright to possess a front-loading musket to defend, in a militia, \nagainst an occupying force.\n  With the nomination of Judge Sotomayor, we have an opportunity--a \nnoble opportunity--to restore faith in the notion that the courts \nshould reflect the same mainstream ideals that are embraced by America. \nOur independent judiciary has served as a beacon of justice for the \nrest of the world. Our system of checks and balances is the envy of \nevery freedom-seeking nation. As I look at the arc of Judge Sotomayor's \nlife, her record, and these hearings, I am confident we are getting a \nJustice who both reflects American values and who will serve them.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, every American should be proud that a \nHispanic woman has been nominated to serve on the Supreme Court. In \nfulfilling our advice and consent role, of course, Senators must \nevaluate Judge Sotomayor on her merits, not on the basis of her \nethnicity.\n  As I noted at the beginning of Judge Sotomayor's hearing, she has a \nbackground that creates a prima facie case for confirmation. She \ngraduated from Princeton University and Yale Law School and then was an \nassistant district attorney, a corporate litigator, a district court \njudge, and a circuit court judge.\n  This background led the American Bar Association to rate her ``Well \nQualified.'' My counterpart on the Democratic side, Senator Durbin, has \nsaid, ``The burden of proof for a Supreme Court Justice nominee is on \nthe nominee. . . . No one has a right to sit on the Supreme Court. . . \n. It is not enough for a nominee to be found well qualified by the \nAmerican Bar Association.''\n  It is obvious that the Senate cannot just rubberstamp the ABA. This \nis why we conduct our own evaluation of the nominee's background and \nrecord and then attempt to resolve outstanding questions at her \nhearing.\n  In evaluating a nominee, it is, of course, important to look at all \naspects of the person's career. The nominee's prior judicial opinions \nare obviously an important consideration in this process. A lower court \njudge who issues judicial opinions that are outside the mainstream \nwill, in all likelihood, continue to issue opinions that are outside \nthe mainstream if promoted to a higher court.\n  But even judicial opinions do not tell us the entire story, \nespecially when we are considering a nominee to the Supreme Court. \nDistrict and appellate court judges operate under the restraining \ninfluence of judicial review. They have a strong incentive to avoid \naberrant interpretations of the law, otherwise they risk embarrassment \nif cases are appealed to a higher authority. This check disappears, \nhowever, when a judge becomes a justice on the Supreme Court. There is \nno higher authority to reign in a lifetime-appointed Justice who \ndecides, for whatever reason, to adopt a strained interpretation of the \nlaw.\n  Nor will a nominee generally be very specific about how he or she may \nrule on matters that could come before the Court.\n  So it is important to examine anything else in a nominee's background \nthat could shed light on how the nominee really thinks about important \nissues. One source of information is a nominee's extrajudicial \nstatements in speeches and writings. In these contexts, the nominee is \nnot constrained by facts of particular cases, by precedents or the fear \nof appellate reprimand, but can say what he or she really thinks.\n  Before Judge Sotomayor's hearing, I studied not only her cases, but \nher extrajudicial writings, and a fraction of her speeches. I say a \n``fraction'' because Judge Sotomayor was either unable or unwilling to \nprovide a draft, video, or a sufficient topic description for more than \n100 of the speeches that she identified for the Judiciary Committee.\n  But even with less than a full complement of her relevant materials, \nI saw a number of things in Judge Sotomayor's decisions and speeches \nthat caused me to have great concern about her ability to put aside her \nbiases and to impartially render a decision to the parties before her.\n  As I will explain, Judge Sotomayor's appearance before the Judiciary \nCommittee did little to dispel my concerns. In many cases, her \ntestimony exacerbated them.\n  I was and remain particularly troubled by Judge Sotomayor's speeches \nabout gender and ethnicity. The speech that has garnered the most \nattention is, of course, her ``wise Latina woman'' speech, which was \npublished in the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal. As it turns out, Judge \nSotomayor delivered this same speech, with only minor variations, on \nmultiple occasions over the course of several years.\n  In reading these speeches in their entirety, it is inescapable that \nher purpose was not simply ``to inspire young Hispanic, Latino \nstudents, and lawyers,'' as she asserted at her hearing. In fact, as \nshe said at the beginning of several of these speeches, her purpose was \nto talk about ``my Latina identity, where it came from, and the \ninfluence I perceive it has on my presence on the bench.''\n  Judge Sotomayor reemphasized this theme later in her speeches. She \nsaid: ``The focus of my speech tonight, however, is not about the \nstruggle to get us where we are and where we need to go, but instead to \ndiscuss . . . what . . . it will mean to have more women and people of \ncolor on the bench.''\n  She continued: ``[N]o one can or should ignore pondering what it will \nmean or not mean in the development of the law.'' In these speeches, \nshe cited statements of some who had a different point of view than \nhers. Then she came back to her overriding theme: ``I accept the \nproposition that, as Judge Resnik describes it, `to judge is an \nexercise of power,' and because as . . . Professor Martha Minnow of \nHarvard Law School states `there is no objective stance but only a \nseries of perspectives--no neutrality, no escape from choice in \njudging. . . .' ''\n  I believe judges must seek objective truth as found in the law of the \ncase. I do not believe in judicial relativism, so I find her comment \nalarming. The essence of judging is neutrality. That is why Lady \nJustice is depicted with a blindfold. And that is why Federal judges \nare required to swear an oath to ``administer justice without respect \nto persons, and do equal right to the poor and to the rich'' and to \n``faithfully and impartially discharge all of the duties incumbent on \n[her].'' That oath makes no allowance for a judge to choose the result \nbased on his or her ``perspective.'' The oath requires exactly the \nopposite: a dispassionate adherence to impartiality and the rule of \nlaw.\n  Now, back to Judge Sotomayor's speech. After agreeing with law \nprofessors who say that there is no objective stance, only a series of \nperspectives, no neutrality, Judge Sotomayor then said, ``I further \naccept that our experiences as women and people of color will in some \nway affect our decisions. . . . What Professor Minnow's quote means to \nme is not all women or people of color, in all or some circumstances, \nor me in any particular case or circumstance, but enough women and \npeople of color in enough cases will make a difference in the process \nof judging. Judge Sotomayor is talking here about different outcomes in \ncases based upon who the judge is. She goes on to substantiate her case \nby citing an outcome in a State court father's visitation case and two \nstudies, which tended to demonstrate differences between women and men \nin making decisions in cases. She said, ``As recognized by legal \nscholars, whatever the reason, not one woman or person of color in any \none\n\n[[Page S8819]]\n\nposition, but as a group, we will have an effect on the development of \nlaw and on judging.'' She continued: ``our gender and national origins \nmake and will make a difference in our judging.''\n\n  To recap: Judge Sotomayor announced her topic, developed the theme, \nrefuted the arguments of those with a different view, and substantiated \nher point of view with some evidence. Up to this point, she had made \nthe case that gender or ethnicity will have an impact on the way judges \ndecide cases. She had not rendered a judgment about whether this \ninfluence would provide better outcomes from her perspective.\n  This is the context of the ``wise Latina'' comment. Judge Sotomayor \nquoted Justice O'Connor who said that a wise old woman and a wise old \nman would reach the same decisions. But, Judge Sotomayor said, ``I am \nalso not sure I agree with that statement. . . . I would hope that a \nwise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would, more \noften than not, reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't \nlived that life.''\n  Judge Sotomayor concluded, in other words, that, not only will gender \nand ethnicity make a difference, but that they should make a \ndifference. She then acknowledged that some White male judges had made \nsome good decisions in the past, but seemed to complain that it took a \nlot of time and effort, something that not all people are willing to \ngive, and so on.\n  Judge Sotomayor concluded by saying, ``In short, I accept the \nproposition that a difference will be made by the presence of women and \npeople of color on the bench and that my experiences will affect the \nfacts that I choose to see as a judge.'' Judge Sotomayor added, ``I \nsimply do not know exactly what that difference will be in my judging. \nBut I accept there will be some based on gender and my Latina \nheritage.''\n  Even if the point of her speech was just to inspire young people or \neven to explore the question of whether judges could be influenced by \ntheir background, she should not have simply ``accepted'' that result. \nTo conclude that judges could not avoid being so influenced and then \nnot admonish that, of course, a judge must try his or her best to avoid \nthat result, to try to set aside any bias and prejudice, was to \nabdicate her role as a judge in teaching her audiences.\n  Never, not once, in her speech, did she say that the biases she \ndiscussed were harmful to impartial judging and needed to be set aside. \nInstead, Judge Sotomayor's speeches seem to be celebrating these \ndifferences, these biases. The clear and unmistakable inference in her \nspeeches is that she embraces the fact that minorities and women will \nreach a different outcome, indeed, a ``better'' outcome.\n  Before the Judiciary Committee, Judge Sotomayor refused to recant the \nspeeches or acknowledge this egregious omission. But she did try \ndesperately to convince committee members that her words conveyed a \nmessage other than the obvious one. Indeed, according to Judge \nSotomayor, her words conveyed the exact opposite meaning. She said: ``I \nwas talking about the very important goal of the justice system is to \nensure that the personal biases and prejudices of a judge do not \ninfluence the outcome of a case. What I was talking about was the \nobligation of judges to examine what they're feeling as they're \nadjudicating a case and to ensure that that's not influencing the \noutcome.'' I've read the speeches in their entirety many times, and \nhave verified that that is most certainly not what she was ``talking \nabout.''\n\n  Judge Sotomayor's recharacterization of her speeches before the \nJudiciary Committee sounds like the objective, neutral approach that \nher speech explicitly dismissed. It is hard to understand how the same \nperson could honestly make both statements. They are irreconcilably \nantithetical.\n  Further examples abound, but for the sake of time I will offer only \none more. When Judge Sotomayor tried to explain her disagreement with \nJustice O'Connor's statement about how a wise old man and a wise old \nwoman would reach the same conclusions, she said: ``The words that I \nused, I used agreeing with the sentiment that Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor was attempting to convey.'' That's not true. Her explanation \nstrains credulity. Both as to whether she really believes judges should \ntry to set aside biases, including those based on race and gender, and \nthe basic element of judicial temperament, forthrightness and fidelity \nto the oath of truth she took before the Judiciary Committee, I \nconclude she did not carry the very low burden of proof.\n  I also would like to discuss another of Judge Sotomayor's speeches, \nan address to the Puerto Rican ACLU on the subject of foreign law. But \nfirst, I should take a moment to explain why this issue is so critical.\n  There is a growing school of thought among some academics, and even \nsome judges, that foreign law and practices should be used as an aid to \nunderstanding and interpreting our own laws and Constitution. This is \nproblematic for two main reasons.\n  First, as Chief Justice John Roberts pointed out during his \nconfirmation hearing, the consideration of foreign law by American \njudges is contrary to principles of democracy. Foreign judges and \nlegislators are not accountable to the American electorate. Using \nforeign law, even as a thumb on the scale, to help decide key \nconstitutional issues devalues Americans' expressions through the \ndemocratic process. It is simply irrelevant, except in a very few \nspecific situations.\n  Second, even if the use of foreign law were not inconsistent with our \nconstitutional system, its use would free judges to enact their \npersonal preferences under the cloak of legitimacy.\n  Against this backdrop, Judge Sotomayor delivered her April 28, 2009, \nspeech entitled, ``How Federal Judges Look to International and Foreign \nLaw Under Article VI of the U.S. Constitution.'' From that speech, we \nbegin to see how foreign law could shape Judge Sotomayor's \njurisprudence in the future. Her comments were not casual observations, \nbut directed to this specific topic, and, presumably says what she \nmeans.\n  After conceding that judges ``don't use foreign or international \nlaw'' as binding precedent in a case, she nonetheless maintained that \nforeign law could, and should, be ``considered.'' In Judge Sotomayor's \nview, foreign law is a source for ``good ideas'' that can ``set our \n[i.e., judges'] creative juices flowing.'' Putting aside for a moment \nthe fact that deciding an antitrust case, or a commerce clause dispute, \nor an Indian law issue, or an establishment of religion case does not \nrequire ``creative juices,'' Judge Sotomayor's suggestion that judges \nconsider foreign law would interfere with specific rules of \nconstruction or application of precedent.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor went on in this same ACLU speech to distance herself \nfrom two sitting justices who are critical of judges considering \nforeign law and align her views with those of Justice Ginsburg who \nrecently endorsed the use of foreign law at a symposium at the Moritz \nCollege of Law at Ohio State University.\n  Specifically, Judge Sotomayor stated that ``[t]he nature of the \ncriticism comes from . . . the misunderstanding of the American use of \nthat concept of using foreign law. And that misunderstanding is \nunfortunately endorsed by some of our own Supreme Court justices. Both \nJustice Scalia and Justice Thomas have written extensive criticisms of \nthe use of foreign and international law in Supreme Court decisions. . \n. .''\n  She continues: ``I share more the ideas of Justice Ginsburg in \nthinking . . . that unless American courts are more open to discussing \nthe ideas raised by foreign cases, and by international cases, that we \nare going to lose influence in the world. Justice Ginsburg has \nexplained very recently . . . that foreign opinions . . . can add to \nthe story of knowledge relevant to the solution of a question. And \nshe's right.\n  Judge Sotomayor's rationale for judges looking to foreign law--so \nthat the United States does not ``lose influence in he world''--is \nastonishing. Not only is such an approach irrelevant to the role of \njudges, vis-a-vis the other branches of government, and arguably \nusually irrelevant even for the President and Congress as a yardstick \nwith which to measure U.S. domestic and foreign policy, it is totally \nirrelevant to the considerations for deciding any particular dispute \nbetween two parties.\n  In response to questions from committee members concerned about these \nkinds of statements, Judge Sotomayor again tried to drastically \nrecharacterize her prior statements. She testified that her speech was \nquite clear\n\n[[Page S8820]]\n\nthat ``foreign law cannot be used as a holding or a precedent or to \nbind or to influence the outcome of a legal decision interpreting the \nConstitution or American law that doesn't direct you to that law.'' But \nin April of this year, Judge Sotomayor said, ``ideas are ideas, and \nwhatever their source, whether they come from foreign law or \ninternational law, or a trial judge in Alabama, or a circuit court in \nCalifornia, or any other place, if the idea has validity, if it \npersuades you, then you are going to adopt its reasoning.'' These two \nstatements cannot be squared, even though they occurred just 2\\1/2\\ \nmonths apart.\n  Later in her hearing, Judge Sotomayor gave the following testimony: \n``I will not use foreign law to interpret the Constitution or American \nstatues. I will use American law, constitutional law to interpret those \nlaws except in the situations where American law directs the court.'' \nWhile this kind of declarative statement would normally provide some \nmeasure of comfort, it is belied by words Judge Sotomayor uttered less \nthan 3 months ago, that judges were ``commanded'' to look to \n``persuasive'' sources, including foreign law, in interpreting our own \nlaw. And it is even inconsistent with an exchange Judge Sotomayor had \nwith Senator Schumer earlier in the hearing, in which she agreed that \nforeign law could be used for the same purposes as traditional \ninterpretive tools, such as dictionaries.\n\n  It gives me great pause that Judge Sotomayor could say one thing at a \npublic speech earlier this year and say the opposite while under oath \nbefore the Judiciary Committee, especially since she never repudiated \nher speech.\n  Finally, when Judge Sotomayor had an opportunity to reflect upon her \ntestimony, review the transcript, and correct the record, she reverted \nto her former position by spinning the meaning of the word ``use.''\n  Specifically, as I just noted, in her hearing before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, Judge Sotomayor testified under oath that \n``foreign law cannot be used as a holding or a precedent or to bind or \nto influence the outcome of a legal decision interpreting the \nConstitution or American law that doesn't direct you to that law.'' In \nwritten answers submitted for the record she wrote, ``In my view, \nAmerican courts should not `use' foreign law, in the sense of relying \non decisions of foreign courts as binding or controlling precedent, \nexcept when American law requires a court to do so. In limited \ncircumstances, decisions of foreign courts can be a source of ideas, \njust as law review articles or treatises can be sources of ideas. \nReading the decisions of foreign courts for ideas, however, does not \nconstitute `using' those decisions to decide cases.''\n  So we are back to ``considering,'' but not ``using.'' Or is it, using \nas ideas, but not binding precedent? And if so, of what use are ideas \nif not used in some way? And if used in some way, could they influence \nthe decision? I am totally baffled how she could consider foreign law \nas a source of ideas consistent with her testimony that foreign law \nshould not influence the outcome of cases. Effectively, immediately \nafter the hearing, she rescinded her sworn testimony regarding foreign \nlaw.\n  Judge Sotomayor's supporters argue that we should not focus on her \nspeeches, but on her ``mainstream'' judicial record. They cite all \nmanner of statistics that purport to show that Judge Sotomayor agreed \nwith her colleagues, including Republican appointees, the vast majority \nof the time. That may be true; but, as President Obama has reminded us, \nmost judges will agree in 95 percent of all cases. The hard cases are \nwhere differences in judicial philosophy become apparent.\n  I have looked at Judge Sotomayor's record in these hard cases and \nagain have found cause for concern. The U.S. Supreme Court has reviewed \ndirectly ten of her decisions--eight of those decisions have been \nreversed or vacated, another sharply criticized, and one upheld in a 5-\n4 decision. Indeed, just in the past 4 months, the Supreme Court has \nreversed Judge Sotomayor's panels three times. That does not inspire \nconfidence.\n  The most recent reversal is a case in point. In Ricci v. DeStefano, a \ncase where Judge Sotomayor summarily dismissed before trial the \ndiscrimination claims of 20 New Haven firefighters, the Supreme Court \nreversed 5-4, with all nine Justices rejecting key reasoning of Judge \nSotomayor's court. But in my view, the most astounding thing about the \ncase was not the incorrect outcome reached by Judge Sotomayor's court; \nit was that she rejected the firefighters' claims in a mere one \nparagraph opinion and that she continued to maintain in the hearings \nthat she was bound by precedent that the Supreme Court said didn't \nexist.\n  As the Supreme Court noted, Ricci presented a novel issue regarding \n``two provisions of Title VII to be interpreted and reconciled, with \nfew, if any, precedents in the court of appeals discussing the issue.'' \nOne would think that this would be precisely the kind of case that \ndeserved a thorough and thoughtful analysis by an appellate court.\n  But Judge Sotomayor's court instead disposed of the case in an \nunsigned and unpublished opinion that contained zero--and I do mean \nzero--analysis. This is confounding given Judge Sotomayor's Judiciary \nCommittee testimony, in which she said: ``I believe my 17-year record \non the two courts would show that in every case that I render, I first \ndecide what the law requires under the facts before me, and that what I \ndo is explained to litigants why the law requires a result. And whether \ntheir position is sympathetic or not, I explain why the result is \ncommanded by law.''\n  Because her initial decision was unpublished, the case--and the \nfirefighters' meritorious claims--would have been swept under the rug \nand lost forever if not for fellow Second Circuit Judge Jose Cabranes, \nwho read about the firefighters' case in a local newspaper, the New \nHaven Register.\n  Judge Cabranes looked into the situation, recognized the importance \nof the case, and requested that the entire Second Circuit, including \njudges who were not involved in the original decision, rehear the case. \nBy a vote of 7-6, the Second Circuit denied rehearing the case, with \nJudge Sotomayor providing the seventh and decisive vote to avoid \nfurther consideration of her panel's decision. Fortunately for the \nfirefighters, Judge Cabranes wrote a blistering dissent that no doubt \ncaught the attention of the Supreme Court. He charged that Judge \nSotomayor and her panel had ``failed to grapple with the questions of \nexceptional importance raised in this appeal.''\n  Some have speculated that the Judge Sotomayor's panel intentionally \ndisposed of the case in a short, unsigned, and unpublished opinion in \nan effort to hide it from further scrutiny. Was the case intentionally \nkept off of her colleagues' radar? Did she have personal views on \nracial quotas that prevented her from seeing the merit in the \nfirefighters' claims? Was it is merely coincidence that the standard \nadopted by Judge Sotomayor--which in the Supreme Court's words ``would \nencourage race-based action at the slightest hint of disparate impact'' \nand would lead to a ``de facto quota system''--was consistent with \npolicy and legal positions advocated by the Puerto Rican Legal Defense \nand Education Fund, an organization with which she was intimately \ninvolved for 12 years? In repeated speeches through the years, Judge \nSotomayor said, ``I . . . accept that our experiences as women and \npeople of color affect our decisions.'' Was this such a case?\n  Judge Sotomayor was asked about her Ricci decision at length during \nthe confirmation hearing. Her defense was that she was just following \n``established Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedent.'' The problem \nwith this answer is that Ricci presented a novel question for which \nthere were no Supreme Court precedents squarely on point. Indeed, the \nSupreme Court noted that there were ``few, if any'' circuit court \nopinions addressing the issue.\n  During the hearing, I pressed Judge Sotomayor to identify those \ncontrolling Supreme Court and Second Circuit precedents that allegedly \ndictated the outcome in Ricci. Rather than answer the question, she \ndissembled and ran out the clock. Perhaps that was because, as \nJudge Cabranes's dissent stated, the ``core issue presented by this \ncase--the scope of a municipal employer's authority to disregard \nexamination results based solely on the race of the successful \napplicants--is not addressed by any precedent of the Supreme Court or \nour Circuit.'' But even\n\n[[Page S8821]]\n\nif we accept Judge Sotomayor's contention that there was some relevant \nSecond Circuit precedent, it is quite clear that such cases would not \nbind her or other judges in considering en banc review. It is telling \nthat even the Obama Justice Department found her legal position \nimpossible to defend. It filed a brief in the case asking the Supreme \nCourt to vacate and remand the case for further proceedings, \nessentially what the dissent favored, as well.\n\n  The truth is that we will never know the reasons that guided the \noutcome of the case. But we know, at the very least, that Judge \nSotomayor exercised poor judgment in dismissing serious claims in an \nunsettled area of the law without engaging in an analysis of the \nissues. As Judge Cabranes wrote in dissenting from the denial of \nrehearing en banc: ``The use of per curiam opinions of this sort, \nadopting in full the reasoning of a district court without further \nelaboration, is normally reserved for cases that present straight-\nforward questions that do not require explanation or elaboration by the \nCourt of Appeals. The questions raised in this appeal cannot be \nclassified as such, as they are indisputably complex and far from well-\nsettled.''\n  Clearly, Judge Sotomayor did not adequately explain to the \nlitigants--or the Judiciary Committee--why the law required the result \nshe supported. And she cast the decisive vote to ensure that the full \ncircuit court could not review the case. Is this the kind of behavior \nwe should expect of a judge who is seeking a promotion to the Supreme \nCourt?\n  Finally, if I had been a litigant before her court and Judge \nSotomayor had asked me the questions I asked her about Ricci, and had I \n``answered'' them as she responded to me in the hearing, she would \nrightly have told me to either sit down or start answering her \nquestions. Her ``answers'' answered nothing and, in my opinion, \nviolated her obligation to be forthcoming with the Judiciary Committee\n  Ricci is not the only Judge Sotomayor decision that gives reason to \nquestion her commitment to impartial justice. I am concerned about her \nanalysis--or lack thereof--in Maloney v. Cuomo, a second amendment case \nthat could find its way to the Supreme Court next year. Maloney was \ndecided after the Supreme Court's landmark ruling in District of \nColumbia v. Heller, which held that the right to bear arms was an \nindividual right that could not be taken away by the Federal \nGovernment.\n  In Maloney, Judge Sotomayor had the opportunity to consider whether \nthat individual right could also be enforced against the States, a \nquestion that was not before the Heller court. In yet another unsigned \nopinion, Judge Sotomayor and two other judges held that it was not a \nright enforceable against States.\n  What are the legal implications of this holding? State regulations \nlimiting or prohibiting the ownership and use of firearms would be \nsubject only to ``rational basis'' review. As Sandy Froman, a respected \nlawyer and former president of the National Rifle Association, said in \nher witness testimony, this is a ``very, very low threshold'' that can \neasily be met by a State or city that wishes to prohibit all gun \nownership, even in the home. Thus, if Judge Sotomayor's decision were \nallowed to stand as precedent, then states will, ironically, be able to \ndo what the Federal District of Columbia cannot--place a de facto \nprohibition on the ownership of guns and other arms.\n\n  Some have suggested that Judge Sotomayor's decision is not cause for \nalarm. They say that she was simply following precedent and that the \nMaloney case is not necessarily indicative of what she would do if \nconfirmed to the Supreme Court. And they point to a recent decision by \nthe Seventh Circuit, which similarly refused to apply the second \namendment to State regulations. Apart from the fact that her ruling is \nnow binding in the States covered by the Second Circuit, there is a \ncritical difference between Judge Sotomayor's decision and that of the \nSeventh Circuit.\n  While the judges on the Seventh Circuit explicitly declined to decide \nwhat will be the key issue before the Supreme Court--whether the Second \nAmendment's right to bear arms is, in legal parlance, ``fundamental,'' \nand therefore enforceable against states as well as the Federal \nGovernment--Judge Sotomayor's perfunctory decision did not leave this \nquestion open. Her panel specifically concluded, without any \nexplanation, that the right to bear arms is in fact not a \n``fundamental'' right a conclusion that, to the best of my knowledge, \nno other court has ever reached--and that, as Sandy Froman noted, \n``would rob the Second Amendment of any real meaning and would trample \non the individual rights of America's nearly 90 million gun owners.'' \nIndeed, Judge Sotomayor's assessment stands in stark contrast to the \nSupreme Court's own opinion in Heller, which not once but twice refers \nto the right to bear arms as ``fundamental.'' It is hard, if not \nimpossible, to square these facts with Judge Sotomayor's repeated \nassertions, in sworn testimony before the Judiciary Committee, that she \nwas just following precedent.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor's opinion in Maloney is extraordinary both for its \nlack of serious analysis and for reaching an unprecedented conclusion \nthat was wholly unnecessary. She could have as easily chosen the path \ntaken by the seventh circuit, and reserved for the Supreme Court the \nopportunity to decide in the first instance whether the right to bear \narms is ``fundamental.'' Or, like the ninth circuit, she could have \nundertaken a thorough analysis of the issue and determined that the \nright is, indeed, fundamental. She did neither.\n  As Sandy Froman stated:\n\n       When faced with the most important question remaining after \n     Heller, whether the right to keep and bear arms is \n     fundamental and applies to the states, Judge Sotomayor \n     dismissed the issue with no substantive analysis. . . . By \n     failing to conduct a proper Fourteenth Amendment analysis, \n     the Maloney court evaded its judicial responsibilities, \n     offered no guidance to lower courts and provided no \n     assistance in framing the issue for resolution by the Supreme \n     Court. Whenever an appellate judge fails to provide \n     supporting analysis for their conclusion or address serious \n     constitutional issues presented by the case, it is legitimate \n     to ask whether the judge reached that conclusion by \n     application of the Constitution and statutes or based on a \n     political or social agenda.\n\n  I agree. I did not expect or even want Judge Sotomayor to precommit \nto a particular reading of the second amendment. The Judiciary \nCommittee did, however, have a right to receive from her an explanation \nof the Maloney decision. At the very least she could have been more \nforthcoming in response to questions regarding recusal, but she would \nnot even commit to recusing herself from the Supreme Court's \nconsideration of her own Maloney decision if it were taken up as part \nof a consolidated appeal.\n  I think it is fair to say that Judge Sotomayor's testimony about the \nsecond amendment raised more questions than it answered. The issue of \nincorporation is bound to come before the Supreme Court. Those of us \nwho support the right of the people to keep and bear arms should be \nvery concerned about the position she has already taken and the fact \nthat she has clearly reserved the option of reviewing the case on the \nCourt she could be confirmed to, particularly on a matter she has \nalready decided.\n  As we have seen, Judge Sotomayor's testimony about her previous \nspeeches and some of her decisions is difficult, if not impossible, to \nreconcile with her record. Similarly, her testimony about the extent of \nher role with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund is in \ntension with the evidence we have.\n  At her hearing, Judge Sotomayor tried to downplay her role at PRLDEF. \nShe said:\n\n       I was not like Justice Ginsburg or Justice Marshall. I was \n     not a lawyer on the fund as they were, with respect to the \n     organizations they belonged to. I was a board member.\n\n  In emphasizing her role as a long-time board member, Judge Sotomayor \ndeflected attention from her service in litigation-focused positions, \nsuch as her 8 years on the litigation committee and the 4 years she \nserved as that committee's chairperson. As anyone who is familiar with \nadvocacy and public interest groups can attest, it is inconceivable \nthat the chair of an organization's litigation committee would not have \na significant role in shaping the organization's legal strategy.\n  Moreover, Judge Sotomayor's testimony that ``it was not my practice \nand not that I know of, of any board member'' to review briefs, is \nundermined by\n\n[[Page S8822]]\n\nPRLDEF's own meeting minutes. For example, on October 8, 1978:\n\n       [Litigation Committee] Chairperson Sotomayor summarized the \n     activities of the Committee over the last several months \n     which included the review of the litigation efforts of the \n     past and present. . . .\n\n  The New York Times has detailed her active involvement, as recounted \nby former PRLDEF colleagues, who have described Judge Sotomayor as a \n``top policy maker'' who ``played an active role as the defense fund \nstaked out aggressive stances.'' According to these reports, she \n``frequently met with the legal staff to review the status of cases'' \nand ``was an involved and ardent supporter of their various legal \nefforts during her time with the group.''\n  What were the litigation positions advanced by PRLDEF during Judge \nSotomayor's tenure there? Well, it argued in court briefs that \nrestrictions on abortion are analogous to slavery. And it repeatedly \nrepresented plaintiffs challenging the validity of employment and \npromotional tests--tests similar to the one at issue in Ricci.\n  I want to return to a question I raised in my opening statement of \nJudge Sotomayor's hearing: What is the traditional basis for judging in \nAmerica?\n  For 220 years, Presidents and the Senate have focused on appointing \nand confirming judges and Justices who are committed to putting aside \ntheir biases and prejudices and applying the law fairly and impartially \nto resolve disputes between parties.\n  This principle is universally recognized and shared by judges across \nthe wide ideological spectrum. For instance, Judge Richard Paez of the \nninth circuit--with whom I disagree on a number of issues--explained \nthis in the same venue where, less than 24 hours earlier, Judge \nSotomayor made her remarks about a ``wise Latina woman'' making better \ndecisions than other judges. Judge Paez described the instructions that \nhe gives to jurors who are about to hear a case. ``As jurors,'' he \nsaid, ``recognize that you might have some bias, or prejudice. \nRecognize that it exists, and determine whether you can control it so \nthat you can judge the case fairly. Because if you cannot--if you \ncannot set aside those prejudices, biases and passions--then you should \nnot sit on the case.''\n  And then Judge Paez said:\n\n       The same principle applies to judges. We take an oath of \n     office. At the federal level, it is a very interesting oath. \n     It says, in part, that you promise or swear to do justice to \n     both the poor and the rich. The first time I heard this oath, \n     I was startled by its significance. I have my oath hanging on \n     the wall in the office to remind me of my obligations. And \n     so, although I am a Latino judge and there is no question \n     about that--I am viewed as a Latino judge--as I judge cases, \n     I try to judge them fairly. I try to remain faithful to my \n     oath.\n\n  What Judge Paez said has been the standard for 220 years. It \ncorrectly describes the fundamental and proper role both for jurors and \njudges.\n  Before the hearing, my biggest question about Judge Sotomayor was \nwhether she could abide by that standard. We spent 3 days asking her \nquestions, trying to understand what she meant in some of her \ncontroversial speeches and what drove her to questionable conclusions \nin cases such as Ricci and Maloney.\n  Judge Sotomayor did not dispel my concerns. Her sworn testimony was \nevasive, lacking in substance, and, in several instances, incredibly \nmisleading.\n  Her dissembling was widely noticed. Indeed, in an editorial, the \nWashington Post criticized Judge Sotomayor's testimony about her ``wise \nLatina'' statement. Here is what the Washington Post said:\n\n       Judge Sotomayor's attempts to explain away and distance \n     herself from that statement were unconvincing and at times \n     uncomfortably close to disingenuous, especially when she \n     argued that her reason for raising questions about gender or \n     race was to warn against injecting personal biases into the \n     judicial process. Her repeated and lengthy speeches on the \n     matter do not support that interpretation.\n\n  Until now, Judge Sotomayor has been operating under the restraining \ninfluence of a higher authority--the Supreme Court. If confirmed, there \nwould be no such restraint that would prevent Judge Sotomayor from--to \nparaphrase President Obama--deciding cases based on her heartfelt \nviews.\n  If the burden is on the nominee to prove herself worthy of a lifetime \nappointment to the Nation's highest Court, she must do more than avoid \na ``meltdown'' in her testimony. She must be able to rationalize \ncontradictory statements--assuming she does not repudiate one or the \nother--such as the differences between her speeches and her committee \ntestimony. Her failure to do that has left me unpersuaded that Judge \nSotomayor is absolutely committed to setting aside her biases and \nimpartially deciding cases based upon the rule of law.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor is obviously intelligent, experienced, and talented. \nShe represents one of the greatest things about America--the \nopportunity to become whatever you want with your God-given abilities. \nShe is a role model for young women, as well as minorities, \nspecifically. She is personable and, apparently, hard working. I \nrespect the views of those who regard her well.\n  Moreover, I appreciate her many declarations during the hearing that \njudges must decide cases solely on the basis of the facts and the law; \nand especially her disagreement with the President's erroneous, I \nbelieve, formulations that, in the hard cases, a judge should rely on \nempathy and what is in his or her heart.\n  It may have been possible to vote to confirm her notwithstanding her \ndecisions in Ricci, Maloney, and some other questionable cases. What I \ncannot abide, however, is her unwillingness to forthrightly confront \nthe contradictions among her many statements, so as to give us \nconfidence that her Judiciary Committee testimony represents what she \nbelieves and what she will do. Instead, she would have us believe that \nthere is no contradiction, that she can hold onto what she said before \nin speeches and decisions--for example, that she merely followed \nSupreme Court and circuit precedent in Maloney, and that the dissenters \nin Ricci did not disagree with her reasoning--and also her testimony.\n  I cannot ignore her unwillingness to answer Senators' questions \nstraightforwardly--for instance, her insistence that as chair of \nPRLDEF's litigation committee, she had little to do with the \norganization's legal positions. She has not carried her burden of proof \nand, therefore, regrettably, I cannot vote to confirm her.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8822-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume the 1-hour alternating blocks of time with the Republicans \ncontrolling the first hour.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the Republican time for the \nnext hour be allocated as follows: Myself, 15 minutes; Senator Snowe, \n30 minutes; and Senator Brownback, 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor to be a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court. Judge \nSotomayor comes to the Senate with a compelling personal story and \nnotable professional accomplishments. She has worked as a prosecutor, a \ncorporate attorney, and then as a Federal district court and circuit \ncourt judge. And, after meeting with Judge Sotomayor and visiting with \nher, I like her. She is a very kind and affable person.\n  Certainly Judge Sotomayor has an impressive resume; however, the \nSenate's inquiry into her suitability for a seat on the Supreme Court \ndoes not end with her professional accomplishments. Equally important \nto our providing ``consent'' on this nomination is our determination \nthat Judge Sotomayor has the appropriate judicial philosophy for the \nSupreme Court. Judge Sotomayor needed to prove to the Senate that she \nwill adhere to the\n\n[[Page S8823]]\n\nproper role of a judge and only base her opinions on the plain language \nof the U.S. Constitution and statutes. She needed to demonstrate that \nshe will strictly interpret the Constitution and our laws and will not \nbe swayed by her personal biases or political preferences. As Alexander \nHamilton stated in Federalist Paper No. 78 ``the interpretation of the \nlaw is the proper and peculiar province of the courts. The constitution \n. . . must be regarded by the judges as a fundamental law.'' Hamilton \nfurther stated that it was ``indispensable in the courts of justice'' \nthat judges have an ``inflexible and uniform adherence to the rights of \nthe Constitution.'' A nominee who does not adhere to these standards \nnecessarily rejects the role of a judge as dictated by the Constitution \nand should not be confirmed.\n  With regard to judicial philosophy, the burden of proof always rests \non the nominee. But, in Judge Sotomayor's case, that burden was \nexacerbated by her prior speeches and statements. President Obama \npromised to nominate someone ``who's got the heart, the empathy, to \nrecognize what it's like to be a young teenage mom. The empathy to \nunderstand what it's like to be poor, or African-American, or gay, or \ndisabled, or old.'' Senator Obama referred to his empathy standard when \nhe voted against Chief Justice John Roberts. He stated that the tough \ncases ``can only be determined on the basis of one's deepest values, \none's core concerns, one's broader perspectives on how the world works, \nand the depth and breadth of one's empathy.'' She meets his standard \nbut not mine. The President's ``empathy'' standard is antithetical to \nthe proper role of a judge. The American people expect a judge to be a \nneutral arbiter who treats all litigants equally. There is a reason why \nLady Justice is always depicted blindfolded and why Aristotle defined \nlaw as ``reason free from passion.'' The judicial oath succinctly \nexpresses this ideal by requiring judges to swear that they ``will \nadminister justice without respect to persons, and do equal right to \nthe poor and to the rich, and . . . will faithfully and impartially \ndischarge and perform all the duties incumbent upon them under the \nConstitution and laws of the United States.''\n  During her hearing, I was pleased to hear Judge Sotomayor disavow \nthis empathy standard. In response to a question asking whether empathy \nshould play a role in a judge's decision, Judge Sotomayor responded, \n``We apply law to facts. We don't apply feelings to facts.'' She \nfurther stated that she ``wouldn't approach the issue of judging in the \nway the President does. . . . judges can't rely on what's in their \nheart. They don't determine the law. Congress makes the laws. The job \nof a judge is to apply the law. And so it's not the heart that compels \nconclusions in cases. It's the law.'' While I was encouraged to hear \nJudge Sotomayor's testimony, I am concerned that these statements and \nher other testimony were a dramatic departure from her earlier \nstatements. So, I am left wondering: Which Judge Sotomayor are we \ngetting?\n  I believe a person speaks from their heart when they discuss matters \nthat are most important to them. On numerous occasions, most notably \nwhen she was teaching and guiding law students and bar associations, \nJudge Sotomayor made some impassioned statements about the role of a \njudge, which contradict her testimony at the hearing. Speaking in 2002, \nJudge Sotomayor said: ``I wonder whether achieving that goal--of \ntranscending personal sympathies and prejudices and aspiring to achieve \na greater degree of fairness and integrity based on the reason of law--\nis possible in all or even in most cases. And I wonder whether by \nignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice \nboth to the law and society.'' This statement is of extraordinary \nconcern to me. Not only does Judge Sotomayor's statement indicate that \nshe cannot set aside her personal sympathies and prejudices ``in most \ncases,'' but she does not appear to believe that this goal is even an \nadmirable one.\n  Even more concerning, Judge Sotomayor stated prior to her hearing \nthat ``[p]ersonal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to \nsee'' and ``our gender and national origins may and will make a \ndifference in our judging.'' It seems to me, and I think to most \nAmericans, that the facts of a case are pretty clear and, if a judge is \npicking and choosing the facts they see based on their personal \nexperiences, then they cannot possibly be impartial arbiters. I believe \nPresident Adams said it best when he stated: ``Facts are stubborn \nthings . . . and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the \ndictums of our passions, they cannot alter the state of facts and \nevidence.'' I am disturbed that Judge Sotomayor does not agree with \nPresident Adams's assessment.\n  Prior to her hearing testimony, she also stated that ``court of \nappeals is where policy is made.'' This statement is in stark contrast \nto her hearing testimony, and that contradiction is deeply disturbing \nto me. I think Judge Sotomayor believes what she said previously in her \nspeeches, and when you believe in something, I think you should stand \nup and defend it. You should explain why you can still be a good judge \neven though you made those statements. That is what I wanted and \nexpected to hear from her during her hearing. I was disappointed that \nshe chose to dodge questions and obfuscate her record.\n  I was even more concerned that Judge Sotomayor reversed herself when \ndiscussing her judicial philosophy on the use of foreign law by U.S. \njudges. Results-oriented, activist judges who seek to rule based on \ntheir personal sympathies and prejudices often look to foreign law when \ninterpreting our statutes and the Constitution in order to reach their \ndesired outcome, and so I was deeply troubled by some of Judge \nSotomayor's earlier statements that endorsed the use of foreign law by \nU.S. judges. Justice Scalia succinctly articulated the problem with \nusing foreign law in his dissent from a recent Supreme Court opinion, \nRoper v. Simmons. The majority decision in Roper cited the worldwide \n``evolving standards of decency'' to strike down a statute that allowed \njudges to impose capital punishment for juveniles, even for the most \nheinous crimes. In his dissent, Justice Scalia asserted that the \npractice of relying on foreign law inevitably leads to judicial \nactivism. He argued that ``[w]hat these foreign sources `affirm,' \nrather than repudiate, is the Justices' own notion of how the world \nought to be, and their diktat that it shall be so henceforth in \nAmerica.''\n  I agree with Justice Scalia's assessment. Unfortunately, judging by \nher statements, Judge Sotomayor does not. During her hearing, I asked \nJudge Sotomayor about a recent speech she gave in which she stated that \nprohibiting the use of foreign law would mean judges would have to \n``close their minds to good ideas'' and that it is her ``hope'' that \njudges will continue to consult foreign law when interpreting our \nConstitution and statutes. In that speech, she condemned Justices \nScalia and Thomas for their criticism of the use of foreign law in \nSupreme Court decisions stating: ``The nature of the criticism comes \nfrom . . . a misunderstanding of the American use of that concept of \nusing foreign law and that misunderstanding is unfortunately endorsed \nby some of our own Supreme Court Justices. Both Justice Scalia and \nJustice Thomas have written extensively criticizing the use of foreign \nand international law in Supreme Court decisions. . . . But, I share \nmore the ideas of Justice Ginsburg in thinking, . . . in believing that \nunless American courts are more open to discussing the ideas raised by \nforeign cases, and by international cases, that we are going to lose \ninfluence in the world.'' In her speech, Judge Sotomayor then \nspecifically cited Roper v. Simmons--ruling unconstitutional a statute \npermitting imposing the death penalty for juveniles--and Lawrence v. \nTexas--overturning a law against same-sex sodomy--as examples of cases \nwhere the Supreme Court used foreign law appropriately to strike down \nState criminal laws.\n  I asked Judge Sotomayor about her statements disagreeing with \nJustices Scalia and Thomas's criticism of the Court's use of foreign \nlaw in cases such as Roper and Lawrence, and she reversed her earlier \nstatement saying she ``actually agreed with Justices Scalia and Thomas \non the point that one has to be very cautious even in using foreign law \nwith respect to the things American law permits you to.'' Clearly, her \nhearing testimony was either inaccurate or designed to be misleading\n\n[[Page S8824]]\n\nsince she previously said she shared ``more the ideas of Justice \nGinsburg'' who has endorsed the Court's use of foreign law in cases \nsuch as Roper and Lawrence.\n  I then asked Judge Sotomayor to affirm that she would refrain from \nusing foreign law in making her decisions and writing her opinions, \noutside of where she was directed to do so through statute or through \ntreaty. She stated unequivocally that she would ``not use foreign law \nto interpret the Constitution or American statutes'' and she would \n``not utilize foreign law in terms of making decisions.'' I was \nreassured by these statements.\n  Regrettably, my reassurance did not last long. In her responses to \nwritten questions following the hearing, Judge Sotomayor reverted back \nto her former stated judicial philosophy regarding foreign law. She \nwrote: ``In some limited circumstances, decisions of foreign courts can \nbe a source of ideas, just as law review articles or treatises can be \nsources of ideas. Reading the decisions of foreign courts for ideas, \nhowever, does not constitute `using' those decisions to decide cases.'' \nShe further stated: ``decisions of foreign courts can be a source of \nideas informing our understanding of our own constitutional rights. To \nthe extent that the decisions of foreign courts contain ideas that are \nhelpful to that task, American courts may wish to consider those \nideas.'' This reversion is extremely troubling to me because it \nsuggests that Judge Sotomayor was either misleading or simply \ndisingenuous in her hearing testimony. Equally troubling is Judge \nSotomayor's continued concern with world opinion of American law. Prior \nto her hearing she asserted that ``unless American courts are more open \nto discussing the ideas raised by foreign cases, and by international \ncases, that we are going to lose influence in the world.'' She echoed \nthis concern after her hearing writing: ``To the extent that American \ncourts categorically refuse to consider the ideas expressed in the \ndecisions of foreign courts, it may be that foreign courts will be less \nlikely to look to American law as a source of ideas.'' A judge's job is \nnot to consider what the rest of the world thinks about us, it is to \ninterpret the Constitution.\n  Her judicial philosophy with regard to the use of foreign law is \nextremely important because it suggests that she will not strictly \ninterpret our Constitution. If Judge Sotomayor believes it is \nappropriate to consult foreign law in some cases, where will she draw \nthe line? During her hearing testimony, Judge Sotomayor stated that the \nright to bear arms is ``settled law''; however, the recent Supreme \nCourt decision in District of Columbia v. Heller left many questions \nunanswered. One critical unanswered question is whether the right will \nbe incorporated on to the States--meaning that the States will not have \nthe right to outlaw the use of firearms. If confirmed, would Justice \nSotomayor be receptive to arguments that foreign countries impose \ngreater restrictions on gun rights and, therefore, be persuaded that \nsome excessive State and Federal restrictions are constitutional? As \nshe noted in her recent second circuit opinion holding that there is no \nfundamental right to bear arms, there are very few Supreme Court cases \naddressing the right to bear arms. If confirmed, would she fill in the \ngaps with foreign law?\n  Unfortunately, I believe my fears were confirmed by her answers to \nwritten questions following the hearing when she refused to pledge that \nshe would not consider foreign law when considering second amendment \ncases. She stated: ``Because cases raising Second Amendment questions \nare currently pending before the Court, I would not comment on how I \nwould decide those cases if I am confirmed.'' Her refusal to answer \nthat should give pause to those who, like me, cherish the fundamental \nright to bear arms.\n  The concern that Judge Sotomayor may use foreign law to interpret the \nSecond Amendment is further exacerbated by her judicial record on the \nbench and her hearing testimony, which demonstrates a clear hostility \nto gun rights. In Maloney v. Cuomo, decided January 29, 2009--post-\nHeller--Judge Sotomayor joined a cursory unsigned opinion holding that \nthe second amendment is not a fundamental right and also that the \namendment does not apply to the States. In Maloney, Judge Sotomayor \nincorrectly relied on an 1886 case--Presser--which did not use the \nmodern Due Process incorporation analysis, a fact Judge Sotomayor \nfailed to note in her opinion. When asked at her hearing to discuss the \nholding in Presser, she responded that she had not ``read it recently \nenough to remember exactly'' what it said even though she had relied on \nit in a decision issued a mere 7 months previously. Her disturbing lack \nof familiarity with the case suggests that she did not give great \nweight to the constitutional right at issue in Maloney. If Judge \nSotomayor's ruling in Maloney is upheld by the Supreme Court, States \ncould ban all guns and other weapons for practically any reason.\n  During her oral and written testimony, she also refused to \nacknowledge the fundamental right to self-defense, which predates the \nConstitution, and stated that she did not recall a case that addressed \nthe right to self-defense, despite the fact that the Supreme Court \ndiscusses the right to self-defense at length in Heller, the opinion \nupon which she relied. Judge Sotomayor even refused to discuss the \nlegal test the Supreme Court uses to determine whether a right is \nfundamental, a basic legal test.\n  In another notable case about which Judge Sotomayor was questioned, \nshe gave short shrift to a constitutional right that is vitally \nimportant to Americans, suggesting that she does not have the \nappropriate respect for the rights guaranteed by the fifth amendment. \nIn Didden v. Village of Port Chester, Judge Sotomayor extended the \ngovernment's power to take private property in a cursory opinion that \none property professor said was the ``worst federal court takings \ndecision since Kelo.'' He further stated that the opinion is ``very \nextreme'' and ``is significant as a window into Judge Sotomayor's \nattitudes toward private property.'' Another notable professor said the \nopinion is ``a disappointment'' and is ``wrong and ill thought out'' \nand is ``about as naked an abuse of government power as could be \nimagined.'' Those are strong criticisms from respected legal scholars \nand nothing in Judge Sotomayor's testimony reassured me about her \nopinion in the Didden case.\n  Following the hearing, I remain concerned that Judge Sotomayor's \nhostility to gun rights, abortion restrictions, and property rights, \namong others, stem from a ``personal prejudice'' that will influence \nher decisions once she is untethered from precedent. It is true that \nshe has an extensive record on the bench; however, the Senate's inquiry \ninto Judge Sotomayor's suitability for the Supreme Court cannot merely \nrest on an overview of the cases she decided when she was constrained \nby precedent. Judge Sotomayor's extra judicial statements are \ncritically important to our examination of her fitness for a seat on \nthe Supreme Court because when a judge is free from the confines of \nprecedent--as she was in her speeches and as she will be if she is a \nSupreme Court Justice--she shows her true colors and passions.\n  So the question remains, which Judge Sotomayor are we getting? Will \nJudge Sotomayor follow in the footsteps of Justice Ginsburg or will she \nadhere to her testimony during her hearing that she will strictly apply \nthe law to the facts? Will she revert back to the judicial philosophy \nshe espoused prior to the hearing, the same way she reverted back to \nher prior statements on the use of foreign law by American judges? \nBecause I am not convinced that she can put aside her personal politics \nand preferences, I regretfully must oppose her nomination.\n  I am pleased to come to the floor today to talk about our Supreme \nCourt selection process. Judge Sotomayor is the third Supreme Court \ncandidate I have had the privilege of getting to know, interview, and \nask rigorous questions of during the hearing. She has a miraculous and \nwonderful personal story. She is very accomplished. She is to be \nadmired for what she has accomplished.\n  When we look at Supreme Court nominees, we are actually charged to do \ntwo things. One is to look at their record of judicial behavior and \nassess it, and then also to look at their record that is out there \nbesides their judicial decisions. We did a very thorough job in \nanalyzing her 15-plus years as a Federal judge and appellate judge. \nThere\n\n[[Page S8825]]\n\nwere some very concerning cases that we encountered for which we \nquestioned her, and the record will fully show her defense of that \nrecord and the reversal rate that she had at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  It is interesting for the American public to know that a Supreme \nCourt Justice is much different than an appellate judge or even a \nFederal circuit judge because they, in fact, are not bound by \nprecedent. As an appellate judge they have to follow precedent, and \nwhen they don't they get reversed, and Federal circuit judges have to \nfollow precedent or they get reversed. But a Supreme Court Justice has \nthe freedom to change precedent, and that is why the inquiry into the \ncandidacy and the qualifications of a Supreme Court nominee is so \nimportant. It is also why our Founders wrote extensively on what should \nbe the qualifications of a Supreme Court Justice.\n  Alexander Hamilton stated in Federalist Paper No. 78: ``The \ninterpretation of the law is the proper and peculiar province of the \ncourts.''\n  He further stated that it was ``indispensable in the courts of \njustice'' that judges have an ``inflexible and uniform adherence to the \nrights of the Constitution.'' A nominee who does not adhere to these \nstandards necessarily rejects the role of a judge as dictated by the \nConstitution and should not be confirmed.\n  When we look at the Constitution, we are told in the Constitution how \njudges are to decide cases. They are given three strict parameters. One \nis they are to look at the Constitution each and every time. No. 2 is \nthey are to look at the statutes that have been passed by the people's \nrepresentatives, and they are to look at the facts. They are to look at \nthe facts in a way that will show never a bias--in other words, blind \njustice--looking at those critical factors of what are the facts of the \ncase, what is the law, and what does the Constitution say.\n  You can be an appellate court justice for 50 years in this country \nand still not qualify to be a Supreme Court Justice. It is tremendously \nimportant who goes on the Supreme Court. The reason it is important is \nbecause we have had a tendency in the last three decades to abandon \nthose three principles and use other principles.\n  Let me mention two of them. One is that we consider foreign law, that \nwe can become enlightened with foreign law. I don't doubt that we can \nbecome enlightened with what other people in the world think about law, \nbut the fact is our Founders said: This is our law. The Constitution is \nour law. And we have a way of setting law which comes through the \nCongress. That is what we shall look at with one exception, and that is \non trade and treaties where we have to consider the agreements and \nforeign laws related to those treaties.\n  The other tendency which has been espoused by our President is an \nempathy standard, that we can somehow--other than looking at the three \nmain parameters of which our Founders told us we must use in deciding \ncases at the Supreme Court. Well, I will tell you that a standard other \nthan looking at the facts and looking at the law and looking at the \nConstitution doesn't meet the test of our Founders nor does it meet the \ntest of our Constitution as it is spelled out in our Constitution.\n  I wish to say as an American citizen, I think we should all be proud \nof this nomination: a Hispanic female coming to the Supreme Court. But \nthat is not a good enough reason to say somebody should become a \nJustice. So I go back to those three founding principles of who should \nqualify. And who should qualify is somebody who is going to strictly \nadhere to what our Founders said was the job of a Supreme Court \nJustice, not with parameters that have been discussed as maybe to be OK \nor parameters that fall outside of what our Founders said.\n  During my questioning and my visits with Judge Sotomayor, I found \nsome very disturbing things. I asked her specifically in the hearing: \nDo individuals have a fundamental right to self defense? She wouldn't \nanswer yes to that question. Now, a fundamental right to self-defense \npredates our Constitution. That is what liberty is all about. That is \none of the bedrocks of our liberty. And the fact that she will not \nagree that we as U.S. citizens have a fundamental right to self-defense \nis extremely troubling.\n  The reason that fundamental right is so important, and it is \nguaranteed in the Constitution, is because on that rests the second \namendment for which I find her somewhat less than comfortable in \naccepting what our Founders said in the second amendment, adopted \nalmost 200-and-some-odd years ago.\n  The second area I have concern with is in the area of property \nrights. It is very explicitly stated, and it is clear except in two \ncases in this country in the Supreme Court, which I hope that someday \nwill be reversed, that our right to property is a real right. There was \na Kelo decision that has markedly limited American citizens' rights to \nproperty. On both her cases and her comments and her written testimony, \nI believe that right of Americans is at risk. I believe judges are \ngoing to decide we don't have that fundamental right. I believe she \nbelieves, based on what she has ruled and what she has written and what \nshe has said, that, in fact, there are times when judges can decide \nwhether we have that right. That is inherently wrong and 180 degrees \nagainst what our Constitution guarantees us as individual citizens.\n  The final area has to do with the use of foreign law. In her speeches \nand statements she was highly critical of people who were critical of \nthe use of foreign law. Upon questioning in the committee, she \nretracted and moved away from those statements. I specifically asked \nher if she would assure the committee that she would, in fact, never \nuse foreign law to decide U.S. cases. I got her to say yes.\n  The only problem with that is, in the answer to questions following \nthe hearing, she backtracked 180 degrees from that statement which \nmatched her previous statements in speeches and writings which caused \nme to ask the question in the first place. So in the area of property \nrights, in the area of the second amendment and the fundamental right \nto self-defense, and in the area of foreign law, I believe her \nviewpoint is something other than what I see in the Constitution.\n  Regrettably, I believe that disqualifies her from being a Justice of \nthe Supreme Court. That when, in fact, we look at the constitutional \nbasis of how judges are instructed to make law and to decide law--\nbecause every decision makes law; it sets precedent--that when we \nextract from that the fundamental right of self-defense, the written, \nspecific right to the second amendment, the written specific right of \nproperty ownership and due process associated with that, and then we \nlay on top of that the idea that it is more important for us to look \ngood in our decisions to foreign governments than it is to follow the \noath, to follow the Constitution of the United States--make no mistake, \nI believe this is a wonderful woman, and I think she has done a fairly \ngood job as a judge on the appellate court, but she has been \nconstrained--as we measure her writings and her words with her \ndecisions on cases, what we find is a conflict for those who would \nstrictly follow what the Constitution tells us.\n  I want our grandchildren to endure and to accept and hold the same \nfreedoms we have. A U.S. Supreme Court Justice will determine that; \njust one can determine that. So I regretfully announce and state that I \nwill not be able to vote for this very fine woman. But I would also \nstate that we need to be very concerned and very vigilant as we see the \nSupreme Court make decisions, whether they are sitting Justices today \nor Justices to come, who violate both the intent, instruction, and the \nspirit of the U.S. Constitution.\n  With that, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise to speak to the nomination of Judge \nSonia Sotomayor to be the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court \nof the United States.\n  After a careful and considerate review of her testimony before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee and her overall record, her distinguished \njudicial background, and a personal meeting\n\n[[Page S8826]]\n\nwith her in June, I have concluded she should be confirmed as the next \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  I have not arrived at my decision lightly. It has been said that, of \nall the entities in government, the Supreme Court is the most closely \nidentified with the Constitution--and that no other branch or agency \nhas as great an opportunity to speak directly to the rational and moral \nside of the American character; to bring the power and moral authority \nof government to bear directly upon the citizenry.\n  The Supreme Court passes final legal judgment on the most profound \nsocial issues of our time. The Court is uniquely designed to accept \nonly those cases that present a substantial and compelling question of \nfederal law; cases for which the Court's ultimate resolution will not \nbe applied merely to a single, isolated dispute--but, rather, will \nguide legislatures, executives, and all other courts in their broader \ndevelopment and interpretation of law and policy.\n  In the end, ours is a government of both liberty and order, State and \nFederal authority, and checks and balances. The remarkable challenge of \ncalibrating these fundamental balance points is entrusted ultimately to \nthe nine Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  To help meet this extraordinary challenge, any nominee for the Court \nmust, as I stated during the confirmations of Chief Justice John \nRoberts and Associate Justice Sam Alito, have a powerful intellect, a \nprincipled understanding of the Court's role, and a sound commitment to \njudicial method. A nominee must have the capacity to engender respect \namong the other justices in order to facilitate the consensus of a \nmajority. And to warrant Senate confirmation, the nominee must have a \nkeen understanding of, and a disciplined respect for, the tremendous \nbody of law that precedes her.\n  It is with these high standards that we should evaluate the record of \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor. Reviewing her professional credentials, it is \nclear that Judge Sotomayor is well qualified. She has served for nearly \n11 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit where she \nhas participated in over 3,100 cases. The judge also previously served \non the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York for \nsix years where she decided over 400 additional cases. She also worked \nfor 8 years in private practice and 4 years in the highly respected \noffice of the district attorney for the County of New York. According \nto the White House, if confirmed, Judge Sotomayor would bring more \nFederal judicial experience to the Supreme Court than any Justice in \n100 years, and more overall judicial experience than anyone confirmed \nfor the Court in the past 70 years. So I applaud the President for \nselecting an individual who clearly possesses the professional \ncredentials to serve on the Court.\n  In reviewing her personal credentials, Judge Sotomayor's \naccomplishments are equally noteworthy. If confirmed, she will become \nthe first Hispanic and only the third woman ever to serve on our \nNation's highest Court. Along the way, she has ascended from modest \nmeans to excel in our country's most prestigious schools and our \njudiciary's highest offices. In doing so, she now stands as a model for \nothers to follow in summoning their own courage to break barriers and \npursue dreams. And she does so with a personal manner that I find to be \nrefreshingly candid and forthright.\n  This brings us to the more particular factors we must consider when \nproviding our consent on a President's nominee for Associate Justice--\njudicial temperament, methodology, integrity and philosophy. By their \nvery nature, these attributes are often challenging to measure, but \nthey can be ascertained through a careful analysis of a nominee's \ncomplete record.\n  With regard to the first consideration, judicial temperament, we all \nagree that it is absolutely essential that a judge be fair, open-\nminded, and respectful. Our citizens simply must have confidence that a \njudge who weighs their legal claims does so with an even temperament. A \njudge must be truly committed to providing a full and fair day in \ncourt, while projecting a sincere equanimity and respect for the law. \nWhen these attributes are not clearly present in our judges, the public \njustifiably begins to lose faith in the integrity of our courts.\n  This issue has been rightly explored and satisfactorily answered with \nJudge Sotomayor. For example, both the New York City and American Bar \nAssociations who reviewed the nominee on all key criteria gave the \njudge their highest ratings. Robert Morgenthau, the judge's former \nemployer and highly regarded district attorney of New York County since \n1975, testified that the judge is ``fair,'' ``non-political,'' and \n``highly qualified for any position in which a first-rate intellect, \ncommon sense, collegiality and good character would be assets.'' And \nformer Federal judge, colleague, and FBI Director Louis Freeh, has \ncalled Judge Sotomayor ``fair, neutral, nonpartisan [and] open-minded . \n. .'' And, indeed, I believe that the Judge's professional manner was \nin evidence during all aspects of her 4-day appearance before the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  We look next at the nominee's judicial methodology which directly \nreflects her commitment to the essential tenets of care, discipline and \nfairness. Here, the judge was very clear and direct in our June \nmeeting. Her approach to all cases is to carefully identify the facts--\nwhat she characterized as a prized skill that she learned as a \nsuccessful young prosecutor--and then follow the law: What it says; \nwhat end was meant to be accomplished; what legislative intent it was \nmeant to advance; and how, if at all, other courts have answered those \nquestions.\n  As the judge elaborated, she believes that the law can and should \ndevelop, but that such development should occur only ``incrementally'' \nthrough the measured development of analogous cases. And when I asked \nher which opinions best reflect her judicial method, Judge Sotomayor \ncandidly replied, ``Read any of my opinions and you will see my \nstructure.'' And the record supports that assertion--the structure of \nher opinions shows a consistent, methodical and careful approach to \ndeciding cases.\n  As she testified at her hearing, her methodology is to ``apply the \nlaw to the facts at hand'' and keep a ``rigorous commitment to \ninterpreting the Constitution according to its terms; interpreting \nstatutes according to their terms and Congress's intent; and hewing \nfaithfully to precedents . . .'' She stated further her view that the \n``process of judging is enhanced when the arguments and concerns of the \nparties to the litigation are understood and acknowledged. . . . That \nis why,'' she explained, ``I generally structure my opinions by setting \nout what the law requires and then by explaining why a contrary \nposition, sympathetic or not, is accepted or rejected. That is how I \nseek to strengthen both the rule of law and faith in the impartiality \nof our justice system.''\n  Indeed, the integrity of the judge's methodology can be measured in a \nvariety of ways. First, the judge has a low reversal rate. Research on \nJudge Sotomayor's performance on the trial court demonstrates she was \noverruled in only 6 of her over 400 trial bench decisions. Westlaw \nreports that, in her 11 years on the appellate court, the judge has \nparticipated--as I referenced earlier--in over 3,100 cases and, of \nthose cases, the White House reports that the Judge has only been \nreversed another six times. In each of those circuit cases she was part \nof a unanimous three-judge panel, and the cases involved the \ninterpretation--not of important constitutional provisions--but of very \ntechnical statutes that, in several instances, had created clear \ndivisions of opinion among several of the circuit courts.\n  Moreover, three of the six circuit cases created 5-4 opinions in the \nSupreme Court, one created a 6-3 split, and one produced this unusual \nalignment: Justices Ginsburg and Scalia together in the majority, and \nJustices Breyer and Alito together in dissent. These facts combine to \nshow the relative difficulty of, and the reasonable room for debate in, \nthese appellate cases.\n  Next, there is the measurement of the judge's concurrence and dissent \nrates. There, the data demonstrate that the judge's method of deciding \ncases is consistent with that of her colleagues on the Second Circuit. \nFor example, research sources indicate that, despite the thousands of \nher appellate opinions, Judge Sotomayor has only dissented in 21 cases, \nand has written\n\n[[Page S8827]]\n\nseparate concurring opinions in only 22 others.\n  Finally, there is the degree to which other courts and scholars find \nthe judge's method of decision worthy of citation. There, data compiled \nby law professors and students from three universities reveal that, \nbetween 1999 and 2001, the judge's opinions were cited by other courts \nand scholars at meaningful rates--4.4 court citations and 4.6 law \nreview citations per opinion. And between 2004 and 2006, those rates \nrose to 8.5 court citations and 4.8 law review citations per opinion. \nThese more recent rates are not only higher than the percentage of \ncitation rates for other distinguished Federal appellate judges, they \nunderscore the increasing respect that Judge Sotomayor's work is \ngarnering.\n  I turn now to the third qualification: judicial integrity. Here, \nthere are those who have suggested that the judge will use her office \nto engage in ``judicial activism'' and advance a certain social or \npolitical agenda that suits her personal preferences. Principally, \nthese critics point to the New Haven firefighters' case and her \nBerkeley and Duke speeches as examples of such activism, and I believe \nthese instances have warranted strict scrutiny.\n  At the outset, it bears noting the White House report that, in her 11 \nyears on the Second Circuit, Judge Sotomayor has agreed with the result \nfavored by the Republican appointees in 95 percent of the published \npanel decisions where the panel included at least one judge appointed \nby a Republican president. This statistic is evidence of a nonpartisan \nor nonideological approach to judging.\n  At the same time, I have shared the concerns expressed specifically \nabout the New Haven firefighters' case--as many have voiced opposition \nto both her decision as well as the curt and summary opinion that was \nused to dismiss the complaint. I sympathize with the plaintiffs, who \nwere told the rules for qualifying for a promotion, who believed they \nwere participating in a fixed process for determining their future \ncareer advancement, who did what was asked of them, and then, when it \nwas all over, were informed that what they had done wasn't good enough. \nSo I understand the frustration.\n  I approached Judge Sotomayor's handling of this case by looking at \nboth the merits--that is, what was decided in the case, as well as the \nprocess, or how, the case was decided. As regards the process, as we \nall well know, the panel that included Judge Sotomayor wrote only a \nthree-paragraph opinion concluding that, ``We affirm, for the reasons \nstated in the thorough, thoughtful, and well-reasoned opinion of the \ncourt below.''\n  Now, it may well be that the district judge's opinion was ``thorough, \nthoughtful, and well-reasoned.'' But the confidence of the litigants \nand public alike in any court relies on their opportunity to explore a \njudge's rationale. And the panel's summary affirmance, albeit adopting \nverbatim the long opinion of the court below, simply failed to meet \nthat expectation.\n  When I asked Judge Sotomayor in our June conversation--and when she \nwas queried before the Judiciary Committee--she stated that she and her \ncolleagues gave the case their full attention and review, and that only \nafter that full and fair consideration did they determine that their \nown written opinion was not necessary, given the district court's \nexhaustive 48-page opinion applying the seemingly clear ``four-fifths \nrule'' of the EEOC regulations and the seemingly settled precedent of \nwhat the Judge referred to in her testimony as the Bushy line of \ncases--this is Bushy v. New York State Civil Service Commission, \nKirkland v. New York State Department of Correctional Services, and \nHayden v. County of Nassau. In reviewing a petition for rehearing in \nRicci, six of the Judge's own colleagues were not persuaded by that \nargument. Yet, another six of her colleagues were so persuaded.\n  Additionally, the judge testified before the Judiciary Committee that \n``the practice is that about 75 percent of circuit decisions are \ndecided by summary order, in part because we can't handle the volume of \nour work if we were writing long decisions in every case; but more \nimportantly, because not every case requires a long opinion if a \ndistrict court opinion has been clear and thorough on an issue . . .''\n  Yet, the bottom line is, in my view, this particular case was simply \ntoo sensitive and complex--with significant societal implications--to \nleave to a summary order. And, therefore, the three-judge panel should \nhave issued its own, comprehensive opinion and explanation.\n  On the matter of the merits of the case, Judge Sotomayor ruled that \nthe city acted lawfully in trying to meet its obligations under Federal \nemployment discrimination law to avoid disparate impact discrimination \nwhen making certain employment promotions. And I understand some \nbelieve this decision evinces the judge's predisposition to rule for \nminority litigants. One well-respected DC law firm, however, has found \nthat the judge has decided nearly 100 race-related cases in her 11 \nyears on the Second Circuit, and has effectively rejected such race-\nrelated claims by a margin of ``roughly eight to one.''\n  Others have suggested that the Supreme Court's reversal of the Second \nCircuit raises questions of the judge's qualifications to serve. In \nevaluating that possibility, I have taken into account that the Supreme \nCourt took this action with a 5-4 vote, with four complex and nuanced \nopinions, as well as an admission from Justice Scalia that the \nunderlying question presented by the case--when affirmative action \nbecomes unlawful discrimination--is ``not an easy one.''\n  And I have considered that the High Court reached its decision only \nby identifying and applying an entirely new standard. Indeed, both the \ntrial and Sotomayor courts applied the then-existing ``four-fifths \nrule'' of the EEOC title VII regulations and the seemingly settled \ncircuit precedent of the ``Bushy line of cases'' in determining that a \nsignificant disparity in the results of an employment test is itself \nadequate evidence of unlawful disparate impact discrimination.\n  On appeal, the Supreme Court changed the rule, saying in essence that \nsuch a significant disparity in test results is no longer itself \nadequate evidence. Importing anew from 14th amendment jurisprudence, \nthe Court said that the new rule for interpreting the title VII statute \ndemands a ``strong[er] basis in evidence,'' such as evidence that the \ntest was ``not job related and consistent with business necessity, or \nif there existed an equally valid, less discriminatory alternative that \nserved the city's needs but that the city refused to adopt.''\n  Therefore, based on the record, it would appear the district and \ncircuit judges fulfilled their assigned job of applying existing \nprecedent to the existing rule. And in weighing all of the facts, given \nJudge Sotomayor's assurance to me and the committee that she gave the \ncase her full consideration, given her established reputation for \ncareful decision-making, and given the daily reality of the Second \nCircuit's burgeoning caseload, particularly with the surge of post-\nSeptember 11 immigration cases, I cannot conclude that the decision in \nRicci should itself disqualify this nominee.\n  Mr. President, I was also concerned--like many Americans--by Judge \nSotomayor's speech at Berkeley in 2001, and specifically by the \nfollowing line that appears to suggest that the judge decides cases \nmore by personal identity than by fidelity to the law:\n\n       I would hope that a wise Latina woman . . . would more \n     often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male. . \n     . .\n\n  To thoroughly examine this question with regard to the judge's \nqualifications, I believed it was necessary to review both the entirety \nof her speech, as well as her testimony before the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, to understand to the fullest extent possible her intention \nbehind those comments, because I agree that they are disconcerting.\n  In that light, I note that the judge, in answering a question from \nthe committee, offered that it is the job of a judge to apply the law, \nand that it is the law, rather than one's own sympathies, that \n``compels conclusions in cases.''\n  I also recall the judge's response when I asked her specifically \nabout this speech during our opportunity to meet one-on-one. I said \nthat commentators had criticized that portion of her speech because it \nsuggested that gender and ethnicity enable her to make ``better'' \ndecisions than a male judge of a different ethnicity. Judge\n\n[[Page S8828]]\n\nSotomayor, in replying, suggested that those who have concerns must \n``read the whole speech;'' that she was only trying to say--she admits \nnow inartfully--that ``judges are human beings and they necessarily \nwill be affected by who they are. But this only makes them attuned to \ncertain case aspects; it does not replace following the law.''\n  In evaluating these responses, I recalled prominent judges in our \nhistory who also raised this issue.\n  Indeed, this was the subject to which Justice Felix Frankfurter \nreferred to when he said, long ago, that one of the greatest challenges \nfor all judges, because they are all human, is to recognize their own \npersonal views and develop the patience, insights and discipline to \ncompensate for them. When I raised Justice Frankfurter's comments \npersonally with Judge Sotomayor, she agreed and asserted that was \n``exactly'' the point she was attempting to communicate in her Berkeley \nspeech.\n  She also asserted in our meeting, and reaffirmed in her committee \ntestimony that, ``no racial or ethnic group has a market on sound \njudgment.'' She explained that some judges, like many lay people, have \n``tin ears'' on certain matters, and that is why the collegial \ndecision-making is so vital--because sharing different perspectives and \nblending them into consensus opinions serves as both a ``spotlight and \na filter.'' She spoke of how judges, like all people, are inescapably \naffected by their own life experiences, but that those experiences only \naffect how ``attuned'' judges are to certain aspects of cases. They do \nnot replace the requirement to follow and apply the law consistent with \nthe limited role and specific oath of their office.\n  A review of Judge Sotomayor's decisions and her resulting affinity, \ndissent and reversal rates that I described earlier bolster the judge's \nstatements that she understands this imperative--and that she decides \ncases based not on personal identities or classifications, but by \n``fidelity to the law.''\n  A final question about the judge's judicial integrity has been raised \nfrom her remark in 2005 at Duke University that the ``Court of Appeals \nis where policy is made.'' This comment has understandably raised the \nspecter of a commitment to judicial activism, and is therefore a \nlegitimate cause for examination. When I raised this issue with the \njudge she responded that she was referring to the educational \ndifference between trial and appellate court clerkships--how a trial \ncourt clerkship focuses primarily on resolving limited factual disputes \nand how an appellate court clerkship focuses primarily on cases \ninvolving broader questions of how the law ought to be interpreted.\n  An essential component of weighing the competing interpretations \nproffered by appellate advocates is for the court to understand the \npractical effect of the advocates' competing arguments. It is this \nunderstanding that defines the scope and reach of the possible \ninterpretations. I believe it is therefore legitimate to read and \nunderstand her comments within this context. It has also been argued \nthat--as the Supreme Court only accepts and decides about 80 of \napproximately 8,000 cases per year, Federal circuit courts of appeal \noften do, as the judge noted in her testimony effectively become the \nfinal decisionmaker on what the law--and by necessary extension, the \npolicy it advances--is.\n  Given all of these factors, again, in considering the entirety of her \nrecord, it is fair to conclude that the Duke University speech is not \nevidence that Judge Sotomayor would practice judicial activism on the \nSupreme Court.\n  Finally, we have a fourth and final qualification--judicial \nphilosophy, judge's sense of limits and horizons and great promises of \nour Constitution and the nominee's view of the proper role of the \nSupreme Court in deciding whether to take cases and, once taken, the \nunderlying philosophy used to rule upon them.\n  On this point, I note first the judge's answer when asked whether she \nsubscribes to one or another school of constitutional interpretation. \nShe said: ``I don't use labels.'' I also recall the study by the New \nYork University Law School's Brennan Center for Justice which analyzed \nover 1,100 constitutional cases decided during Judge Sotomayor's tenure \non the second circuit and found as an appellate judge, she voted with \nthe majority in over 98 percent of constitutional cases and that 94 \npercent of her constitutional decisions have been unanimous. Such \nfigures argue strongly that the judge's constitutional approach is \nsquarely in the mainstream.\n  The inquiry into any nominee's judicial philosophy is particularly \nsignificant for those of us who value the Court's landmark rulings. \nDecisions protecting the rights of privacy, civil rights, and women \nseeking equal protection in the workplace--to name a few--comprise a \ncrucial and settled body of the Court's case law. Entire generations of \nAmericans have come to live their lives in reliance upon the Court's \nrulings in these key areas, and overruling these precedents would \nsimply roll back decades of societal advancement and impose substantial \ndisruption and harm.\n  Therefore, central to the question of this nominee's judicial \nphilosophy are her views on one of the cornerstones of jurisprudence, \nand that is judicial precedent.\n  In our June meeting, I asked whether she agreed with Chief Justice \nRehnquist's observation in Dickerson v. United States which upheld the \nfamous decision Miranda v. Arizona. There, the Chief Justice wrote \nthere are situations where constitutional precedent--that a Justice \nmight have believed had been wrongly decided--should nevertheless be \nupheld because the people have accepted the principle of the decision \nas an ``embedded . . . part of our national culture.'' Judge Sotomayor \nagreed with that position.\n  This expressed adherence to applying precedent has achieved \nsignificance in many passionately contested areas of the law, such as \nthe second amendment, which brings me to the concerns raised with \nrespect to Judge Sotomayor's decision in Maloney v. Cuomo. I happen to \nbe a strong, long-time defender of second amendment rights, as \nevidenced by my amicus support for Mr. Heller in his recent case before \nthe Supreme Court, in District of Columbia v. Heller. Accordingly, I am \nvery well aware the issue of whether second amendment protections are \nto be construed as incorporated against acts of a State government--as \nopposed to the Federal Government--has assumed renewed importance and \nvisibility since the Court's recent landmark decision ruling in Heller.\n  I also understand that several longstanding Court precedents have \nbeen widely construed by State and Federal courts around the country, \nincluding the Maine Supreme Judicial Court, not to incorporate the \nsecond amendment. Judge Sotomayor in Maloney v. Cuomo, and her two \npanelists, have stated that those consistent interpretations of the \nSupreme Court's precedent were binding upon them. And while a panel in \nthe ninth circuit in Nordyke v. King bypassed such precedent, a seventh \ncircuit panel, led by Judge Shakley, sharply criticized the Nordyke \ndecision for doing so, and instead in NRA v. City of Chicago agreed \nwith Judge Sotomayor's opinion because they, too, concluded that the \nSupreme Court's precedent was binding upon them. Last week, the full \nninth circuit itself agreed to reconsider its decision in the Nordyke \ndecision.\n  The Supreme Court may well revisit this issue soon. But the issue \nbefore us in the Senate right now is whether the judge has \ndemonstrated, as she describes, ``fidelity to the law'' and precedent \nas we would expect--because several longstanding Supreme Court \nprecedents have been widely construed by State and Federal courts alike \nnot to incorporate the second amendment, and because the Supreme Court \nin footnote 23 of the Heller majority opinion expressly said the Court \nwas not deciding the incorporation question. Moreover, given her \ndemonstrated adherence to stare decisis, while no one can predict the \nfuture with certainty, it is reasonable to conclude she will continue \nto follow precedent, as also evidenced by her testimony to the \nJudiciary Committee in which she stated:\n\n       The Supreme Court did hold that there is in the second \n     amendment an individual right to bear arms. And that is its \n     holding, and that is the Court's decision. I fully accept \n     that.\n\n  Finally, what a powerful and profound message it will send to have \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor join with Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg on the \nhighest Court in the land. The fact is, it\n\n[[Page S8829]]\n\ndoes make a difference who women and girls see at the pinnacles of \ngovernment, just as it matters in all fields of endeavor. As Justice \nGinsburg has said recently:\n\n       My base concern about being all alone was the public got \n     the wrong perception of the Court. It just doesn't look right \n     in the year 2009 . . . It matters for women to be here at the \n     conference table to be doing everything that the Court does . \n     . . Women belong in all places where decisions are being \n     made.\n\n  Given the totality of the record before us, I have concluded from \nJudge Sotomayor's testimony regarding both her judicial methodology and \nher judicial philosophy that she is not predisposed to overturning \nsettled precedent. Obviously, none of us can know with certainty how \nJudge Sotomayor would vote on any particular case. But we can assess \nher methodology and analysis in approaching cases by reviewing her \nresponses to the committee and to other Members throughout this \nprocess.\n  In that light, in evaluating the essential qualifications as I have \noutlined them, and reviewing the entire judicial record of Judge \nSotomayor, I find a fairminded judge with a deep respect for the rule \nof law and the independence of the courts, and a judicial method \ncommitted to stability in the law. It is, therefore, my conclusion that \nbased on the totality of the record and her distinctive qualifications, \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor has earned the distinction of serving as the next \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask the Presiding Officer to inform me when 2 \nminutes is left of my time.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of Judge Sonia \nSotomayor to be a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Ultimately, the \ncore of this debate, I believe, is over the proper role of the Court. \nOur side tends to believe that the Court does not make policy and must \nstay within the written text of the Constitution. The other side sees \nthe Constitution more often as a living document and that its meaning \nchanges along with the attitudes of society.\n  When the courts improperly assume the power to decide issues more \npolitical than legal in nature, the people naturally focus less on the \nlaw and more on the lawyers who are chosen to administer it. Some are \nkey to impose their policy agendas through the judicial process. Others \nwant judges who will stick to interpreting the law rather than making \nit. It is beyond dispute that the Constitution and its Framers intended \nfor judges to satisfy the latter criteria; that is, to stay within the \nlaw rather than making it.\n  President Obama has voiced his support for judges looking to the \nConstitution as a living document malleable to the times. He has said \nhe will pick judges who will look to empathy rather than written law \nwhen deciding cases. When then-Senator Obama voted against the \nconfirmation of Chief Justice John Roberts, he said this:\n\n       [W]hile adherence to legal precedent and rules of statutory \n     or constitutional construction will dispose of 95 percent of \n     the cases that come before a court, so that both a Scalia and \n     a Ginsburg will arrive at the same place most of the time on \n     those 95 percent of the cases--what matters on the Supreme \n     Court is those 5 percent of cases that are truly difficult. \n     In those cases, adherence to precedent and rules of \n     construction and interpretation will only get you through the \n     25th mile of the marathon. That last mile can only be \n     determined on the basis of one's deepest values, one's core \n     concerns, one's broader perspectives on how the world works, \n     and the depth and breadth of one's empathy.\n\n  I don't dispute that there is a small percentage of cases that are \ntruly difficult. But the question is: Do we want these cases decided by \nwhat the law says or by a judge's own personal empathies? I reject the \nidea that these cases cannot be resolved by staying faithful to the \ntext of the Constitution, and it is dangerous to the rule of law to \nsuggest otherwise.\n  In June, I came to the floor and stated my opposition to Judge \nSotomayor's nomination based on numerous past statements she made \nembracing an activist judiciary and endorsing the idea that judges \nshould look to areas outside of the law when deciding cases. However, \nwhen Judge Sotomayor appeared before the Judiciary Committee last \nmonth, she consistently took positions contrary to her past writings \nand, in many cases, did a complete 180. This leads me to ask which \nSotomayor are we voting to confirm--the liberal activist or the modest \njudge who believes in strictly applying the law as written?\n  Judge Sotomayor attempted to assure Senators that the real Sotomayor \nis reflected in her 17-year record on the bench. I find this argument \ninteresting but unpersuasive, because as a judge on the court of \nappeals, Judge Sotomayor has been constrained by Supreme Court \nprecedent. That is the position she held. Her judicial record tells us \nvery little about who the real Sotomayor will be when on the Supreme \nCourt. It is in her speeches and writings where she is unrestrained \nthat we find the real views on the fundamental questions that she will \ndecide as a Justice on the Supreme Court.\n  When asked at her confirmation hearing to summarize her judicial \nphilosophy, she said: ``Fidelity to the law.'' I completely agree with \nthis philosophy, but I have difficulty reconciling the words she chose \nat her confirmation hearing with the statement she made in 1996 at \nSuffolk University Law School when she stated: ``The law that lawyers \npractice and judges declare is not a definitive capital `L' law that \nmany would like to think exists.'' The only reasonable interpretation \nto that is that she pledges fidelity to whatever she says the law is.\n\n  In a 2001 famous speech she gave to Berkeley Law School, which was \nlater published in the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal, she dismissed the \nidea that ``judges must transcend their personal sympathies and \nprejudices and aspire to achieve a greater degree of fairness and \nintegrity based on the reason of law,'' saying that ``by ignoring our \ndifferences as women or men of color, we do a disservice both to the \nlaw and society.'' This certainly doesn't sound like a judge who \nbelieves in fidelity to the law.\n  In the same speech, Judge Sotomayor famously said:\n\n       Justice O'Connor has often been cited as saying that a wise \n     old man and a wise old woman will reach the same conclusion \n     in deciding cases. I am not so sure that I agree with that \n     statement. I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the \n     richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a \n     better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that \n     life.\n\n  When asked about this statement at her confirmation hearing, Judge \nSotomayor said:\n\n       The words I used, I used agreeing with the sentiment that \n     Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was attempting to convey.\n\n  Really? Are we really supposed to believe that each time Judge \nSotomayor said, ``I'm not so sure I agree with that statement,'' she \nactually meant ``I agree with that statement''? Judge Sotomayor's \nexplanation requires some suspension of disbelief.\n  Also at Berkeley, Judge Sotomayor said:\n\n       Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or \n     cultural differences, our gender and national origins may and \n     will make a difference in our judging.\n\n  At her hearing, she said:\n\n       I do not believe that any ethnic, racial, or gender group \n     has an advantage in sound judging.\n\n  Again, are we being asked to believe that Judge Sotomayor is either a \nvery poor communicator or her past statements have been continually \ntaken out of context and misinterpreted? I don't think she is a bad \ncommunicator at all.\n  In her writings, Judge Sotomayor has repeatedly rejected the \nprinciple of impartiality and embraced the novel idea that a judge's \npersonal life story should come into play in the courtroom. But when \nshe was in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee, with the Nation \nwatching, she suddenly embraced the judicial philosophy of Chief \nJustice Roberts.\n  The past positions simply cannot be reconciled with what she said \nbefore the Judiciary Committee. We do not know what she actually \nbelieves.\n  In a 2005 appearance at Duke University Law School, she said, ``The \ncourt of appeals is where policy is made.'' During her confirmation \nhearing, she said, ``Judges don't make law'' and they ``look at the \nConstitution and see what it says.''\n  Even some of Judge Sotomayor's defenders have criticized her flip-\nflopping on her views. Georgetown Law Center professor Louis Michael \nSeidman, a liberal constitutional law scholar, said:\n\n\n[[Page S8830]]\n\n\n       I was completely disgusted by Judge Sotomayor's testimony \n     today. If she was not perjuring herself, she is \n     intellectually unqualified to be on the Supreme Court. If she \n     was perjuring herself, she is morally unqualified.\n\n  There was never any doubt that this President would nominate liberal \njudges who shared his views. He won the election. Judge Sotomayor's \nrecord on the bench has been fairly typical of a liberal judge. \nHowever, there have been some notable exceptions.\n  After the Supreme Court ruled that individuals have a \nconstitutionally protected right to gun ownership in the case of \nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller, Maloney v. Cuomo, another second \namendment case, was argued in front of the Second Circuit. In a per \ncuriam opinion issued by a panel that included Judge Sotomayor, the \nSecond Circuit ruled that ``the Second Amendment applies only to \nlimitations the Federal Government seeks to impose on this right.'' \nThey also said:\n\n       Legislative acts that do not interfere with fundamental \n     rights or single out suspect classifications carry with them \n     a strong presumption of constitutionality and must be upheld \n     if rationally related to a legitimate state interest.\n\n  In other words, the second amendment does not protect a fundamental \nright. I believe the second amendment protects a fundamental right, \njust as the first amendment protects a fundamental right. The Supreme \nCourt agrees it protects a fundamental right, and the Founders most \ncertainly believed there was a fundamental right to keep and to bear \narms.\n  In a high-profile racial discrimination case, Judge Sotomayor's panel \nissued an unpublished summary order denying a group of firefighters a \npromotion they had earned because the promotion exam had a disparate \nimpact on minorities. Sotomayor and her two colleagues' actions were \ntroubling because by issuing an unpublished summary order, they avoided \nbringing the case to the attention of other judges on the Second \nCircuit. It was only after another judge of the circuit read about the \ncase in a New Haven newspaper and requested that the full Second \nCircuit rehear the case that Sotomayor's actions came to light. The \ncase was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court, and in a 5-to-4 \nopinion, the Court reversed the Second Circuit. Perhaps even more \nimportantly, the Court was unanimous--unanimous--in rejecting \nSotomayor's opinion that simply having a disparate racial impact was \njustification to void the test. The dissenters at the Supreme Court \nbelieved a jury trial should have been granted to examine the evidence \nand determine whether the test was job related. Sotomayor clearly erred \nin her decision.\n  Judge Sotomayor was nominated by a President who said judges should \nhave ``the empathy to recognize what it's like to be a young teenaged \nmom; the empathy to understand what it's like to be poor or African-\nAmerican or gay or disabled or old,'' and that difficult cases should \nbe decided by ``what is in the justice's heart.''\n  When asked about President Obama's empathy standard by Senator Kyl, \nJudge Sotomayor said this:\n\n       I wouldn't approach the issue of judging in the way the \n     President does. He has to explain what he meant by judging. I \n     can only explain what I think judges should do, which is \n     judges can't rely on what is in their heart.\n\n  Are we really to believe the President chose a nominee who outright \nrejects his view of justice? I am concerned that the President has, in \nfact, nominated an individual who shares his view that the Constitution \nis a living document, and that is why I will be voting against her \nconfirmation.\n  After watching her performance in front of the Judiciary Committee \nlast month and observing that performance, I learned something I have \nlong suspected: Judge Sotomayor had no choice but to reverse many of \nher past statements. A judge who openly embraces an activist judiciary, \nusing empathy to pick winners and losers, using his or her own race and \ngender to decide the outcome of cases, using foreign law, who does not \nbelieve the second amendment is a fundamental right and sees judges as \npolicymakers--all those things--is a judge who cannot be confirmed by \nthis body despite 60 Members belonging to the party of the President.\n  I hope President Obama has learned that important lesson as well, \nthat the people of the country want a Justice on the Supreme Court to \nbe a justice and not a policymaker; to be a judge and not somebody who \ngoes with the sympathies in their heart; someone who sticks with the \nConstitution and does not try to rewrite it. If the President realizes \nthat, it will be a victory for the rule of law. And that is what this \nis about.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the time in this hour be \ndivided in the following manner: Senator Cardin, 15 minutes; Senator \nBaucus, 15 minutes; Senator Merkley, 10 minutes; Senator Akaka, 10 \nminutes; and Senator Lieberman, 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor \nto be Associate Justice to the Supreme Court will be my first Justice \nconfirmation vote as a Senator. It is an honor for me to represent the \npeople of Maryland in the Senate and to serve on the Judiciary \nCommittee. I particularly thank Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member \nSessions for the dignified manner in which the committee handled the \nnomination process of Judge Sotomayor. Each Senator on our committee \nhad ample time to review Judge Sotomayor's background and ask questions \nof the nominee. Her answers were as responsive as possible and gave me \nconfidence that she understood the appropriate role of a judge in \napplying the law.\n  The Supreme Court, our Nation's highest Court, holds a tremendous \nresponsibility in deciding cases of fundamental issues that have real \nimpacts on the lives of Americans. In recent years, we have seen less \nof a consensus on the Court, with many 5-to-4 decisions. Regrettably, \ntoo many of these decisions have been at times when the Court has \nignored congressional intent and precedent to instead move forward with \nits own agenda. It has been the so-called conservative Justices who \nhave been the most active in ignoring the intent of Congress in \nprotecting individual rights. For example, in the Ledbetter decision, \nthe Court denied women a remedy against employer discrimination pay \nequity cases, thus eliminating protection intended by Congress. In the \nRiverkeeper and Rapanos decisions, the Supreme Court narrowed the \ncongressional protections for clean water. In the Northwest Austin \nMunicipal Utility District decision, the Court challenged congressional \nauthority to extend the Voting Rights Act. In each of these cases, the \nSupreme Court actively ruled to restrict laws passed by Congress to \nprotect individual rights. I want the next Justice to respect legal \nprecedent and congressional intent and advance, not restrict, \nindividual rights.\n  In determining whether to support Judge Sotomayor for this lifetime \nappointment, I looked at several factors. First, I believe judicial \nnominees must have an appreciation for the Constitution and the \nprotections it provides to each and every American. I also believe each \nnominee must embrace a judicial philosophy that reflects mainstream \nAmerican values, not narrow ideological interests. I believe a judicial \nnominee must respect the role and responsibility of each branch of \ngovernment. I look for a strong commitment and passion for continued \nprogress in civil rights protections.\n  I understand there is a careful balance to be found. Our next Justice \nshould advance the protections found in the Constitution but not \ndisregard important precedents that have made society stronger by \nembracing our civil liberties. I believe Judge Sotomayor understands \nthis balance and will apply these principles appropriately.\n  During the hearing, we all learned more about Judge Sotomayor's \napproach to the law and to judging. She clearly outlined for us her \nfidelity to the law, respect for precedent, and due deference to the \nintent of Congress. With each question, our committee and the American \npublic gained a greater\n\n[[Page S8831]]\n\nappreciation of Judge Sotomayor's knowledge of and commitment to the \nrule of law. Her command of legal precedent and her ability to \nchallenge attorneys in their arguments will bode well for reaching the \nright decisions in the Supreme Court. She is mainstream in her judicial \ndecisions and opinions, and she possesses a correct sense of the role \nof a judge in deciding a case based on sound legal precedent and the \nfacts, giving due deference to congressional intent.\n  Over the past few months, our committee has had time to thoroughly \nreview Judge Sotomayor's record. From the moment she was nominated by \nPresident Obama, we knew Judge Sotomayor had a strong background, \nincluding extensive experience as a prosecutor, trial judge, and \nappellate judge. She grew up in modest circumstances, worked hard to \nattend two of our Nation's most prestigious universities, Princeton and \nYale Law School, and she excelled at the highest levels in each \ninstitution. Judge Sotomayor's lifelong work has been recognized by \nboth Democratic and Republican Presidents who nominated her for Senate-\nconfirmed judicial appointments, and for 17 years she has served as a \ndistinguished jurist.\n  Judge Sotomayor is an example of a highly competent and experienced \nnominee. She has more Federal judicial experience than any Supreme \nCourt nominee in the last 100 years. She was rated ``well qualified'' \nby the American Bar Association, which is the highest rating given by \nthe ABA. She has been supported by the National Fraternal Order of \nPolice, the NAACP, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National \nAssociation of Women Legislators, the Brennan Center for Justice, the \nLawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and many more.\n  The nine Justices of the Supreme Court have a tremendous \nresponsibility of safeguarding the Framers' intent and the fundamental \nvalues of our Constitution, while ensuring the protection of rights \nfound in that very Constitution are applied and are relevant to the \nissues of the day. It is my belief that the Constitution and Bill of \nRights were created to be timeless documents that stand together as the \nfoundation for the rule of law in our Nation. Were it not possible for \nthe Supreme Court to apply the basic tenets of the Constitution to \nchanging times, moving beyond popular sentiment, our Nation would never \nhave made the progress it has, improving society for the better. When \nthe Constitution was written, African Americans were considered \nproperty and counted only as three-fifths of a person. Non-Whites and \nwomen were not allowed to vote. Individuals were restricted by race as \nto whom they could marry.\n  Decisions by the Supreme Court undeniably have moved the country \nforward, continuing the progression of constitutional protections. I \nbelieve Judge Sotomayor's record and background demonstrate that she \nunderstands these principles and that she will apply sound legal \nprecedent to contemporary challenges advancing individual rights.\n  During the confirmation hearing, I spent the majority of my time \nquestioning Judge Sotomayor on the topic of civil rights. We discussed \nthe right to vote, women's rights, minority rights, including race and \ngender issues, the environment, and the importance of diversity of the \ncourts throughout society. While difficult questions will continue to \ncome before the Court, for me, it bears repeating how important it is \nto have Justices on the Supreme Court who will apply established \nprecedents and are not tempted to turn back the clock on landmark court \ndecisions that protect individual constitutional rights.\n  I gained great confidence in Judge Sotomayor after listening to her \nanswers to questions I posed. I wished to mention a few of the key \ncases decided by Judge Sotomayor that we discussed at the hearing. \nJudge Sotomayor has protected the civil rights of all Americans, \nadvanced equal opportunity, and promoted racial justice.\n\n  In the Gant case, she protected the rights of a young African-\nAmerican student who was treated differently than his fellow White \nclassmates. In the Boyton case, she looked at the facts presented and \nreversed and remanded the case because the facts did present a \nplausible claim of disparate treatment in a housing application \nprocess. Judge Sotomayor has also shown an understanding of privacy \nrights. While we do not have cases to review that she participated in, \nher responses to questions gave me great confidence that she will \nrespect legal precedent while applying privacy protections to the \nchallenges in the 21st century.\n  I have confidence that Judge Sotomayor understands the importance of \nprotecting the freedom of speech based on the decisions she reached in \nthe Pappas case, where an off-duty police officer used speech that was \nrepugnant, but her ruling showed an understanding of the importance of \nconstitutional protections, even when the speech is unpopular and \nhateful.\n  I have confidence Judge Sotomayor will protect religious freedom \nbased on her decision in the Ford case, where she protected the rights \nof a Muslim prison inmate. I was particularly impressed by Judge \nSotomayor's record on voting rights. In the Hayden case, she wrote in a \ndissent:\n\n       The duty of a judge is to follow the law, not to question \n     its plain terms. I do not believe that Congress wishes us to \n     disregard the plain language of a statute or to invent \n     exceptions in the statutes it has created.\n\n  Her commitment on voting rights was reinforced at the hearing when \nshe responded to a question I posed. She acknowledged, unequivocally, \nthat the right to vote is a fundamental right for all Americans. With \ncurrent Justices on the Court ready to question Congress's right to \nextend the basic voting protections of the Voting Rights Act, it is \nrefreshing to hear Judge Sotomayor say in the Hayden case: ``I trust \nthat Congress would prefer to make any needed changes itself rather \nthan have the court do so for it.''\n  I have great confidence that Judge Sotomayor understands the \nimportance of civil rights and the importance of protecting those \nrights for the American people.\n  I believe Judge Sotomayor will defend Congress's intent with the \npassage of the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, and many others, \nbased on her decision in the Riverkeeper case. In this case, she wrote \nfor a unanimous panel and held that under the Clean Water Act, the EPA \ncould not engage in a cost-benefit analysis. Allowing cost-benefit \nanalysis would undermine congressional protections, when determining \nwhat constitutes the ``best technology available for minimizing the \nadverse environmental impact.'' She concluded, instead, the test for \ncompliance should consider ``what technology can be reasonably borne by \nthe industry and could engage in cost-effectiveness analysis in \ndetermining the [best technology available].''\n  In addition to her impressive legal background, Judge Sotomayor is on \nthe verge of becoming the first Latino and only the third woman to \nserve on the Supreme Court. Her story of personal success is an \ninspiration for young Latinos, women, and for all Americans. She is \nprepared and ready to serve our Nation on the Court, where I am \nconfident she will continue to build upon the outstanding record she \nhas already achieved as a distinguished jurist. For all these reasons \nand many more, I will vote to confirm Judge Sotomayor to be the next \nAssociate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I urge my colleagues to \njoin in support of her confirmation.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following \nletters of support: The Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a \njoint letter with more than 25 disability rights organizations in \nsupport of Judge Sotomayor's confirmation; and letters of support \nsigned by more than 80 civil rights and labor organizations in support \nof her nomination to be the next Supreme Court Justice.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n        Confirm Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court\n\n                             August 4, 2009\n\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the undersigned organizations, \n     we write to express our support for the confirmation of Judge \n     Sonia Sotomayor as associate justice of the Supreme Court of \n     the United States. In her 17 years of service to date as a \n     federal trial and appellate judge, and throughout the course \n     of her entire career, Judge Sotomayor has strongly \n     distinguished herself through her outstanding intellectual \n     credentials and her deep respect for the rule of law, \n     establishing\n\n[[Page S8832]]\n\n     herself beyond question as fully qualified and ready to serve \n     on the Supreme Court.\n       Judge Sotomayor will be an impartial, thoughtful, and \n     highly respected addition to the Supreme Court. Her unique \n     personal background is compelling, and will be both a \n     tremendous asset to her on the Court and a historic \n     inspiration to others. Her legal career further demonstrates \n     her qualifications to serve on our nation's highest court. \n     After graduating from Yale Law School, where she served as an \n     editor of the Yale Law Journal, Judge Sotomayor spent five \n     years as a criminal prosecutor in Manhattan. She then spent \n     eight years as a corporate litigator with the firm of Pavia & \n     Harcourt, where she gained expertise in a wide range of civil \n     law areas such as contracts and intellectual property. In \n     1992, on the bipartisan recommendation of her home-state \n     senators, President George H.W. Bush appointed her district \n     judge for the Southern District of New York. In recognition \n     of her outstanding record as a trial judge, President Bill \n     Clinton elevated her to the U.S. Court of Appeals in 1998.\n       During her long tenure on the federal judiciary, Judge \n     Sotomayor has participated in thousands of cases, and has \n     authored approximately 400 opinions at the appellate level. \n     She has demonstrated a thorough understanding of a wide range \n     of highly complicated legal issues, and has a strong \n     reputation for deciding cases based upon the careful \n     application of the law to the facts of cases. Her record and \n     her inspiring personal story indicate that she understands \n     the judiciary's role in protecting the rights of all \n     Americans, in ensuring equal justice, and in respecting our \n     constitutional values--all within the confines of the law. \n     Moreover, her well-reasoned and pragmatic approach to cases \n     will allow litigants to feel, regardless of the outcome, that \n     they were given a fair day in court.\n       Given her stellar record and her reputation for fairness, \n     Judge Sotomayor has garnered broad support across partisan \n     and ideological lines, earning glowing praise from colleagues \n     in the judiciary, law enforcement community, academia, and \n     legal profession who know her best. Her Second Circuit \n     colleague (and also her former law professor) Judge Guido \n     Calabresi describes her as ``a marvelous, powerful, \n     profoundly decent person. Very popular on the court because \n     she listens, convinces and can be convinced--always by good \n     legal argument. She's changed my mind, not an insignificant \n     number of times.'' Judge Calabresi also discredited concerns \n     about Judge Sotomayor's bench manner, explaining that he \n     compared the substance and tone of her questions with those \n     of his male colleagues and his own questions: ``And I must \n     say I found no difference at all.'' Judge Sotomayor's \n     colleague Judge Roger Miner, speaking of her ideology, argued \n     that ``I don't think I'd go as far as to classify her in one \n     camp or another. I think she just deserves the classification \n     of outstanding judge.'' And New York District Attorney Robert \n     Morgenthau, her first employer out of law school, hailed her \n     for possessing ``the wisdom, intelligence, collegiality, and \n     good character needed to fill the position for which she has \n     been nominated.''\n       The undersigned organizations urge you not to be swayed by \n     the efforts of a small number of ideological extremists to \n     tarnish Judge Sotomayor's outstanding reputation as a jurist. \n     These efforts have included blatant mischaracterizations of a \n     handful of her rulings, as well as efforts to smear her as a \n     racist based largely on one line in a speech that critics \n     have taken out of context from the rest of her remarks. The \n     simple fact is that after serving 17 years on the federal \n     judiciary to date, she has not exhibited any credible \n     evidence whatsoever of having an ideological agenda, and \n     certainly not a racist one. We hope that you will strongly \n     reject the efforts at character assassination that have taken \n     place since her nomination.\n       In short, Judge Sotomayor has an incredibly compelling \n     personal story and a deep respect for the Constitution and \n     the rule of law. Her long and rich experiences as a \n     prosecutor, litigator, and judge match or even exceed those \n     of any of the justices currently sitting on the Court. \n     Furthermore, she is fair-minded and ethical, and delivers \n     thoughtful rulings in cases that are based upon their merits. \n     For these reasons, the undersigned organizations strongly \n     urge you to vote to confirm Judge Sotomayor. If you have any \n     questions, please feel free to contact Leadership Conference \n     on Civil Rights (LCCR) Counsel Rob Randhava at (202) 466-\n     6058, or LCCR Executive Vice President Nancy Zirkin at (202) \n     263-2880.\n           Sincerely,\n       80 signatures in support of Judge Sotomayor's confirmation.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                                  of People With Disabilities,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 7, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chair, Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Sessions: On behalf of the \n     undersigned national advocacy organizations representing the \n     interests of millions of people with disabilities, we write \n     to express our strong support for the confirmation of Judge \n     Sonia Sotomayor as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of \n     the United States. We have reviewed hundreds of Judge \n     Sotomayor's decisions, including her disability rights \n     decisions, from her career as a trial judge and appeals court \n     judge, along with her public statements in speeches and in \n     interviews. Based on her sterling judicial record, and on her \n     valuable life experience, we strongly believe that Judge \n     Sotomayor will adequately and fairly protect the rights of \n     all Americans, including people with disabilities. As such, \n     we ask that you vote to confirm her nomination.\n       Judge Sotomayor's decisions under our seminal civil rights \n     law, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), have \n     demonstrated a good understanding of--and healthy respect \n     for--the rights of persons with disabilities. In important \n     ADA cases concerning the definition of ``disability''--an \n     area of the law subject over the years to many \n     inappropriately narrowing judicial interpretations, so much \n     so that last year Congress amended the ADA to restore its \n     broad reach--Judge Sotomayor has often combed through \n     voluminous or technical testimony to determine whether the \n     plaintiff was protected by the law. Similarly, her \n     understanding of the importance of accommodations to help \n     workers with disabilities maintain employment is reflected in \n     her thoughtful decisions in workplace accommodation cases. \n     She has not been afraid to dissent from a decision finding \n     that plaintiffs did not have disabilities. Nor has she \n     been afraid to overturn a jury verdict where incorrect \n     instructions to the jury impeded a plaintiff's ability to \n     obtain relief under the ADA.\n       In her ADA decisions, and in other cases, Judge Sotomayor \n     has demonstrated great sensitivity to the needs of, and \n     challenges facing, people with disabilities in this country. \n     For example, her analysis of special education issues arising \n     under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) \n     reflects--and language from her decisions explicitly states--\n     a keen awareness of the importance of timely special \n     education services to students with disabilities and their \n     families, She has been vigilant in reviewing administrative \n     decisions denying Social Security benefits, especially where \n     applicants are not represented by attorneys. In a notable \n     dissent, Judge Sotomayor argued forcefully that the \n     appointment of a guardian ad litem violated the \n     constitutional rights of a plaintiff who had received \n     psychiatric treatments, because she was not properly notified \n     that she would have no control over her case once the \n     guardian was appointed.\n       Given her record of balanced and thoughtful decisionmaking, \n     we believe that Judge Sotomayor understands and appreciates \n     Congress's role in enacting important disability rights \n     protections, in enacting the ADA and other disability rights \n     laws, Congress carefully considered the history of people \n     with disabilities in the United States, and acknowledged that \n     many people with disabilities have been ostracized from their \n     families and communities--that they have been prevented from \n     going to school in their neighborhood schools, from working \n     at jobs for which they were qualified, and from participating \n     fully in all aspects of community life. The care that Judge \n     Sotomayor has taken in her disability rights decisions \n     indicates a respect for Congress's intent that these laws \n     have a broad remedial effect on the relationships between \n     individuals with disabilities and covered entities such as \n     employers, schools, state agencies, and public \n     accommodations. For this reason, we expect that she would \n     accord Congress appropriate deference in this area.\n       It is our belief that Judge Sotomayor will bring her fair, \n     thorough approach to disability rights cases to her work on \n     the Supreme Court, Judge Sotomayor understands the language \n     and purpose of the ADA and other disability rights laws. \n     Further, she understands that the decisions of judges, \n     including Supreme Court justices, that interpret these laws \n     have consequences for people with disabilities. Admirably, \n     she has been unafraid to take strong positions on issues \n     where she believes her reading of the law and facts is \n     correct.

Patrick Leahy, Chairman,\n     U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Sessions: As professors of \n     Disability Law, Disability Rights Law, and Special Education \n     Law from across the country, we write to express our support \n     for the confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor for appointment \n     to the United States Supreme Court.\n       A review of Judge Sotomayor's record on disability law \n     issues indicates that she has an excellent understanding of \n     the various laws' application to people with disabilities in \n     various contexts, including disability civil rights, \n     employment, special education, Social Security, Medicaid, and \n     guardianship.\n       Judge Sotomayor's record shows that she takes a balanced, \n     thoughtful approach to disability issues. Her analysis is \n     consistently thorough, practical and respectful of individual \n     rights. In close cases, she does not appear to follow any \n     particular ideology or activist agenda.\n\n\n                        Definition of Disability\n\n       With the passage of the Americans with Disabilities \n     Amendments Act of 2008, Congress repudiated much of the way \n     that the Supreme Court has interpreted the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act's definition of disability. Notwithstanding \n     this flux In the law, Judge Sotomayor's opinions in this area \n     stand out as being careful and reasoned, as she has engaged \n     in searching inquiries into the nature of plaintiffs' \n     impairments to determine whether they meet the functional and \n     legal definition of disability. (See Bartlett v. New York \n     State Board of Law Examiners, 2001 WI 930792 (S.D.N.Y, 2001).\n       Judge Sotomayor has not been reluctant to dissent in cases \n     where the law was being applied overly narrowly, particularly \n     on the Issue of coverage based on an employer's perceptions \n     of disability (``regarded as''). (See EEOC v. J.B. Hunt \n     Transp., Inc., 321 F.3d 69, 78 (2d Cir. 2003) (Sotomayor \n     dissenting)). After the passage of the ADA Amendments Act, \n     Judge Sotomayor's interpretation of the ``regarded as'' prong \n     of disability now has been adopted as consistent with \n     congressional intent.\n\n\n                             Discrimination\n\n       Judge Sotomayor has authored decisions holding, as a matter \n     of first impression in the Second Circuit, that ``mixed \n     motive'' analysis (allowing discrimination claims where there \n     are both discriminatory and non-discriminatory motives for a \n     challenged action) applies in ADA employment discrimination \n     claims (See Parker v. Columbia Pictures Industries, 204 F.3d \n     326 (2d Cir, 2000)). Her opinion fully analyzed, and was \n     consistent with, precedents in other jurisdictions and the \n     demonstrated intent of Congress.\n\n\n                        Reasonable Accommodation\n\n       Judge Sotomayor has participated in several cases reversing \n     grants of summary judgment for ADA defendants where there \n     were questions of fact regarding whether plaintiffs requested \n     accommodations were reasonable. Judge Sotomayor wrote a \n     decision reversing a jury verdict against the plaintiff for \n     failure to give a jury instruction indicating that, in \n     determining whether reassignment to a vacant position is a \n     reasonable accommodation, an offer of an inferior position is \n     not reasonable when a comparable, or lateral, position is \n     available, (See Norville v. Staten Is. Univ. Hosp., 196 F.3d \n     89 (2d Cir. 1999)).\n\n\n                               Education\n\n       Judge Sotomayor's education opinions reflect an appropriate \n     concern for parents' procedural rights, recognizing that, \n     only by ensuring parents' rights to hearings and records can \n     their children's substantive educational rights be ensured, \n     while also balancing states' rights under the ``cooperative \n     federalism'' envisioned by the Individuals with Disabilities \n     Education Act (IDEA). (See Taylor v. Vermont Dep't of Educ., \n     313 F.3d 768 (2d Cir, 2002). She has also written opinions \n     recognizing that the IDEA exhaustion requirement is not so \n     inflexible as to require parents to engage in futile efforts. \n     (See Murphy v. Arlington Cent. Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 297 \n     F.3d 195 (2d Cir. 2002)).\n\n\n         Constitutionality of Federal Civil Rights Legislation\n\n       Judge Sotomayor has resisted judicial attempts to \n     artificially limit federal legislative authority to \n     articulate and enforce individual rights. While demonstrating \n     respect for precedent, she has not interpreted the \n     Constitution to prevent Congress from recognizing individual \n     and civil rights. (See Hayden v. Pataki, 449 F.3d 305 (2d \n     Cir. 2006) (Sotomayor joining dissent from en bane decision); \n     Connecticut v. Cahill, 217 F.3d 93 (2d Cir. 2000) (Sotomayor \n     dissenting)). Her opinions reflect a deference to Congress \n     and to the plain language of the Constitution.\n       The Supreme Court is the guardian of our rights and \n     freedoms. As such, we recognize the importance of each \n     nomination to the Court. Based on her record as a district \n     court judge and as a Judge on the Second Circuit Court of \n     Appeals, we believe Judge Sotomayor has demonstrated \n     appropriate respect for the rule of law and the importance of \n     individual rights, Therefore, we urge you to confirm the \n     nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme \n     Court.\n       23 signatures in support of Judge Sotomayor's confirmation.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, it is with great honor that I rise to \nexpress my support for the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be an \nAssociate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In the Federalist Papers, explaining our great Constitution and the \nrole of the judiciary, Alexander Hamilton quoted Montesquieu to say:\n\n       There is no liberty, if the power of judging be not \n     separated from the legislative and executive power.\n\n  We Americans should take a moment to recognize that few other nations \nin the world possess such a strong emphasis on individual rights and \nliberties--something we cherish greatly. Too often we take it for \ngranted. We can, in large part, point to this Nation's independent \njudiciary as the reason for this emphasis on individual rights and \nliberties. Sure, they are enshrined in the Constitution, but the \nindependent judiciary, framed in the Constitution, helps make all that \npossible. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor stated, for example:\n\n       The Framers of the Constitution were so clear in the \n     Federalist Papers and elsewhere that they felt an independent \n     judiciary was critical to the success of the nation.\n\n  Our Founding Fathers were wise in setting up three separate branches \nof government, including a strong and independent judiciary. The \npinnacle of this system and its independence is the U.S. Supreme Court, \nthe highest Court in the land.\n  Our Constitution embodies this independence in the separation of \npowers and checks and balances throughout this great document. This is \nthe case in the structure of appointing our Supreme Court Justices. The \nConstitution provides of the President, for example, that:\n\n       He shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent \n     of the Senate, shall . . . appoint judges of the Supreme \n     Court.\n\n  Let me repeat, the Constitution says: the President ``shall nominate, \nand by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint . . \n. judges of the Supreme Court.''\n  The Senate's role is of utmost importance in defending the \nindependence of the Supreme Court. The Senate's active advice and \nconsent role in the confirmation of Supreme Court Justices helps to \nensure that nominees have the support of a broad political consensus.\n  Of the many responsibilities the Constitution grants to the Senate, \nfew are more critical than the Senate's role in the confirmation \nprocess for Supreme Court Justice nominees.\n  I take--and I know each of us in the Senate does--this constitutional \nresponsibility very seriously. Throughout my time in the Senate, I have \nestablished three criteria I use to examine nominees. These three \ncriteria are: professional competency, personal integrity, and a view \nof important issues within the mainstream of contemporary judicial \nthought. Those are the three. They are the criteria I use. I have \nanalyzed past Supreme Court nominees using these three criteria, \nincluding Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito. I will review my \ncriteria.\n  First, professional competency. The Supreme Court must not be the \ntesting ground for the development of a jurist's basic values. We do \nnot have time for that. A Justice cannot learn on the job, nor should \nshe require further training. The stakes are simply too high. She must \nbe professionally competent on day one.\n  Second, personal integrity. Nominees to our Nation's highest Court \nmust be of the highest caliber.\n\n[[Page S8834]]\n\n  And, third, the nominee should fall within the mainstream of \ncontemporary judicial thought. The next Justice must possess the \nrequisite judicial philosophy to be entrusted with the Court's sweeping \nconstitutional powers.\n  I believe that in the case of Judge Sonia Sotomayor, the answer to \nall three questions is a resounding ``yes.''\n  Judge Sotomayor is the embodiment of the American dream--rising from \na Bronx public housing project to a place among the judicial elite. She \nattended Princeton, where she graduated among the top of her class, and \nshe was editor of the Law Journal at Yale Law School.\n  Judge Sotomayor's work history is diverse and rich with experience. \nJudge Sotomayor began her legal career as assistant district attorney \nfor New York County in 1979. She then worked as a litigator at Pavia & \nHarcourt, a small firm in Manhattan, where she handled commercial \ncases.\n  Judge Sotomayor's 17 years on the bench, first as a district court \njudge, then on the second circuit, have yielded an enormous yet \nconsistent body of work. Her opinions show thorough and thoughtful \nanalysis, an eye for detail, and, in her own words, fidelity to the \nlaw.\n  I have no doubt that Judge Sotomayor has the professional competency \nthat the American people require of Supreme Court Justices.\n  Judge Sotomayor's life experiences also convey the personal integrity \nessential to a Supreme Court Justice. She has given back her time, \nenergy, and expertise to the community that helped shape who she is. \nShe has worked hard throughout her career, inspiring students across \nthe country to pursue study of the law.\n  For her service, Judge Sotomayor has received many honorary degrees--\nmany--countless awards, and accolades from her colleagues, clerks, and \nthe academic community. Judge Sotomayor has also made personal \nsacrifices. She recognizes the personal sacrifices she must make in \norder to serve as a Justice on the Supreme Court.\n  My third criteria--that is, a nominee who falls within the mainstream \nof contemporary judicial thought--is met, again, by reviewing Judge \nSotomayor's lengthy judicial record. Some of my colleagues want to \npaint her as a judicial activist with leftwing leanings.\n  In fact, in constitutional cases that came before the second circuit, \nJudge Sotomayor voted with the majority 98 percent of the time--hardly \na leftwing activist. In the rare cases where she held a government \naction unconstitutional, the decision was so clear that it was \nunanimous. Judges appointed by Republican Presidents have agreed with \nJudge Sotomayor 90 percent of the time--hardly a leftwing activist.\n  This is not the actions of an activist judge. In fact, this is a \njudge who can be relied on to produce a decision that most people can \nagree with.\n  I strongly believe Judge Sotomayor has met the three criteria I view \nessential to a Supreme Court Justice, and this was even more evident \nduring her confirmation hearing.\n  Over the 4 days of hearings on the nomination of Judge Sotomayor, \nwhat did we see? We saw a composed, intelligent, and thoughtful judge, \nsomeone committed to the law, and one with a rich life story and \nexpansive judicial experience, whose perspective will enrich the \njudgments of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In closing, I congratulate our President. I congratulate President \nObama on his historic nomination. I am confident Judge Sotomayor will \nmake an outstanding Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, for the benefit of Members, we will have no \nmore votes tonight. I just completed a meeting with Senator McConnell, \nand we are trying to work through when we are going to have a final \nvote on the Supreme Court nomination, what we are going to do on travel \npromotion, and what we are going to do for cash for clunkers. We are \ntrying to work through that. We hope we will have something worked out \ntonight, but knowing how things work around here, we probably will not \nbe able to get information to Members until tomorrow. But there will be \nno more votes tonight.\n  I have indicated the number of things we have to complete before we \nleave here, and that is all dependent on the amount of cooperation we \nget from the minority whether we finish tomorrow, Friday, or Saturday, \nor Sunday. There is no reason we can't put in a modestly long day \ntomorrow and complete everything, but we will have to see. We will do \nour best to try to get notice to Members as quickly as we can.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President. I support the nomination of Judge Sonia \nSotomayor to the Supreme Court.\n  Some of my colleagues have criticized Judge Sotomayor for her views. \nI welcome an independent thinker.\n  Some have criticized her for being a ``liberal'' in certain cases. \nWhat is wrong with being a liberal? Do all Supreme Court Justices have \nto qualify as being conservatives?\n  I welcome the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to the Court because she, \nunlike most members of the Supreme Court, has lived through the \nexperiences of many of our citizens. She knows what it is to be poor. \nShe knows what it is to have grown up in public housing.\n  I wish her the very best.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the confirmation \nof Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. She has received support from many parts of the community. The \nJudiciary Committee has received many letters of support for Judge \nSotomayor's nomination, from current and former public officials, \nincluding the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed \nOfficials, the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus, former \nPresident Bill Clinton, as well as former Judge Advocates General. \nThese letters of support continue to come.\n  Judge Sotomayor is well qualified, with significant judicial \nexperience. After graduating from Yale Law School, she worked in the \nNew York County District Attorney's Office prosecuting criminal cases \nsuch as homicides and robberies, child pornography, police misconduct, \nand fraud cases. She then spent over 7 years in private practice \nworking with large corporations on international business issues.\n  In 1992, Judge Sotomayor was appointed by President George H.W. Bush \nto the Southern District Court of New York. Six years later she was \nappointed by President Clinton to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals \nwhere she has served for more than 10 years.\n  Throughout her career, Judge Sotomayor has displayed a keen intellect \nand an understanding of the world around her. She knows the law and \nknows firsthand how it affects Americans' daily lives.\n  If confirmed, Judge Sotomayor will be the first Hispanic Justice and \nthe third female Justice to sit on the Supreme Court. Her confirmation \nwould make the Supreme Court more reflective of our great and diverse \nNation.\n  She brings a rich background and a wealth of experience and \nunderstanding of American life that will have an impact on the cases \nbefore the Court. As other Justices have noted, the unique personal \nstory of each Supreme Court Justice allows them to better understand \nthe parties before them and to better apply the law to the facts at \nhand. She has a deep understanding of the real lives of Americans--how \nher decisions can affect not only the parties before her but society at \nlarge.\n  In June, I had the pleasure to meet with Judge Sotomayor. During our \nmeeting we talked about Hawaii, its history, and its culture. We talked \nabout how being an island State forces us to work together to resolve \nchallenges and how our diverse culture helps us find unique solutions. \nJudge Sotomayor understands that. She knows our diversity ultimately \nmakes America stronger.\n  Her commonsense approach to the law gives Americans reason to believe \nthat she will be an unbiased and fair-minded Supreme Court Justice. In \nfact,\n\n[[Page S8835]]\n\nJudge Sotomayor's record demonstrates her realistic approach to \ndeciding cases and her fair treatment of the parties before her. She \nhas a long record of judicial restraint and respect for our \nconstitutional freedoms, established precedent, and the other branches \nof the government, including the lawmaking role of Congress.\n  Last month we watched as she handled her confirmation hearing with \npoise and composure. She addressed the committee members' questions \nwith thoughtfulness and respect. She demonstrated that she is up to the \nchallenge and the great responsibility of serving on the Supreme Court. \nI am confident, based on her experience and background, that she will \nmake an excellent addition to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I urge my colleagues to focus on her qualifications, her life \nexperience, and her judgment and join me in supporting Judge \nSotomayor's confirmation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the letters I mentioned \nat the beginning of my remarks be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                    National Association of Latino\n\n\n                              Elected and Appointed Officials,\n\n                                   Los Angeles, CA, July 10, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jess Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Sessions: On behalf of the \n     National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed \n     Officials (NALEO), I am writing to express our strong support \n     for the swift confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to serve \n     as Association Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. NALEO is \n     the leadership organization of the nation's more than 6,000 \n     Latino elected and appointed officials.\n       Judge Sotomayor is an exceptionally accomplished jurist who \n     has demonstrated a deep commitment to equal justice for all \n     Americans. She has excelled as a prosecutor, a corporate \n     litigator, a federal judge, and an appellate judge on the \n     Second Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Sotomayor has more \n     experience in the federal judiciary than any other person \n     nominated to the United States Supreme Court in a hundred \n     years.\n       In addition, during her distinguished career, Judge \n     Sotomayor has combined a profound respect for the rule of law \n     with careful and thoughtful analysis of the law's impact on \n     the day-to-day realities of our diverse nation. Through her \n     extensive public service efforts, she has promoted equal \n     opportunity in employment and housing, and expanded access to \n     the electoral process.\n       NALEO's Board reached the decision to support Judge \n     Sotomayor's nomination after a thorough review of her \n     qualifications conducted in accordance with the Board's \n     principles governing the assessment of federal judiciary \n     nominees. This assessment involved a comprehensive evaluation \n     of the Judge's professional accomplishments, and her opinions \n     and rulings that affect equal access to civic and economic \n     opportunities. The Board also reviewed the Judge's record of \n     service to the legal profession, the judiciary, and the \n     public.\n       We believe that the confirmation of Judge Sotomayor is \n     particularly important, because it will help enhance the \n     diversity of the nation's highest court, where no Latino has \n     yet served. In order for our judicial system to carry out \n     justice effectively and interpret our laws fairly, our judges \n     must understand how laws affect the daily realities of the \n     life of our nation's diverse residents. Latinos are the \n     nation's second largest and fastest growing population group, \n     and Judge Sotomayor will bring a deep understanding of the \n     issues facing Latinos and all Americans to the Supreme Court. \n     Thus, her service as an Associate Justice will greatly enrich \n     the administration of justice in our nation.\n       NALEO believes Judge Sotomayor will be an invaluable asset \n     to our nation's highest court because she possesses \n     exceptional judicial expertise and a firm dedication to our \n     laws and Constitution. The full Senate must confirm the \n     Judge's nomination by the August Congressional recess in \n     order for Judge Sotomayor to participate in September when \n     the Court confers, and to be seated on the first Monday in \n     October, when the court publicly convenes. We urge the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee to help meet this schedule by advancing \n     Judge Sotomayor's nomination to the full Senate as \n     expeditiously as possible.\n       Thank you for attention to this matter. Should you have any \n     questions, please contact me.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Arturo Vargas,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     Congressional\n\n\n                                Asian Pacific American Caucus,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: On behalf \n     of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), I \n     am writing to inform you of CAPAC's endorsement of the \n     nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate \n     Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       CAPAC applauds President Obama's decision to choose Judge \n     Sonia Sotomayor as his Supreme Court nominee A brilliant \n     legal mind, Judge Sotomayor has already served our country \n     with great distinction. Over the course of her distinguished \n     career, Judge Sotomayor has been a fearless guardian of the \n     rule of law and demonstrated integrity of the highest class, \n     earning her the respect of the legal community.\n       Despite humble beginnings from the South Bronx, Judge \n     Sotomayor went on to become the valedictorian of her high \n     school, the top undergraduate student in her class at \n     Princeton, and an editor of the Yale Law Journal. Her legal \n     career has been as dazzling as her life story, and she is \n     unquestionably qualified to serve as a Supreme Court Justice.\n       She would bring to the Supreme Court her experience in \n     nearly every level of our judicial system as a prosecutor, \n     litigator, trial court and appellate judge--offering a depth \n     and breadth of experience that will inform her work on our \n     nation's highest court. In fact, she has a wider range of \n     federal legal experience than any Justice sitting on today's \n     Court.\n       CAPAC extends its endorsement with pride. Members of our \n     caucus look forward to working with you to ensure a fair and \n     smooth confirmation process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Michael M. Honda,\n     Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 14, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I write respectfully to urge the \n     Senate's speedy confirmation of the Honorable Sonia Sotomayor \n     as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United \n     States.\n       I had the privilege to name Judge Sotomayor to a position \n     in the Federal Judiciary. On that occasion, she was a \n     trailblazer as the first Latina nominated to a U.S. Circuit \n     Court. As the first Hispanic nominee to the U.S. Supreme \n     Court, Judge Sotomayor once again breaks new ground. If \n     confirmed, Justice Sotomayor will be the second jurist in \n     history nominated to three judgeships by three different \n     Presidents. I am very proud of our nation at this auspicious \n     moment.\n       It is my hope that Judge Sotomayor will join the Supreme \n     Court, where she can make a unique contribution through her \n     experience as a state prosecutor and a trial judge. Her \n     compelling life story, being raised by a single mother of \n     modest means who instilled in her the values of hard work and \n     educational achievement, is the true embodiment of the \n     American Dream.\n       I congratulate President Obama for selecting an eminently \n     qualified nominee and encourage the Senate to recognize Judge \n     Sotomayor's outstanding qualifications and experiences, which \n     make her worthy of the honored role of Associate Justice of \n     the Supreme Court of the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n     Bill Clinton.\n                                  ____\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Jefferson B. Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Lindsey Graham,\n     Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washinton, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Sessions, and Senator \n     Graham: We, former Judge Advocates General and a general in \n     the Judge Advocate General's Corps, respectfully write to \n     support the confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as an \n     Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n       Judge Sotomayor is well-qualified for the Supreme Court and \n     should be confirmed. She has earned a reputation for careful, \n     narrowly-tailored decisions in seventeen years as a federal \n     judge, applying the law impartially, and faithfully honoring \n     precedent and the rule of law. Earlier in her career, she \n     impressed her colleagues as a focused and hard-working \n     prosecutor and corporate litigator. She has distinguished \n     herself in each role, displaying rigorous thinking and \n     careful attention to the facts before her. Judge Sotomayor \n     would serve the Court, and the nation, well.\n\n[[Page S8836]]\n\n       We urge your speedy confirmation of this qualified nominee.\n           Sincerely,\n     James P. Cullen,\n       Brigadier General, USA (Ret.).\n     Donald J. Guter,\n       Rear Admiral, USN (Ret.).\n     John D. Hutson,\n       Rear Admiral, USN (Ret.).\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, over the past few weeks of meetings and \nhearings, both the Senate and the American people have witnessed the \nintelligence, the legal understanding, and dedication to the law that \nmakes Judge Sonia Sotomayor well qualified to be our next Supreme Court \nJustice. Today, I rise to support her nomination and share a few \nthoughts on why I think Judge Sotomayor should be confirmed as the next \nU.S. Supreme Court Justice.\n  When I was in college I took a freshman seminar on the Bill of \nRights. Each week, our professor would give us the facts of a Supreme \nCourt case without the opinions and would ask us to draft our opinion \nof a situation. After we had prepared our opinion, we would share them \nthe next week, and then and only then read the official majority and \nminority opinions of the Justices. It was quite an education in the \nBill of Rights.\n  Over the course of the semester, many of us came to identify with the \napproach and viewpoints of one Justice or another. It was very helpful \nin gaining insight into my own thinking and that of our Supreme Court. \nSo when I met Judge Sotomayor, I posed a question to her: Which judge \ndo you most identify with? Her answer was Justice Benjamin Cardozo.\n  Let me tell my colleagues a little bit about Benjamin Cardozo. A \nnative of New York, he served on the New York Court of Appeals, the \nhighest State court in New York, from 1914 to 1932, and then on the \nU.S. Supreme Court from 1932 to 1938. Cardozo was descended from \nPortuguese Jewish immigrants who long ago had fled the Spanish \nInquisition, and Cardozo was the first Jewish person to serve on the \nNew York Court of Appeals. His careful, brilliant opinions on New York \nlaw earned him wide recognition as one of our Nation's most outstanding \njudges.\n  When he was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1932, he was confirmed \nby the Senate by a unanimous voice vote. I can see many reasons why \nJudge Sotomayor, as a native New Yorker, as a child of Spanish-speaking \nimmigrants from Puerto Rico, and as a longtime judge in New York might \nidentify with Justice Cardozo. I am sure Judge Sotomayor would love to \nextend the parallel to Cardozo's unanimous Senate confirmation vote. \nBut Judge Sotomayor cited none of these reasons. Rather, she pointed to \nhis particular approach to judging--the careful, fact-intensive \napproach that was Cardozo's hallmark.\n  Let me put that observation in context. Cardozo served as a judge \nduring the industrializing early 20th century. Because of the rapidly \nchanging times in which he lived, he was faced with a wide range of \ncases that raised new and difficult issues. His opinions became \nrecognized for drawing deeply on the facts of individual cases and \nrelied heavily on the development of the law that came before him. He \nwas innovating and forward-looking but also deeply respectful of \ncareful development of the law. He described his style as one of \nsteady, hard work. Justice Cardozo and Judge Sotomayor share a love for \nsteady, hard work--the steady, careful development of law that comes \nfrom fact-intensive, careful judging. These are approaches to law that \nwill serve the judge well as our next Supreme Court Justice.\n\n  Interpreting the Constitution is, of course, a challenge. Our \nConstitution is mostly written in broad, general directives. For \nexample, our first amendment says Congress shall pass no law \n``abridging the freedom of speech.'' Our fourth amendment ensures \npersons shall be free in their homes from ``unreasonable searches and \nseizures.'' The fourteenth amendment declares that no State shall \n``deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of \nthe laws.''\n  Those broad phrases do not provide easy answers to complicated cases. \nWhen is a search or seizure unreasonable? When does a practice or law \nabridge freedom of speech? When does a practice or law abridge equal \nprotection under the law?\n  Our first Chief Justice, John Marshall, correctly noted it is the \nresponsibility of the judicial branch to provide answers. How should a \nSupreme Court Justice go about providing these answers?\n  Judge Sotomayor's background and record offer a model for how it \nshould be done. First, she brings to her work extraordinary academic \nand experiential qualifications. She graduated at the top of her class \nfrom Princeton University and from Yale Law School. She brings valuable \nlife experience from growing up in public housing in the Bronx, from \nserving as a prosecutor in New York City, and from working as an \nattorney in private practice. In 1992, she was appointed to the Federal \nbench by President George Herbert Walker Bush. During the following 17 \nyears, including 11 on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit, she weighed in on over 3,000 panel decisions and authored \nabout 400 published opinions.\n  What this body of work shows, more than anything else, is that Judge \nSotomayor is diligent and prudent in her approach to hearing and \ndeciding cases. She thoroughly weighs the facts and carefully adapts \nthe principles expounded by previous courts to reach a just result in \neach new set of circumstances. In fact, the reason many find it \ndifficult to pin a label on her--be it conservative or liberal--is \nbecause her decisions do not follow ideological lines. Rather, they \nemerge from close readings of previous cases and careful thought about \nthe implications of the particular facts. Clearly, the judge's respect \nfor Justice Cardozo isn't just an off-the-cuff remark. Hers is record a \njudicial record that Benjamin Cardozo would be proud of.\n  Just as Cardozo faced the challenge of interpreting the Constitution \nin a newly industrialized state, so, too, do we face the challenge of \ninterpreting the Constitution in a high-tech, globally interconnected \nworld. The answers to tomorrow's constitutional questions will not be \neasy. But if we follow Judge Sotomayor's approach, our constitutional \ninterpretations will be built on the wise interpretations of the past. \nWe will, with this approach, have confidence that our Supreme Court \nwill stay true to the body of principles of justice and freedom that \nare at the heart of our constitutional tradition.\n  Let me summarize. Judge Sotomayor has a stellar academic background. \nShe brings diverse and valuable life experiences. She has a \ndistinguished record on the bench, and she will bring a carefully \nmeasured judicial approach and valuable insights to our Supreme Court.\n  Moreover, the value of the diversity that Sotomayor would bring to \nthe Court, as a woman, as an American of Puerto Rican descent, cannot \nbe overstated. We often talk about government by and for the people. \nThat is a cherished part of our tradition. We often talk about it in \nterms of the diversity of those who serve in the executive branch. We \noften talk about it being important in the diversity of those who serve \nin the legislature, so we can bring valuable insights to bear. But \ngovernment by and for the people extends to the judicial branch as \nwell. We need to have the insights that flow from having judges with \nmany different life experiences.\n  I am confident Sonia Sotomayor will be a wise guardian of our \nConstitution. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to join me in casting \ntheir votes to confirm Judge Sonia Sotomayor as an Associate Justice of \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I want to say a few words about Judge \nSotomayor and about the hearing process we have just been through.\n  First, I commend Chairman Leahy and his staff for a remarkably well-\nrun proceeding in the Judiciary Committee. I think anyone who saw the 4 \ndays of hearings would agree that the\n\n[[Page S8837]]\n\nprocess was scrupulously fair. Everyone got a chance to ask all the \nquestions they wanted to ask. They had the time they needed for follow \nup questions, and for follow ups to those follow ups. No stone was left \nunturned, even if the answers the Judge gave weren't always what the \nquestioner hoped to hear.\n  What the public doesn't see is the work that is done behind the \nscenes to get us to that point. Not just the setup of the room and all \nthe complex preparations that go into the smooth running of the hearing \nitself, but also the enormous effort to make all of the background \ninformation that came to the Judiciary Committee available online \nvirtually immediately--all of Judge Sotomayor's speeches and articles, \nover 100 letters and reports from people who know her, or organizations \nthat wished to express their views on her nomination, as well as all of \nthe materials received from the PRLDEF organization in response to the \nJudiciary Committee's request. Chairman Leahy has set a new standard \nfor transparency and public access to Supreme Court nomination \nproceedings, and I truly commend him for that, and I also thank him and \nhis staff for the tremendous work they have done over the last several \nweeks.\n  The scrutiny to be applied to a President's nominee to the Supreme \nCourt is the highest of any nomination. The Supreme Court, alone among \nour courts, has the power to revisit and reverse its precedents, and so \nI believe that anyone who sits on that Court must not have a pre-set \nagenda to reverse precedents with which he or she disagrees, and must \nrecognize and appreciate the awesome power and responsibility of the \nCourt to do justice when other branches of government infringe on or \nignore the freedoms and rights of our citizens. This is the same \nstandard I applied to the nominations of both Chief Justice Roberts and \nJustice Alito during the last administration.\n  What we saw over 4 days of hearings on the nomination of Judge \nSotomayor was a thoughtful, intelligent, and careful judge, a person \ncommitted to her craft and to the law, someone whose remarkable life \nstory and varied experience will add diversity and perspective, which \nthe Court sorely needs. Not only will Judge Sotomayor become the first \nLatina Justice, and only the third woman, to serve on the Court, but \nshe will be the only Justice who has served as a trial court judge, and \nshe will have more judicial experience at the outset of her service on \nthe Court than any of her colleagues did. There is no doubt she is \nhighly qualified, and I think we saw during those 4 days of hearings \nthat she has an admirable judicial temperament and demeanor that will \nserve her well on the Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor's record and testimony satisfied me that she \nunderstands the important role of the Court in protecting civil \nliberties, even in a time of war. She sat on a Second Circuit panel \nthat struck down portions of the National Security Letter statute that \nwas so dramatically expanded by the Patriot Act. And when I asked her \nhow September 11 changed her view of the law, she gave the following \nanswer:\n\n       The Constitution is a timeless document. It was intended to \n     guide us through decades, generation after generation, to \n     everything that would develop in our country. It has \n     protected us as a nation. It has inspired our survival. That \n     doesn't change.\n\n  Later, when we discussed the Korematsu case, she said:\n\n       A judge should never rule from fear. A judge should rule \n     from law and the Constitution.\n\n  Those words give me hope that she will have the courage to defend the \nliberties of the American people from an overreaching executive or \nlegislative branch.\n  At the same time, she appreciates the deference the judiciary must \ngive to the legislature as it seeks to solve the problems facing the \nAmerican people. I don't see in her record or in her public statements \na burning desire to overturn precedent or to remake constitutional law \nin the image of her own personal preference, and I certainly don't see \nbias of any kind. I was also impressed with her record and statements \nduring the hearing on judicial ethics. Judge Sotomayor seems to \nunderstand that the extraordinary power she will wield as a Justice \nmust be accompanied by extraordinary care to guard against any apparent \nconflict of interest.\n  All that being said, I do want to express a note of dissatisfaction. \nNot with Chairman Leahy, or with my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee, and certainly not with Judge Sotomayor, but with a \nnominations process that I think fails to educate the Senate or the \npublic about the views of potential Justices on the Supreme Court. I \nhave said before that I do not understand why the only person who \ncannot express an opinion on virtually anything the Supreme Court has \ndone in recent years is the person from whom the American public most \nneeds to hear. It makes no sense to me that the current Justices can \nhear future cases notwithstanding the fact that we know their views on \na legal issue because they wrote or joined an opinion in a previous \ncase that raised a similar issue, but nominees for the Court can refuse \nto tell us what they think about that previous case under the theory \nthat doing so would compromise their independence or their ability to \nkeep an open mind in a future case.\n  I remain unconvinced that the dodge that all nominees now use--``I \ncan't answer that question because the issue might come before me on \nthe Court''--is justified. Nomination hearings have become little more \nthan theater, where Senators try to ask clever questions and nominees \ntry to come up with cleverer ways to respond without answering. This \nproblem certainly did not start with these hearings or this nominee, \nbut perhaps it is inevitable. The chances of the Senate rejecting a \nnominee who adopts this strategy are very remote, based on the recent \nhistory of nominations. Nonetheless, I do not think it makes for \nmeaningful advice and consent.\n  So I cannot say that I learned everything about Judge Sonia Sotomayor \nthat I would have liked to learn. But what I did learn makes me believe \nthat she will serve with distinction on the Court, and that I should \nvote in favor of her confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it is a privilege to rise to speak on \nbehalf of President Obama's nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be \nan Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  This takes me back to a time, shortly after I was privileged to be \nelected to the Senate, when President George H.W. Bush nominated David \nSouter to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United \nStates. David Souter had, by that time, been in law enforcement as an \nattorney general of New Hampshire. As a former attorney general, I felt \nan instant kinship with him. He had also been a trial judge in New \nHampshire, a member of the New Hampshire Supreme Court and, ultimately, \nhe sat on the Federal First Circuit Court of Appeals. He was proposed \nto President Bush 41 by our former colleague, Warren Rudman, a Senator \nfrom New Hampshire, a great Senator and a great friend.\n  I remember when Senator Rudman brought David Souter around and \nintroduced him after President Bush nominated him. It has been my \nprivilege to have had a friendship with David Souter in the company of \nformer attorneys general, particularly those who gather periodically to \nspeak of matters past, present, and future. I wanted to speak of \nJustice Souter because, of course, it is his announcement of retirement \nthat opens the vacancy that President Obama has asked us to fill with \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor.\n  In the case of now-Justice Souter, I was privileged in one of my \nearly votes here to join 89 of my Senate colleagues in voting to \nconfirm Justice Souter. With his retirement this summer, after two \ndecades on the Court, he has become the first Justice to retire of the \nsix Supreme Court Justices on whose nominations I have had the \nprivilege and responsibility of voting.\n  I wish to first thank and commend Justice Souter for his decades of \npublic service, generally, and, specifically, for his thoughtful, \ndistinguished service to the highest Court of our land. I know Justice \nSouter is a very honorable, straightforward man. He is--if I may say so \nas a New Englander--a quintessential New Englander. He carries with him \nall the great constitutional traditions of the part of our country from \nwhich I am proud to hail. He\n\n[[Page S8838]]\n\nbrings with him some characteristics that are best associated with a \nNew Englander. He is straightforward. He is not one for flowery \nrhetoric. He is one who is committed to integrity in his personal life, \nas well as his public life. He has a great New England sense of humor--\nprobably not often seen in his decisions, but I bear personal testimony \nhere, though I am not under oath at the moment, to that great quality \nhe has.\n  I know there are some who have become critics of Justice Souter, who \nhave said he isn't what they thought he would be when he was nominated. \nBut when he was nominated, what he presented himself as was a man of \nthe law who believed in our Constitution, believed in the values that \nunderlie it, and one who would always do what he thought was right. He \nhas done that in his years on the U.S. Supreme Court. I haven't agreed \nwith every opinion Justice Souter has ever written, but this I know: \nEvery time he sat to write an opinion or to join an opinion, he did so \nafter the most careful consideration. He is an extraordinarily hard-\nworking, disciplined individual and, ultimately, he reached a judgment \nthat he felt was right, according to the requirements of our \nConstitution. I salute this great American, this quiet American, but \nthis profoundly patriotic American, and wish him well in the years he \nhas ahead of him as he returns now, by his own choice, to his beloved \nNew Hampshire.\n  The life tenure of Supreme Court Justices--a lifetime appointment for \nthose who choose not to step down--defines, in many ways, the \nimportance of the Senate's role in providing advice and consent to the \nPresident on Supreme Court nominees. I have always felt, from the time \nI first came in--and the first vote I cast was on a controversial \nnomination for Secretary of Defense. It was in 1989. I spent a lot of \ntime looking back at the history of the advice and consent clause. To \nmake a long story short, I felt it wasn't for me to vote for a nominee \nof the President, to advise and consent. I did not have to feel that \nnominee was the person I would have chosen but just that that nominee \nwas within the range of being acceptable and was prepared and qualified \nfor that job. There is a slightly higher standard for Supreme Court \nnominees because they do serve lifetime appointments.\n  It is with that in mind that I approach this nomination of Sonia \nSotomayor. I have met with Judge Sotomayor and have reviewed her \njudicial record. I followed her confirmation hearing before the \nJudiciary Committee and, based on all that, I conclude, without \nquestion, that she possesses remarkable intellectual and legal \ncredentials, has a distinguished record of experience in the public and \nprivate sector, and a deep commitment to our country and our \nConstitution. I will, therefore, vote affirmatively to consent to her \nnomination to the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor's 17-year record as a Federal judge speaks volumes \nabout her qualifications to serve on the Court, and that is why I feel \nshe more than passes the threshold for this lifetime appointment. \nDuring 6 years as a trial judge on the U.S. district court and 11 years \nas a judge on the court of appeals, Sonia Sotomayor has shown she \npossesses a superior intellect, a commendable judicial temperament, and \nan admirable respect for the role of established precedent in our legal \nsystem.\n  It is usually and quite naturally true that those who know people \nbest are those with whom they have worked most closely. Those who have \nworked most closely with Judge Sotomayor are consistent, even effusive, \nin their praise for her personal attributes, her professional \nqualifications, and her fairness. Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs of the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals, said:\n\n       Sonia Sotomayor is a well-loved colleague on our court--\n     everybody from every point of view knows that she is fair and \n     decent in all her dealings.\n\n  Another colleague on the Second Circuit, Senior Judge Roger Miner, \nsaid:\n\n       I don't think I'd go so far as to classify her in one camp \n     or another. I think she just deserves the classification of \n     outstanding judge.\n\n  While the most significant facts about Judge Sotomayor are her \npersonal qualifications and her judicial record, I also note that women \nare underrepresented on the Supreme Court of the United States. I say \nthat not just as a matter of numbers but as a matter of qualification.\n  I thank the President for this historic nomination of the first \nAmerican of Hispanic descent to the Supreme Court. This nomination was \nclearly made on the basis of merit, not ethnicity or gender. I think it \nis consistent with her merit. But acknowledging her ethnicity, her \nselection represents another barrier that has been broken in American \nlife. When that happens in American life, the doors open wider for \nevery other American.\n  I will be proud to vote yes to confirm Sonia Sotomayor, of New York, \nto be Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nRepublican time for the next hour be allocated as follows: Senator \nEnsign, 30 minutes; Senator Murkowski, 20 minutes; and Senator \nSessions, 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about Supreme Court \nnominee, Judge Sonia Sotomayor.\n  The words ``Equal Justice Under Law'' are engraved in the stone above \nthe entrance to the U.S. Supreme Court. This simple phrase, ``Equal \nJustice Under Law,'' carries an immense amount of weight and \nresponsibility.\n  As a Senator tasked with the monumental responsibility of confirming \na Supreme Court nominee, it is with these four words in mind that I \ncarefully studied this Supreme Court nominee. There is no denying that \nJudge Sotomayor is impressive. Her qualifications, diverse experience, \nand personal disposition make her a worthy candidate for this \nnomination. The fact that this is a proud moment for our Nation has not \nbeen lost on me. This year, America has certainly filled the history \nbooks. On the tails of his historic election, President Obama has \nchosen to nominate the Nation's first Hispanic woman to the Supreme \nCourt. President Obama and Judge Sotomayor have made history, but the \nimpact they will have on future generations is so much greater.\n  Although, as a child, Judge Sotomayor could do little more than \ndream. She was born in the Bronx, raised by a single mother after her \nfather passed away when she was 9 years of age. Her mother instilled in \nher a deep value for education and a strong work ethic, which paid off \nwith a full scholarship to Princeton University. She graduated summa \ncum laude from Princeton and went on to attend Yale Law School, where \nshe earned her juris doctorate. She is truly an inspiration for people \nacross our great country.\n  Judge Sotomayor's humble upbringing is reminiscent of another recent \njudicial nominee, also of Hispanic heritage, who rose above his meager \nmeans in New York to attend and graduate with honors from Ivy League \nschools. And the similarities do not stop there. I am referring to the \nAmerican success story of Miguel Estrada, an individual equally \ndeserving of our respect.\n  Miguel Estrada came to America as a Honduran immigrant at the age of \n17. With very little English in his vocabulary, he rose to the top of \nthe legal profession after graduating with honors from Columbia \nUniversity and Harvard Law School. He clerked for Supreme Court Justice \nAnthony Kennedy and was a former Assistant Solicitor General of the \nUnited States. Miguel Estrada served in the administrations of both \nPresident Bill Clinton and President George W. Bush.\n  In 2001, President George W. Bush recognized his talent and nominated \nhim to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. Unfortunately, \npartisan politics came into play, and Estrada's record was not judged \npurely on its merits. He did not receive the fair consideration that \nhas been given to Judge Sotomayor. He never even made it as far as a \nconfirmation vote. Miguel Estrada's nomination and expected ascension \nto the Supreme Court was cut short by a Democrat filibuster--as a \nmatter of fact, seven Democrat filibusters that helped create a new \nstandard for judicial nominees and the Senate's constitutional role of \n``advise and consent.'' Had he been given\n\n[[Page S8839]]\n\nthe fair consideration he deserved, the Hispanic community would have \nanother great role model in our judicial system.\n  As I have previously stated, I am impressed by Judge Sotomayor. In \nour meeting, I found her very personable and easy to talk with. \nUnfortunately, our discussions during that meeting did little to \nalleviate the concerns I had upon reviewing her record and her public \nstatements, including her testimony before the Judiciary Committee. \nJudge Sotomayor's record and testimony have left me with more \nuncertainty and doubt instead of the assurance that she has the ability \nto rule with a fair and impartial adherence to the rule of law. I fear \nthat Judge Sotomayor, when seated on the Supreme Court bench, will not \nbe a zealous advocate for ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' Many of her \nresponses to me and to my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee were \ntroubling, not necessarily because of substance, but more due to the \nlack of it.\n  I remain concerned that we just do not know who we will be getting on \nthe Supreme Court. The inconsistencies in Judge Sotomayor's testimony, \njudicial record, and writings make it impossible to fully understand \nher commitment to how she will interpret and uphold the Constitution.\n  This especially concerns me because a lifetime appointment to the \nSupreme Court comes without the barriers of additional judicial review \nthat someone has in a lower court. The restraints of precedent that she \nwas under as a district court and circuit court judge will not apply.\n  Even if I was to solely consider her judicial record, I cannot in \ngood conscience dismiss her cursory treatment of cases dealing with \nserious and important constitutional questions. Some of her decisions \nhave run contrary to the Constitution, were decided in opinions lacking \nanalysis, and are consistent with liberal political thought.\n  For example, there was her 2006 private property decision that \npermitted the government to take property from one developer and give \nit to another.\n  And we have heard a lot about her 2008 Ricci decision, recently \noverturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, which would have effectively \nallowed employers to engage in reverse discrimination, so long as their \nclaims of their actions were motivated by a desire to avoid conflicts \nwith favored minority groups. A majority of Justices found that Judge \nSotomayor misapplied the law.\n  Then there was her 2009 second amendment decision in Maloney v. Cuomo \nthat would give States the power to ban firearms. The unsigned \ndecision, joined by Judge Sotomayor, held that New York's state statute \ndoes not interfere with a fundamental right. The opinion also dismissed \nthe argument that a complete ban violates the Second Amendment by \nciting Supreme Court cases from the 19th century holding that the \nSecond Amendment applies only to the Federal Government and not to the \nStates. To me, the Maloney ruling is an indication that Judge Sotomayor \ndoes not view the Second Amendment as protecting a fundamental right.\n  This is further supported by a 2004 decision in U.S. v. Sanchez-\nVillar in which she also joined a decision that flatly denied gun \npossession as a fundamental right. While that decision pre-dated \nHeller, the Maloney decision occurred more than six months after the \nHeller decision, and yet Sotomayor again dismissed the possibility that \nthe second amendment protects a ``fundamental right.'' Once again in \nthe decision, no analysis was given as to why. Her conclusion was that, \none, the Second Amendment does not apply to the States and, two, the \nSecond Amendment does not protect a fundamental right.\n  Had Judge Sotomayor looked to the history of the Fourteenth \nAmendment, the Civil Rights Act, and the Freedman Bureau's Act, she \nwould have recognized--or at least she should have recognized--that \nthey were enacted to ensure that the constitutional rights of freedmen \nwere protected against State infringement. This is especially true as \nit relates to the Second Amendment and the practice by States and \nlocalities that were outlawing the ownership of firearms by newly freed \nslaves.\n  Given this information, coupled with Judge Sotomayor's record, I \nbelieve it is reasonable to conclude that she has a bias against \nfirearms and our constitutional right to ``keep and bear arms.'' Should \nwe expect her to rule differently when the Supreme Court takes up the \nMaloney case or the Ninth or Seventh Circuit cases that deal with the \nquestion of whether the Second Amendment applies to the States?\n  Judge Sotomayor appears to believe that the Second Amendment is not \nan individual, fundamental right. It is, in fact, a fundamental right \ngranted to all Americans and enshrined in our Constitution. The Second \nAmendment is the cornerstone of our Bill of Rights. If it is chipped \naway or infringed upon in any way, our freedom and liberties will be \ncompromised. It is my fear that Judge Sotomayor will threaten Second \nAmendment rights for all Americans.\n  This was not the first time her bias and propensity to rule with \npurpose-driven results impacted her judicial decision making. \nUnfortunately, Judge Sotomayor's record and testimony provides more \nuncertainty and doubt than a declaration to her ability to rule with a \nfair and impartial adherence to the rule of law.\n  Presidents, Senators, judges, and Supreme Court Justices alike take \nan oath to preserve, to protect, and to defend the Constitution. It is \nour most solemn duty. Judges are expected to be tethered to the \nConstitution and impartially apply the law to the facts. The American \npeople overwhelmingly reject the notion that unelected judges should \nset policy or allow their social, moral, or political views to \ninfluence the outcome of cases. I worry about her prior dismissal of \nthe goal of judicial impartiality as an unattainable ``aspiration.'' \nAnd I disagree that embracing her biases is a good thing.\n  Judge Sotomayor's views on international law are also troubling. \nWhile the use or consideration of foreign and international law in \njudicial decision-making is not new and remains a subject of \ncontroversy, Judge Sotomayor appears to embrace using international \nstandards or laws to decide U.S. constitutional questions.\n  I asked Judge Sotomayor about her thoughts on the use of foreign law. \nHer answers on this worrisome issue only confirm a contradictory \nposition reflected in many of her public statements and an apparent \nendorsement of using foreign law as a source of creative ideas.\n  During the confirmation hearings, Judge Sotomayor was asked if she \nagreed that ``there is no authority for a Supreme Court justice to \nutilize foreign law in terms of making decisions based on the \nConstitution or statutes.'' This was her response:\n\n       Unless the statute requires you or directs you to look at \n     foreign law . . . the answer is no. Foreign law cannot be \n     used as a holding or a precedent or to bind or to influence \n     the outcome of a legal decision interpreting the Constitution \n     or American law that doesn't direct you to that law.\n\n  She went on to say:\n\n       I will not use foreign law to interpret the Constitution or \n     American statutes. I will use American law, constitutional \n     law to interpret those laws, except in the situations where \n     American law directs a court.\n\n  This seems fairly straightforward. But her answers to written \nquestions are contradictory, saying:\n\n       In limited circumstances, decisions of foreign courts can \n     be a source of ideas informing our understanding of our own \n     constitutional rights.\n       To the extent that the decisions of foreign courts contain \n     ideas that are helpful to that task, American courts may wish \n     to consider those ideas.\n\n  This was not the only time she offered support for utilizing foreign \nlaw. On April 28, 2009, Judge Sotomayor gave a speech to the ACLU of \nPuerto Rico entitled ``How Federal Judges Look to International and \nForeign Law Under Article VI of the U.S. Constitution.'' Article VI \nmakes the Constitution and subsequent laws the ``supreme law of the \nland.'' In her April speech, she gave a broad defense of the practice \nby some American judges of looking to foreign and international law as \na source of ``good ideas'' in deciding questions of American law. She \nstated that U.S. courts can use foreign law to ``help us understand \nwhether our understanding of our own constitutional rights f[a]ll[s] \ninto the mainstream of human thinking.''\n\n  Apparently, the sentiments Judge Sotomayor expressed this past April \nare not new. In 2007, she wrote a forward to a book on international \njudges, titled ``The International Judge,''\n\n[[Page S8840]]\n\nwhere she assumed there is value to ``learn[ing] from foreign law and \nthe international community when interpreting our Constitution.''\n  I believe, and Justices Roberts, Scalia, and Thomas agree, it is \nillegitimate for judges to look to foreign sources for guidance in \ninterpreting the Constitution and laws ratified and enacted by ``We the \nPeople, of the United States.'' Judge Sotomayor has also specifically \ncriticized Justices Scalia and Thomas for their opposition to relying \non foreign law to interpret the Constitution. She has even suggested \nthat we will lose our influence globally if we are not open to foreign \nand international law.\n  While Judge Sotomayor acknowledges that judges are prohibited from \ntreating foreign statutes or foreign court judgments as binding, she \nhas publicly embraced their use in formulating decisions. Judge \nSotomayor attempted to distinguish the ``use'' of foreign law to decide \nAmerican legal questions from the act of ``considering'' foreign law by \n``us[ing] the ideas of foreign courts in some of our decision-making.''\n  According to Sotomayor, any effort to ``outlaw the use of foreign or \ninternational law . . . would be asking American judges to . . . close \ntheir minds to good ideas.'' She further stated, ``How can you ask a \nperson to close their ears? Ideas have no boundaries. Ideas are what \nset our creative juices flowing.''\n  I agree, good ideas are important. Aren't we fortunate that our \nConstitution is full of them? And our Constitution will always be the \nsupreme law of our land.\n  Unfortunately, we have already experienced the negative impact of so-\ncalled good ideas from foreign law and how some on the Supreme Court \nmay be using them to erode our constitutionally protected rights. Let's \ntake a look at the controversial 2005 Supreme Court decision of Kelo v. \nNew London.\n  It appears the global ``good idea'' of ``Sustainable Development'' \nfrom a U.N. Earth Summit may have influenced the majority decision to \nwidely expand the definition of the ``Takings Clause'' and eminent \ndomain from its original purpose--``public use'' for bridges, roads, or \ntraditional government uses.\n  In Kelo, I believe the Court incorrectly ruled against the private \nproperty owners, allowing the City of New London, CT, to transfer the \nprivate property from long-time homeowners to a private developer for \nwhat the city considered a greater ``public purpose,'' instead of \npublic use to increase the city's tax base.\n  Again, I believe this is a troubling interpretation of the \nConstitution, and the Kelo decision suggests the danger of allowing \ninternational or foreign good ideas to impact interpretation of U.S. \nconstitutional questions.\n  I further fear that she may be less restrained by the text of the \nConstitution and more inclined to embrace judicial activism. Throughout \nher hearing, Judge Sotomayor insisted her judicial philosophy was, \n``fidelity to the rule of law,'' and that judges are required to defer \nto the policy choices made by Congress. Unfortunately, she declined to \nexplain how she would apply that principle in practical terms.\n  When asked how her commitment to the ``rule of law'' would guide her \njudgment on whether the Second Amendment protected a fundamental \nconstitutional right against encroachments from States and local \ngovernments, Judge Sotomayor declined to answer other than to vaguely \ncommit to look at the Supreme Court's prior decisions. And when asked \nwhether she views the Constitution as a ``living, breathing, evolving \ndocument,'' Judge Sotomayor professed that the Constitution ``is \nimmutable'' and ``has not changed except by amendment.''\n  Yet, once again, her own responses to Senators' questions adopt a \nstrikingly different tone. When asked to distinguish between judicial \ndecisions that apply a broadly-written statute to specific \ncircumstances based on a judge's view of ``common sense'' and a \nlegislative act that endorses and codifies a court's decisions, Judge \nSotomayor argued that a court's action--with precisely the same \npractical effect as the action of the legislature--does not amount to \n``making law'' solely because it is a judicial act.\n  If, as her written answers argue, Judge Sotomayor believes judges \ncannot make law solely because they are judges, her repeated disavowals \nof judicial law-making while sitting before TV cameras are essentially \nmeaningless.\n  In conclusion, when thinking back on the phrasing engraved in marble \nabove the entrance to the U.S. Supreme Court, ``Equal Justice Under \nLaw,'' Judge Sotomayor's record and testimony provide uncertainty and \ndoubt that she will rule with a fair and impartial adherence to the \nrule of law. Therefore, I respectfully oppose her nomination because \nshe has given no assurances that the Second Amendment is an individual, \nfundamental right; she has demonstrated a propensity to rule with \npurpose-driven results; she has indicated a particular interest in \nconsidering international standards or laws to decide U.S. \nconstitutional questions; and her televised testimony contradicted much \nof her public record and professed judicial philosophy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, a decision as to whether to confirm a \nPresident's nominee to the Supreme Court is one of the most significant \ndecisions any of us will make during our Senate careers. The precedents \nthat are established by the U.S. Supreme Court do not merely affect the \nlitigants but the entire fabric of American society, often for \ncenturies.\n  Justices of the Supreme Court enjoy life tenure. They are not \naccountable to the President who appointed them or to the Senators who \nvoted to confirm them. They are not directly accountable to the \nAmerican people. Yet it is undeniable today, as it has been since the \nfounding of our Republic, that the Supreme Court is relied upon as the \nlast line of defense against the loss of our liberties.\n  It is critical that the American people have the highest confidence \nin the Supreme Court and its objectivity. In a Democratic society, the \ncredibility of any institution relies on the consent of the governed. \nThose who seek nomination to the Supreme Court must be ever vigilant in \ntheir words and in their deeds that they do nothing to undermine that \ncredibility.\n  Mr. President, after lengthy, lengthy introspection, I rise this \nevening to inform my colleagues that I am unable to support the \nnomination of Judge Sotomayor to serve on the Supreme Court. This is a \ndifficult result for me because I like Judge Sotomayor on a personal \nlevel. I visited with the judge for nearly an hour when she came \nthrough to meet with Senators. She is absolutely an engaging \nindividual, and I left thoroughly impressed with her intellect and \ncertainly with her resolve. She was open to my invitation to visit \nAlaska, and that invitation still stands.\n  The nomination of Judge Sotomayor, who would be the first woman of \nPuerto Rican descent to serve on the Supreme Court, is indeed a \nhistoric one. Many were disappointed that President Bush did not \nnominate a woman to fill Justice Sandra Day O'Connor's seat on the \nSupreme Court. Justice O'Connor herself underscored the importance of \nplacing women on the bench and in other high governmental positions in \nan interview with the National Law Journal that was published on May \n26, 2009. So I am pleased that President Obama has nominated a woman to \nsucceed Justice Souter.\n  Judge Sotomayor's education and experience certainly qualify her for \nthe position for which she was nominated--experience as a prosecutor \nand in the private practice of law, 17 years service on the Federal \ntrial and appellate bench, a gifted and inspiring law professor.\n  Judge Sotomayor's rise from the South Bronx to Princeton and Yale Law \nSchool is truly an American success story. Her excellence in practice \nas a prosecutor and private practice attorney is also an American \nsuccess story. Her rise through the ranks of the Federal Court system \nis an American success story. And here in America, we celebrate success \nstories such as Judge Sotomayor's.\n  But as much as I like Judge Sotomayor and am impressed with the \nobstacles she has clearly overcome, there are aspects of Judge \nSotomayor's record that make me uncomfortable. I have heard from about \n1,400 Alaskans\n\n[[Page S8841]]\n\nwho are troubled by what they know of Judge Sotomayor as well, and this \ndiscomfort arises from Judge Sotomayor's speeches as well as her \ndecisions in key cases involving the second amendment and property \nrights.\n  Alaskans, by their nature, are independent thinkers, and this \nnomination has rightly engaged their attention. So let's begin with the \nspeeches.\n  In the National Law Journal interview I referred to a moment ago, \nJustice O'Connor reasserted her viewpoint that ``a wise old woman and a \nwise old man, at the end of the day, can reach the same conclusion.'' I \nagree with that conclusion. But this is a viewpoint that Judge \nSotomayor has challenged in one form or another on some eight different \noccasions.\n  During the confirmation hearings I was looking for a simple, \nstraightforward statement that Judge Sotomayor had come to appreciate \nthat perhaps her remarks were ill-conceived; that she would not use \nthose words if she were delivering those speeches today. During the \nconfirmation hearings Judge Sotomayor used many words to justify and to \nexplain her statements. She argued vigorously that she was \nmisunderstood. But I am still not clear she understands the impact the \nplain meaning of her words had upon the American people or the impact \nthey potentially could have on the credibility of the Court.\n  Many of my constituents in the State of Alaska are not impressed with \nthis talk. Alaskans champion diversity. In the Anchorage school \ndistrict where my children attended elementary and middle school, more \nthan 90 different languages are spoken. About 20 percent of Alaskans \nare of Alaska Native ancestry. Yet we reject the notion that coming \nfrom a particular background makes you wiser than one who has a \ndifferent background. Alaskans judge each person as an individual.\n  Alaskans respect those who respect our lifestyle and our values--\nhunting and fishing and sustaining one's self from the land, \nresponsible development of our natural resources, and a government that \nrestrains itself from intruding on the lawful choices of American \ncitizens.\n  About 63 percent of our State is owned by the Federal Government. \nAlaska is constantly in Federal court defending attacks to our ability \nto access Alaska's lands and develop our economy, and often these \nissues end up before the Supreme Court. Many Alaskans were disappointed \nrecently with the outcome of the Exxon Valdez punitive damages case. \nThis may explain why so many Alaskans are so attuned to the objectivity \nof those nominated to serve on our Supreme Court.\n  We are initially suspicious of those who are educated at Ivy League \nschools and spend their entire careers in the Boston-Washington \ncorridor. Alaskans wonder whether those with this background truly \nunderstand the slice of the American experience that we live in the \n49th State, and with good reason.\n  I would not expect that Judge Sotomayor would devalue her own \nexperiences. But neither should she have suggested that the experiences \nof others would lead them to decisions of lesser wisdom. One's diverse \nbackground does not and should not diminish the value of another's \nexperiences.\n  All of this leads me to question whether Judge Sotomayor will \nconsider the pleas of those with experiences different from her own \nwith the objectivity that is demanded of a Supreme Court Justice. My \nconstituents are also troubled by the speech in which Judge Sotomayor \nexpresses her notion that the appellate courts are where policy is \nmade. Judge Sotomayor has subsequently explained that the point she was \ntrying to make is that the courts of appeal establish precedent and the \ndistrict courts do not. But there is a difference between policy and \nprecedent, and my constituents don't believe Judge Sotomayor would have \nused the words ``make policy'' to mean ``establish precedent.''\n  They believe that she really did mean ``make policy.'' Alaskans get \nnervous when courts make policy decisions. Particularly those policy \ndecisions that infringe upon our constitutional rights, as Alaskans \nunderstand them.\n  And no constitutional issue concerns my constituents in Alaska more \nthan the second amendment. They question whether Judge Sotomayor's \nexperiences enable her to fully understand why people in the West fear \nthe creep of government regulation on their second amendment right to \nbear arms. Judge Sotomayor has dealt with second amendment issues on \ntwo occasions. Neither inspires confidence.\n  Let me focus on the 2009 Maloney decision. Maloney presented the \nquestion whether the second amendment protects citizens from State \ninterference with their right to keep and bear arms. It was heard by a \nthree judge panel in the Second Circuit. Judge Sotomayor served on that \npanel. Maloney was one of the first cases to construe the second \namendment following the Supreme Court's landmark 2008 decision in \nHeller.\n  Judge Sotomayor's panel held that the second amendment did not \nprotect citizens from state interference. It reasoned that it was \nconstrained by the U.S. Supreme Court's 1866 decision in Presser v. \nIllinois.\n  But as the Supreme Court explained in Heller, the Presser case said \nnothing about the second amendment's meaning or scope, beyond the fact \nthat it does not prevent the prohibition of private paramilitary \norganizations.\n  Maloney had nothing to do with private paramilitary organizations. \nThe sole question in Maloney was whether the State of New York could \nban the possession of a particular kind of weapon.\n  A three judge panel in the Ninth Circuit, a circuit which is often \nregarded as one of the more ``liberal'' circuits, reached quite the \nopposite conclusion from Judge Sotomayor's panel. The case was Nordyke \nv. King.\n  It concluded that Heller left little doubt that the second amendment \nis a fundamental right. Accordingly the second amendment is \nincorporated into the 14th amendment and applies with equal vigor to \nthe States. To the Ninth Circuit panel this was not a question of \nideology or judicial activism. It was the undeniable outcome of \nHeller's reasoning.\n  But if Judge Sotomayor and her colleagues really believed that courts \nof appeals must await additional guidance from the Supreme Court before \ndetermining whether the second amendment constrains State action they \ncould have stopped there. Instead, the Sotomayor panel went on to \nconclude that the rights secured under the second amendment are not \nfundamental rights. It was not necessary to reach any conclusion on \nthis issue because the panel had already decided that the second \namendment doesn't apply to the States. So why did Judge Sotomayor's \npanel go out of its way to make this point?\n  I am also disappointed that Judge Sotomayor did not write a separate \nopinion in Maloney. On a question as significant as whether the second \namendment is a fundamental right, I would have expected that Judge \nSotomayor would have written a thoughtful and scholarly opinion. \nInstead she signed on to an analysis of the second amendment that is \nwidely regarded as superficial.\n  Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Judge Sotomayor failed \nto write a substantial opinion on a significant constitutional issue. \nSome of my colleagues have discussed their concerns with Judge \nSotomayor's handling of the New Haven firefighters' case.\n  I would like to take a moment to discuss the Didden case which \ninvolves property rights and constitutional limits on the scope of \neminent domain.\n  The reasoning of Didden is particularly perplexing. The panel on \nwhich Judge Sotomayor sat concluded that Didden's constitutional \nchallenge to the taking of his property was time barred. If a suit is \ntime barred there is no reason for judges to reach the merits of the \ncase.\n  Yet for reasons I cannot fathom, Judge Sotomayor's panel went on to \ndo just that. They performed a superficial analysis of whether the \ntaking of a piece of private property by a municipality for a drugstore \nis a constitutionally permissible public purpose. The Supreme Court \ninvited lower courts to scrutinize a claim of public purpose to \ndetermine whether it is pretextual. Judge Sotomayor's panel never \nanalyzed this question.\n  They simply concluded that Didden's constitutional rights were not \nviolated. This analysis was dicta. Not necessary to the outcome of the \ncase. But it is a most troubling piece of dicta because it\n\n[[Page S8842]]\n\nundermines the constitutional protection for private property. It could \nbe used to limit the rights of litigants in other cases.\n  My professional training is no different than that of the other \nlawyers in this body. In law school you spend 3 years reading appellate \ndecisions day in and day out. Hundreds of appellate decisions--over a \n3-year period. We are taught that the measure of a judge is in the \nquality of her analysis.\n  The strength of a judge's reasoning is as important, if not more \nimportant, than who wins and who loses. It is important because that \nreasoning is part and parcel of the precedent that is used in deciding \nfuture cases.\n  In three separate cases of significant constitutional import, Judge \nSotomayor's panel failed to provide the rigorous analysis we commonly \nexpect of future Supreme Court Justices. That troubles me deeply.\n  I appreciate that the decision of who to nominate to the Supreme \nCourt belongs to the President. However, if advice and consent is to be \nmeaningful the Senate cannot be a mere rubberstamp on the President's \ndecision.\n  My decision to oppose Judge Sotomayor's nomination is not based upon \npartisanship, ideology or the recommendations of any outside interest \ngroup. It is the product of reservations I have about the positions \nthat Judge Sotomayor has taken in speeches on multiple occasions over a \nperiod of years. It is based on the brief and superficial treatment she \nhas given to important constitutional questions. Equally troubling is \nthe fact that about 1,400 Alaskans have arrived at the same conclusion.\n  This is not the conclusion I would have preferred to announce but it \nis one that is compelled by Judge Sotomayor's record.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we had a number of Members discuss the \nsecond amendment issue that was dealt with by Judge Sotomayor in two \ndifferent cases. It is an important question and I think her nomination \nraises very serious concerns about it. I would like to try as fairly as \nI can to analyze the circumstances in her dealing with these issues and \nwhy I think it is a problem that Senators rightly have objections to.\n  The second amendment is in the Constitution. It is the second of the \nfirst 10 amendments. It is part of the Bill of Rights. If you remember, \nthe people were not so happy with the Constitution. They wanted to have \na guarantee of individual rights that they as American citizens would \npossess no matter what the Federal Government or anyone else wanted to \ndo about it. So they passed the right not to establish a religion, free \nspeech, free press, the right to jury trial and other matters of that \nkind in the first 10 amendments, as adopted.\n  The second amendment was one of those, of course. It says:\n\n       A well regulated militia being essential to the security of \n     a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms \n     shall not be infringed.\n\n  The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\n  Over the years, laws have been passed that caused difficulties and \nthat began to overreach with respect to the second amendment right. The \nAmerican people have gotten their back up, as the Senator from Alaska \ntold us, Senator Murkowski. People in Alaska, people in Alabama, people \nall over America are concerned about this. It is a constitutional \nright. It has been there since the founding of the Republic.\n  I think most scholars have believed for some time that it is, in \nfact, an individual right, that the first clause regarding the well-\nregulated militia did not undermine the final declaratory clause which \nsaid:\n\n       The right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be \n     infringed.\n\n  But no Supreme Court case had ruled on that squarely until last year \nwhen the Supreme Court took up the Heller case, which was in the \nFederal city we are in today, DC. The Supreme Court in the Heller case \nsaid it was an individual right and it prohibited the city of \nWashington, DC, from effectively barring any citizen in the District \nfrom having a gun.\n  It was an exceedingly broad ban on guns. But I would note something \nthat ought to be remembered: It was a 5-to-4 decision--four members of \nthe Supreme Court did not agree. Some people do not agree.\n  One of our Democratic colleagues yesterday said of the result in \nHeller, that it was ``a newly minted and narrowly enacted \nconstitutional right.''\n  That is cause for concern. The Constitution, I don't think, is newly \nminted. I don't think the Court created a right. I think the Court \nsimply declared a right that was plainly in the Constitution. So this \nis part of our concern.\n  I would suggest that it is a fragile right, however, based on the way \nsome of the courts have been ruling and based on how Judge Sotomayor \nruled.\n  Somebody had raised the point several times that it is somehow not \nright that the National Rifle Association here, at the end, after the \nhearings, declared that they think that Judge Sotomayor should not be \nconfirmed. Certainly they were reluctant to be engaged in this debate. \nBut for the reasons I would note--and Senator Murkowski and others have \nnoted--I don't think they had much choice, because it is a critical \nthing we are dealing with here, the next appointment to the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  In a year after the Heller case was decided that the right to keep \nand bear arms is a personal or individual right and it cannot be \nabridged by the Federal Government, the case came before her as to \nwhether the second amendment applied to States and cities.\n  What if other cities were to declare that you couldn't have a gun in \nthe city, or a State were to declare you couldn't have a firearm, or if \na State were to place massive restrictions on the use of personal \nweapons? She took that case, the first major case after Heller to deal \nwith this issue. Anyone who is familiar with the appellate courts in \nAmerica, as this judge would be, would know this was a big, big, big \ncase, a case of great importance coming on the heels of the widely \ndiscussed Heller decision. In it, she rendered an exceedingly short \nopinion. In it, she found it was ``settled law'' that the second \namendment does not apply to individual Americans in States or cities. \nThe city or State could completely bar them from having any kind of \ngun.\n  In the Heller case, to be fair with her, this is what the \ncircumstances were. There was an old 1800s case that basically held \nthis way. It basically held that the second amendment did not apply to \nthe States. I think the judge could rightly conclude that she may have \nbeen bound by that case. However, in the Supreme Court decision, they \nput a footnote in it and said: we are not deciding the question of \nwhether the second amendment applies to the States because we are \ndeciding a case in the District of Columbia, and the law in the \nDistrict of Columbia is not city law. The law in the District of \nColumbia is U.S. Government law. They put a footnote and indicated that \nthe incorporation doctrine was out there, but that they would review \nthat in the future.\n  My first point is this: I don't believe it would be appropriate to \nsay it is settled law that the second amendment does not apply to the \nStates after the Heller case. That troubled me that she said that.\n  Judge Sotomayor made a decision in the Maloney case, the first major \ncase after Heller. It was only eight paragraphs in a case that everyone \nknew was of great importance. And only one paragraph dealt with the \nquestion of whether the second amendment would apply to the States. \nThose who have supported Judge Sotomayor have correctly noted that the \nseventh circuit heard the same kind of case some months later and they \nagreed with the Maloney case and Judge Sotomayor. They spent, however, \na number of pages on it. They spent 2\\1/2\\ pages on the question of \nwhether it was incorporated against the States. But they concluded that \neven with the footnote in the Heller case, they concluded that the more \nclear authority was still this old case that is out there in the 1800s.\n\n[[Page S8843]]\n\nThey did not say, however, that it was settled law.\n  The ninth circuit took up the very same case just a few months after \nJudge Sotomayor's Maloney decision. In a 19-page opinion that discussed \nin great depth the important constitutional issues, the panel said, \nwhen you read the Heller decision, when you consider the footnote of \nthe Supreme Court's opinion where they said they didn't explicitly \ndecide whether it applied to the States, they found differently. They \nfound the second amendment does apply to the States and cities, and the \nStates and cities must comply with it, and they can't ban all guns. \nThey found not only that it was not settled law. To the contrary, they \nfound that the footnote in the Supreme Court opinion ``explicitly left \nopen this question.'' And because they found the question was left open \nby the Supreme Court, they felt they were authorized to consider the \nconstitutional laws and questions that are important and render a \ndecision that they thought was the right constitutional decision. That \nis why they went forward in that fashion.\n  At the hearing, the judge was asked a number of questions about this. \nI didn't find those questions answered very persuasive, frankly. In \nsome instances, I found them confusing. There was no retreat that I \nheard from this untenable position. In answering questions from Senator \nHatch, the judge said that:\n\n       The Supreme Court didn't consider [the second amendment] \n     fundamental [in the Heller case] so as to be incorporated \n     against the state. . . . Well, it not only didn't decide it, \n     but I understood Justice Scalia to be recognizing that the \n     [C]ourt's precedent held that it was not fundamental.\n\n  In the course of her decision she also found a critical question, \nthat the second amendment is not a fundamental question. The judge was \njust wrong on that in a big, big case. It is the kind of thing you \nshouldn't make a mistake on. In the majority's footnote on this issue, \nthe Court expressly reserved the question of whether the second \namendment applies to the States. The footnote said this:\n\n       With respect to Cruikshank's\n\n     one of the old cases\n\n       --continuing validity on incorporation, a question not \n     presented in this case . . .\n\n  So they explicitly said that they didn't were addressing this issue. \nBut it is pretty clear that the doctrine that allows the Bill of \nRights, the first 10 amendments, to apply to the States. That doctrine \nhas developed dramatically in the 20th century, over the last 100 \nyears. Virtually every one of the 10 amendments has been incorporated \nagainst the States. But the Second Amendment has not yet been applied \nto the States. To me, that is an odd thing in light of the doctrine of \nthe incorporating of the first 10 amendments as protections for \nindividual Americans against both the Federal Government and State and \nlocal governments. That doctrine has developed great strength and power \nover the last 100 years. Few people would want to go back. I think most \npeople would be awfully surprised to learn that the second amendment \nwould not be one of those applied to the States. It certainly, in my \nopinion, is not settled law.\n  This case was dealt with in a most cursory manner. It dealt with a \nmatter of huge national importance. It is the kind of case that legal \nscholars watch closely. It was an exceedingly short opinion, a few \nparagraphs. It showed little respect for the seriousness of the issue. \nIt didn't discuss it in any depth. It incorrectly stated it was settled \nlaw that the second amendment would not apply to the States. These are \nthe problems we have with it.\n  Judge Sotomayor now seeks to be on the Supreme Court. And with regard \nto the 5-to-4 decision in Heller and to the question of whether she \nshould recuse herself, as asked by Senator Kyl, she indicated that if \nher case came up, she would recuse herself. It could come before the \nSupreme Court. It is that important. But if one of the other cases \nraising exactly the same issue came up, she refused to say she would \nrecuse herself. Of course, if her case comes up, it is a matter of \nethics that she would have to recuse herself. I thought that since \nhaving already clearly decided precisely the same issue the Supreme \nCourt would have to deal with, she ought to have indicated to us that \nsince she expressed her opinion on it, she wouldn't sit on the case. \nBut that did not happen.\n  I will share likewise another concern we have about the firefighters \ncase and how that was handled in such a short manner. The firefighters \ncontended that they had studied hard. They had passed a promotion exam. \nThey were on the road to being promoted. The city, because of political \ncomplaints about the fact that certain groups did not pass the test in \na way that raised concerns, decided they would give up and not have the \ntest and wipe out the test and not follow through with the test. The \nfirefighters felt they had done everything possible, and they \nchallenged that. Indeed, later the Supreme Court held that no evidence \nwas ever presented that the test was not a fair and good test. Indeed, \nthey had taken great care to get good people to help write the test in \na way that would be neutral and fair to all groups of people and would \nnot have any kind of unfair advantage.\n  When that case came before the judge, I was very disappointed that \nshe and her panel treated it as a summary order. A summary order is \nreserved for cases that present no real legal question. Summary orders \nare not even circulated among the other judges in the circuit. Here, it \nwas a summary order that did not even adopt the opinion of the lower \ncourts that had ruled in this fashion. It just summarily dismissed the \nfirefighters' claim and rendered judgment in favor of the city which \nhad altered the plan for promotion. It was basically done because of \ntheir race.\n  The equal protection clause of the Constitution says that all \nAmerican citizens are entitled to equal protection of the laws, \nregardless of race. That is what their complaint was, one of the \ncomplaints. I would note that this was not even an opinion. It was \nbasically a line or two summarily dismissing this.\n  Then one of the other judges on the court apparently found out this \nopinion had been rendered in a case that struck him, apparently, as a \nmatter of real importance, a case that ought not to be disposed of by a \nsummary order, that the firefighters were at least entitled to an \nopinion. And by the way, they never got a trial. Basically it was \ndismissed prior to trial on motions. So after great debate within the \ncircuit, a little bit of a dust-up within the circuit, by a 7-to-6 \nmargin, Judge Sotomayor casting the decisive seventh vote, they decided \nnot to rehear the case and any precedent that may exist in the circuit. \nBut at that point, I guess as part of the process of confrontation that \narose there, the panel issued an opinion that adopted the lower court \nopinion, a procuring opinion. They didn't write their own opinion but \nbasically adopted the lower court's opinion.\n  It was from that decision, as a result of by chance another judge \nheard about it, not through the normal processes but, according to \nStuart Taylor's article, from seeing it on television, that the case \ngot some attention. And the Supreme Court agreed to hear it and \nreversed the case and rendered a judgment in favor of the firefighters. \nI think that was not responsible. That was a huge case of major \nconstitutional import. It should have been written in detail. Any \nperson, any judge should have done that, particularly one who would be \nconsidered for the Supreme Court.\n  So I will say those two opinions to me are troubling in that I think \nthey were wrong, No. 1. And No. 2, they were exceedingly short, too \nshort, when you consider the seriousness of those issues.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the nomination of \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor to serve as an Associate Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court. Judge Sotomayor has a long career as a jurist with many \ncases for Senators to review and determine how she may address cases \nbrought before the Supreme Court. Judge Sotomayor is clearly an \naccomplished attorney and intelligent person who overcame many \nobstacles and came from a humble beginning to rise to this nomination. \nHowever, in that long record I have found a tendency to at times place \nmore emphasis on personal experience than the most fundamental parts of \nour Constitution.\n  I must oppose Judge Sotomayor's nomination.\n\n[[Page S8844]]\n\n  I am concerned about Judge Sotomayor's past rulings and statements \nduring the Senate Judiciary Committee hearings about the second \namendment as a fundamental right. The Supreme Court's ruling in 2008 in \nthe Heller case confirmed that the second amendment's right to keep and \nbear arms includes the right of American citizens to have weapons for \npersonal self-defense. The Supreme Court has not yet reviewed an \nincorporation case involving the second amendment, but its second \namendment opinion last year noted that a due process analysis is now \nrequired. Earlier this year, when Judge Sotomayor and the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals ruled on Maloney v. Cuomo determining that the \nsecond amendment is not a fundamental right, they relied on rulings \nfrom the 1800s rather than following the 2008 Supreme Court ruling.\n  The second amendment of our Constitution guarantees the fundamental \nright of an individual to keep and bear arms. This is clear to me and a \nclear legal precedent set by the Supreme Court.\n  As a father and grandfather, who strongly believes in the rights of \nthe unborn, I am also troubled by Judge Sotomayor's past affiliation \nand leadership of an organization, the Puerto Rican Defense and \nEducation Fund, which has taken positions on abortion that I find \nunsettling. Judge Sotomayor's case record does not include direct \nrulings on abortion issues, so we must look at her history with this \norganization. The fund, while Judge Sotomayor served in a leadership \ncapacity, filed briefs with the Supreme Court not only supporting \nabortion rights but in support of Federal funds for abortion services. \nI could not disagree more with these positions, and I cannot help but \nwonder how Judge Sotomayor would use her experiences with the fund to \nrule on a possible case before the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, she \nwould not provide a satisfactory answer or position when my colleague \nfrom Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, asked her direct questions during the \nJudiciary Committee process.\n  The issue of international law is another area of concern. Judge \nSotomayor has stated that ideas have no boundaries, but we must \nremember that nations do have boundaries as well as laws that govern \nactions within those boundaries. The U.S. Constitution is the highest \nlaw of our land and the basis of our Nation's sovereignty. It may be \ngood and well for academics to discuss international laws, or even \ndomestic laws of other countries, as they compare to the United States, \nbut when making a ruling, a member of the U.S. judicial branch must \nrely on the laws of this Nation.\n  Finally, I would like to address the issue of judicial impartiality. \nJudge Sotomayor's statements about her ability to judge cases better \nthan others based on her background are certainly troublesome. These \nstatements have been vetted in the Judiciary Committee and certainly \nthrough the media. The statements warrant further discussion, however. \nAs public figures, I, and the rest of my colleagues, may be faced with \nsituations where a comment can be taken out of context. A comment that \nis repeatedly used in prepared remarks, however, should be interpreted \nas showing the true thoughts and beliefs of the speaker.\n  I believe the United States is a great nation because of the \nfoundation of our government, one element of which is an independent \njudicial branch where we believe that justice is blind. This is a \ncritical element of our system and a part of the judicial oath. I can \nagree that our personal backgrounds lead us to look at situations \ndifferently, but I cannot agree that judges should allow their \nbackgrounds to determine a case. Judicial decisions must be based on \nfacts. When the facts or the Constitution comes into conflict with \nJudge Sotomayor's feelings and past experiences, I am not confident \nwhich side she will ultimately take.\n  I voted against Judge Sotomayor's nomination in 1998 to the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals. At that time, I shared the concern of many of \nmy colleagues about Judge Sotomayor's positions and her view of the \nrole of the Judiciary. While I hold Judge Sotomayor in the highest \nrespect, I believe my concerns then are borne out by her record now. I \nhave no reason to believe anything will change in the future.\n  I understand that Judge Sotomayor has support from many of my \ncolleagues, and I hope they will listen to the concerns I and others \nare raising. I hope they will take the time to fully consider the \nimpact of Judge Sotomayor's positions on future decisions of the \nSupreme Court as the Court's decisions will affect our entire Nation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise tonight, as so many have, in the \nlast several days, especially to speak about the nomination of Judge \nSonia Sotomayor to be on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  As we all know, she is a distinguished Federal jurist who has been \nnominated to serve as an Associate Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court--a \ncritically important decision that the Senate is charged with making to \nadvise and consent on such nominations.\n  Sonia Sotomayor's life story is an authentically American story. It \nis a story with which so many people in this capital and across the \ncountry can identify. It is a story of hard work and sacrifice. It is a \nstory of struggle and triumph, overcoming barriers in her life that, \ncandidly, many in this Chamber have not had to overcome.\n  It is a story, like so many authentically and compelling American \nstories, that starts with her family and, in particular, her parents, \nnot people of tremendous means or wealth. Her mother was a nurse, her \ndad was a factory worker, and she, unfortunately, lost him at a very \nyoung age. I think she was just 9 years old when her father died--a \nvery difficult circumstance for anyone to overcome, especially a young \ngirl.\n  When we look at her record as a student, it is also a great American \nstory of academic excellence, and I believe that is an understatement. \nHer record as a student through high school and then going on to \nPrinceton and graduating with honors and going to Yale Law School and \nserving on the Law Review and being such a leader and a student in both \ncollege and law school--not only being a leader but also achieving \nacademic excellence--is a record we would hope every member of the U.S. \nSupreme Court could bring to their nomination debate.\n  I was reflecting the last couple of days about my remarks tonight, \nand I remembered that when our President, President Obama, was \ncampaigning, I had the chance to introduce him a number of times. One \nof the times I introduced him, I was trying to convey the reality of \nwhat he had overcome, and it is very difficult to put that in a few \nwords. But I said at the time, in one particular place in northeastern \nPennsylvania, that then-Senator Obama did not have a path cleared for \nhim, that he had to overcome barriers and obstacles in his life growing \nup, as a public official, and all the way to the Presidency.\n  The same can be said of Judge Sotomayor. She had not, in her life--\nand has not to this day--ever had a path cleared for her. She has had \nto work and struggle and achieve to get where she is today, to the \npoint of being on the verge of being confirmed to serve on the Supreme \nCourt.\n  So I think it is very important to point out her life story, her \nremarkable life story, her achievements, but also to speak, as we must, \nand as we should, of her judicial expedience.\n  We hear all kinds of comparisons, when someone is nominated to the \nSupreme Court, about how many years they have served as a judge, how \nmany years they have served as a lawyer or as an advocate or as a \npublic official--whatever their background is. But it just so happens \nthis particular nominee, Judge Sotomayor, has more judicial experience, \nI am told, than anyone currently sitting on the U.S. Supreme Court--all \ndistinguished in their own way. But if you add up the years, I guess it \nis 17--first on the district court, the trial court in New York, for \nthe Southern District of New York--nominated and confirmed by the \nSenate--and the same when she was confirmed and served as a judge on \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit at the appellate \nlevel. In both of those appointments, she gained enormous experience on \nthe very matters that will come before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  First, she was on the district court where you have litigants coming \nbefore\n\n[[Page S8845]]\n\nyou, for example, in a trial or in a hearing--sometimes a criminal \nmatter that involves someone's liberty, involves law enforcement \nissues, and all the complexities of our human condition in the context \nof a criminal case. Also coming before that court are very complex \ncivil matters, and I know the record is replete with references to her \nrulings in various cases involving civil, criminal, and other matters.\n  Then she went to the appeals court, working in a different court, \nwith a different set of issues and, candidly, a different procedure, \nwhere someone is appealing to the Federal appeals court, in this case, \nin the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit--all the \ncomplexities that involves, where you are not taking testimony as you \ndo in a trial, not making determinations of fact, you are deciding the \nlaw, what the law should be, how to apply the law to the facts in the \nrecord, which is already established.\n  Both are very different judicial responsibilities, but both are very \nimportant to serve on the ultimate appellate court, the top court in \nthe land, that being the Supreme Court.\n  So she has had broad and unprecedented experience as a Federal judge \nfor 17 years. That is very important in this debate.\n  She also served as a prosecutor dealing with all of the complexities \nand all of the difficulties that any prosecutor encounters, dealing \nwith victims and the impact of a crime on a victim and his or her \nfamily, dealing with the impact of crime on a community and in a \njurisdiction, dealing with judges and witnesses and law enforcement \nwith whom often you work so closely--the prosecutor--to develop your \ncase, to marshal the evidence that a prosecutor has to put before a \njudge and jury.\n  That experience is particularly relevant because a number of the \ncases the Supreme Court will hear--and they do not hear every case; \nthey take a number of cases per year--some of those cases will involve \nthe rights of one party versus the other, will involve the rights of a \ncriminal defendant versus the State. There are very complex matters \nthat a Supreme Court Justice has to decide.\n  So whether you look at her experience as a prosecutor, as a Federal \ndistrict court judge, a trial judge, or her experience on the appellate \ncourt--hearing appeals at the Federal level--all are very relevant to \nand I think prepare her well for her service on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Two more sets of experiences--one as a lawyer. I think it helps when \nyou have been an advocate, a lawyer, to have that as part of your \nexperience serving on the Supreme Court, where you have had to take on \na battle for a client, to be their advocate, sometimes in very \ncomplicated matters, sometimes matters that will affect their lives in \nways that will alter the course their life is taking when they have a \nmatter before a court.\n  Finally, her life experience. I would hope we nominate people to the \nSupreme Court who have a broad life experience, who have not just been \nin one area of a profession, but also have had challenges in their \nlives they have had to overcome because the people who come before the \nSupreme Court may be a little bit distant, but often arrive there after \nmonths or years or longer of struggle.\n  I think Judge Sotomayor has a life story that indicates she not only \nunderstands struggle and understands how difficult life can be, but \nalso has an appreciation for the complexities of life as well. She has \nbeen described, as a judge and as a prosecutor, as both tough and \nfair--tough and fair. That is a good description that you would want, \nwhen you are evaluating the role and the record of a Supreme Court \nJustice--someone who asks difficult questions and probing questions as \na member of the Court, but also someone who is fair, who does not seek \nto gain an advantage over a lawyer in the course of an argument but is \nboth tough and fair.\n  I believe integrity is a central consideration that Senators should \nweigh when we are deciding who serves on the Supreme Court after a \nPresident nominates. We want someone with broad life experiences. We \nwant someone with experience in the law and often as a judge. But we \nalso want someone who has character.\n  I got a sense of that when I met with her. I also got a better sense \nby reading the long list, which I will not read tonight, of all the \norganizations that have endorsed her. They did not just endorse a set \nof cases. They did not just endorse a resume. They endorse and give \ntheir support to a human being, a person who has had tremendous \nexperience. And part of that, of course, is integrity.\n  I think we saw both her integrity and her temperament, which is \nanother very serious consideration. But we saw both of them tested in \nthe course of her hearings, where she was asked a lot of tough \nquestions by members of the Senate Judiciary Committee on both sides of \nthe aisle, Democratic Senators and Republican Senators--hour after hour \nafter hour, day after day, under very difficult circumstances, on live \ntelevision, with all of the pressure that every word, every response is \nweighed and scrutinized and criticized often and examined. I think both \nher integrity and her temperament were on display, and, in my \njudgement, she passed both of those tests in considerations we have to \nweigh, that she passed them so easily and so effectively.\n  I would make two more points. Inscribed over the building that houses \nthe courtroom where the U.S. Supreme Court meets--that historic room \nwhere so many great cases have been decided--inscribed over the \nbuilding, above it, is the phrase we all know well: ``Equal Justice \nUnder Law.'' ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' That is what we expect \ncertainly of every judge, even lawyers, but especially someone who \nbecomes a U.S. Supreme Court Justice; that they would have that \nphilosophy in every case, but also the reality that precept entails, \nthat they would approach every case, every litigant, every party with \nthe same approach, dispensing equal justice under the law--not equal \njustice under my law or equal justice under a philosophy of, in this \ncase, Judge Sotomayor as a Supreme Court Justice, not her definition of \nwhat the law is, but what the law is, in fact, that she is required to \napply.\n  That equal justice under law is not just something inscribed above \nthat building. I believe, based upon her record, based upon her \nexperience, and based upon her character, she believes that and will be \ngoverned by that as a member of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I conclude with this thought. When President Lincoln was speaking at \nGettysburg, PA--a place we all learned about as children and learned \nabout the Gettysburg Address and the meaning of it and the enduring \nvalue of that speech--in one of the lines Lincoln used in that speech, \nhe was talking about the Nation being tested at a time of war, and, \nunfortunately, at that time, a time of civil war, the worst of all \nwars. He was posing the question about this Nation that had been \nconceived not too long before he gave that speech. He said that one of \nthe questions he posed was whether a nation so conceived can ``long \nendure,'' whether our Nation could long endure, that we were being \ntested at a time of war.\n\n  I believe our Nation has been tested at other times as well, not only \nin something as grave as a war, but we are tested in other ways as \nwell. We were tested in the Great Depression, whether we could endure \nthe misery and the difficulty, the joblessness of that, and all of the \nproblems the Depression brought to America. We have been tested in \nother wars. We were tested in the battle for civil rights. We have been \ntested as a nation very often--maybe not every day, maybe not every \nweek, but at some period of time in our lifetimes, we can see how our \nNation was tested. In some ways, we are tested when debates occur in \nthe Senate. We are tested in terms of appointments that a President \nmakes.\n  In this case, President Obama has nominated someone to the U.S. \nSupreme Court who I believe will allow us to be able to say that as \nlong as we are nominating people with the experience, the character, \nand the integrity of Judge Sonia Sotomayor, this Nation will long \nendure. I have no doubt about that. I say that with as much confidence \nas anyone could because her record demonstrates that. Her experience \ndemonstrates that if we have people such as Judge Sotomayor in the U.S. \nSupreme Court, this Nation will not only long endure, it will indeed \nthrive under that kind of judicial excellence and that kind of \nexperience she will bring to the bench. So I have\n\n[[Page S8846]]\n\nno hesitation at all in saying that I will vote for her confirmation to \nbe an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. We can be proud of her \nrecord and her experience but also her remarkable and authentically \nAmerican story.\n  Before I conclude my remarks, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record a letter of endorsement for Judge Sotomayor that the \nJudiciary Committee received on July 15 from the National Hispanic \nChristian Leadership Conference, serving approximately 16 million \nHispanic American born-again Christians and 25,434 member churches \nacross the country.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions:\n       America's largest Hispanic Christian Organization, The \n     National Hispanic Christian Leadership Conference (NHCLC), \n     serving approximately 16 million Hispanic American Born Again \n     Believers via 25,434 member churches, hereby endorses Judge \n     Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the Supreme Court.\n       We commend President Obama's selection of Sotomayor as a \n     brilliant exercise in pragmatism and moderation. First, as \n     Hispanic Americans, we celebrate her nomination. Her journey \n     is our collective journey. Sotomayor stands as a model to all \n     our Hispanic young people throughout America that faith, \n     family and education can overcome the most difficult of \n     environments and economic circumstances.\n       More importantly, as Americans concerned with judicial \n     activism and defacto legislation from many sectors of our \n     judiciary, Sotomayor reflects, via her career on the bench, \n     the type of tempered restraint and moderation necessary for \n     appropriate application of the rule of law. Without a doubt, \n     Judge Sotomayor serves with a moderate voice without displays \n     of bias towards any party based on affiliation, background, \n     sex, color or religion. Judge Sotomayor's over 700 decisions \n     stand as testimony of a commitment and respect for the rule \n     of law, particularly the importance of stare decisis.\n       As an organization serving America's largest minority group \n     and the fastest growing religious demographic, we seek to \n     reconcile both the vertical and horizontal planes of the \n     Christian message. As we serve both matters of the soul and \n     community, religious liberties stand as an issue of utmost \n     concern for our constituents. Judge Sotomayor's rulings \n     affirm Constitutional safeguards for those liberties.\n       In conclusion, even moderate and conservative evangelicals \n     within our ranks find no reason to conclude that the \n     nomination and confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor would \n     diminish the collective application of Constitutional rights \n     and freedoms to a religious community committed to Life, \n     Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness. For that matter, we \n     encourage the support of this nominee from both sides of the \n     political aisle.\n\n                                                Jesse Miranda,\n\n                                          CEO, NHCLC, President of\n                           Miranda Center for Hispanic Leadership.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, before I discuss the nomination of Judge \nSotomayor, I wish to take a moment to thank all of my colleagues here \nin the Senate for their very warm welcome and hospitality. I joined \nthis body a little less than a month ago, but I have been humbled by \nthis institution, by the work that goes on here, and, most importantly, \nby my colleagues. It is an honor to represent the people of Minnesota, \nand it is a special privilege to do so here in the Senate.\n  One of my first responsibilities on joining the Senate was to \nparticipate in the nomination hearings for Judge Sotomayor. I said at \nthe start of the hearings that I wanted to be a voice for the \noverwhelming majority of Americans who aren't lawyers. The actions of \nthe Supreme Court directly affect the everyday lives of all Americans. \nWhom we choose to place on the Supreme Court affects every one of us. \nThat is what I want to do this evening. I want to put the nomination of \nJudge Sotomayor in context. I want to put it in the context of what the \nSupreme Court has done these past 5 years and how that has affected the \nlives of Minnesotans and of all Americans.\n  Our country is going through some tough times. We are experiencing \nthe highest unemployment in decades. Businesses are failing. Investors \nare seeing their investments shrink, even disappear. Yet, despite all \nof this, despite our faltering economy, in the past 5 years this \nSupreme Court has restricted the rights of Americans as employees, as \nsmall business owners, and as investors, and they have done this by \noverturning longstanding precedents.\n  Let me put this in the context of Minnesota. Ten years ago, Minnesota \nhad an unemployment rate of 2.8 percent. Let me repeat that. Ten years \nago, Minnesota had an unemployment rate of 2.8 percent. Today, it is \n8.4 percent. In certain counties, it hovers between 13 and 14 percent. \nAt the same time, Minnesota has an older workforce. The Twin Cities are \nfourth in the Nation in the percentage of seniors working past the age \nof 65. When businesses are making tough personnel decisions, you can \nbet they are taking a good hard look at older workers who have higher \npension and health care costs.\n  But just last month, the Supreme Court eviscerated the one law \ndesigned to prevent discrimination against older workers: the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act, or ADEA, as it is called. Because of \nthis case, the Gross case, it is not enough for a worker suing for age \ndiscrimination to show he or she was fired improperly because of their \nage. Under this new standard, an older worker must now show that age \nwas the single determinative reason for the firing. This is a \ndifficult, if not practically impossible, standard to meet. This also \nbreaks with the longstanding rule that the ADEA must be interpreted the \nsame as title VII of the Civil Rights Act which protects women and \nminorities against discrimination in the workplace. Because of the \nGross case, Minnesota's older workers have fewer rights in the \nworkplace precisely when they need them the most.\n  This was the same Court that 2 years ago barred a title VII suit by \nLilly Ledbetter, a woman who was paid less than her male colleagues for \nthe same work for two decades. Minnesota women are paid 74 cents for \nevery dollar earned by men. Until Congress fixed this ruling last year \nthrough the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, this was yet another ruling \nthat limited Minnesotans' rights in the workplace.\n  This Supreme Court has put Minnesota's small business owners in a \nsimilar position. Like entrepreneurs around the country, Minnesota \nbusiness owners are struggling. Business bankruptcies in our State \nincreased 40 percent between 2006 and 2008, and it will likely be worse \nin 2009. If there were ever a time small business owners in Minnesota \nneeded a leg up, it is right now. But 2 years ago, this Supreme Court \noverturned one of the strongest protections small business owners have \nunder the Sherman Act, our main antitrust law. For over 100 years, it \nhas been illegal for manufacturers to price-fix--to force retailers to \nsell their goods at a certain price. Today, thanks to this Court's \nruling in the Leegin case, price fixing is now permitted. In fact, the \nburden is now on consumers and small business owners to show, through a \ncomplex economic analysis, that the price fixing hurts them.\n  This Court has been no kinder to investors. Like almost all American \ninvestors, Minnesota investors are reeling from the trillions of \ndollars in losses in the stock market. These losses were partly caused \nby structural deficiencies in our finance system, but they were also \ncaused by speculation and by fraud, by people such as Bernie Madoff and \nTom Petters, a Minnesota financier who is in prison right now charged \nwith a $3.5 billion scheme that bilked stockholders in a number of \nMinnesota companies. Yet, last year, the Supreme Court handed down a \ndecision that severely limited investors' ability to defend themselves \nagainst securities fraud. In the Stoneridge case, the Supreme Court \nsaid that an investor cannot sue an outside accountant or a lawyer who \nworked with a company to fraudulently alter its financial records to \ndeliberately cook its books unless that third party somehow, for some \nreason, publicly announced its involvement.\n  Together, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, title VII of the \nCivil Rights Act, the Sherman Act, and the Securities Exchange Act are \nsome of the strongest protections employees, small business owners, and \ninvestors\n\n[[Page S8847]]\n\nhave under American law. These laws help to level the playing field for \nthe less powerful in our society. Yet, in each of these cases, for each \nof these laws, this Supreme Court has ignored longstanding precedent \nand original congressional intent to limit the rights these laws afford \nprecisely when they are needed the most.\n  The Supreme Court's willingness to ignore longstanding precedent to \nrestrict individual rights is not limited to our economy. This same \nSupreme Court recently overturned a 30-year rule that requires that a \nwoman's health be taken into account in any law regulating her right to \nchoose.\n  The Court is also poised to overturn critical protections to voters. \nThis Supreme Court has questioned the constitutionality of section 5 of \nthe Voting Rights Act, even though the 15th amendment expressly grants \nCongress the power to regulate elections and even though Congress \nrecently voted to reauthorize those provisions for the fourth time by a \nvote of 98 to 0. Talk about judicial activism. This is judicial \nactivism. This is the Supreme Court questioning the constitutionality \nof a law passed by Congress under an explicit and exclusive grant of \npower granted in the Constitution of the United States.\n  If she is confirmed, the first case Justice Sotomayor will hear will \nreconsider the constitutionality of sections of McCain-Feingold that \nthe Supreme Court upheld just 6 years ago. The underlying principle in \nquestion goes back over 100 years to the Tillman Act of 1907. For 100 \nyears, Congress has said with increasing force that corporations should \nnot be spending money on Federal election campaigns. Yet this Court is \npoised to contravene that 100-year-old rule and its own ruling on the \nidentical provision just 6 years ago. Again, I think this is judicial \nactivism. In fact, I think it is judicial activism in one direction: \naway from longstanding protections for the individual and toward a more \nfriendly law for the powerful.\n  As I said last week, I firmly believe that in this context, with this \nSupreme Court, a vote for Judge Sotomayor is a vote against judicial \nactivism. In a careful review of her opinions as an appellate judge, \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Research Service recently concluded that:\n\n       [p]erhaps the most consistent characteristic of Judge \n     Sotomayor's approach as an appellate judge has been an \n     adherence to the doctrine of stare decisis--\n\n  The upholding of past judicial precedents. Of the 230 majority \nopinions Judge Sotomayor wrote as an appellate judge, the Supreme Court \nhas reversed only 3. That is 3 reversals out of 230 majority opinions.\n  But the best examples of Judge Sotomayor's inherent judicial \nrestraint are the two cases for which she has ironically received the \nmost criticism--the Ricci case and Maloney v. Cuomo, the Second \nCircuit's most recent second amendment case. In both of these cases, \nJudge Sotomayor simply followed the Supreme Court's own maxim that it \nis the Court's--the Supreme Court's--prerogative alone to overrule one \nof its precedents. When a three-judge panel in Ricci affirmed the \ndistrict court's decision, it was simply following existing title VII \nlaw. When the three-judge panel in the Maloney case said that the \nsecond amendment does not apply to the States, it was simply following \na 120-year-old Supreme Court precedent that said exactly that. \nMoreover, a three-judge panel on the Seventh Circuit that included two \nof the most prominent negligent conservative judges in the country, \nFrank Easterbrook and Richard Posner, reached the same exact conclusion \nunanimously.\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor is a judge who follows and respects precedent. \nShe is a judge who does not make new law.\n  In fact, it seems that Judge Sotomayor's worst sin in this whole \nprocess is her straightforward observation that our life experiences \nshape who we are and what we do. This is not a new idea. Mr. President, \n175 years ago, on the first page and at the most famous treatise in \nAmerican law, Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote:\n\n       The life of the law has not been logic; it has been \n     experience.\n\n  This isn't just an old idea either. Justices Alito, Scalia, and \nThomas each acknowledged in their own confirmation hearings that their \nown life experiences--being born into an immigrant family, an exposure \nto discrimination, a childhood in poverty--shaped their own approach to \njudging.\n  But Judge Sotomayor went beyond Justices Alito, Scalia, and Thomas by \nalso recognizing that judges must be aware of these prejudices, and \nthey must not allow these prejudices to impact their approach to a \ncase.\n  Since this is a body that values its history, I thought it would be \nappropriate to close by mentioning the last nominee to the Supreme \nCourt with a comparable amount of experience to Judge Sotomayor. That \nperson is Benjamin Cardozo.\n  Judge Cardozo was nominated to the Supreme Court in 1932, after \nspending 18 years on his State's highest court. Like Judge Sotomayor, \nJudge Cardozo was from New York. Like Judge Sotomayor, he had a tough \nchildhood, losing a parent when he was 9 years old. He had a tough \nchildhood like her. Like Judge Sotomayor, Cardozo was from an ethnic \nminority--he was a Sephardic Jew, a descendent of Portuguese \nimmigrants. Like Judge Sotomayor, Cardozo was rightly proud of his \nheritage. Like Judge Sotomayor, Cardozo was the most experienced \nnominee to the Supreme Court in his generation.\n  Yet, unlike Judge Sotomayor, Judge Cardozo did not attract so much \ncontroversy. In fact, he was unanimously confirmed to the Supreme Court \nin a voice vote that lasted all of 10 seconds.\n  Judge Sotomayor is one of the leading jurists of our Nation. If \nconfirmed, she will be the only judge on the Supreme Court with trial \ncourt experience. She would be one of the only ones with experience as \na prosecutor. As many have commented, she would be the appointee with \nthe most Federal court experience in a century.\n  We have, right now, a chance to make history. Thankfully, unlike a \nlot of the important decisions we have to make that come before this \nbody, this is an easy one to make.\n  Judge Sotomayor will not only be the first Latina on the Supreme \nCourt; she will be the first person of Hispanic descent to reach the \npinnacle of any one of the three branches of the Federal Government. \nShe could not be more qualified for this position. Her appointment will \nhelp protect the individual rights and liberties that are so necessary \nfor Minnesotans and for all Americans--and that this Supreme Court has \nsteadily, and substantially, eroded.\n  I am honored to cast my vote in favor of Judge Sonia Sotomayor, and I \nhope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will join me.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, while this is my first opportunity to vote \nfor a Supreme Court nominee named by a Democratic President, I don't \nview the confirmation of judges through a partisan lens. Instead of \npartisanship, I have developed several criteria for assessing Supreme \nCourt nominations. I believe these criteria are straightforward, and \nthey are easy to understand:\n  Does the nominee have extensive experience with the law and a \njudicial temperament?\n  Has the nominee demonstrated sharp legal intelligence and sound \njudgment?\n  Does the individual display a judicial philosophy that falls within \nthe mainstream of American legal thought?\n  Is he or she able and willing to separate their personal beliefs from \ntheir constitutional obligations?\n  On each count, I rule in favor of Judge Sotomayor.\n  My colleagues and I have all been listening carefully to Judge \nSotomayor's testimony, and we have reviewed her record. In that record, \neverything I have been able to ascertain indicates that Justice \nSotomayor will look a lot like Judge Sotomayor--an exemplary arbiter of \nthe law, firm but practical, tough but fair.\n  For these reasons, I will cast my vote to confirm her as the next \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  I speak from, perhaps, a unique position among Senators. I may be the \nshortest serving Senator in the history on our Senate Judiciary \nCommittee. At the beginning of the 111th Congress, Senator Reid asked \nme to serve on this extraordinarily important committee. Senator Reid \ntold me it would be a\n\n[[Page S8848]]\n\ntemporary assignment, but I was still on the committee when Judge \nSotomayor was nominated to the Supreme Court. I very much enjoyed my \nmeeting with Judge Sotomayor, and I told her I wasn't sure how long I \nwould be serving on the committee. I said I felt a little bit like a \nsnowflake with the prospect of an Oregon rain coming in the afternoon. \nIn fact, the rain came just a few days before the Judiciary Committee \nbegan the confirmation hearing for Judge Sotomayor. I did get a chance \nto talk with her and discuss, at some length, her views with respect to \nthe key issues surrounding how a Senator evaluates a nominee to the \nSupreme Court.\n  On the basis of that discussion and a review of her record, while I \nwasn't able to cast a vote for her in committee, it is going to be, \nlater this week, an honor for me to vote for her on the Senate floor.\n  When I met with Judge Sotomayor, we discussed a number of important \nissues--particularly matters relating to national security, the power \nof the Commander in Chief, and we also spent some time on a matter that \nI know the occupant of the chair is most interested in and that is end-\nof-life health care. What struck me the most about Judge Sotomayor was \nher openness, her intellectual curiosity, and her desire to make sure \nshe had all the facts, all the information, all the views and \nbackground and the reading material that you have to have when you are \ngoing to make a call not on the basis of your predisposition but on the \nbasis of the law and the law as it is applied to the facts.\n  In a number of areas we discussed with respect to end of life, Judge \nSotomayor acknowledged that these were issues she hadn't personally \nconsidered. The occupant of the chair and I have talked at some length \nabout the politicized case of the late Terri Schiavo. I objected on the \nfloor of the Senate to the Senate considering that matter.\n  Of course, Judge Sotomayor could not go into how she would rule on \nend-of-life cases. But we talked at some length about those issues, and \nI am going to discuss them later in this statement tonight.\n  I wish to start my comments by saying I believe, with the young \npeople at home in Oregon, this nomination by President Obama is \nregarded as an inspiration and a remarkable personal story. Oregonians \nhave told me they look at her journey as the realization of the \nAmerican dream. Oregonians have followed her testimony before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee. They believe she is qualified for this job. \nThey are very excited about the fact that this nomination makes \nhistory, and I commend the President for demonstrating with this \nnomination how it is possible to increase the diversity, talent, and \nexperience on the Supreme Court with one very capable individual.\n  Chairman Leahy and others have done an excellent job of going through \nthe judge's impressive background. I do want to spend some time talking \nabout the issues that Judge Sotomayor and I discussed in my office most \nextensively--Presidential power and end of life.\n  Serving on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, I have \nfollowed the history with respect to a President's Commander in Chief \nauthority. Disagreements about this authority and how it is applied are \ncertainly nothing new. There have been vigorous debates about this \nissue since our country was founded. But over the past several years, \nthere has been especially heated debate around these questions and, in \nparticular, the issue of whether, during times of war, the President \nhas the authority to ignore laws passed by the Congress. As a result, \nthere have been several occasions, over the past few years, where the \nSupreme Court has had to rule on major national security issues and \naddress this question directly.\n  Our Court has frequently been sharply divided on this issue. At the \nsame time, it has consistently ruled that--in Justice Sandra Day \nO'Connor's words--``a state of war is not a blank check for the \nPresident.'' I believe this is a principle that has to be upheld.\n  When I raised these issues with Judge Sotomayor, I was impressed with \nher thoughtfulness, her knowledge, and the experience she discussed \nabout dealing with these thorny issues. Her answers made me believe \nthat, as a Supreme Court Justice, she would apply the Constitution in a \nway that struck a balance--a very careful balance--between protecting \nour collective security and protecting our individual liberty.\n  We have always had, in the national security area, something of a \nconstitutional teeter-totter, where the Founding Fathers always sought \nto try to ensure that there was an appropriate balance between \nprotecting our Nation and securing our individual liberties; and \nmaintaining that balance is what the Founding Fathers saw as paramount.\n  While Judge Sotomayor certainly gave no inkling to me in our \ndiscussion about national security how she might rule in a particular \ncase, I felt very strongly that she would be able to define the reach \nof the Commander in Chief's power so as to strike that appropriate \nbalance between collective security and individual liberty.\n  I must say, I don't want judges who will defer to any one President. \nI want judges who are going to defer to the Constitution. I believe \nJudge Sotomayor will do that in her service on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  As I mentioned, I discussed with the judge the matter of end-of-life \nhealth care. This is a very sensitive issue for millions of Americans. \nWhat was striking about this in our discussions, when she and I met, is \nshe recognized it was a contentious area of the law--one that deals \nwith the rights of individuals and family members; and she certainly \nindicated she was going to spend a lot of time trying to learn about \nthe history of cases in this area and the Court's judgments on end-of-\nlife care.\n  I have been very interested particularly in Justice Brandeis's \ndissent in the Olmstead case. This was a 1928 case. The Supreme Court \nlater adopted Justice Brandeis's view in the Katz case which \nessentially made it clear there is a right to be left alone, a right to \nbe respected in these very delicate questions.\n  What concerned me so much about the Terry Schiavo case--and again, \nJudge Sotomayor gave no inkling about how she would rule on an end-of-\nlife case--I think she understood my concern, and would follow up on \nit, that we cannot have elected officials, and particularly the Senate, \nbecome something of a medical court of appeals where the Senate \nessentially appoints itself the arbiter of these very difficult \ntragedies.\n  Judge Sotomayor did not commit herself to any specific position on \nend-of-life issues or any of the other issues. And, in fact, the judge \nsaid that coming from New York where they have a very sophisticated set \nof laws and legal protections to empower the individual to make their \nown choices--not government--empower the individual to make these very \ndifficult questions, the judge said because New York had those statutes \nempowering individuals that she would spend time looking at the laws \nand the decisions of the Supreme Court in this area, reflecting, again, \nher commitment to follow the facts, follow the law, and not bring any \npredisposition of one sort or another to a very difficult and \ncontentious area of the law, one that is as sure as night follows the \nday is going to be before the Supreme Court again--the matter of end-\nof-life health care.\n  Let me also mention one of our colleagues talked about her respect \nfor precedent. I asked her about a woman's right to choose. She said \nthat is an area of the law that has been settled for decades.\n  On the second amendment, she indicated she would not try to eliminate \nthe right to own guns for hunting or for personal protection, again, \nwhat amounts to a recognition of existing law.\n  On foreign law, she said she would not rely on international legal \ndecisions to interpret the Constitution.\n  This is a nominee who is going to be very sensitive to following \nprecedent, following the facts, and ensuring that those principles are \nwhat guide her service on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Before I close, I wish to submit a letter the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee received in support of Judge Sotomayor from the Federal Bar \nAssociation. They passed a resolution in support of the judge's \nnomination. The Senate Judiciary Committee has also received statements \nof support from the Hispanic National Bar Association, from the past \npresidents of NHBA.\n\n[[Page S8849]]\n\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the letter and \nresolution and statement of support.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     June 1, 2009.\n     Re Nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the United States \n         Supreme Court.\n\n     Hon.

To express its unconditional satisfaction with the \n     qualifications of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to fill the vacancy \n     in the United States Supreme Court, and the Chapters \n     unconditional support of this important nomination;\n       2. To exhort the United States Senate and Its Committee on \n     the Judiciary to expeditiously consider and favorably act on \n     Judge Sonia Sotomayor's nomination, so that the United States \n     Supreme Court may have a full complement of Justices by the \n     time the Supreme Court reconvenes on October 5, 2009.\n       In San Juan, Puerto Rico, this 29th day of May, 2009.\n\n\n                            Hispanic National Bar Association,\n\n                                                     July 8, 2009.\n\n      HNBA Announces Endorsement of the Honorable Sonia Sotomayor\n\n       Washington, DC.--The Hispanic National Bar Association \n     (HNBA) announced today that it has formally endorsed The \n     Honorable Sonia M. Sotomayor to serve as Associate Justice of \n     the Supreme Court of the United States. The HNBA's Special \n     Committee on the U.S. Supreme Court has concluded its most \n     recent review of Judge Sotomayor's qualifications and overall \n     record, and found her to be `extraordinarily well-qualified' \n     to serve on the Nation's highest court. According to Ramona \n     E. Romero, HNBA National President, ``the HNBA unanimously \n     endorsed Judge Sotomayor after reviewing her judicial record, \n     professional competence, intellect, character, reputation for \n     integrity, temperament, commitment to equal justice and \n     record of service to the American public and the Hispanic \n     community.'' Carlos Ortiz, who co-chairs the HNBA's Supreme \n     Court Committee, added that ``based on our review, we are \n     certain that she is extraordinary well-equipped to serve on \n     our country's high court. We believe that she embodies all \n     the qualities required for service as a Justice, and are \n     confident that, when confirmed, she will render fair and \n     impartial justice for all Americans. We recommend her without \n     any reservation.''\n       This is the HNBA's fourth review of Judge Sotomayor's \n     record. The HNBA conducted due diligence before including \n     Judge Sotomayor on a short list of potential Hispanic \n     American nominees for the U.S. Supreme Court released in \n     2005. Her credentials were also reviewed by the HNBA prior to \n     her elevation to the Second Circuit in 1998, and when she was \n     nominated for the U.S. District Court. ``In each instance, we \n     have been impressed by her intellect, her commitment to the \n     rule of law and equal justice, her experience, and her \n     respect for all who interact with the legal system,'' said \n     Ms. Romero. Since the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to the \n     U.S. Supreme Court in late May, the HNBA has met with members \n     of the Senate Judiciary Committee and their staff to advocate \n     for a fair and expeditious confirmation hearing. The HNBA \n     looks forward to the opportunity to reiterate its strong \n     support for Judge Sotomayor during the confirmation process.\n       The HNBA Supreme Court Committee is co-chaired by Robert \n     Raben, founder and President of The Raben Group.

Judge Sotomayor has exceptional \n     academic and professional credentials. She is a summa cum \n     laude graduate of Princeton University and graduated from \n     Yale Law School, where she served as an editor of the Yale \n     Law Journal. Before her appointment to the federal bench, \n     Judge Sotomayor was a prosecutor for five years in the \n     Manhattan District Attorney's Office and then a commercial \n     litigator in a private law firm. Judge Sotomayor has been a \n     federal judge for 17 years, serving with distinction on both \n     the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York \n     and the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.\n       We have all long been troubled by the fact that no person \n     of Hispanic heritage has ever served on our nation's highest \n     court. During our terms as HNBA President, each and every one \n     of us engaged in bipartisan efforts to diversify the federal \n     bench and to build a pipeline of qualified Latino lawyers, \n     jurists and legal scholars who would be prepared to serve on \n     the U.S. Supreme Court with distinction. We have always been \n     convinced that greater diversity on the Supreme Court would \n     broaden and strengthen the perspective of its jurisprudence \n     and enhance the administration of justice for all Americans. \n     Words cannot adequately express the delight in our hearts \n     that our time has finally arrived. We urge the U.S. Senate to \n     confirm an exceptional jurist with extraordinary federal \n     judicial and legal experience, Judge Sonia Sotomayor.\n         Mario G. Obledo, John R.

Mr. President, this organization, the Hispanic National \nBar Association is not for profit, a national membership association \nthat represents the interests of more than 100,000 attorneys, judges, \nlaw professors, legal assistants, and law students of Hispanic descent \nin United States, its territories, and Puerto Rico.\n  After a review of her qualifications and overall record, the Hispanic \nNational Bar Association's Special Committee on the U.S. Supreme Court \nconcluded that Judge Sotomayor is extraordinarily well qualified to \nserve on the Nation's highest Court.\n  Let me close simply by saying that when we have to review a nominee \nfor this extraordinarily important position, one of the most important \nmeasures for me is to know that the nominee's views are squarely in the \nmainstream of American jurisprudence.\n\n[[Page S8850]]\n\n  I came away believing that, but I hope that the Senate will not take \nmy word for it or any other colleague's word for it. I think we ought \nto reflect on what the American Bar Association said. They gave her \ntheir highest rating. Or listen to former FBI Director Louis Freeh who \ncalled her an ``outstanding judge.'' Or read the dozens of endorsements \nfor her, including those from the American Hunters & Shooters \nAssociation, the Chamber of Commerce, and the National Association of \nWomen Lawyers.\n  I started my statement tonight by laying out the criteria that I \nbelieve ought to be used in evaluating a Supreme Court nominee. In \nterms of those criteria, Judge Sotomayor is an individual who will \nbring great credit to the Supreme Court. She will be a role model for \nmillions and millions of young people in our country. I hope our \ncolleagues will vote in a resounding fashion in favor of her nomination \nto serve on the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I, too, rise in strong support of the \nPresident's historic nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be \nAssociate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  The Senate has no more important responsibility than to advise and \nconsent on nominations to our Nation's highest Court. It will be an \nhonor, on behalf of the people of my State, to cast my vote to confirm \nSonia Sotomayor.\n  Judge Sotomayor is a distinguished lawyer with a lifetime of \nexperience in and out of the courtroom, as a litigator, a prosecutor, a \ntrial judge, and an appellate judge on one of the most prestigious \ncourts in the Nation.\n  At an early point in her career, she showed a dedication to public \nservice, serving 5 years as an assistant district attorney in New York \nCity. As a prosecutor, she focused on murder and robbery cases at a \ntime when violence was high in New York and law and order was \nessential. And she has chosen in recent years to share her knowledge \nand experience with young legal scholars as an adjunct professor at \nlocal law schools.\n  Three Presidents from both parties have also agreed she merits a \nprestigious lifetime judicial appointment. That is impressive \nbipartisan support at our Nation's highest levels.\n  The question before the Senate is whether the nominee meets the high \nstandards we rightfully expect of our Supreme Court Justices. It is our \nrole to advise and consent on whether a President's nominee seeks to \napply the law and not to make or remake it. On both of these fronts, \nJudge Sotomayor meets and far exceeds the mark. She is clearly a \njudicial moderate and has demonstrated this through a Federal judicial \nrecord longer than any nominee in the last 100 years.\n  As Federal district court judge in the Southern District of New York, \nJudge Sotomayor presided over roughly 450 cases. As a member of the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals, Judge Sotomayor has participated in \nover 3,000 panel decisions and authored over 400 published opinions.\n  Seldom does the Senate have a record as long as Judge Sotomayor's. \nThere is no mystery here about what kind of Justice she will be.\n  Since joining the second circuit, she has participated in 434 \npublished panel decisions where the panel included at least one judge \nappointed by a Republican President. In these cases, Judge Sotomayor \nagreed with the result favored by the Republican appointee 95 percent \nof the time. She has ruled for the government in 83 percent of \nimmigration cases, and 92 percent of criminal cases. She has hewed \nclosely to second circuit precedent. On employment cases, she has split \nher decisions evenly. By all accounts, she is a mainstream moderate \nnominee.\n  The American Bar Association unanimously found her well qualified. \nShe is someone with a long record of moderation and humility toward the \nlaw. Her work is driven by a thorough application of the law to the \nfacts of each case. Our focus and the basis for support or opposition \nshould be on her qualifications and record. And on this point, she \nclearly should be confirmed.\n  This week, we have a historic opportunity to add a mainstream, \nmoderate judge to our Nation's highest Court. President George H. W. \nBush saw this kind of potential in her when he nominated her to the \nFederal district court, and she has fully realized his faith in her, so \nmuch so that she stands on the brink of history after being nominated \nby President Obama.\n  Judge Sotomayor has all the professional ingredients to make a great \nSupreme Court Justice. It is on that basis she should be confirmed by \nthis body by an overwhelming vote.\n  But there is more to Judge Sotomayor than this impressive legal \ncareer. Judge Sotomayor has also lived a truly American story. The \ndaughter of Puerto Rican parents, Judge Sotomayor lost her father at \nthe age of 9 and was raised in a housing project in the Bronx. Through \nstrong-willed parenting by her mother, she rose from difficult \ncircumstances to receive the very highest honor that Princeton awards \nto an undergrad. She also went to Yale Law School where she had a much \nmore distinguished career than my own.\n  When she is confirmed as the first Hispanic and third woman ever to \nbe nominated to the Supreme Court, Judge Sotomayor will be an \ninspirational example to all children all across the country, telling \nus that regardless of where you come from, regardless of your economic \ncircumstances, nothing is beyond your reach in America.\n  Judge Sotomayor will be a role model for young Coloradans in all of \nour schools, and with her on the high Court, I fully expect that \nschool-age girls, such as my three daughters, will have an important \nrole model of success to follow in their own lives.\n  These intangible factors make her nomination an important statement \nfor millions of young Americans setting out on their own paths.\n  I have the utmost faith in Sonia Sotomayor. The President made an \nexcellent nomination. Through sheer persistence, hard work, \nintelligence, and integrity, she has become an inspiration to the \nAmerican people, and she is a compelling reminder that in this Nation, \neverything is possible.\n  I am proud to commit my vote in favor of this nominee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. Presdient, many independent studies that have closely \nexamined Judge Sotomayor's record have concluded that hers is a record \nof applying the law, not bias. For example, the American Bar \nAssociation's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously \nfound Judge Sotomayor to be ``well qualified''--its highest rating--\nafter conducting a thorough evaluation that included an examination of \nher integrity and freedom from bias. The Chair of the Standing \nCommittee testified, ``the committee unanimously found an absence of \nany bias in the nominee's extensive work,'' and described Judge \nSotomayor's opinions as ``show[ing] an adherence to precedent and an \nabsence of attempts to set policy based on the judge's personal \nviews.''\n  Numerous other studies from groups such as the Congressional Research \nService, the New York City Bar Association, the Transactional Records \nAccess Clearinghouse, the National Association of Women Lawyers, and \nthe nonpartisan Brennan Center for Justice, have reached similar \nconclusions. These studies were entered into the record during Judge \nSotomayor's confirmation hearings. Nothing in these studies or in her \n17 year record on the bench raises a concern that Judge Sotomayor would \nsubstitute feelings for the command of the law.\n  Judge Sotomayor's critics attack her by pretending that President \nObama does not respect the Constitution and the rule of law. They are \nwrong. They attack him for using the word empathy to describe one of \nthe qualities he is looking for in a judicial nominee. He has never \nsaid that empathy is intended to override the rule of law. It is, \nnonetheless, ironic that the Senate Republican leader has criticized \nJudge Sotomayor for not being more empathetic and ruling for Frank \nRicci, Ben Vargas, and the other plaintiffs despite the well-settled \nlaw in the Second Circuit which she applied in that case.\n  They attack her by misconstruing what empathy means. Empathy is \nunderstanding and awareness. That is what Justice Alito was testifying \nabout at his confirmation hearing. That is what Justice Thomas was \ntestifying about when he said that what he would bring to the Supreme \nCourt ``is\n\n[[Page S8851]]\n\nan understanding and the ability to stand in the shoes of other people \nacross a broad spectrum of this country.'' Justice Alito and Justice \nThomas were not testifying that they would be biased. What the partisan \ncritics do not appreciate is that the opposite of empathy is \nindifference and a lack of understanding. Empathy does not mean biased \nor mean picking one side over another, it means understanding both \nsides.\n  When she was designated by the President, Judge Sotomayor said: ``The \nwealth of experiences, personal and professional, have helped me \nappreciate the variety of perspectives that present themselves in every \ncase that I hear. It has helped me to understand, respect, and respond \nto the concerns and arguments of all litigants who appear before me, as \nwell as to the views of my colleagues on the bench. I strive never to \nforget the real-world consequences of my decisions on individuals, \nbusinesses, and government.''\n  It took a Supreme Court that understood the real world to see that \nthe seeming fair-sounding doctrine of ``separate but equal'' was a \nstraightjacket of inequality. We do not need more conservative \nactivists second guessing Congress and who through judicial extremism \noverride congressional judgments intended to protect Americans' voting \nrights, privacy rights and access to health care and education.\n  In her widely misconstrued speech at the University of California at \nBerkeley, Judge Sotomayor said: ``[J]udges must transcend their \npersonal sympathies and prejudices and aspire to achieve a greater \ndegree of fairness and integrity based on the reason of law.'' That \nparallels what Chief Justice Roberts said at his confirmation hearing \nwhen he testified about ``the ideal in the American justice system'' \nand judges ``doing their best to interpret the law, to interpret the \nConstitution, according to the rule of law'' and not substituting their \nown personal agenda.\n  Those who spent days asking Judge Sotomayor to explain what she meant \nin a partial quotation from that speech about the decisions reached by \na ``wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences'' miss that \nshe begins that statement with the words, ``I would hope.'' They miss \nthat her statement is aspirational. She would ``hope'' that she and the \nother Hispanic women judges would be ``wise'' in their decisionmaking \nand that their experiences would help inform them and help provide that \nwisdom. Judge Sotomayor's critics have ignored her modesty in not \nclaiming to be perfect, but rather in aspiring to the greatest wisdom \nand fairness she can achieve.\n  These critics also miss that Judge Sotomayor was pointing out a path \nto greater fairness and fidelity to law by acknowledging that despite \nthe aspiration she shares with other judges, there are imperfections of \nhuman judging. By acknowledging rather than ignoring that while all \njudges seek to set aside their personal views, they do not always \nsucceed, and we can be on guard against those views influencing \njudicial outcomes.\n  Judge Sotomayor has described herself as ``an ordinary person who has \nbeen blessed with extraordinary opportunities and experiences.'' In her \nopening statement at her Supreme Court confirmation hearing she spoke \nabout witnessing the ``human consequences'' of judicial decisions. She \ntestified that her judicial decisions ``have not been made to serve the \ninterests of any one litigant, but always to serve the large interest \nof impartial justice.''\n  We have a long and important tradition in the law of seeking justice \nand fairness and equity. Judge Sotomayor spoke about the meaning of the \nword ``justice'' a decade ago and said: ``Almost every person in our \nsociety is moved by that one word. It is a word embodied with a spirit \nthat rings in the hearts of people. It is an elegant and beautiful word \nthat moves people to believe that the law is something special.''\n  In this country, the law is special, and it is special because of \nwhat it protects and what it can do. In England there were separate law \ncourts and chancery courts. But, in the United States we have combined \nthese functions to be performed by all of our Federal judges.\n  We all talk about the importance of judges following the law. Yet we \nshould remember that the law that judges must follow includes the \nreconstruction amendments and particularly the 14th amendment, which \ntransformed the rule of law and the role of judges and Congress in the \nUnited States. In the aftermath of the bloody, tragic Civil War, the \n14th amendment was passed to give the courts and the Congress a more \nactive role in defining and protecting civil rights. The complete \nabolition of slavery was only a part of its grand purpose. It was \ndriven by a profound desire to arm the newly freed slaves--and all \nAmericans--with the rule of law--set forth in the grand phrasing of the \nequal protection, due process, and privileges or immunities clauses--to \nguarantee their equal rights against invidious governmental \ndiscrimination.\n  The 14th amendment does not supplant but reinforces the historical \nequitable powers of our courts to redress problems. It is not just the \nstatutes Congress writes, but also the precedent and interpretations of \nthe courts that make up the law. We have a strong common law tradition \nin that regard. And we have a powerful equitable tradition that ensures \nthat fairness and justice are done.\n  We need judges who appreciate when and how to use their equitable \npowers. Judges who follow the law are empowered to enjoin illegal \nbehavior, as the Supreme Court did in its historic series of orders \nenjoining the States and others from segregating schools on the basis \nof race. This does not mean that our courts have the power to remedy \nevery problem in America. They do not. In addition, they can abuse \ntheir power, as I think the Supreme Court did when it intervened in the \nPresidential election in 2000 and determined its outcome. But, we \nshould never forget that it is through its equitable powers that the \nSupreme Court and most other courts in this country are able to do \njustice and to ensure fairness and equity. In that regard, I believe \nthat the experience and wisdom Judge Sotomayor has gained from an \nextraordinary life will benefit all Americans.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

RICHARD BAKER\n\n Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the U.S. Senate is an institution \nthat reveres precedent, continuity, and tradition. Ours is an \ninstitution that prides itself on the great men and women who preceded \nus in this Chamber, and the role this institution has played in \nprotecting our Nation, and in making our Nation a better place in which \nto live, work, and raise families. This is an institution that prides \nitself on its history.\n  Therefore, it is important that the Senate have an official \nhistorian, along with an Historical Office to document our history, and \nsupervise the management of the records of the Senate as an \ninstitution, of Senate committees, and of individual Senators.\n  For the past 34 years, the Senate has been fortunate, perhaps I \nshould say we have been blessed, to have Dr. Richard Baker as the \nSenate Historian. Unfortunately for us, he is now leaving his position \nas Senate Historian, so I must say farewell.\n  This is a most reluctant and sad farewell. While I am pleased that \nDr. Baker will now have the time and opportunity to pursue other \nendeavors, such as spending more time with his wife and other family \nmembers, as well as\n\n[[Page S8852]]\n\ncompleting some manuscripts he has been working on, I must say that I \nam truly sorry to see him leave.\n  In the preface of volume two of my four-volume history of the Senate, \nI pointed out that, ``This work in its present form would not have been \npossible without the assistance of the professionals within the Senate \nhistorical office,'' which, of course, was headed by Dr. Baker. My \nlittle acknowledgment hardly begins to convey the debt of my gratitude \nto him for his assistance in that project.\n  Researching and writing that four-volume history took more than a \ndecade, and during that 10-year period, whenever I went to him for \nassistance, whether for help in research or writing or just thinking \nabout how I wanted to present a certain idea, he always went above and \nbeyond the call of duty. He was always there, ready and eager to help. \nI will never forget how, time after time, he would simply say, \n``Senator, I'll be delighted to help.''\n  He was always ready to help, although he was responsible to 99 other \nSenators, and had so many other responsibilities and functions. Since \nthe office was created in 1975, following the Watergate scandal, Dr. \nBaker, the Senate's first and only historian, has ensured that the \nhistory of the Senate is properly collected, categorized, maintained, \nand preserved. In addition, he has advised Senators on how to manage \ntheir personal papers while they are here, and how to preserve them \nonce they leave office, and has advised Senate committees on the \ntransfer of their records to the National Archives.\n  Charged with maintaining an objective and thorough record of the \ninstitution, his office has collected information on important Senate \nevents, and traced the background and the evolution of Senate rules, \nprecedents and countless activities.\n  In a multitude of ways, through the publications that his office \nissues, in talks with Senators and our staffs, and in private \nconsultations, Dr. Baker has provided Senators with a better \nunderstanding and appreciation of the U.S. Senate, and its importance \nand its role under the Constitution. His office has reminded us on a \ndaily basis of the majesty, the uniqueness, and the greatness of our \ninstitution.\n  His office has undertaken its very important work objectively and \nwithout political motivation or slant. It always remained a completely \nnonpartisan office. As a result, Dr. Baker earned the respect as well \nas the gratitude of Senators on both sides of the aisle. This explains \nwhy, even with the many changes in the Senate during his tenure as \nSenate Historian, including changes in Senate leaders and party \ncontrol, no one has even considered any change in the Senate Historical \nOffice.\n  Because of his careful and methodical work in collecting the history \nof the Senate, I can safely predict that the work of his office will be \nvital to future historians. Years from now, when most of us are long \ngone--from the Senate, that is--historians will be using the records \nhis office has compiled and the documents his office has produced, to \nwrite their histories of the Senate--and for that we will all be \ngrateful.\n  I congratulate and I thank Dr. Baker for the marvelous work he has \ndone. I wish him and his lovely wife Pat nothing but much happiness, \ngreat success, and the best of health as they embark on the next phase \nof their lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8852-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8852-S8854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       BUDGET SCOREKEEPING REPORT\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to submit to the Senate the second \nbudget scorekeeping reports for the 2010 budget resolution. The \nreports, which cover fiscal years 2009 and 2010, were prepared by the \nCongressional Budget Office pursuant to section 308(b) and in aid of \nsection 311 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, as amended.\n  The reports show the effects of congressional action through July 31, \n2009, and include the effects of legislation since I filed my last \nreports on June 25, 2009. The new legislation includes P.L. 111-42, a \njoint resolution approving the renewal of import restrictions contained \nin the Burmese Freedom and Democracy Act of 2003, and for other \npurposes; H.R. 3114, an act to authorize the Director of the U.S. \nPatent and Trademark Office to use funds made available under the \nTrademark Act of 1946 for patent operations in order to avoid furloughs \nand reductions-in-force, and for other purposes, pending Presidential \naction; S. 1107, the Judicial Survivors Protection Act of 2009, pending \nPresidential action; and H.R. 3357, an act to restore sums to the \nhighway trust fund, and for other purposes, pending Presidential \naction. The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues are \nconsistent with the technical and economic assumptions of S. Con. Res. \n13, the 2010 budget resolution.\n  For 2009, the estimates show that current level spending is $982 \nmillion below the level provided for in the budget resolution for \nbudget authority and $3.8 billion above it for outlays while current \nlevel revenues match the budget resolution level. For 2010, the \nestimates show that current level spending is $1,205.9 billion below \nthe level provided for in the budget resolution for budget authority \nand $715.8 billion below it for outlays while current level revenues \nare $19.2 billion above the budget resolution level.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the letters and accompanying tables \nfrom CBO printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, August 4, 2009.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: The enclosed report shows the effects of \n     Congressional action on the fiscal year 2009 budget and is \n     current through July 31, 2009. This report is submitted under \n     section 308(b) and in aid of section 311 of the Congressional \n     Budget Act, as amended.\n       The estimates of budget authority, outlays, and revenues \n     are consistent with the technical and economic assumptions of \n     S. Con. Res. 13, the Concurrent Resolution on the Budget for \n     Fiscal Year 2010, as approved by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives.\n       Pursuant to section 403 of S. Con. Res. 13, provisions \n     designated as emergency requirements are exempt from \n     enforcement of the budget resolution. As a result, the \n     enclosed current level report excludes these amounts (see \n     footnote 2 of Table 2 of the report).\n       Since my last letter dated June 25, 2009, the Congress has \n     cleared for the President's signature the following acts, \n     which affect budget authority and outlays for fiscal year \n     2009:\n       An act to authorize the Director of the United States \n     Patent and Trademark Office to use funds . . . and for other \n     purposes (H.R. 3114); and\n       An act to restore sums to the Highway Trust Fund, and for \n     other purposes (H.R. 3357).\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Douglas W.

Mr. Presdient, following the attacks of September 11, \n2001, Congress made dramatic changes to our immigration laws that were \nintended to strengthen barriers to entry to the United States for those \nbelieved to be engaged in terrorist activity. This was a laudable goal, \nbut as with so much of the Federal Government's response to the \nSeptember 11 attacks, fear overtook reason and sound judgment. Rather \nthan limit the scope of changes to the law, Congress passed vastly \noverbroad revisions to the definition of terrorist activity, resulting \nin harm to asylum seekers and refugees. As a result, many who deserve \nand are otherwise eligible for protection under our laws have suffered \nneedlessly.\n  The post-September 11 changes to the law expanded bars to entry for \nthose accused of providing ``material support'' to terrorist \norganizations, or who are believed to have engaged in ``terrorist \nactivity.'' The new definition of terrorist organization was so broadly \nwritten that an individual who was forced at gunpoint to provide \nmedical or other assistance, no matter how slight, to any group of two \nor more people acting against the law of their country, are considered \nto have materially supported a terrorist organization. As a result, \nthose who bravely fought repressive governments in their home \ncountries, and those who joined the United States in opposing despots, \ncan now be called terrorists and barred from protection in our Nation.\n  I have worked for years to restore common sense to the bars in our \nimmigration laws that apply to material support for terrorism. \nUnfortunately, as a result of the previous administration's inaction, \nand slow progress within the new administration, these laws remain a \nstain on the reputation of the United States as a leader in the cause \nof human rights. The time to end the terrible consequences of these \nlaws is long overdue.\n  I called upon the previous administration to exert leadership in \nsolving the longstanding problems associated with these restrictions to \nadmission to the United States. I worked with Senator Kyl to provide \nthe Bush-Cheney administration with the authority to implement waivers \nso that those deserving of our protection were not wrongly denied \nsanctuary in the United States. Little was done with the authority we \nprovided.\n  We can and must do better. Today I renew these calls for leadership \nin the new administration. I call on President Obama to take the steps \nnecessary to implement the authority granted by Congress to protect \nbona fide refugees and asylees.\n  I recognize that the waiver authority Congress provided to the \nexecutive branch resulted in some positive changes in recent months. \nThe executive branch is granting waivers to those whose ``support'' \nunder the overly broad definition of terrorist organization was \nprovided only under duress. Some others, whose support was provided to \ngroups exempt from the definition of terrorist organization, are also \nbeing granted protection. But that is not enough. The third tier of the \nlaw's definition of terrorist organization\n\n[[Page S8855]]\n\ncontinues to ensnare those deserving of our protection who pose no \nlegitimate threat to the United States. Currently, over 7,000 \nindividuals who were granted refugee status or asylum, and who have \nsince petitioned the Government for lawful permanent residence, are on \nhold and in legal limbo because the agency has not implemented the \nauthority granted under law. These are individuals whom our Government \nhas already screened and deemed eligible for protection under the same \nset of facts now being held against them to erroneously claim that they \nare threats to the United States.\n  And in some cases, these are people that bravely stood by the United \nStates in Iraq and elsewhere. Saman Kareem Ahmad served as a translator \nfor the U.S. Marines in Iraq. He came to the United States on a special \nvisa, supported by the Marine captain with whom he served, and with \ncommendations from GEN David Petraeus. But because he had served with \nthe Kurdish democratic party in Iraq in opposing Saddam Hussein, Mr. \nAhmad was initially denied a green card because he was deemed to have \nbeen part of a terrorist organization under the law's definition. It \ntook press reporting and congressional oversight to resolve this \ninjustice. Such a result is at odds with our values.\n  As the result of legislation Senator Kyl and I sponsored, and which \nbecame law, the agency was directed to establish a process for \nexempting certain groups from the material support bars. In practice, \nan individual who is granted refugee status or asylum is eligible to \nlater petition to adjust their status to lawful permanent residence. \nYet, rather than apply the exemption authority granted under law, the \nagency appears to assume the terrorism bars apply in many of these \ncases, and then holds the cases until it determines whether the \nindividual applicants are eligible for a waiver. This is not what \nCongress intended. A significant percentage of the more than 7,000 \npending cases are petitions from refugees or asylees who were \npreviously admitted to the United States. They are being penalized for \nactions that took place prior to their admission to the United States, \noften for activity that was not barred at the time, and which they \ndisclosed prior to lawful admission to our nation. These individuals \nshould be granted a presumption of admissibility, assuming no other \nfactors of inadmissibility apply to their cases.\n  Equally troubling is the effect of agency inaction on individuals in \nremoval proceedings. Asylum seekers in removal proceedings are not \nconsidered for a waiver of the terrorism-related bars unless and until \na final order of removal is issued. This inefficient system forces \nasylum seekers to engage in a lengthy appeals process if they believe \nthey have a valid claim for relief. Reviewing such cases for waivers at \nthe early stages of removal proceedings will lead to more efficient \noperations within the agency and the immigration courts. It will also \nsave genuine asylum seekers from unnecessary anguish and enable them to \nmore quickly integrate into American society.\n  I intend to work in earnest with the Obama administration to solve \nthis problem once and for all. If the executive branch is unwilling or \nunable to make the needed administrative changes to policy, then I will \nintroduce legislation once again. Should legislation be necessary, I \nexpect the administration and the agencies to work with me in a \nconstructive manner to restore common sense and fairness to our \ntreatment of refugees and asylum seekers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8855-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8855-S8856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INTELLIGENCE INVESTIGATIONS\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, it has now been nearly 8 years since \nour country was attacked on September 11, 2001, as 19 al-Qaida members \nhijacked four jet airplanes and crashed three of them into the World \nTrade Center and the Pentagon. The passengers on the fourth plane, \nFlight 93, learned of the other attacks, fought back against the \nhijackers, and heroically gave their lives to prevent that plane from \nreaching its target in Washington, DC. That target was probably this \nvery building--the U.S. Capitol.\n  In the last 8 years, our homeland has not been attacked again. The \nreasons for this are many. We created a Department of Homeland \nSecurity, and we adopted reforms in our intelligence community \nrecommended by the 9/11 Commission. We are now consistently connecting \nthe intelligence dots that were not connected before 9/11. We have \ndenied safe haven to terrorist organizations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and \nother countries around the world. And we have worked with our allies to \nprevent terrorist groups from gaining access to nuclear and \nradiological materials and to combat terrorist financing.\n  One of the most important reasons why we have not been attacked again \nin the last 8 years is the tireless work of the men and women who serve \nin our intelligence agencies. While the attacks of 9/11 have receded \ninto the memory of many Americans, I assure my colleagues that is not \nthe case for the intelligence community. They know that the threat of \nterrorism has not diminished and are working each day to detect and \ndisrupt terrorist plots targeting America and our allies.\n  They know that the threats we face are ones that could imperil the \nlives of countless Americans. Just last year, the Commission on the \nPrevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction determined that it is ``more \nlikely than not'' that a nuclear or biological weapon of mass \ndestruction will be used against the United States in a terrorist \nattack within the next five years. Should a nuclear device detonate in \nan American city, it could instantly kill hundreds of thousands of \npeople and render the city uninhabitable for years. This is a \ndevastating possibility that America faces every day and agents are \nworking to prevent every second of every day.\n  For all of these reasons, I believe we have a responsibility to give \nour intelligence agencies and agents the resources and tools they need, \nas well as the respect and appreciation they have earned.\n  What we should not do is go backwards by investigating intelligence \nofficials who served us on the front lines of this ongoing war on \nterrorism and acted within legal guidance they were given.\n  Attorney General Holder is still considering an investigation into \nCIA interrogators and contract employees. I fear that such an \ninvestigation could very well foster a climate of political \nrecriminations and sap the morale of the intelligence community. Those \nnear certain results would no doubt leave our country less safe.\n  President Obama had it right when he said that with regard to past \nbehavior by the intelligence community, he is ``more interested in \nlooking forward . . . than looking backward.'' Given the threats that \nwe face as a nation, it is imperative that we follow the President's \nlead.\n  With regard to the treatment of detainees now in U.S. custody, the \nPresident has been clear. The Executive order he signed on January 22 \nof this past year requires that all detainees in U.S. custody ``shall \nin all circumstances be treated humanely and shall not be subjected to \nviolence to life and person'' and that all interrogations carried out \nby the U.S. Government, whether by the military, the CIA, the FBI or \nany other government entity, shall comply with the Army Field Manual. \nThe President's Executive order is consistent with the Detainee \nTreatment Act as well as the Convention Against Torture and Common \nArticle 3 of the Geneva Conventions. Given that such policy changes \nhave already been made, I can see no benefit from new investigations of \nintelligence officials, especially those who were doing what they \nthought was appropriate and necessary to keep us safe.\n  The 9/11 Commission did a positive and constructive investigation of \npast events that needed to be understood so that we did not repeat the \nmistakes that made that horrific day possible. The commission \ninvestigated the activities of agencies such as the CIA and FBI in the \nyears and months prior to the attacks of 9/11, and was unsparing in \npointing out where those agencies had missed opportunities to disrupt \nthe plot. As a result of the commission's recommendations, we \nestablished the Director of National Intelligence and the National \nCounterterrorism Center, improved sharing of intelligence information, \nand strengthened our watchlisting and visa issuance systems. All of \nthese initiatives make the United States safer today against the threat \nof terrorism.\n\n[[Page S8856]]\n\n  A new investigation of interrogation procedures used on al-Qaida \ndetainees would have no such benefits given that these procedures have \nnow been changed. But an investigation into past practices could cause \ngreat harm.\n  An investigation could ruin careers of men and women who have \nsacrificed so much on our behalf and would have a chilling effect on \nintelligence efforts moving forward. The overhanging threat of \ninvestigations will force those in the intelligence services to be risk \naverse, which in turn would make us all less secure. In the war against \nan enemy that does not wear a uniform, that ruthlessly kills innocent \ncivilians, that then hides among those very same civilians, and that \nuses our own freedoms to undermine and attack us, tough decisions under \ngreat pressure--life and death decisions--must be made by those whose \njob it is to protect our security and our freedom.\n  As CIA Director Leon Panetta recently wrote in the Washington Post:\n\n       The time has come for both Democrats and Republicans to \n     take a deep breath and recognize the reality of what happened \n     after September 11, 2001. The question is not the sincerity \n     or the patriotism of those who were dealing with the \n     aftermath of September 11. The country was frightened, and \n     political leaders were trying to respond as best they could. \n     Judgments were made. Some of them were wrong. But that should \n     not taint those public servants who did their duty pursuant \n     to the legal guidance provided.\n\n  As I said at the beginning, we must not take for granted the \nimportant fact that we have not been attacked on our homeland since \nSeptember 11, 2001. That fact is not an accident nor is it just a \nproduct of good luck. It is mostly the result of the ceaseless efforts \nto protect our country by the brave men and women in our military, by \nall who work for civilian agencies involved in homeland security and \ncounterterrorism, and last but not least, by the intelligence \ncommunity. Those men and women are, as CIA Director Panetta pointed \nout, ``truly America's first line of defense.''\n  I urge the Attorney General not to go forward with the investigations \nbeing debated now. The collateral damage to America's intelligence \ncommunity could be severe and that is something no American should \nwant.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8856-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8856-S8857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SERVICE MEMBER BENEFITS EDUCATION\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I want to share a story I heard \nabout retired MSG Michelle Fitz-Henry.\n  Michelle served our Nation for over 20 years. Her husband, Senior \nChief Petty Officer Ted Fitz-Henry, was a Navy SEAL who served our \nNation for 21 years.\n  Michelle told me that before her husband left home for the Middle \nEast they went into the living room. He said to her, you know if \nanything happens to me, SBP is there for you.\n  When he said SBP, he was referring to the Survivor Benefit Plan, an \nannuity that the Department of Defense (DOD) pays to survivors--the \nwidows and orphans--of two groups of servicemembers.\n  The first group of survivors includes those who lost a loved one \nserving on active duty.\n  In 2001, Congress passed a law allowing active duty servicemembers \nwho are not eligible for retirement to be included in the SBP program. \nThe SBP program provides the survivors of these fallen heroes with a \nmonthly payment based upon the age of the spouse and the year the \nservicemember entered the service.\n  This was the right thing to do. It showed the Nation's gratitude for \nservicemembers' sacrifice. If a servicemember dies on active duty \nbecause of a military-connected cause, the servicemember and his or her \nfamily are automatically enrolled in the SBP program.\n  There is a second group of survivors who can also enroll in the SBP \nprogram. A veteran who is classified as a retiree--someone who has \nserved for at least 20 years--is eligible to enroll in the program. \nAfter they leave the service, retirees can contribute a portion of \ntheir retirement pay to SBP. This contribution entitles their survivors \nup to 55 percent of the retiree's base retirement pay after his or her \ndeath.\n  Since 1972, retirees have paid into the program with a portion of \ntheir retirement income in order to improve their family's financial \nsecurity upon their death. Some retirees have paid into the program for \nover 30 years.\n  What Michelle and Ted did not know was that the SBP they thought they \ncould count on--approximately $1,200 per month--would be reduced, \ndollar-for-dollar, by another benefit from the Department of Veterans \nAffairs dependency and indemnity compensation, DIC, program.\n  DIC is a monthly benefit payment to the survivors of all \nservicemembers who have died from a service-connected condition. That \nincludes both those who die on active duty and veterans whose deaths \nresulted from a service-related injury.\n  What many SBP participants and their future survivors do not know is \nthat the SBP-DIC dollar-for-dollar offset can leave widows and orphans \nwith up to $1,200 less per month than they had expected to receive. \nWhen planning a family budget this unforeseen reduction can be \ndevastating.\n  For example, if a widow's husband served for over 20 years, retired, \npaid into the SBP program and then died of a service-connected \ndisability, she may think that she is entitled to both the full SBP and \nDIC payments. However, if she planned to receive $1,300 per month from \nSBP and $1,200 per month from DIC, she could be surprised to learn that \nthe dollar-for dollar offset would reduce her $1,300 SBP payment by the \n$1,200 DIC payment and she would be left with DIC intact, but only $100 \nin SBP per month.\n  As this body knows well, for 8 years I have fought to repeal the law \nthat offsets the monetary payments between the SBP annuity and the DIC \nbenefit. This body may recall that in 2005 we took a step in the right \ndirection and passed by 92-6 an amendment to repeal the unjust SBP-DIC \noffset. In the 2008 Defense authorization, we cracked the door to \neliminating the offset by getting a ``special payment'' of $50 per \nmonth. This special payment, called the special survivor indemnity \nallowance, is received by the widows and orphans whose SBP payments are \noffset by the DIC they receive. This year, the Congress increased the \nspecial payment to $310 per month, by 2017, for the widows and orphans \nimpacted by the SBP-DIC offset. This increase came from savings found \nin the tobacco legislation, which became law on June 22, 2009.\n  Michelle allowed me to speak of her case, but she isn't alone. When \nwidows, veterans, and constituents speak to me in support of my efforts \nto repeal this offset, they often tell me that they did not know that \nthe offset existed.\n  If Michelle and Ted, with 39 years of combined service upon his \ndeath, didn't know about this offset then we have a bigger problem out \nthere: the Services don't adequately educate our servicemembers and \ntheir families about their benefits, especially the offsets to their \nbenefits. This year, we will change that.\n  The amendment I filed to the fiscal year 2010 National Defense \nAuthorization Act, Senate Amendment No. 1808 to S. 1390, will increase \nservicemembers' and their families' awareness of their service-related \nbenefits during transitions and events in a servicemember's career.\n  My amendment will require the Services to provide information to \nservicemembers and their families about their disability, death, \neducation, and survivor benefits, including any offsets.\n  My amendment requires the Services to provide this information when a \nservicemember enters or leaves the service either through retirement or \nat the end of his or her service. The services must also provide \ninformation when a servicemember is classified as having a service-\nconnected disability and is unfit to perform their duty.\n  We all believe it is important for servicemembers and their families \nto receive certain benefits because of their service to the Nation. It \nis my guess that we also believe that servicemembers and their families \nshould know about those benefits. We sometimes take for granted that \nwe're doing enough, but I believe we can do more and benefits education \nis a small but important step toward taking better care of our people.\n  Now I want to be clear, the Services are making honorable efforts to \neducate our troops about their benefits, but we all agree that we can \ndo better. I asked the Services about their procedures, and I was \nsurprised that there\n\n[[Page S8857]]\n\nare few standards or requirements that compel the Services to educate \nservicemembers and their families about disability, death, education \nand survivor benefits. Thus, I believe that our joint approach with the \nServices will go a long way to bring uniformity of content and access \nto all servicemembers and their families.\n  So, after gathering the information, I spoke with the Pentagon about \nthe changes I was proposing and the possibility that I would file \nlegislation. The Department provided numerous improvements to the \nlegislation, including additional requirements for more information to \nbe provided to servicemembers and their families. I appreciate their \nengagement and their thoughtful responses. I think it made for a better \nbill and a better amendment.\n  Requiring benefits education about service-related benefits will help \nachieve the basic goal of raising awareness, not only about \nservicemembers' benefits, but also about the offsets to those benefits.\n  This legislation is another step in the right direction; another step \ntoward raising awareness about the law that requires the unjust SBP-DIC \noffset.\n  However, as awareness is raised we must continue to work hard to \nenact a law that will repeal the unjust offset. Our servicemembers not \nonly earned or purchased this annuity; they and their survivors rely on \nthe government to provide them with accurate information and the \nbenefits they expect and deserve. We must continue to right these \nwrongs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8857-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8857-S8860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SITUATION IN YEMEN\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to bring \nto the attention of my colleagues the burgeoning threat of a potential \nsafe haven for extremists in Yemen. As I am sure is true of many of my \ncolleagues, I continue to monitor the press reports surrounding the \nfuture of the Yemeni detainees currently being held at the Guantanamo \nBay detention facility. However, what I believe too few people are \nfollowing is the growing threat of Yemen becoming a failed state and \npotential safe haven for members of al-Qaida.\n  A recent New York Times article, ``Some in [al] Qaeda Leave Pakistan \nfor Somalia and Yemen,'' highlighted the growing concern within the \nU.S. Government about relocations of some al-Qaida operatives to Yemen. \nThe Washington Institute for Near East Policy also highlighted the \ngrowing threat in Yemen in a recent paper, ``Waning Vigilance: al \nQaeda's Resurgence in Yemen,'' that discusses how the threat in Yemen \nhas simmered in recent years and urgently needs the attention of \npolicymakers. Mr. President, I will ask that the New York Times and \nWashington Institute for Near East Policy articles be printed in the \nRecord following my comments.\n  To appreciate fully the concerns about Yemen's stability, it is \nimportant to recall the association of terrorist activities with Yemen. \nIt is perhaps best known as the site of the U.S.S. Cole attack in \nOctober 2000. But Yemen is also one of the top sources of foreign \nfighters in Iraq and Afghanistan, the source of weapons trafficked into \nGaza, and the country of origin of almost 100 of the remaining \ndetainees at the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. It was also where \nmany mujahedeen returned to after the Soviet withdrawal from \nAfghanistan and, often forgotten, it is the ancestral home of Osama bin \nLaden. Further, in 2008, the U.S. Embassy in the Yemeni capital of \nSana'a was attacked twice--first by a mortar attack and the second time \nby highly trained terrorists using vehicle-borne improvised explosive \ndevices, small arms, and suicide vests.\n  Director of National Intelligence Dennis Blair also highlighted the \nsignificance of the situation in Yemen earlier this year in testimony \nbefore the Senate Armed Services Committee. Director Blair testified \nthat losses within al-Qaida's command structure since 2008 have been \nsignificant and that sustained pressure against al-Qaida in the \nFederally Administered Tribal Areas, FATA, of Pakistan may eventually \nforce it to vacate the FATA. He stated that it is conceivable that al-\nQaida could relocate to the gulf where it could exploit a weak central \ngovernment and close proximity to established recruitment, fundraising, \nand facilitation networks.\n  Yemen is the type of country the Director is concerned about, and, \nfor good reason. I would direct my colleagues to the most recent issue \nof Foreign Policy magazine, which ranks Yemen 18th on its failed states \nindex, an annual index based on 12 indicators ranging from availability \nof public services to demographic pressures to refugee and internally \ndisplaced populations. The failed state index additionally says of \nYemen: ``a perfect storm of state failure is now brewing there: \ndisappearing oil and water reserves; a mob of migrants, some allegedly \nwith al Qaeda ties, flooding in from Somalia . . . ; and a weak \ngovernment increasingly unable to keep things running.''\n  The article goes on to suggest what many Yemen observers have been \nsaying for years: ``Yemen is the next Afghanistan: a global problem \nwrapped in a failed state.'' Report after report reaches the same \nconclusion about--Yemen--it is a failing state with all the makings of \nan extremist safe haven. I believe it is critical that we monitor this \nsituation closely; fund developmental and counterterrorism assistance \nfor the Government of Yemen at robust levels; and urge the Obama \nadministration to engage actively with the Yemeni Government. The \nconsequences of inaction can be seen right across the Gulf of Aden in \nSomalia.\n  For its part, the administration has increased its focus on this \nthreat. Earlier this year, Central Intelligence Agency, CIA, Deputy \nDirector Stephen Kappes reportedly met with Yemeni President Ali \nAbdullah Saleh in Sana'a to discuss security and counterterrorism \ncooperation. This visit is one of many that the CIA and National \nSecurity Council officials have made in recent months, and in addition \nto a visit by General Petraeus shortly after taking command at U.S. \nCentral Command.\n  All of these visits confirmed that the political landscape in Yemen \nremains fragile. Throughout his decades of rule, President Saleh has \nsuccessfully balanced the various political forces in Yemen--tribes, \npolitical parties, military officials, political elites, and radical \nIslamists--to create a stable ruling coalition that has kept his regime \nintact. While in many cases this stability has been purchased via \ncorruption and payoffs, in cases where groups and/or individuals have \nnot been willing to join President Saleh, he has used law enforcement, \nmilitary, and intelligence services to manage threats to stability. In \nrecent years, al-Qaida has entered into the political landscape and \ncomplicated this delicate 30-year balance. President Saleh has \naddressed this situation by reportedly reaching understandings with al-\nQaida that it would be left alone to recruit fighters if it did not \nattack the Yemeni Government.\n  In the Washington Institute for Near East Policy article I mentioned \nearlier, the author makes a number of points that underscore this \ndelicate balancing act and the role of al-Qaida in the political \nlandscape of Yemen. The author argues that the Yemeni Government is \npreoccupied, and its security services overtaxed by increasingly \nviolent calls for secession from the south, threats of renewed fighting \nin the north, and a faltering economy that is dependent on revenue from \nrapidly dwindling petroleum reserves.\n  Between 2002 and 2004, the Yemeni Government, largely with U.S. \nassistance, was able to disrupt al-Qaida-inspired terrorist activity in \nYemen. However, in recent years, a new generation of militants, with \neither experience in Iraq and Afghanistan or time spent in the Yemeni \nprison system, has emerged. This new generation of militants is \ninclined to target the Yemeni Government itself, in addition to foreign \ninterests in Yemen.\n  The start of this resurgence was a 2006 jailbreak, in which 23 \nconvicted terrorists escaped from a prison in the capital of Sana'a. \nEscapees from this jailbreak formed the core of a new group, al-Qaida \nin the Arabian Peninsula, AQAP, which is led by a 2006 escapee whose \ndeputy is a former Guantanamo detainee. While many Yemen observers \nbelieve that AQAP is not yet strong enough to topple President Saleh's \nregime, it is capable of striking high value targets; contributing to \ninstability across Yemen; and recruiting individuals to strengthen its \nranks. The ideological demands of AQAP are\n\n[[Page S8858]]\n\nfamiliar: release militants from prison; end cooperation with the \nUnited States; renounce democracy; and implement a strict form of \nsharia law.\n  If al-Qaida operatives and their leadership in Pakistan look for a \nnew home, Yemen will seem attractive. As in Afghanistan and Pakistan, \nit has large areas of naturally defensible land where President Saleh's \nregime has little authority; a robust tribal structure that could host \nrelocating operatives; and a security infrastructure which lacks the \ncapacity to defend Yemen's sovereign territory. It is also worth \nmentioning that these same tribes, in some cases, share the hard-line \nviews of these relocating al-Qaida operatives and are inclined to help \nenlist their own family into AQAP's efforts. This reality only \ncomplicates further the work of President Saleh in balancing \ncounterterrorism efforts and the survival of his regime.\n  In June 2007, al-Qaida officially announced its rebirth in Yemen with \na suicide attack on a convoy of Spanish tourists. Since then, the \norganization has grown stronger and its attacks more frequent. In \nJanuary 2008, it launched a series of attacks, culminating in the \nassault on the U.S. Embassy in September 2008. Earlier this year, a \npair of suicide bombers targeted South Koreans, attacking first a group \nof tourists in the countryside and then the officials sent to \ninvestigate. Just last month, AQAP demonstrated that it is also \nadopting the kidnapping for ransom tactic, which has proven profitable \nfor other terrorist groups. And, just last month, the Associated Press \nreported that security was upgraded in Yemen's capital after \nintelligence reports warned of attacks planned against the U.S. Embassy \nand other potential targets. In response, the Yemeni chief of \nintelligence has reportedly directed an increase in security around \ndiplomatic missions in the capital and elsewhere in the country. The \nculmination of these developments gives the AQAP the ability to attract \nrelocating foreign fighters and broaden its operational reach.\n  The United States is by no means the only player in the country. \nSaudi Arabia provides the most assistance to Yemen, some of it via \nofficial channels to the government and some portions of it \nunofficially. A myriad of countries are involved in the Yemeni energy \nsector, and Russia and China are the Yemeni Government's major arms \nsuppliers. To complicate matters further, Yemen's tribal leaders, \npowerful within the Yemeni political landscape, are suspicious of U.S. \npolicy in the region. These tribal leaders are often the proxies used \nby President Saleh, Saudi Arabia, and others interested in influencing \nthe government and other elites.\n  Over the past several fiscal years, Yemen has received on average \nbetween $20 and $25 million annually in total U.S. foreign aid. For \nfiscal year 2009, the U.S. provided over $40 million in assistance for \nYemen, an increase from its $18 million aid package in fiscal year \n2008. Between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2007, Yemen also \nreceived approximately $31.5 million from the U.S. Department of \nDefense's section 1206 account to train and equip Yemeni \ncounterterrorism units. The Obama administration also recently sent to \nCongress a new package of 1206 funded projects, which includes $65 \nmillion in counterterrorism assistance for various Yemeni military \nunits. The recently passed fiscal year 2009 supplemental included $10 \nmillion for the U.S. Agency for International Development to support \nU.S.-sponsored rural engagement measures, focused on civil affairs \nactivities and civilian capacity building in the ungoverned regions of \nYemen.\n  While these programs are important and need to be funded, Yemen \nobservers have expressed frustration with how little ``bang for the \nbuck'' the U.S. gets for its financial assistance to Yemen on \ncounterterrorism operations. This is one area where I hope the \nadministration will continue to press the Yemeni Government. In the \npast, the Yemeni Government has complained that the United States has \nprovided them with insufficient assistance. However, based on the most \nrecent administration efforts, the situation has clearly changed, and \nit is time for President Saleh's government to be more responsive. And, \njust as in Pakistan, it is critical that our government make two things \nvery clear: first, we stand ready to assist in training and equipping \ncounterterrorism forces; and second, the threats confronting Yemen are \nultimately a threat to its own existence. American security assistance \nwill ultimately only be as effective as the Yemeni Government's will to \nexecute an aggressive counterterrorism and counter-recruitment mission.\n  To date, the administration has not officially characterized Yemen as \nan al-Qaida safe haven, but should President Saleh prove unwilling to \nconfront adequately the threat posed by relocating foreign fighters; \nthe growing threat of AQAP; and the sympathy of some tribal leaders in \nhis country to support extremist elements, the administration should \nconsider more vigorous action. While the U.S. Embassy in Sana'a is \nworking hard to find an amenable resolution for the transfer of the \nYemeni detainees at Guantanamo, it is also working on these very \ncomplex counterterrorism efforts. I would urge my colleagues to look at \nthe threats emanating from Yemen and to support efforts by the \nadministration to cooperate with the Yemeni Government and other \nregional actors, particularly Saudi Arabia, to address the burgeoning \nthreat in the country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe New York Times and Washington Institute for Near East Policy \narticles to which I referred.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 12, 2009]\n\n           Some in Qaeda Leave Pakistan for Somalia and Yemen\n\n                 (By Eric Schmitt and David E. Sanger)\n\n       Washington.--American officials say they are seeing the \n     first evidence that dozens of fighters with Al Qaeda, and a \n     small handful of the terrorist group's leaders, are moving to \n     Somalia and Yemen from their principal haven in Pakistan's \n     tribal areas. In communications that are being watched \n     carefully at the Pentagon, the White House and the Central \n     Intelligence Agency, the terrorist groups in all three \n     locations are now communicating more frequently, and \n     apparently trying to coordinate their actions, the officials \n     said.\n       Some aides to President Obama attribute the moves to \n     pressure from intensified drone attacks against Qaeda \n     operatives in Pakistan, after years of unsuccessful American \n     efforts to dislodge the terrorist group from their haven \n     there.\n       But there are other possible explanations. Chief among them \n     is the growth of the jihadist campaigns in both Somalia and \n     Yemen, which may now have some of the same appeal for \n     militants that Iraq did after the American military invasion \n     there in 2003.\n       Somalia is now a failed state that bears some resemblance \n     to Afghanistan before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, while \n     Yemen's weak government is ineffectually trying to combat the \n     militants, American officials say.\n       The shift of fighters is still small, perhaps a few dozen, \n     and there is no evidence that the top leaders--Osama bin \n     Laden and Ayman al-Zawahri--are considering a move from their \n     refuge in the Pakistani tribal areas, according to more than \n     half a dozen senior administration, military and \n     counterterrorism officials interviewed in recent days.\n       Most officials would not comment on the record about the \n     details of what they are seeing, because of the sensitivity \n     of the intelligence information they are gathering.\n       Leon E. Panetta, the C.I.A. director, said in remarks here \n     on Thursday that the United States must prevent Al Qaeda from \n     creating a new sanctuary in Yemen or Somalia.\n       The steady trickle of fighters from Pakistan could worsen \n     the chaos in Somalia, where an Islamic militant group, the \n     Shabab, has attracted hundreds of foreign jihadists in its \n     quest to topple the weak moderate Islamist government in \n     Mogadishu. It could also swell the ranks of a growing menace \n     in Yemen, where militants now control large areas of the \n     country outside the capital.\n       ``I am very worried about growing safe havens in both \n     Somalia and Yemen, specifically because we have seen Al Qaeda \n     leadership, some leaders, start to flow to Yemen,'' Adm. Mike \n     Mullen, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in \n     remarks at the Brookings Institution here on May 18.\n       For the United States, the movement creates opportunities \n     as well as risks. With the Obama administration focusing its \n     fight against the Taliban and Al Qaeda on the havens in \n     Afghanistan and Pakistan, a shift of fighters and some \n     leaders to new locations could complicate American efforts to \n     strike a lasting blow.\n       But in the tribal areas of Pakistan, Qaeda and Taliban \n     forces have drawn for protection on Pashtun tribes with whom \n     they have deep familial and tribal ties. A move away from \n     those areas could expose Qaeda leaders to betrayal, while \n     communications among militants in Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen \n     have\n\n[[Page S8859]]\n\n     created a new opportunity for American intelligence to zero \n     in on insurgents who gave up many electronic communication \n     devices shortly after the Sept. 11 attacks to avoid \n     detection.\n       A senior Obama administration official attributed some of \n     the movement to ``the enormous heat we've been putting on the \n     leadership and the mid-ranks'' with Predator strikes, \n     launched from both Pakistan and Afghanistan. Mr. Obama's \n     strategy so far has been to intensify many of the strikes \n     begun under the Bush administration.\n       ``There are indications that some Al Qaeda terrorists are \n     starting to see the tribal areas of Pakistan as a tough place \n     to be,'' said an American counterterrorism official. ``It is \n     likely that a small number have left the region as a result. \n     Among these individuals, some have probably ended up in \n     Somalia and Yemen, among other places. The Al Qaeda \n     terrorists who are leaving the tribal areas of Pakistan are \n     predominantly foot soldiers.''\n       Measuring the numbers of these movements is almost as \n     difficult as assessing the motivations of those who are on \n     their way out of the tribal areas.\n       But American officials say there is evidence of a shift. \n     One senior American military official who follows Africa \n     closely said that more than 100 foreign fighters had trained \n     in terrorism camps in Somalia alone in the past few years. \n     Another senior military officer said that Qaeda operatives \n     and confederates in Pakistan, Yemen and Somalia had stepped \n     up communications with one another.\n       ``What really has us worried is that they're communicating \n     with each other much more--Al Qaeda in Pakistan, Somalia and \n     Yemen,'' the senior military officer said. ``They're asking, \n     `What do you need? Financing? Fighters?' ''\n       Mr. Obama's strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan placed \n     the defeat of Al Qaeda as the No. 1 objective, largely to \n     make sure that the group could not plot new attacks against \n     the United States.\n       Thus, the movement of the fighters, and the disruption that \n     causes, has been interpreted by some of the president's top \n     advisers as a sign of success.\n       But the emergence of new havens, from which Al Qaeda and \n     its affiliates could plot new attacks, raises difficult \n     questions for the United States on how to combat the growing \n     threat, and creates the possibility that increased missile \n     strikes are in the offing in Yemen and Somalia.\n       ``Those are issues that I think the international community \n     is going to have to address because Al Qaeda is not going \n     away,'' Admiral Mullen told a Senate committee on May 21.\n       The C.I.A. says its drone attacks in Pakistan have \n     disrupted Al Qaeda's operations and damaged the group's \n     senior ranks. American officials say that strikes have killed \n     11 of the top 20 Qaeda leaders in the past year.\n       ``Al Qaeda has been hit by drones and it has generated a \n     lot of insecurity among them,'' said Talat Masood, a retired \n     Pakistani general and military analyst in Islamabad.\n       ``Many among them are uneasy and it is possible that they \n     are leaving for Somalia and other jihadi battle fronts,'' he \n     said. ``The hard core, however, will like to stay on.''\n       Without singling out any countries, Adm. Eric T. Olson, the \n     head of the Special Operations Command, spoke in general \n     terms last week about how the increased Pakistani military \n     operations in the Swat Valley and early indications of a new \n     Pakistani offensive in South Waziristan had put militants on \n     the run.\n       ``As the Pakistanis are applying pressure,'' Admiral Olson \n     told a House panel, ``it will shift some of the sanctuaries \n     to other places.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n  [From the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, July 14, 2009]\n\n            Waning Vigilance: Al-Qaeda's Resurgence in Yemen\n\n                          (By Gregory Johnsen)\n\n       Recent reports suggesting that al-Qaeda fighters are \n     leaving Pakistan and Afghanistan, where the group has \n     suffered serious setbacks, have renewed international \n     concerns that Yemen is reemerging once again as a major \n     terrorist safe haven. Although the assessments of al-Qaeda's \n     resurgence in Yemen are accurate, the deteriorating situation \n     is not due to U.S. successes elsewhere; rather, it is the \n     result of waning U.S. and Yemeni attention over the past five \n     years. Renewed cooperation between Sana and Washington in \n     tackling al-Qaeda and addressing Yemen's systemic problems \n     could help reduce the terrorist organization's appeal in this \n     troubled country.\n\n\n                The Apparent Defeat of al-Qaeda in Yemen\n\n       By late 2003, al-Qaeda in Yemen had been largely defeated \n     through the close cooperation of U.S. and Yemeni security \n     forces. This cooperation reached its zenith in November 2002 \n     when the CIA assassinated the head of the organization, Abu \n     Ali al-Harithi, but the Pentagon bypassed the agreed-on cover \n     story and leaked the operation to the press. Washington \n     needed an early victory in the war on terror and the \n     assassination of an al-Qaeda leader was too good to go \n     unacknowledged.\n       Yemen, however, believed it was sold out to U.S. domestic \n     concerns. Yemeni president Ali Abdullah Salih paid a high \n     price for allowing the United States to carry out the \n     attack--something al-Qaeda still uses to great propaganda \n     effect--and it took more than a year for the government to \n     publicly admit that it had authorized Washington to act.\n       In November 2003, the United States was still paying for \n     this mistake when Yemen arrested al-Harithi's replacement, \n     Muhammad Hamdi al-Ahdal, on the streets of Sana. Instead of \n     being granted direct access to al-Ahdal, U.S. officials were \n     forced to work through Yemeni intermediaries; however, with \n     its leadership dead or in jail, its infrastructure largely \n     destroyed, and its militants more attracted to the insurgency \n     in Iraq than jihad at home, al-Qaeda in Yemen appeared \n     largely defeated.\n\n\n                           Al-Qaeda Rebuilds\n\n       The United States and Yemen both treated this victory as \n     absolute, failing to realize that a defeated enemy is not \n     necessarily a vanquished one. In effect, al-Qaeda was crossed \n     off both countries' list of priorities and replaced by other, \n     seemingly more pressing, concerns. For Washington, democratic \n     reforms and anticorruption campaigns dominated the bilateral \n     agenda as part of the Bush administration's desire to mold a \n     new Middle East. For Yemen, attention was increasingly \n     diverted by a five-year-old sectarian civil war in the north \n     and more recently by threats of secession from the south. \n     Over the next two years of relative calm, the threat from al-\n     Qaeda, while not necessarily forgotten, was certainly \n     ignored. Tourism flourished, and the U.S. State Department \n     initiated a Yemen study-abroad program.\n       Even the prison break of twenty-three al-Qaeda suspects in \n     early 2006, which U.S. officials privately blamed on Yemeni \n     government collaboration, was treated more like an aberration \n     than the opening volley of a new battle. Among the escapees \n     were Qasim al-Raymi and Nasir al-Wahayshi, a former secretary \n     to Usama bin Laden and a veteran of the fighting at Tora \n     Bora. The nearly two and a half years of government neglect \n     had created a great deal of space for the two men to \n     reorganize and rebuild al-Qaeda in Yemen.\n       The involvement of al-Raymi and al-Wahayshi, along with \n     numerous other Yemenis from across the country, illustrates \n     one of the more worrying facts about al-Qaeda's current \n     incarnation: it is the most representative organization in \n     the country. Al-Qaeda in Yemen transcends class, tribe, and \n     regional identity in a way that no other Yemeni group or \n     political party can match. Al-Wahayshi and others within the \n     organization have proven particularly talented at \n     articulating a narrative designed to appeal to a local \n     audience, using everything from Palestine to the plight of \n     Sheikh al-Muayad--a Yemeni cleric who ran a popular charity \n     and is currently in a U.S. prison for providing funds to \n     terrorists--to increase their rhetorical appeal to young \n     Yemenis. Both the U.S. and Yemeni governments have been \n     incapable of countering this approach and have effectively \n     ceded the field to al-Qaeda.\n       In June 2007, al-Qaeda officially announced its presence in \n     the country with al-Wahayshi as its commander. It underscored \n     its intentions within days by a suicide attack on a convoy of \n     Spanish tourists. Since then, the organization has grown \n     stronger. In January 2008, it released the first issue of its \n     bimonthly journal, Sada al-Malahim (``The Echo of Battles''), \n     and that same month it launched a series of attacks, \n     culminating in the assault on the U.S. embassy in September \n     2008. Earlier this year, a pair of suicide bombers targeted \n     South Koreans, attacking first a group of tourists and then \n     the officials sent to investigate.\n       Al-Qaeda has also capitalized on its recent successes, \n     attracting recruits from both Yemen and Saudi Arabia. In \n     January, two former Guantanamo Bay detainees joined the group \n     as commanders, spearheading the merger of local branches in \n     Saudi Arabia and Yemen into a single regional franchise. One \n     of the leaders, Muhammad al-Awfi, has since turned himself in \n     to Saudi authorities, but this gesture appears to be prompted \n     more from a desire to protect his family than from a change \n     of heart.\n       This new regional organization, which calls itself al-Qaeda \n     in the Arabian Peninsula, is indicative of al-Wahayshi's \n     growing ambition. Throughout the first two years of his \n     leadership, he worked hard to create a durable infrastructure \n     that could survive the loss of key commanders. His success in \n     this regard is demonstrated by the fact that even though the \n     organization lost a particularly skilled local commander, \n     Hamza al-Quayti, in a shootout with Yemeni security forces in \n     August 2008, it was still able to launch an attack on the \n     U.S. embassy just one month later. Al-Wahayshi is now looking \n     to use the undergoverned regions of Yemen as a staging ground \n     for attacks not only in Yemen but also throughout the Arabian \n     peninsula and the Horn of Africa.\n\n\n                            Lessons Learned\n\n       Al-Qaeda's resurgence in Yemen does not stem from \n     displacement of U.S. successes elsewhere. Rather, the United \n     States and its allies need to understand that defeating one \n     generation of al-Qaeda does not eliminate the threat \n     completely. In conjunction with Yemen and Gulf Cooperation \n     Council allies, Washington must develop a two-track strategy \n     to eliminate al-Qaeda in Yemen. In the short term, the United \n     States must discretely partner with Yemen and Saudi Arabia \n     once again and target al-Qaeda's leadership and \n     infrastructure. Although successfully doing so will be much \n     harder the second time around, it can be accomplished with \n     careful and coordinated strikes.\n       The long-term approach, however, is both more important and \n     more difficult to implement. The current incarnation of al-\n     Qaeda in\n\n[[Page S8860]]\n\n     Yemen has more recruits--and younger recruits--than ever, due \n     to al-Wahayshi's powerful propaganda as well as the lack of \n     opportunity and an incipient breakdown in traditional social \n     authorities. Furthermore, Yemen is preoccupied, and its \n     security services overtaxed with the increasingly violent \n     calls for secession from the south, threats of renewed \n     fighting in the north, and, most importantly, a faltering \n     economy that makes traditional modes of patronage-style \n     governance nearly impossible. The United States and Yemen are \n     also facing an al-Qaeda group that is now more accepted as a \n     legitimate organization. Killing or arresting al-Qaeda \n     leaders in Yemen and dismantling its infrastructure will be \n     an important step forward, but will unlikely eliminate the \n     problem in the long term. Tackling the underlying issues, \n     although very difficult, will be key to ensuring that al-\n     Qaeda does not reemerge in Yemen once again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8860-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    COMMENDING SENATOR NORM COLEMAN\n\n  Mr. ENZI.

He is quite a remarkable \nindividual, and I know I am going to miss seeing him on the Senate \nfloor and working with him on issues of concern to the people of \nMinnesota and my constituents in Wyoming.\n  Ever since Norm's political career began, it was clear he had a mind \nof his own and, like the old adage about baseball umpires, he was going \nto call them as he saw them. That meant taking each issue as it came, \ncarefully studying what was proposed and its consequences, and then \nmaking up his own mind on how he thought he should vote.\n  His independent streak and his determination to be true to his \nprinciples, his commitment to the people of Minnesota, and his internal \ncompass transcended party politics and kept both sides guessing as to \nhow he would vote on any given issue.\n  I remember the first time I met him, shortly after his election to \nthe Senate. It turned out we had some things in common. For starters, \nearly on in our political careers, Norm and I both served as mayors, so \nwe had an appreciation for the demands that are made upon local \nofficials.\n  Norm was elected mayor of St. Paul. I was elected mayor in my \nhometown of Gillette, WY. We both had some tough challenges to deal \nwith as our communities felt the aches and pains of growth and we were \nfortunate enough to put together a good team who helped us to deal with \nthe needs of the people who were counting on us to solve some pretty \nvexing problems.\n  Looking back, Norm was able to compile quite a record and he became a \nvery popular mayor. His administration promoted policies that helped to \nspur an increase in the number of jobs in the St. Paul area. He also \nhelped to oversee a downtown revitalization that came at a time when \nmany other similar areas across the country were downsizing and \nbecoming a shadow of their former selves. He also managed to help \nengineer the return of professional hockey to Minnesota. The presence \nof the Minnesota Wild soon became a source of great pride to the people \nof his State. He was able to do all of that and so much more without \nincreasing property taxes. That was the result of careful planning, and \nit understandably earned him the respect and admiration of his \nconstituents.\n  Then, with a key election approaching, Norm was giving some thought \nto his political future. There were a lot of rumors as to his next run \nfor office, but the people of Minnesota made it clear that they wanted \nhim to run for the Senate, so Norm began what was to become a very \ndifficult and emotionally charged race. When it was all over, Norm \nColeman had defeated a Minnesota political icon and was sworn in to \nrepresent the people of his home State in the Senate.\n  Ever since that day, Norm has been working to serve the people of \nMinnesota and do whatever was in their best interests. Always focused \non getting results, he supported the President when he agreed with him, \nand he never hesitated to speak up when he felt there was another way \nto get things done that ought to be taken up as part of the mix.\n  Of all his accomplishments during his service here in the Senate, \nthere are two that I will always remember. The first was a factfinding \nmission we took along with several of our colleagues to Africa to \ndetermine what we could do as a nation to help combat the AIDS epidemic \nthere. For both of us our visit turned out to be a great cultural \nshock. There were barriers of all kinds we had to deal with--language, \ncustoms, and technology. All of the things we take for granted here are \nvirtually nonexistent there. The lack of any regular distribution of \nthe written word, like a community newspaper, makes getting the most \nbasic of information to the people an incredible challenge.\n  When we returned to the United States we joined with our colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to develop a program that has been producing \ntremendous results for the past few years. The great strides that have \nbeen made have not eliminated the disease, but they have greatly \nincreased the quality of life there. Our efforts have also helped to \nmake people more aware of what they can do to ensure they don't get \nAIDS, or if they are already infected, what they must do to avoid \ntransmitting the disease to anyone else.\n  We both learned from that experience the truth of the old adage--you \nmay not be able to save the whole world, but you can always make a good \neffort to save part of it, and the results we have achieved in Africa \nand the lives we have saved will be part of Norm Coleman's legacy of \nservice in the Senate.\n  Another part of the change he brought that will be felt for many \nyears to come is the leadership he showed as the chairman of the \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations. In 2006, Norm led the effort to determine how safe and \nsecure our Nation's ports were. The results of his investigations were \nunsettling and soon became the subject of headlines across the country.\n  Norm wasn't looking for headlines, however. He was looking to craft a \nworkable solution to the problem, and he did when the Senate approved a \nprogram that authorized the use of pilot technology to screen incoming \ncargo containers for their contents. As a result of his efforts, people \nall across the country will be better protected from those who might \nwish to do us harm. Thanks to Norm, that once open door has now been \nclosed.\n  Norm will not be a part of this current Congress, but his impact will \ncontinue to be felt for some time to come. He was a tireless worker for \nMinnesota, and although I don't know what the future holds for him, I \nhave every confidence that we haven't heard the last of Norm Coleman. \nHe has been and will always be an individual of vision and action. That \nis a combination that can't help but produce results, and I am certain \nhe will continue to set new goals in his life and achieve them--one \nafter the other. Good luck, my friend, and keep in touch. We will \nalways be interested to hear from you and to benefit from your take on \nour work in the Congress to make Minnesota and the rest of the Nation a \nbetter place for us all to live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8860-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8860-S8861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF CAMP RAINBOW GOLD\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize a program in my \nhome State of Idaho that provides an outstanding service to many who \nare greatly challenged in a battle for life. Twenty-five years ago this \nsummer, Dr. David McClusky planted the seeds of a dream he had nurtured \nfor many years: opening a camp for kids with cancer in the mountains of \nIdaho.\n  Armed with a grant, a group of committed volunteers and the support \nof the American Cancer Society, 15 campers with cancer kicked off the \nfirst of 25 years of very special summers. This new retreat was called \nCamp Rainbow Gold.\n  The camp provided an opportunity for these kids to swim, ride horses, \nfish, hike, paint, bike, eat and laugh. They developed deep bonds with \none another as they fought a disease that knows no bounds in the lives \nit ravages. This one week allowed them an opportunity to escape from \nthe daily emotional and physical battle with an insidious disease.\n  Today, Camp Rainbow Gold continues to provide that week-long respite \nfrom the ever-present cancer fight\n\n[[Page S8861]]\n\nand allows these kids to enjoy a beautiful setting with others just \nlike them.\n  This very week 85 children are in the mountains of Idaho at Camp \nRainbow Gold. With an army of volunteers, Dr. McClusky is watching his \ndream flourish. The kids still attend free of charge. A full medical \nstaff and a licensed social worker volunteer their time to provide \nmedical and emotional support to the children.\n  As the camp grew, so did the vision to meet not only the needs of the \nkids with cancer, but their siblings and parents as well. Dr. \nMcClusky's original vision has grown into two more camps: one for \nsiblings and one for families. These camps provide a much-needed break \nfrom the demands of the intensive care required for a child with \ncancer.\n  Throughout the year, special outings are held to strengthen the bonds \nof friendships developed at camp and to continue the emotional support \namong families. In addition, a junior counselor program has been \ncreated to allow former campers who have turned 18 to continue their \nparticipation at Camp Rainbow Gold. They now offer their support and \nencouragement to kids who are in the same fight they, too, have fought. \nCampers and junior counselors are also eligible for college \nscholarships to help them fulfill their dreams.\n  It is, indeed, an honor for me to give recognition to Dr. David \nMcClusky for his vision and many years of work in creating and \nsustaining Camp Rainbow Gold. I extend this recognition to the more \nthan 200 volunteers from around Idaho who support the Camp Rainbow Gold \nprograms; to the American Cancer Society for their backing and \nadministrative support; and to the thousands of Idahoans and many \nothers who provide the funds to make all of this a reality.\n  Congratulations, Camp Rainbow Gold, on this 25th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8861-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONGRESSMAN JOHN McHUGH\n\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND.

Agawam has an exceptional history as one of \nthe Nation's oldest summer camps.\n  Founded in 1919, Agawam was owned and operated continuously by the \nMason family until 1985. Throughout its history, Camp Agawam has \nprovided a unique and exciting summer camp program for boys from Maine \nand from across the country. The talented staff and counselors at \nAgawam continue to carry on the Mason family's vision of providing a \nsafe, positive environment for boys to make lifelong friends and foster \nskills through outdoor recreation and activities.\n  Agawam has made significant contributions to youth in Maine's local \ncommunities. Strongly supported by camp alumni and parents, the camp's \nMaine Idea program highlights the impressive commitment by Agawam to \nprovide free campership opportunities to Maine boys. This is truly a \nmeaningful investment in Maine's most precious resource--our children.\n  I congratulate and commend Agawam's talented staff, counselors, \ncouncil members, camp alumni, parents, and campers on a remarkable 90 \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8861-3", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8861-S8862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    98TH BIRTHDAY OF KAPPA ALPHA PSI\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, this year we are celebrating the \n98th birthday of Kappa Alpha Psi Fraternity Incorporated. This week, \nthousands of members and guests from all over the world have come to \nWashington, DC, to participate in a week-long program of forums and \nseminars with a focus on leadership, brotherhood and service, known as \nthe 79th Grand Chapter Meeting. The theme of this week's celebration is \n``A Call to Service: The Journey Home Continues.''\n  The week's events commenced with a public meeting where members from \nthe nine African-American Greek fraternities and sororities will gather \nin the spirit of unity. In addition, during this gathering, I was \nhonored that Kappa Alpha Psi bestowed upon me their prestigious \nHumanitarian Award. This particular award is the highest honor awarded \nto an individual that is not a member of the organization. I am excited \nto be joining the ranks of previous honorees including: Congresswoman \nMaxine Waters; Mrs. Lyndon Baines ``Lady Bird'' Johnson; Mr. Harry \nBelafonte; Mrs. Rosa Parks; and Drs. Bill and Camille Cosby, just to \nname a few.\n  I also would like to take this opportunity to commend Attorney Dwayne \nMurray. Dwayne currently serves as the 31st Grand Polemarch of Kappa \nAlpha Psi Fraternity, Incorporated, and is a resident of the great \nState of Louisiana. Under Dwayne's extraordinary leadership, the \norganization has initiated several community service projects, \nincluding ``Sunday of Hope.'' Through this effort, Kappa Alpha Psi has \nraised well over $500,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital \nduring the past 2 years. In addition, Dwayne has also spearheaded the \n``Greeks Learning to Avoid Debt''--GLAD--Program throughout the Nation. \nThis program will ensure that college students receive the necessary \ntraining to use credit wisely and remain financially stable through \ncollege and beyond. His administration is committed to the theme of \n``One Kappa, Creating Inspiration: A Call to Service''.\n  Kappa Alpha Psi was founded on January 5, 1911, on the campus of \nIndiana University in Bloomington, IN. Led by the vision of Elder \nWatson Diggs, it was founded by 10 God-fearing, serious-minded young \nmen who possessed the imagination, ambition, courage, and determination \nto defy custom in pursuit of college educations and careers during an \noppressive time in American history for African Americans.\n  Now, the membership has grown to more than 360 undergraduate chapters \nand 347 alumni chapters located throughout the United States and five \nforeign countries. Today, the fraternity boasts a membership of more \nthan 150,000 college-trained young men. Among the famous Kappas are \nWilt Chamberlain, Adrian Fenty, Cedric ``The Entertainer'' Kyles, and \nTavis Smiley; and Members of the House of Representatives include \nSanford Bishop of Georgia, William Clay of Missouri, John Conyers of \nMichigan, Alcee Hastings of Florida and Bennie Thompson of Mississippi. \nAdditionally, there are many more prominent and influential men across \nAmerica that represent the Kappa Alpha Psi brotherhood. Furthermore, \nboth current and former members of my staff are proud to be members of \nthis noble and prestigious fraternity: my former legislative director \nBen Cannon, former regional manager Terrence Lockett, and my current \ncapital regional manager Jason Wynne Hughes.\n  Kappa Alpha Psi has been an instrumental group in raising the profile \nof African-American men and has worked tirelessly to knock down \nbarriers to advancement in our society. The brotherhood has \nconsistently encouraged achievement in every field of human endeavor.\n\n[[Page S8862]]\n\n  Members remain active for their whole lives and are encouraged to \ncontribute to their communities. Each chapter has its own community \nservice focus. The Baton Rouge Alumni Chapter, for example, raises \nmoney through its annual Walter Banks Golf Classic for scholarships for \nhigh school seniors and also sponsors several kids to attend Kappa \nKamp--a rigorous leadership institute for elementary and middle school \naged young men. Chapters all over Louisiana are similarly committed to \ntheir communities.\n  In the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita in 2005, Kappas from \nall over the country came to the aid of hurricane survivors along the \ngulf coast and helped with our recovery effort.\n  It is with great pride that we welcome all members of Kappa Alpha Psi \nto our Nation's Capital as they kick off the countdown to their \ncentennial celebration in 2011.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8862-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING JOEL PIERCE SMITH\n\n Mr. SHELBY. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to my \ngood friend Joel Pierce Smith, Sr. He was a personal friend who passed \naway on July 30, 2009, and, along with his family, I mourn his passing.\n  Joel was born on February 13, 1929, in Samson, AL. After graduating \nfrom Florida State University, he went to work at the Birmingham News-\nPost Herald in 1953. This would mark the start of a newspaper career \nthat would span five decades. Following his work in Birmingham, Joel \nserved as the editor of the the Geneva Reaper for 3 years.\n  In 1958, Joel moved to Eufaula, AL, and was named editor of the \nEufaula Tribune. A year later, he was named publisher. An avid \njournalist, Joel also edited and published the Cuthbert Times and News \nRecord of Cuthbert, GA. In 1999, Joel handed over the editorial reins \nof the Eufaula Tribune to his son Jack, though he continued to write \nhis weekly personal column, Candid Comments, until 2006. All told, Joel \nwrote Candid Comments for 51 years, never missing a week. He truly was \nan extraordinary newspaperman and, as such, garnered numerous state and \nnational awards. These awards recognized both the quality of his work \nand his leadership in his community and amongst his peers. Among his \nhonors were the Alabama Press Association's Community Service Award, \nGeneral Excellence Award, and the Lifetime Achievement Award.\n  Joel was active in both the Alabama Press Association and the \nNational Newspaper Association throughout his career. He served as \npresident for both the Alabama Press Association and the Alabama \nJournalism Foundation and he held a seat on the board of directors for \nthe Alabama Press Association and the Georgia Press Association. \nAdditionally, Joel served as the Alabama State Chairman of the National \nNewspaper Association for many years, chairing the latter's 1992 \nGovernmental Affairs Conference in Washington, DC.\n  Throughout his distinguished career, Joel remained an active voice \nfor progressive change in Eufaula. Among other things, he encouraged \nthe reorganization of the Chamber of Commerce, promoted tourism in the \narea, and crusaded for the preservation of Eufaula's architectural \nheritage. He served on the board of trustees at Birmingham-Southern \nCollege for more than 25 years, where he became life trustee, and at \nAndrew College in Cuthbert, GA. Joel served on the Board of Education \nof the city of Eufaula and as a trustee at the Lakeside School. His \ngood work was not overlooked in the community and he was honored as the \nEufaula Kiwanis Club's Citizen of the Year in 2002 and received the \nAlabama Historical Commission's Distinguished Service Award.\n  Joel is loved and will be missed by his wife Ann Sutton Smith and his \nthree sons, Joel Pierce Smith, Jr., Abb Jackson Smith II, and William \nSutton Smith. Joel was an inspiration to many and will be remembered as \nan outstanding husband, father, editor, publisher, friend, and \ncommunity leader.\n  I ask the entire Senate to join me in recognizing and honoring the \nlife of my friend, Joel Pierce Smith.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8862-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING CARLISA BAYNE\n\n Mr. THUNE.

A bill to amend chapter 171 of title 28, United States Code, \n(commonly referred to as the Federal Torts Claims Act) to extend \nmedical malpractice coverage to free clinics and the officers, \ngoverning board members, employees, and contractors of free clinics in \nthe same manner and extend as certain Federal officers and employees; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nclarify the application of the Federal Tort Claims Act and how it \napplies to free medical clinics. In my home State of Vermont, free \nclinics provide important health care, and in these tough economic \ntimes they provide an essential safety net for many people. Free \nclinics in Vermont and around the country are struggling to pay medical \nmalpractice insurance premiums, due to an ambiguity in the Federal law. \nCurrent law provides for physicians who volunteer in free clinics to \nreceive medical malpractice coverage under the Federal Torts Claims \nAct, FTCA, but it is unclear whether other professionals serving the \ncommunity in free clinics are also covered. Existing Federal law \nexplicitly provides more comprehensive FTCA coverage to community \nhealth centers, including coverage for their boards, employees, \ncontractors and officers. But free clinics currently must purchase \nmalpractice insurance for their board members, employees, contractors \nand officers. Purchasing this coverage diverts thousands of dollars \nannually from each of the free clinics in the country. These are funds \nthat could be directed to providing necessary healthcare to the \nuninsured. This is especially true in States like Vermont, where free \nclinics make a significant impact serving those in rural areas. \nAdditionally, by removing this financial burden for free clinics, the \nimpact of organizations like Volunteers in Medicine, which assists in \nsetting up and staffing free clinics, will be that much greater. In \nclarifying current law, and at minimal expense to the Federal \nGovernment, we can increase the effectiveness of free clinics that \nserve and care for so many Americans.\n  This legislation would make it clear that FTCA coverage should be the \nsame for community health centers and free clinics. Both of these \ninstitutions deserve our help and play a fundamental role in our \ncommunities. It is my understanding that this clarification would not \ndramatically raise medical malpractice defense costs of the Federal \nGovernment because free clinics do not perform high risk procedures \nlike surgeries or births. I urge my fellow Senators to join me in \nsupporting the important work that free clinics provide our \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S8867]]\n\n                                S. 1578\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Occupational Safety and Health Act of \n1970 to expand coverage under the Act, to increase protections for \nwhistleblowers, to increase penalties for certain violators, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the \nProtecting America's Workers Act. Almost 40 years ago, Congress set out \nto guarantee a safe workplace for all Americans. The Occupational \nSafety and Health Act of 1970 was landmark legislation that has \ndramatically improved the well-being of working men and women.\n  Since then, the annual job fatality rate has dropped from 18 deaths \nper 100,000 workers to less than four. Thousands of lives have been \nsaved each year. These are not abstract numbers--they represent \nthousands of families who have been spared the pain and heartache of \nlosing a loved one on the job.\n  We are enormously proud of the progress we have made, but we also \nknow that too many workers continue to face needless dangers in the \nworkplace. In 2007, almost 5,500 workers were killed on the job and 4 \nmillion other workers became ill or were injured. Fifteen workers still \ndie on the job every day, and nearly 11,000 who are injured or become \nill because of dangerous conditions.\n  We now have strong partners in the White House and at the Department \nof Labor who are committed to making our workplaces safer. But they \nneed action by Congress as well. That is why today we are reintroducing \nthe Protecting America's Workers Act, to take concrete steps to address \nmany of the failures of the existing law.\n  First, this legislation expands the coverage of the current job \nsafety laws to protect the millions of public employees and \ntransportation workers who are not covered by these laws. In \nMassachusetts alone, 350,000 public sector workers lack the protections \ngranted by the federal workplace safety law.\n  Our bill also protects workers who speak up about unsafe conditions \non the job, by updating OSHA's whistleblower provisions. OSHA \ninspectors can't be in every workplace, every day. We must rely on \nworkers who have the courage to come forward when they know their \nemployer is cutting corners on safety. This legislation makes good on \nthe promise to stand by those workers and guarantee they don't have to \nsacrifice their jobs in order to do the right thing.\n  In addition, the legislation gives workers and their families and \nrepresentatives a seat at the table on safety issues. It includes \nsensible reforms to ensure that victims and their families have a right \nto talk to OSHA before a citation issues, to obtain copies of important \ndocuments, to be informed about their rights, and to have their voices \nheard before OSHA accepts a settlement that lets an employer off the \nhook for endangering workers.\n  Finally, a critical element of this bill is the increase in penalties \non employers who turn their backs on the safety of their workers. Too \nmany employers in our country blatantly ignore the law, and too often \nthey are not held accountable. They pay only minimal fines, which they \ntreat as just another cost of doing business.\n  Last year, my office issued a report that showed that the median \npenalty for a workplace fatality was only $3,675. In other words, in \ncases investigated by OSHA where workers were killed on the job, half \nof all employers were fined $3,675 or less. Workers' lives are \nobviously worth far more than that. We know this administration will do \nbetter, but it needs our help.\n  The bill makes reasonable increases in civil penalties--especially in \nthe most serious cases. It also creates a strong criminal penalty, \nincluding the possibility of felony charges and significant prison \nterms. These changes will create the deterrence we need so that \nemployers will think twice before they gamble with workers' lives to \nsave a few dollars. We need to send a strong message that it is \nunacceptable to treat workers as expendable or disposable.\n  Earlier this year a brave young woman, Tammy Miser, testified before \nour Labor Committee about her brother Shawn, who was killed in an \nexplosion at the Hayes Lemmerz manufacturing plant in Huntington, \nIndiana in 2003. We can't bring Shawn back and we can't ease Tammy's \npain at the loss of her beloved brother. But we can stand with her as \nshe pursues her life's work since then of speaking out for the right of \nevery worker to come home safely at the end of the day. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in honoring the millions of hardworking Americans \nwho deserve real protection by supporting the Protecting America's \nWorkers Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Snowe, \n        Mr. Akaka, Mr. Bingaman, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Brown, Mr. Burris, Ms. \n        Cantwell, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Casey, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Feingold, Mrs. Feinstein, Mr. Franken, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \n        Harkin, Mr. Inouye, Mr. Kerry, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Kohl, Mr. \n        Lautenberg, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Levin, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Menendez, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mr. Reed, Mr. Sanders, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mrs. Shaheen, Mr. Specter, Mr. Udall of Colorado, Mr. Udall of \n        New Mexico, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Wyden):\n  S. 1584. A bill to prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of \nsexual orientation or gender identity; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the Employment \nNon-Discrimination Act, a bill I introduced with Senators Susan \nCollins, Ted Kennedy, Olympia Snowe, and more than 30 others. This \nhistoric bill will prohibit employers from discriminating against those \nemployed or seeking employment, on the basis of their perceived or \nactual sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  Senator Kennedy has long been a champion for civil rights, and \nwithout his decades of leadership and determination, we would not have \nthe strong coalition of support we exhibit today with the introduction \nof ENDA.\n  I would also like to thank the Human Rights Campaign and the \nLeadership Conference on Civil Rights for their strong commitment to \nthis legislation.\n  Our country was founded on the principle of equal justice for all. It \nis that philosophy which has guided us through decades of progress. It \nis that philosophy which led to passage of the Civil Rights Act of \nl964. It was that act which paved the way for countless groundbreaking \nmoments, and I am certain this is one of them.\n\n[[Page S8868]]\n\n  Passage of the Civil Rights Act was a defining time in our history, \nthe result of generations of people willing to march and struggle for \nequality. Although we have made progress, we continue that fight today. \nWe continue that fight for those who have, for too long, been left out.\n  Let me be clear, discrimination on the basis of personal \ncharacteristics has no place in any workplace or in any State, and it \nis long overdue for Congress to extend American employees these \nprotections. Under ENDA, employment decisions will be based upon merit \nand performance, not prejudice.\n  This is not a new idea. In fact, many states have already confronted \nthis challenge. I am proud that Oregon has long been a leader on \nequality issues, and already offers protections to those discriminated \nagainst based on both sexual orientation and gender identity. But it \nwas not easy. It is never easy.\n  Martin Luther King, Jr. said, ``Human progress is neither automatic \nnor inevitable. Every step toward the goal of justice requires \nsacrifice, suffering, and struggle; the tireless exertions and \npassionate concern of dedicated individuals.''\n  For the first time in history, the Senate has before it a fully \ninclusive bill, extending employment protections to members of \ncommunities that have historically been left out. I am proud to be a \npart of this historic effort to ensure that no matter who you are, you \nhave the right to earn a living.\n  Corporate America is light years ahead. More than 85 percent of \nFortune 500 companies have implemented non-discrimination policies that \ninclude sexual orientation, and another third have policies that \ninclude gender identity.\n  Unfortunately, we are still faced with cases of employment \ndiscrimination that are entirely legal--a fact I find offensive and \ncontradictory to the founding principles of this great nation.\n  In 2000, Linda, an attorney, relocated to Virginia where her partner \nhad accepted a faculty position at a university. During her job search, \nLinda was invited for a second interview with a local law firm. During \nthe interview, Linda was asked why she was moving to Virginia, and she \nreplied that her spouse had taken a position at a local university.\n  The firm asked Linda to come back for a third interview, which \nincluded dinner with all the partners and their spouses to ``make sure \nthey all got along.'' At that point, Linda told one of the partners at \nthe firm that her spouse was a woman. It was not long before Linda was \ntold that the firm would not hire a lesbian and the invitation to the \nfinal interview was rescinded.\n  Thankfully, Linda spoke out, but there are still countless instances \nwhere victims of this type of discrimination remain silent.\n  By extending the protection of Title VII to those victimized purely \nbecause of who they are, we move one step closer to that fundamental \nprinciple of equal justice for every American.\n  I am proud that we are again taking a step toward progress. I hope my \ncolleagues will move swiftly to pass the Employment Non-Discrimination \nAct, which will ensure that every American receives equality under the \nlaw.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1584\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, the promise of America will never be \nfulfilled as long as justice is denied to any of our fellow citizens. \nWe have made remarkable progress in the long march towards equal \nopportunity and equal justice for all Americans, but this is no time \nfor complacency. Civil rights remains the unfinished business of \nAmerica. Millions of our people are still shut out of the American \ndream solely because of their sexual orientation or gender identity. \nThe Employment Non-Discrimination Act brings us closer to fulfilling \nthe promise of America for gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender \ncitizens, and I am proud to join Senators Merkley, Collins, and Snowe \ntoday in introducing this important legislation.\n  ENDA reflects the bedrock American principle that employees should be \njudged on the basis of job performance, not prejudice. It prohibits \nemployers from making decisions about hiring, firing, promotions, or \ncompensation based on sexual orientation or gender identity. It makes \nclear that there is no right to preferential treatment, and that quotas \nare prohibited.\n  While some states have taken this important step to guarantee fair \ntreatment in the workplace, ENDA is necessary to guarantee these rights \nfor all. It is unacceptable that in our country in 2009, it is legal \nanywhere to judge people on who they are, not what they can accomplish. \nThis legislation will right this historic wrong.\n  ENDA has broad, bipartisan support. It reflects non-discrimination \nprinciples already in place at some our country's largest employers. In \nthe past, this legislation has been endorsed by a broad religious \ncoalition, civil rights leaders, and distinguished Americans from both \nparties.\n  I am proud to join my colleagues today in bringing us one step closer \nto our ideal of a nation free from prejudice and injustice. I look \nforward to doing all I can to pass this important legislation, and I \nurge my colleagues to support us.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, our Nation has a proud history of diversity \nand a commitment to justice and equal rights for all Americans. The \npromise of equal rights is a foundational freedom of our democracy. \nToday we re-introduce important legislation to protect Americans from \ndiscrimination in the workplace. I am proud to again cosponsor the \nbipartisan Employment Non-Discrimination Act, and I thank Senators \nKennedy, Collins, and Merkley for their leadership and commitment to an \nissue that has practical significance in the daily lives of millions of \nour fellow Americans.\n  American workers should be evaluated on the basis of how they \nperform, not on irrelevant considerations, such as their race, gender, \ngender identity or sexual orientation. It is a question of fundamental \nfairness. In these difficult economic times, I can think of nothing \nmore fundamental than equality in the workplace.\n  The Employment Non-Discrimination Act would prohibit workplace \ndiscrimination by making it illegal to fire, refuse to hire, or refuse \nto promote employees simply based on a person's sexual orientation or \ngender identity. Currently, Federal law protects against employment \ndiscrimination on the basis of race, gender, religion, national origin \nor disability, but not sexual orientation or gender identity. It is \nlong overdue for Congress to extend these protections to American \nworkers.\n  Senator Kennedy introduced the Employment Non-Discrimination Act in \nprevious sessions of Congress, and with his leadership, it has \nconsistently maintained strong bipartisan support. Unfortunately, \npartisan politics have prevented passage of the measure. It goes \nagainst our country's basic values to fire someone based on who they \nare or what they look like, and we should not tolerate discrimination \nin the workplace. I hope that this year Congress will have the ability \nto finally\n\n[[Page S8871]]\n\npass this straightforward civil rights measure.\n  My home State of Vermont has played a constructive role in America's \njourney to build a more just society. Vermont added sexual orientation \nto the list of protected categories in its antidiscrimination in \nemployment law in 1992, and added gender identity protection in 2007. \nTwenty-one other States have also taken the lead to ban discrimination \non the basis of sexual orientation, with 13 of those States also \nbanning discrimination on the basis of gender identity. But it is clear \nthat more still deeds to be done. In 30 States, it remains legal to \nfire someone based on their sexual orientation and in 38 States, to do \nso based on gender identity. Americans' civil rights should be \nprotected no matter where they live, which is why I am proud to once \nagain cosponsor this bill, as I have every time it has been introduced \nin the Senate. I believe the passage of this legislation is long \noverdue and it is a step in the right direction toward creating \nequality in the workplace.\n  I urge my fellow Senators to come together to support this important, \nbipartisan bill without further delay.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN:\n  S. 1585. A bill to permit pass-through payment for reasonable costs \nof certified registered nurse anesthetist services in critical access \nhospitals notwithstanding the reclassification of such hospitals as \nurban hospitals, including hospitals located in ``Lugar counties'', and \nfor on-call and standby costs for such services; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, today I'm introducing the Rural Access to \nNurse Anesthesia Services Act to ensure patients in rural communities \ncan access the health care services they need. The bill would restore \nrural healthcare by making improvements to the Medicare Part A \nreasonable cost-based, pass-through program for nurse anesthesia \nservices in rural and critical access hospitals.\n  Throughout the Nation, 1,300 critical access hospitals provide \nessential health care services to the elderly and medically underserved \ncommunities in rural areas. In my State of Illinois, 51 Critical Access \nHospitals provide emergency, primary care, and surgery services \ndirectly to rural communities, covering over 60 percent of the counties \nin the State and reaching over 1 million rural residents.\n  For the majority of Critical Access Hospitals, Certified Registered \nNurse Anesthetists are the sole providers of anesthesia services. The \nnurse anesthetists make it possible for these hospitals to offer \nsurgical, obstetrical, trauma stabilization, interventional diagnostic \nand pain management capabilities.\n  Critical Access Hospitals depend on the work of nurse anesthetists to \ndeliver quality care, even while the hospitals are pressed for \nresources. Because of the limited availability of nurse anesthetists \nand fewer patients in their rural communities, Critical Access \nHospitals do not have anesthesia in the hospital 24/7. They rely on \nanesthesia and other surgery staff to be on call and available to the \nhospital within 15 minutes to cover emergency surgery procedures and \nobstetric services.\n  As an incentive to continue serving Medicare beneficiaries in rural \nareas, critical access hospitals were given permission to use \nreasonable, cost-based funding for anesthesia services performed by \nnurse anesthetists. However, recent changes in CMS policy have denied \nCritical Access Hospitals' claims for tens of thousands of dollars each \nin annual Medicare funding that they had come to rely on. In Illinois, \nCritical Access Hospitals lost $50,000-$100,000 per hospital.\n  These hospitals aren't just looking for a handout. Without being able \nto pay nurse anesthetists, the rural hospitals have to turn away \npatients whose procedures call for anesthesia. Patients have to travel \nto the next nearest hospital, which is a terrible option when dealing \nwith trauma stabilization, obstetrical care, or even pain management, \nparticularly for elderly patients.\n  In addition, despite previously reimbursing Critical Access Hospitals \nfor the costs of having a nurse anesthetist available or on call for \nemergency services, CMS recently began to deny payments for this \nservice. How is a hospital able to retain the few nurse anesthetists \nwho are available if they can't at least keep them on call?\n  The Rural Access to Nurse Anesthesia Services Act will enable \nhospitals to offer the highest quality of care and availability of \nservices to patients of Critical Access Hospitals. For decades, the \nMedicare Part A reasonable cost based pass-through program has \nsuccessfully and safely ensured the availability of anesthesia services \nfor Medicare patients in rural areas. Because of the program's success \nand impact, the Rural Access to Nurse Anesthesia Services Act is \nsupported by the American Association of Nurse Anesthetists and the \nAmerican Hospital Association. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this bill and work to protect anesthesia services for \npatients in rural communities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1585\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

and\n       Whereas volunteers engage in an annual national awareness \n     event held during the third week of September, making that \n     week an appropriate time to recognize National Polycystic \n     Kidney Disease Awareness Week: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the period beginning on September 13, 2009, \n     and ending on September 19, 2009, as ``National Polycystic \n     Kidney Disease Awareness Week'';\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of a national week to \n     raise public awareness and understanding of polycystic kidney \n     disease;\n       (3) recognizes the need for additional research into a cure \n     for polycystic kidney disease; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States and \n     interested groups--\n       (A) to support National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness \n     Week through appropriate ceremonies and activities;\n       (B) to promote public awareness of polycystic kidney \n     disease; and\n       (C) to foster understanding of the impact of the disease on \n     patients and their families.\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Hatch to \nsubmit a resolution to increase awareness of Polycystic Kidney Disease, \nPKD, a common and life threatening genetic illness.\n  Over 600,000 people have been diagnosed with PKD nationwide. There is \nno treatment or cure for this devastating disease. Families and friends \nstruggle to fight PKD and provide unwavering support to their suffering \nloved ones.\n  But there is hope. The PKD Foundation has led the fight for increased \nresearch and patient education. Recent studies have led to the \ndiscovery of the genes that cause PKD as well as promising clinical \ndrug trials for treatment. More needs to be done, however, and the \nGovernment wants to help.\n  In order to increase public awareness of this fatal disease, I \npropose that September 13th through the 19th be designated as National \nPolycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week. This week coincides with the \nannual walk for PKD which takes place every September. In Wisconsin, \nwhere over 10,000 patients are living with the disease, residents \ngather across the State to take part in this very special walk.\n  Increasing awareness will help all those affected by Polycystic \nKidney Disease, and I hope my colleagues will support this important \nresolution.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I am pleased to submit, along with my \ncolleague, Senator Herb Kohl, a resolution to designate the week of \nSeptember 13-19, 2009 as National Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness \nWeek.\n  Polycystic kidney disease, or PKD, is a life-threatening, genetic \ndisease of which most Americans are probably unaware. According to the \nPKD Foundation, PKD affects 600,000 Americans and 12.5 million children \nand adults worldwide. There is no treatment or cure, but it is our hope \nthat, with this resolution, a National PKD Awareness Week will promote \npublic awareness and education of this devastating disease.\n  PKD is one of the four leading causes of kidney failure, which also \ncalled end-stage renal disease, ESRD, PKD is characterized by the \ngrowth of numerous fluid-filled cysts in the kidney, which slowly \nreduce the kidney function and can eventually lead to kidney failure. \nSome cysts in individuals with PKD have reportedly grown to the size of \na football. When PKD causes kidneys to fail, the patient requires \ndialysis or kidney transplantation. About one-half of people with the \nmajor type of PKD progress to kidney failure.\n  PKD is of particular interest to me because so many Utahns suffer \nfrom this disease. The PKD Foundation claims that approximately 5,000 \nindividuals in Utah live with PKD, and that the incidence of end-stage \nrenal disease in Utah is three times that of the national average. To \ncure PKD could result in billions of dollars in savings to the \nmilitary, Medicare, Medicaid and the Veterans Administration for \ndialysis, transplantation and related treatments.\n  To promote greater understanding of this destructive genetic disease, \nSenator Kohl and I have introduced this resolution to designate a \nNational Polycystic Kidney Disease Awareness Week, and I urge our \ncolleagues to support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8872-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8872-S8873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 242--SUPPORTING THE GOALS AND IDEALS OF ``NATIONAL \n                            AEROSPACE DAY''\n\n  Mr. VOINOVICH (for himself and Mr. Nelson of Florida) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation:\n\n                              S.

Res. 244\n\n       Whereas September 3, 2009, will mark the 45th anniversary \n     of the date of enactment of the Wilderness Act (16 U.S.C. \n     1131 et seq.), which gave to the people of the United States \n     the National Wilderness Preservation System, an enduring \n     resource of natural heritage;\n       Whereas great writers of the United States, including Ralph \n     Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Willa Cather, George \n     Perkins Marsh, Mary Hunter Austin, and John Muir, poets such \n     as William Cullen Bryant, and painters such as Thomas Cole, \n     Frederic Church, Frederic Remington, Georgia O'Keefe, Albert \n     Bierstadt, and Thomas Moran, have defined the distinct \n     cultural value of wild nature and unique concept of \n     wilderness in the United States;\n       Whereas national leaders, such as former President Theodore \n     Roosevelt, reveled in outdoor pursuits and diligently sought \n     to preserve opportunities to mold individual character, to \n     shape the destiny of the Nation, to strive for balance, and \n     to ensure the wisest use of natural resources, so as to \n     provide the greatest good for the greatest number of people \n     as possible;\n       Whereas luminaries in the conservation movement, such as \n     scientist Aldo Leopold, forester Bob Marshall, writer Howard \n     Zahniser, teacher Sigurd Olson, biologists Olaus, Adolph, and \n     Mardy Murie, and conservationists David Brower and Marjory \n     Stoneman Douglas, believed that the people of the United \n     States could protect and preserve the wilderness in order for \n     the wilderness to last well into the future;\n       Whereas Senator Hubert H. Humphrey, a Democrat from \n     Minnesota, and Representative John Saylor, a Republican from \n     Pennsylvania, originally introduced the Wilderness Act with \n     strong bipartisan support in both houses of Congress;\n       Whereas, with the help of colleagues (including cosponsors \n     Senators Clinton P. Anderson, Gaylord Nelson, William \n     Proxmire, and Henry ``Scoop'' M. Jackson, and the Senate \n     floor manager, Senator Frank Church) and conservation allies \n     (such as Secretary of Interior Stewart L. Udall and \n     Representative Morris K.

Byrd, Senator Daniel Inouye, and \n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy;\n       Whereas President John F. Kennedy, who took office in 1961 \n     with an agenda that included a plan to enact wilderness \n     legislation, was assassinated before he could sign into law a \n     bill concerning the wilderness;\n       Whereas 4 wilderness champions, Aldo Leopold, Olaus Murie, \n     Bob Marshall, and Howard Zahniser also passed away before \n     witnessing passage of a wilderness bill;\n       Whereas President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the \n     Wilderness Act in the Rose Garden on September 3, 1964, \n     establishing a system of wilderness heritage, as President \n     Kennedy and the conservation community had envisioned and \n     advocated for ardently;\n       Whereas, in 2009, as a consequence of popular support, the \n     people of the United States continue to have a system that \n     protects wilderness for the permanent good of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, over the 45 years since the enactment of the \n     Wilderness Act, various Presidents of both parties, leaders \n     of Congress, and experts in the land management agencies \n     within the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture have \n     expanded the system of wilderness protection;\n       Whereas the Wilderness Act instituted an unambiguous \n     national policy to recognize the natural heritage of the \n     United States as a valuable resource and to protect the \n     wilderness for future generations to use and enjoy;\n       Whereas wilderness offers numerous values for an \n     increasingly diverse populace, allowing youth and adults from \n     urban and rural communities to experience nature and explore \n     opportunities for healthy recreation;\n       Whereas wilderness provides intact, healthy, and \n     biologically diverse ecosystems that will better withstand \n     the effects of global warming and help communities in the \n     United States adapt to a changing climate;\n       Whereas wilderness provides billions of dollars of \n     ecosystem services in the form of safe drinking water, clean \n     air, and recreational opportunities;\n       Whereas 44 of the 50 States have protected wilderness \n     areas;\n       Whereas the abundance of natural heritage of the United \n     States is seen from Alaska to Florida, from Fire Island in \n     the Long Island South Shore of New York and West Sister \n     Island of Lake Erie in Ohio, to larger areas such as the \n     Mojave National Preserve in California and the River of No \n     Return in Idaho; and\n       Whereas President Gerald R.

(a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) sudden loss in late 2008 of export-market based demand \n     equivalent to about 3 percent of domestic milk production has \n     thrown the U.S. dairy industry into a critical supply-demand \n     imbalance;\n       (2) an abrupt decline in U.S. exports was fueled by the \n     onset of the global economic crisis combined with resurgence \n     of milk supplies in Oceania;\n       (3) the U.S. average all-milk price reported by the \n     National Agriculture Statistics Service from January through \n     May of 2009, has averaged $4.80 per hundredweight below the \n     cost of production;\n       (4) approximately $3,900,000,000 in dairy producer equity \n     has been lost since January;\n       (5) anecdotal evidence suggests that U.S. dairy producers \n     are losing upwards of $100 per cow per month;\n       (6) the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 extended \n     the counter-cyclical Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) support \n     program and instituted a `feed cost adjuster' to augment that \n     support;\n       (7) the Secretary of Agriculture in March transferred \n     approximately 200,000,000 pounds of nonfat dry milk to USDA's \n     Food and Nutrition Service in a move designed to remove \n     inventory from the market and support low-income families;\n       (8) the Secretary on March 22nd reactivated USDA's Dairy \n     Export Incentive Program (DEIP) to help U.S. producers meet \n     prevailing world prices and develop international markets;\n       (9) the Secretary announced on July 31, 2009 a temporary \n     increase in the amount paid for dairy products through the \n     Dairy Product Price Support Program (DPPSP), an adjustment \n     that is projected to increase dairy farmers' revenue by \n     $243,000,000; and\n       (10) U.S. dairy producers face unprecedented challenges \n     that threaten the stability of the industry, the nation's \n     milk production infrastructure, and thousands of rural \n     communities.\n       (b) The Senate states that the Secretary of Agriculture and \n     the President's Office of Management and Budget should \n     continue to closely monitor the U.S. dairy sector and use all \n     available discretionary authority to ensure its long-term \n     health and sustainability.\n       Sec. 752. (a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Agriculture, may conduct a \n     study on the labeling of personal care products regulated by \n     the Food and Drug Administration for which organic content \n     claims are made. Any such study shall include--\n       (1) a survey of personal care products for which the word \n     ``organic'' appears on the label; and\n       (2) a determination, based on statistical sampling of the \n     products identified under paragraph (1), of the accuracy of \n     such claims.\n       (b) If the Commissioner of Food and Drugs conducts a study \n     described in subsection (a), such Commissioner shall--\n       (1) not later than 270 days after the date of enactment of \n     this Act, submit to the Committees on Agriculture, Nutrition, \n     and Forestry, Appropriations, and Health, Education, Labor, \n     and Pensions in the Senate and the Committees on Agriculture, \n     Appropriations, and Energy and Commerce in the House of \n     Representatives a report on the findings of the study under \n     subsection (a); and\n       (2) provide such Committees with any recommendations on the \n     need to establish labeling standards for personal care \n     products for which organic content claims are made, including \n     whether the Food and Drug Administration should have pre-\n     market approval authority for personal care product labeling.\n       Sec. 753. (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) agriculture is a national security concern;\n       (2) the United States suffers from periodic disasters which \n     affects the food and fiber supply of the United States;\n       (3) the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008 (7 \n     U.S.C. 8701 et seq.) established 5 permanent disaster \n     programs to deliver timely and immediate assistance to \n     agricultural producers recovering from losses;\n       (4) as of the date of enactment of this Act, of those 5 \n     disaster programs--\n       (A) none are available, finalized, and implemented to \n     deliver urgently needed assistance for 2009 producer losses; \n     and\n       (B) only 1 is being implemented for 2008 losses;\n       (5) according to the Drought Monitor, the State of Texas is \n     suffering from extreme and exceptional drought conditions, \n     the highest level of severity; and\n       (6) the Secretary of Agriculture has previously authorized \n     various forms of disaster assistance by providing funding \n     under section 32 of the Act of August 24, 1935 (7 U.S.C. \n     612c), and through the Commodity Credit Corporation.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of \n     Agriculture should use all of the discretionary authority \n     available to the Secretary to make available immediate relief \n     and assistance for agricultural producers suffering losses as \n     a result of the 2009 droughts.\n       Sec. 754. (a) The Senate finds that--\n       (1) with livestock producers facing losses from harsh \n     weather in 2008 and continuing to face disasters in 2009, \n     Congress wanted to assist livestock producers in recovering \n     losses more quickly and efficiently than previous ad hoc \n     disaster assistance programs;\n       (2) on June 18, 2008, Congress established the livestock \n     indemnity program under section 531(c) of the Federal Crop \n     Insurance Act (7 U.S.C. 1531(c)) and section 901(c) of the \n     Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2497(c)) as a permanent disaster \n     assistance program to provide livestock producers with \n     payments of 75 percent of the fair market value for livestock \n     losses as a result of adverse weather such as floods, \n     blizzards, and extreme heat;\n       (3) on July 13, 2009, the Secretary of Agriculture \n     promulgated rules for the livestock indemnity program that \n     separated non adult beef animals into weight ranges of ``less \n     than 400 pounds'' and ``400 pounds and more''; and\n       (4) the ``400 pounds and more'' range would fall well short \n     of covering 75 percent market value payment for livestock in \n     these higher ranges that are close to market weight.\n       (b) It is the sense of the Senate that the Secretary of \n     Agriculture--\n       (1) should strive to establish a methodology to calculate \n     more specific payments to offset the cost of loss for each \n     animal as was intended by Congress for calendar years 2008 \n     through 2011; and\n       (2) should work with groups representing affected livestock \n     producers to come up with this more precise methodology.\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Agriculture, Rural \n     Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010''.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8887-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8887-S8888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            UNANIMOUS CONSENT AGREEMENT--EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

Humphrey, a Democrat from \n     Minnesota, and Representative John Saylor, a Republican from \n     Pennsylvania, originally introduced the Wilderness Act with \n     strong bipartisan support in both houses of Congress;\n       Whereas, with the help of colleagues (including cosponsors \n     Senators Clinton P. Anderson, Gaylord Nelson, William \n     Proxmire, and Henry ``Scoop'' M. Jackson, and the Senate \n     floor manager, Senator Frank Church) and conservation allies \n     (such as Secretary of Interior Stewart L. Udall and \n     Representative Morris K. Udall), Senator Humphrey and \n     Representative Saylor worked tirelessly for 8 years to secure \n     nearly unanimous passage of the legislation, with a vote of \n     78 to 12 in the Senate and 373 to 1 in the House of \n     Representatives;\n       Whereas critical support in the Senate for the Wilderness \n     Act came from 3 Senators who still serve in the Senate as of \n     2009: Senator Robert C. Byrd, Senator Daniel Inouye, and \n     Senator Edward M. Kennedy;\n       Whereas President John F. Kennedy, who took office in 1961 \n     with an agenda that included a plan to enact wilderness \n     legislation, was assassinated before he could sign into law a \n     bill concerning the wilderness;\n       Whereas 4 wilderness champions, Aldo Leopold, Olaus Murie, \n     Bob Marshall, and Howard Zahniser also passed away before \n     witnessing passage of a wilderness bill;\n       Whereas President Lyndon B. Johnson signed into law the \n     Wilderness Act in the Rose Garden on September 3, 1964, \n     establishing a system of wilderness heritage, as President \n     Kennedy and the conservation community had envisioned and \n     advocated for ardently;\n       Whereas, in 2009, as a consequence of popular support, the \n     people of the United States continue to have a system that \n     protects wilderness for the permanent good of the United \n     States;\n       Whereas, over the 45 years since the enactment of the \n     Wilderness Act, various Presidents of both parties, leaders \n     of Congress, and experts in the land management agencies \n     within the Departments of the Interior and Agriculture have \n     expanded the system of wilderness protection;\n       Whereas the Wilderness Act instituted an unambiguous \n     national policy to recognize the natural heritage of the \n     United States as a valuable resource and to protect the \n     wilderness for future generations to use and enjoy;\n       Whereas wilderness offers numerous values for an \n     increasingly diverse populace, allowing youth and adults from \n     urban and rural communities to experience nature and explore \n     opportunities for healthy recreation;\n       Whereas wilderness provides intact, healthy, and \n     biologically diverse ecosystems that will better withstand \n     the effects of global warming and help communities in the \n     United States adapt to a changing climate;\n       Whereas wilderness provides billions of dollars of \n     ecosystem services in the form of safe drinking water, clean \n     air, and recreational opportunities;\n       Whereas 44 of the 50 States have protected wilderness \n     areas;\n       Whereas the abundance of natural heritage of the United \n     States is seen from Alaska to Florida, from Fire Island in \n     the Long Island South Shore of New York and West Sister \n     Island of Lake Erie in Ohio, to larger areas such as the \n     Mojave National Preserve in California and the River of No \n     Return in Idaho; and\n       Whereas President Gerald R. Ford stated that the National \n     Wilderness Preservation System ``serves a basic need of all \n     Americans, even those who may never visit a wilderness area--\n     the preservation of a vital element in our heritage'' and \n     that ``wilderness preservation ensures that a central facet \n     of our Nation can still be realized, not just remembered'': \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 45th anniversary of the Wilderness Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 1131 et seq.);\n       (2) recognizes and commends the extraordinary work of the \n     individuals and organizations involved in building the \n     National Wilderness Preservation System; and\n       (3) is grateful for the wilderness, a tremendous asset the \n     United States continues to preserve as a gift to future \n     generations of the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/05/senate-section/article/S8890-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DISCHARGE AND REFERRAL--S. 1547\n\n  Mr. WARNER.
