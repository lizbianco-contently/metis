Mr. President, I was thinking this morning after the prayer \nand pledge how things in the Senate, because of tradition, rarely \nchange. But one of the things that has changed during the time I have \nbeen in the Senate is the Pledge of Allegiance. That wasn't done \nbefore. I don't know how many years ago the pledge was started, and it \ndoesn't matter who the leader of the Senate is, it is something I think \nwill be with us forever in the Senate. I think it is a good tradition \nwe picked up.\n  As I recall--my friend is on the Senate floor, the Republican \nleader--this was started during--was it Senator Frist or Dole? When was \nthat, do you recall? It was one of the Republican leaders.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the majority leader will yield, I think it was 8 or \n10 years ago. Interestingly enough, I believe who first suggested it \nwas former Senator Bob Smith of New Hampshire, and it was widely \nrecognized on both sides of the aisle that this is something we should \nhave been doing for a long time.\n  Mr. REID. When I was president of the senate in Nevada, that was \nsomething we always did. Of course, I remember Bob Smith. I think it \nwas a Republican leader, but, regardless, it is something that is a \npart of the tradition now, and I am glad we are doing it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9943-7", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9943-S9944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                SCHEDULE\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will be \nin morning business for 1 hour; Republicans will control the first 30 \nminutes and the majority will control the next 30 minutes. Following \nthat morning business, the Senate will proceed to the consideration of \nthe conference report to accompany H.R. 2918, the Legislative Branch \nappropriations bill and the continuing resolution, with the time until \n4:30 equally divided and controlled between Senators Nelson of Nebraska \nand Murkowski. Senators should expect a series of three rollcall votes. \nWe hope there could even be more than that, to begin about 4:30 this \nafternoon.\n  The Senate will recess from 12:30 until 2:15 to allow for our weekly \ncaucus luncheons.\n  I am sure Republican luncheons are packed with a lot of discussion. I \nknow I had a meeting earlier this morning with a number of Senators, \nand we have a lot to talk about. We have the health care bill. We have \nto talk about energy, which is something we need to do. Regulation \nreform, we are going to talk about that at our caucus. And we are going \nto spend a little bit of time on Afghanistan.\n  That brings us to the point that this afternoon there is going to be \na Members-only, classified briefing at 5:30 with GEN Jim Jones, the \nNational Security Adviser to the President. The issue of dealing with \nAfghanistan has heated up. That is going to be there--perhaps on this \nbill that is before us, if not shortly thereafter--as to what we are \ngoing to do on Afghanistan.\n\n[[Page S9944]]\n\n  Briefly, on health care, the committee is making progress. I am happy \nabout that. I would say that under the Republicans' plan, insurance \ncompanies can deny coverage for a preexisting condition, because you \nare getting older or because you are a woman. Under their plan, \ninsurance companies can take away your coverage when you need it the \nmost.\n  Under our plan, if you like what you have, you can keep it; but if \nyou don't, there will be affordable choices for you that cannot be \ntaken way. We will protect Medicare, will not raise taxes on the middle \nclass, and we are not going to add any money to the deficit.\n  Mr. President, I have been reminded to announce to the Senate--I \ntalked to the Republican leader about this last week--Columbus Day is \nfast approaching. It is the week after next. With all the things going \non here, it would not be right for us to take that week off.\n  What we are going to do, as I have explained to the Republican leader \nlast week, we will be off that Monday--which is the holiday, Columbus \nDay--and the following Friday. To make it as convenient as we can for \neveryone, on Tuesday we will be in session and have a vote late that \nafternoon. I know that is inconvenient for others because we had \nindicated there would be that recess.\n  It is a long period of time, as I have announced on the Senate floor, \n11 weeks from the time we started this work period until Thanksgiving. \nThat is a long time when a number of us have families at home, and the \nwork we want to try to do during the week rather than just on weekends. \nSo I apologize to everyone.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. If the majority leader will yield, which Tuesday was \nthe leader referring to?\n  Mr. REID. Tuesday after Columbus Day. It is October 13.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. We will be in. There would be a vote at what point on \nthat Tuesday?\n  Mr. REID. We will vote at 5, 5:30. OK?\n  As I have indicated, I apologize to everyone for not being able to \nhave that whole week off, but I think with health care, which is \nbeginning to firm up, it would not be right for us to be gone that \nweek. I think we should be able to start our health care work that week \nin the Senate.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Let me reiterate further for the Members on this side \nof the aisle, what the leader indicated is, the week that includes \nColumbus Day, which is on a Monday, we will have Monday and Friday of \nthat week off, and he has indicated the first vote will be on the \nTuesday after Columbus Day, late in the afternoon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9944-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            McCHRYSTAL PLAN\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the situation in Afghanistan is urgent, \nand we are told that action is necessary soon. But to better understand \nthe need for action, the American people need to know all the details. \nAnd they should have those details explained to them by the man who \nknows them best.\n  It is hard to deny the urgency of General McChrystal's assessment, \nparts of which have already been made public. And it is impossible to \nignore his depiction of a grave and deteriorating situation in the same \npart of the world where a group of terrorists plotted the 9/11 attacks. \nGeneral McChrystal's assessment of Afghanistan should worry all of us. \nAs the President told a Turkish audience in April, ``The world has come \ntoo far to let this region backslide, and to let al Qaeda terrorists \nplot further attacks.''\n  Earlier this year, President Obama expressed his confidence in \nGeneral McChrystal by appointing him to his current post. Following the \nPresident's lead, the Senate expressed its confidence in General \nMcChrystal by confirming him for his current mission without dissent. \nNow it is time for Congress to hear his detailed assessment of the \nmission that we confirmed him for, and to give him an opportunity to \nexplain why he has concluded that additional troops are needed to avert \nfailure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9944-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HEALTH CARE WEEK XI, DAY I\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Senators will continue to hash out a \nhealth care bill in committee today, and anyone who tunes in will hear \na dizzying amount of detail about what is in and what is out.\n  But it is worth noting that the basic shape of this legislation is \nalready clear: Any bill that makes it to the Senate floor will include \na heavy dose of tax hikes. Any bill that makes it to the floor will \ninclude massive cuts to Medicare. Any bill that makes it to the floor \nof the Senate will be about 1,000 pages long, cost about a trillion \ndollars, affect about one-sixth of the entire U.S. economy, and impact \nthe health care of every single American, whether they like it or not.\n  And here is the other thing we know: Democrats don't want to give the \nAmerican people the time they need to review all the details. We saw \nthis last week when they rejected a request for a simple 72-hour \nreview, which is hard for anyone who grasps the scope of this \nlegislation to understand. Nor would they pledge to wait until we \nunderstand the full cost of this bill, before acting on it.\n  There is important work going on in the Finance Committee this week, \nbut no one should lose sight of where the work is headed. What we know \nfor sure is higher taxes when American families and businesses are \nstruggling just to make ends meet, cuts to seniors' Medicare when the \nprogram is already going bankrupt, more spending and more debt when we \nare about to end the fiscal year just today with an annual deficit \nroughly equivalent to the deficits of the last 5 years combined--the \ndeficit this fiscal year, ending today, will be roughly as much as the \nlast 5 years combined--and a government intrusion into health care of \nevery single American at a time when Americans are asking us to lower \ncosts and lower premiums, not add new burdens to the system or wreck \nthe care they already have and like.\n  We know the essentials of the health care bill already. Americans \nhave every reason to be concerned.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9944-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9944]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I wonder, before the Republican leader leaves, if I \ncould ask him a quick question? I ask unanimous consent that Senators \nBarrasso, McCain, and Bennett, and the Republican leader, be permitted \nto engage in a colloquy during our 30 minutes and that I be notified \nwhen we have about 4 minutes left.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask the Senator from Kentucky, the Republican \nleader, is it not true that the Finance Committee Democrats voted down \na Republican proposal to put the health care reform bill on the \nInternet for 72 hours so Americans could read it?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would say to my friend from Tennessee that is \nabsolutely correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I believe the Republican leader said the bill might be \n2,000 pages long?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Certainly, well above 1,000 and probably 2,000.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I am not mistaken, there are several versions of \nthe bill in the House of Representatives that will come over here. Then \nthere is a version that we did in the Health Committee here that will \nhave to be integrated with that bill; is that not correct?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. It is my understanding it is the intention of the \nmajority leader and the administration to\n\n[[Page S9945]]\n\nmerge the bill that came out of the Health Committee on which the \nSenator from Tennessee serves and the bill that is in the Finance \nCommittee now.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It is my understanding in the Finance Committee they \nare not even writing a bill yet; they are just working on concepts?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Apparently, the Finance Committee will actually go to \na final vote on a concept paper, not an actual bill--which I think will \ninevitably produce a dilemma for the Congressional Budget Office in \ntrying to assess the cost of a concept bill. Then, apparently, they \nwill turn that into a bill, and then the Congressional Budget Office \nwill have to score, once again, the final bill, and the number there \nmay be different from the number of the concept paper.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. How long do you suppose it would take, once the two \nbills are put together, for the Congressional Budget Office to tell us \nhow much it costs?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would think for an accurate score we would have to \nask them. What a challenge that will be. But I assume it will take a \nwhile.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Well, I thank the Republican leader. In our discussion \ntoday, I see the Senator from Wyoming is here, it is almost \nembarrassing to say that--I mean, to people outside Washington, and \nmaybe even to people inside Washington, the idea that we would not take \n72 hours to read a 2,000-page bill that spends $1 trillion or $1.5 \ntrillion that affects virtually every American and that may have a lot \nof unresolved questions in it.\n  It is hard to imagine people would not think that was common sense, \nthat we ought to read it before we vote on it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I think we can add, the American people, I think \ncorrectly, could only assume there is some effort to try to hide the \ntrue impact of this rush effort to reorganize one-sixth of our economy, \na $1 trillion bill, well over 1,000 pages that nobody has taken the \ntime to read. It is not even produced in final bill language.\n  The American people begin to get the drift that this is a process \nthat is going to, I think, enrage them. It enrages them already. I \nthink the rage about it is only going to escalate in the coming weeks.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Republican leader for his time. I would \nthink every civics class in America, if the teacher would give a test, \nwould say: Should an elected representative read a bill before he or \nshe voted on it? Yes.\n  Should he or she know how much it costs? Yes.\n  Even the President has said we cannot have a deficit. Well, how are \nwe going to know if it creates a deficit if we do not read the bill and \nif the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has not told us how much \nit costs?\n  I thank the Republican leader. The Republican leader mentioned there \nmay be some questions we would want to know. There are some.\n  Governors across the country may want to know how much it is going to \ncost them and their budgets because, the other day, the chairman of the \nNational Governors Association and the Republican Governors Association \nheld a joint press conference and they said this: If you are going to \nexpand Medicaid in our States, if the Federal Government is going to do \nit, the Federal Government ought to pay for it.\n  Medicaid is the largest government-operated health care program we \nhave in the country. About 55 or 60 million Americans are there. The \nFederal Government pays about 60 percent of it and the State \ngovernments pay about 40 percent.\n  I noticed two articles in the newspaper. I ask unanimous consent to \nhave these articles printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the New York Times, Sept. 29, 2009]\n\n                  Majority Leader Protects Home State\n\n                            (By Robert Pear)\n\n       Washington.--The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of \n     Nevada, has secured a special deal protecting his state \n     against the costs of expanding Medicaid under one of the \n     major health care bills moving through Congress.\n       Mr. Reid, a Democrat, complained about the impact on Nevada \n     when the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Max \n     Baucus, Democrat of Montana, unveiled his bill on Sept. 16.\n       Now Mr. Baucus has modified the bill to spare Nevada and \n     three other states, and Mr. Reid, who faces a potentially \n     difficult race for re-election next year, is taking credit \n     for getting a ``major increase'' in federal money for his \n     state.\n       The Senate bill, like a companion measure in the House, \n     would expand Medicaid to cover childless adults, parents and \n     other people with incomes less than 133 percent of the \n     poverty level, or $29,327 for a family of four. The federal \n     government would pay most of the new costs--anywhere from 77 \n     percent to 95 percent, with a higher share in poorer states, \n     in the first five years.\n       Under Mr. Baucus's original proposal, the federal \n     government would have paid 87 percent of the new costs in \n     Nevada. Under the modified version, the federal government \n     would pay 100 percent of the new costs for the first five \n     years. Severe financial problems have prompted Nevada and \n     other states to cut spending and furlough workers, and some \n     states have even considered releasing prison inmates to save \n     money.\n       There is no guarantee that the provision will be retained \n     as the legislation moves through Congress. Many other \n     lawmakers are trying to influence its particulars to favor \n     their states, but few have the power of the majority leader \n     to get their way.\n       Mr. Baucus revised his bill to give extra help to certain \n     ``high-need states.'' The states were not named in the bill. \n     But only four states meet the criteria: Michigan, Nevada, \n     Oregon and Rhode Island.\n       The changes came at the expense of other states, including \n     California, Florida and Illinois, which would see significant \n     increases in state Medicaid spending under the new formula.\n       The Finance Committee resumes work on the legislation \n     Tuesday, with some of the biggest fights still to come.\n       Many states worry that the expansion of Medicaid could \n     saddle them with long-term financial obligations.\n       Representative Nathan Deal of Georgia, the senior \n     Republican on the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on \n     Health, said Mr. Reid ``appeared to be playing politics to \n     favor Nevada over other states.''\n       ``Senator Reid should know that this legislation is not \n     only bad for Nevada, but it is bad for the rest of the United \n     States,'' Mr. Deal said.\n       James P. Manley, a spokesman for Mr. Reid, brushed aside \n     the criticism.\n       ``Senator Reid makes no apologies for fighting for federal \n     money for his constituents,'' Mr. Manley said. ``Under \n     Republican governors, Nevada has consistently underfunded \n     programs such as Medicaid.''\n       Mr. Baucus said other provisions of the bill would help all \n     states--for example, by reducing what they spend on \n     prescription drugs for Medicaid recipients and on the \n     Children's Health Insurance Program.\n       About 220,000 people are on Medicaid in Nevada, and Charles \n     Duarte, the state Medicaid director, said Monday that \n     enrollment could double under the legislation being \n     considered by Congress.\n       Many parents and childless adults would qualify for \n     Medicaid for the first time, Mr. Duarte said. And many people \n     who are eligible but not enrolled would sign up for Medicaid \n     because, under the legislation, they could be required to pay \n     financial penalties if they did not have insurance.\n       The Finance Committee has rejected several Republican \n     amendments that would have blocked the expansion of Medicaid \n     if it was found to impose additional costs on states.\n       ``We have got to protect the states from the impact of one \n     more federal mandate at a time when states are in dire \n     circumstances financially,'' said Senator Michael D. Crapo, \n     Republican of Idaho.\n       But Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota, said \n     states must share the cost of covering the uninsured.\n       ``We are going to have a real hard time dealing with this \n     problem,'' Mr. Conrad said, ``if it is all supposed to be on \n     the federal government, which has record deficits and record \n     debt, and if the states just expect the federal government to \n     write a check for 100 percent of everything.''\n       All the major health care bills moving through Congress \n     would expand Medicaid, adding perhaps 11 million people to \n     the rolls, the Congressional Budget Office says.\n       The Democratic staff of the Finance Committee estimates \n     that, under existing law, state spending on Medicaid will \n     total $1.7 trillion from 2013 to 2019. That figure could \n     increase by $33 billion under Mr. Baucus's bill. But when the \n     new costs are combined with savings elsewhere in the bill, \n     Democrats say, state spending would increase by only $22 \n     billion, or 1.3 percent, over the levels now projected.\n       A few states, like Arkansas, Colorado, Maryland and \n     Virginia, could see increases of 4 percent or more, according \n     to the data.\n       Maine and Vermont have led the way in expanding Medicaid. \n     But Senator Olympia J. Snowe, Republican of Maine, said that \n     after talking with the governors of those states, she had \n     concerns about the burdens that would be placed on states \n     under the bill.\n                                  ____\n\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 29, 2009]\n\n               States' Quarterly Tax Revenue Plunges 17%\n\n                          (By Conor Dougherty)\n\n       State tax revenue in the second quarter plunged 17% from a \n     year earlier as rising unemployment and falling consumption\n\n[[Page S9946]]\n\n     dragged down sales- and income-tax collections, according to \n     Census figures released Tuesday.\n       It was the sharpest decline since at least the 1960s. The \n     biggest drop was in state income taxes, which were down 28% \n     in the second quarter from a year earlier. Corporate income \n     taxes, which tend be volatile, increased 3%.\n       The numbers aren't adjusted for inflation or tax-rate \n     changes.\n       The steep declines show how the recession continues to \n     cripple state finances, despite support from the stimulus \n     package and signs of a nascent recovery in economic activity. \n     Falling revenue, combined with growing demand for social \n     programs like food stamps or Medicaid, forced states to slash \n     spending and scramble to raise revenue through measures from \n     new taxes to slot machines and pricier fishing licenses.\n       ``This brings really bad news for almost every single state \n     and leaves them with an unprecedented budget crisis,'' said \n     Lucy Dadayan, a senior policy analyst with the Nelson A. \n     Rockefeller Institute of Government at the State University \n     of New York.\n       States--which, unlike the federal government, are generally \n     required to balance their budgets--have already responded to \n     revenue declines with employee furloughs and higher taxes and \n     fees. But with tax collections continuing to decline, many \n     have been forced to reopen budgets midsession to push through \n     even more drastic cuts to staffing and services. In Michigan, \n     stalled budget negotiations between the governor and the \n     legislature could force the state to shut down if a deal \n     isn't reached by Wednesday at midnight local time.\n       With lower-than-expected revenue, the governor of \n     Massachusetts cut that state's budget four times over the \n     fiscal year that ended in June, including drawing down \n     reserves from a rainy-day fund and eliminating unfilled jobs. \n     With revenue still weaker than expected, the state may be \n     forced to reopen the budget as early as next month, said a \n     spokesman for the Executive Office for Administration and \n     Finance.\n       Without a budget, Michigan state employees wouldn't report \n     to work, and the governor would likely have to take emergency \n     steps to keep essential services such as hospitals and \n     prisons operating. ``We remain optimistic that we will have a \n     budget in place because everyone wants to avoid a shutdown,'' \n     says Liz Boyd, a representative for Gov. Jennifer Granholm.\n       Some of the sharpest tax declines were in states that have \n     been among the hardest-hit by the recession, in particular \n     those with high concentrations of jobs in the battered \n     housing sector. In Arizona, overall tax revenue fell 27% in \n     the second quarter from a year ago. Tax revenue fell 12% in \n     Florida and 14% in California.\n       States across the country saw drastic declines in personal \n     income taxes, the largest source of state funding, \n     representing about one-third of states' overall revenue. The \n     largest decline was in New Mexico, where income taxes fell \n     59%. In 11 states--including California, New York and \n     Wisconsin--personal income taxes fell more than 30%.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. One is from the Wall Street Journal: State quarterly \ntax revenues plunge 17 percent. Talking about how budgets in \nCalifornia, Florida, other States are going down.\n  Then there is another article, September 29--actually these both \nappeared yesterday--in the New York Times entitled ``Majority Leader \nProtects Home State.''\n  Well, the majority leader, Senator Reid, has done exactly what all \nthe Governors hope would be done. He has said: If the Federal \nGovernment is going to expand Medicaid in my State, the Federal \nGovernment is going to pay for it.\n  But, I would say to the Senator from Wyoming, I wonder how citizens \nin Wyoming and California and Florida and other States will feel if \nthey pay more in taxes so Nevadans can pay less in taxes? Is that not \nthe kind of question Senators from virtually every State might want to \nbe sure about by reading the bill and knowing what it costs before it \ncomes to the floor?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It seems to me the people of Wyoming have those very \nconcerns, as does the Governor of Wyoming.\n  I served in the Wyoming State Senate for 5 years, and we know that \none of the largest budgets is Medicaid, the aid we give to people in \nneed of health care. But it is almost the same as what we are paying \nfor K-12 education. In Wyoming, we sure do not want to pay for what is \nhappening in the majority leader's home State.\n  I was home yesterday. Yesterday morning, getting on the plane to come \nback from Wyoming--I go home every weekend. I was at the Wyoming \nfootball game, where we won, we beat the University of Nevada Las \nVegas, the leader's home State. That was another great day for Wyoming \nfootball.\n  But when you go to a game like that in Wyoming, a lot of people come \nup to you and ask you questions. One of the questions that came up this \npast weekend was: Have you read the bill? What is in it? What is it \ngoing to cost? People of Wyoming say: Am I going to be able to read it? \nHow do I read the bill? Is it going to be on the Internet? Will I be \nable to see it?\n  To try to explain: There is no bill. There is this concept paper. I \nhave it here. It is called the chairman's mark. It is the concept paper \nof 220 pages. You look at this, this is not even in legislative \nlanguage yet. So you are going to be asked to vote on legislation, not \njust a concept paper.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I think the Senator from Wyoming is making an awfully \ngood point. He is a distinguished orthopedic surgeon, a doctor, one of \ntwo physicians in the Senate. Both of them happen to be on the \nRepublican side of the aisle at this time, Senator Coburn, and I know, \nDr. Barrasso, since we are talking about Medicaid, which is a program \nthat every State has that serves low-income people, that States pay \ntypically roughly 40 percent for, one of the questions somebody might \nhave who reads the bill is: How many more low-income people are going \nto be added to that bill?\n  Because it is my understanding that Medicaid reimburses physicians at \nsuch a low rate, that about 40 percent of physicians will not see \nMedicaid patients. So by dumping more low-income Americans into \nMedicaid, we are dumping them into a program where they have 40 percent \nof a chance of not seeing the doctor or getting the services they want \nto have. Have you had any experience with that?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Absolutely. In my practice for 25 years in Casper, WY, \nI took care of a lot of people on Medicaid. I took care of anybody who \nneeded to see me.\n  But you are right. Across the board, there are many people on \nMedicaid who do not--are not able to see a doctor. The number you \nquoted is exactly the one I have.\n  I have an article that I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Sept. 27, 2009]\n\n                           Max's Mad Mandate\n\n       The more we inspect Max Baucus's health-care bill, the \n     worse it looks. Today's howler: One reason it allegedly \n     ``pays for itself'' over 10 years is because it would break \n     all 50 state budgets by permanently expanding Medicaid, the \n     joint state-federal program for the poor.\n       Democrats want to use Medicaid to cover everyone up to at \n     least 133% of the federal poverty level, or about $30,000 for \n     a family of four. Starting in 2014, Mr. Baucus plans to spend \n     $287 billion through 2019--or about one-third of ObamaCare's \n     total spending--to add some 11 million new people to the \n     Medicaid rolls.\n       About 59 million people are on Medicaid today--which means \n     that a decade from now about a quarter of the total \n     population would be on a program originally sold as help for \n     low-income women, children and the disabled. State budgets \n     would explode--by $37 billion, according to the Congressional \n     Budget Office--because they would no longer be allowed to set \n     eligibility in line with their own decisions about taxes and \n     spending. This is the mother--and father and crazy uncle--of \n     unfunded mandates.\n       This burden would arrive on the heels of an unprecedented \n     state fiscal crisis. As of this month, some 48 states had \n     shortfalls in their 2010 budgets totaling $168 billion--or \n     24% of total state budgets. The left-wing Center for Budget \n     and Policy Priorities expects total state deficits in 2011 to \n     rise to $180 billion. And this is counting the $87 billion \n     Medicaid bailout in this year's stimulus bill.\n       While falling revenues are in part to blame, Medicaid is a \n     main culprit, even before caseloads began to surge as \n     joblessness rose. The National Association of State Budget \n     Officers notes that Medicaid spending is on average the \n     second largest component in state budgets at 20.7%--exceeded \n     only slightly by K-12 education (20.9%) and blowing out state \n     universities (10.3%), transportation (8.1%) and prisons \n     (3.4%).\n       In some states it is far higher--39% in Ohio, 27% in \n     Massachusetts, 25% in Michigan, Rhode Island and \n     Pennsylvania. Forcing states to spend more will crowd out \n     other priorities or result in a wave of tax increases, or \n     both, even as Congress also makes major tax hikes inevitable \n     at the national level.\n       The National Governors Association is furious about Mr. \n     Baucus's Medicaid expansion, and rightly so, given that \n     governors and their legislatures will get stuck with the bill \n     while losing the leeway to manage or reform their budget-\n     busters. NGA President Jim Douglas of Vermont recently said \n     at the National Press Club that the Baucus plan poses a \n     ``tremendous financial liability'' and doesn't ``respect that \n     no one size fits all at\n\n[[Page S9947]]\n\n     the state level.'' He added: ``Unlike the federal government, \n     states can't print money.''\n       Mr. Baucus hopes to use his printing press to bribe the \n     governors, at least for a time. Currently, the federal \n     government pays about 57 cents out of every dollar the states \n     spend on Medicaid, though the ``matching rate'' ranges as \n     high as 76% in some states. That would rise to 95%--but only \n     for five years. After that, who knows? It all depends on \n     which budget Congress ends up ruining. Either the states will \n     be slammed, or Washington will extend these extra payments \n     into perpetuity--despite the fact that CBO expects purely \n     federal spending on Medicaid to consume 5% of GDP by 2035 \n     under current law.\n       As for the poor uninsured, they'll be shunted off into what \n     Democratic backbencher Ron Wyden calls a ``caste system.'' \n     While some people will be eligible for subsidized private \n     health insurance, everyone in the lowest income bracket will \n     be forced into Medicaid, the country's worst insurance \n     program by a long shot. States try to control spending by \n     restricting access to prescription drugs and specialists. \n     About 40% of U.S. physicians won't accept Medicaid at all.\n       Why? One reason is that Medicaid's price controls are even \n     tighter than Medicare's, which in turn are substantially \n     below private payers. In 2009 or 2010, 29 states will have \n     either reduced or frozen their reimbursement rates to \n     providers. Democrats love Medicaid because is it much cheaper \n     than subsidizing private insurance, but that is true only \n     because of this antimarket brute force. Of course, such \n     coercion will be extended to the rest of the health market \n     under ObamaCare.\n       The states aren't entirely victims here. Both Republican \n     and Democratic state houses regularly game the Medicaid \n     funding formula--which itself is designed to reward higher \n     spending--to steal more money from national taxpayers. Then \n     when tax collections fall during downturns, budget gaskets \n     blow all over the place. This dynamic helps explain the \n     spectacular budget catastrophes in New York and California. \n     We'd prefer a policy of block grants, which would extricate \n     Washington from state accounting and encourage Governors to \n     spend more responsibly.\n       That's not going to happen any time soon, but the least Mr. \n     Baucus can do is not make things worse. Instead, his Medicaid \n     expansion is a disaster on every level--like the rest of \n     ObamaCare.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. This as also from the Wall Street Journal from \nSeptember 27, called: ``Max's Mad Mandate.'' The first paragraph says: \nOne reason this Finance Committee bill allegedly pays for itself is \nbecause it will break all 50 State budgets by permanently expanding \nMedicaid.\n  It says: They are going to expand Medicaid. The Senator was a \nGovernor. The Senator had to deal with this in Tennessee: Using \nMedicare to cover everyone up to at least 133 percent of the Federal \npoverty level, that will add some 11 million new people to the Medicaid \nrolls, which is not going to help, if currently, as the article goes \non, about 40 percent of U.S. physicians will not accept Medicaid at \nall.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I have thought for some time that any Senator who \nvotes to expand Medicaid in the States without paying for it at the \nFederal level ought to be sentenced to go home and serve as Governor \nfor 8 years and try to pay for it and raise the taxes and deal with the \npeople who cannot do that.\n  But that is the kind of question I think a Governor would want: Read \nthe bill and know what it costs. For example, I believe there is a \nquestion about the Finance Committee, in its concept papers, may say: \nWell, we will pay for it for 5 years--or we will pay 77 to 95 percent \nof it.\n  The Governors are saying--now these are Democratic Governors as well \nas Republicans--they are all saying to us: Do not do that to us. Our \nrevenues are down 17 percent, 18 percent, 20, 35 percent in some of our \nStates. If you are going to pass it, pay for it. That is a question \ngovernors should have a chance to ask and get an answer for. That is \nwhy we need to read the bill.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. That is why the National Governors Association is \nfurious with this huge expansion of Medicaid. It quotes the Governor of \nVermont, who says: Unlike the Federal Government, States cannot print \nmoney. Many of us, such as Wyoming, live within our budgets. We live \nwithin our means. We balance the budget every year. For Washington, in \nits effort to take over health care in the country, to force the States \nto pay for it, in what is, to me, a trickery or a financial gimmick, to \nsay they can make the books balance, is not a favor to the American \npeople.\n  That is why people at home ask me every weekend: Can I read the bill? \nHave you read the bill? Can I read the bill? What is it going to cost? \nIt ultimately gets down to people are very worried about a government \ntakeover, very worried that at a time we are spending all this money as \na nation, against my wishes, another trillion dollars for kind of an \nexperiment that is going to fund a lot of it through Medicare. We have \nnot even gotten into the discussion of Medicaid.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Let's talk about Medicare because many people, unless \nthey follow health care every day, confuse Medicaid, which is the \nprogram for low-income Americans that States help administer--there are \nabout 55 or 60 million Americans in that program--and Medicare, which \nis the program that about 40 million seniors have.\n  We have had a lot of talk about Medicare. The President says: There \nare no Medicare cuts. Then, on the other hand, he said: We are going to \ntake up to $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare and spend it on a new \nprogram.\n  We are saying: You are going to cut one-quarter of the Medicare \nbeneficiaries' Medicare Advantage payments. The other side is saying: \nNo, that is not what we are doing. We are saying: How can you cut \nMedicare and spend it on another program when Medicare is going broke?\n  Well, I would think the American people would want to know the answer \nto those questions, and we should know the answer before we vote. Is \nthat not another reason we should read the bill to find out who is \ntelling the truth about Medicare?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It is the reason that, No. 1, we should read the bill. \nIt is the reason we should make sure the people all across the country \nhave a chance to read the bill. The people of Wyoming want to read the \nbill. It is the reason we need some time for those people from all our \nhome districts to get back to us.\n  As I say, all around Wyoming, the wisdom does not come from \nWashington, the wisdom comes from America, from your State and my State \nand the other States. I want those people to be able to read the bill, \ncome up with better ideas or suggestions, and a lot of times folks at \nhome will see what I call unintended consequences, something that is in \nthe bill that you say: Well, I had not thought about that.\n  We have the hospitals across Wyoming, those people want to read it. \nThe doctors, the nurses, the physicians assistants, and the patients, \nthe people who are mostly going to be affected by this, they want to \nknow what is in the bill, which is why I say that is the reason to put \nit on the Internet. People can read it ahead of time and then let them \nhave time to comment back to us.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I see the Senator from Utah has come. Let me ask one \nmore question to Dr. Barrasso. Because we are told--and here is another \nreason to put the bill on the Internet for 72 hours and to wait a \ncouple weeks or whatever it takes for the Congressional Budget Office \nto tell us how much it costs, because the President has said: There \ncannot be one dime added to the deficit, which we agree with.\n  In fact, we think the whole goal of this ought to be to reduce the \ncost of health care to you and then to your government but not one dime \nto the deficit.\n  But one of the assumptions of the bill coming through the Finance \nCommittee has to do with what we elegantly call in the Senate the ``doc \nfix,'' the fact that basically the government sets what doctors will be \npaid when they see a Medicare patient. What we do every year is change \nwhat is in the formula because it cuts the physicians.\n  So is not the assumption that we are going to continue to cut what we \npay physicians, and if we come along and change that in the second \nyear, will not we then be adding to the deficit?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, you will be adding to the deficit. That is why \nseniors all across this country have great concerns about what is being \nproposed.\n  I am saying: Who is opposed to this? The No. 1 group is seniors, by 2 \nto 1. Seniors are opposed to what is happening because they know this \nis going to be paid for out of their own Medicare.\n  Just 10 or 15 minutes ago, we heard the majority leader on the floor \nof this Senate say--and I wrote it down. He said, talking about his \nplan, he said: If you like what you have, you can keep it. That is what \nhe said.\n\n[[Page S9948]]\n\n  But you and I both know there are 11 million Americans, seniors in \nthis country, on Medicare Advantage, which is a program set to help \npeople in cities and people in rural communities. They have both in \nTennessee. We sure have the rural communities in Wyoming.\n  It says they cannot keep that if they like it--or 11 million, it is \ndouble the number on it in the last couple years because it is so \npopular, because it actually does what Medicare itself does not do, \nworks with prevention, works with coordinated care. That is what our \nseniors want. That is why seniors across the country are so opposed to \nthis.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I see the Senators from Utah and Arizona have come to \nthe floor. We were talking, Senator Barrasso and I, about how well the \nmajority leader has done in helping to do what all of us would like to \ndo in his home State.\n  He has noticed, I guess he has heard from his Governor, that the \nFinance Committee is saying we are going to expand Medicaid in the \nState, but the States are going to help pay for it. The majority leader \nhas put something in the bill so Nevada does not have to pay for it.\n  I notice--to Senator McCain--according to the New York Times, in \nArizona overall tax revenues fell 27 percent in the second quarter of \nthis year from a year ago.\n  I wonder how Arizonans are going to feel about paying for Nevada's \nMedicaid.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I find it entertaining when our constituents ask: Have \nyou read the bill? Of course we haven't been able to because there is \nno bill. If I could just quote what happened here. This says:\n\n       The Chairman's Mark will provide additional assistance that \n     would be made available to high-needs states which are \n     defined as states that (1) have total Medicaid enrollment \n     that is below the national average for Medicaid enrollment as \n     a percentage of state population as of the date of enactment \n     . . .\n\n  It goes on and on for a few more sentences. What does it mean? It \nmeans they got a special deal for four States, one of them being the \nState of Nevada. Who pays? Who pays? The other States. So we have a \ncomplaint by the distinguished majority leader that his State of Nevada \nwould have to pay an amount that they don't appreciate, so we shifted \nit so that three other States--I am sure my friend from Tennessee knows \nwhich ones. I believe one of them is Oregon. I am not sure what the \nother three are.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Michigan, Rhode Island, and Oregon are the three \nothers.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So our constituents who don't happen to live in those \nfortunate four are now going to pay additional funds because we put in \nthe chairman's mark. Everybody wonders why people are so mad. They \nwonder why is it that there are these tea parties, why is it that there \nare people marching on Washington, what are they mad about? I hear the \npundits and those who very seldom go outside the beltway or outside \nManhattan say they are a bunch of crazies. It is this kind of thing. It \nis this kind of thing. We are going to do a legislative appropriations \nbill here that has $500,000 in it so that Senators can send out \npostcards to announce townhall meetings. Has anybody had any trouble \ngetting people to townhall meetings? We need to spend $500,000 \nadditional to notify people?\n  Getting back to the point of the Senator from Tennessee, this is what \nis wrong. This is what is wrong with the way we do business. We cut \nspecial favors for special States, not based on need or requirements \nbut on the influence of the individual Senator or Member of Congress. \nThat is what they are mad about.\n  May I mention one other thing to my friend from Tennessee. Yesterday, \nthere was a big vote in the Finance Committee that dominated the \nheadlines. The so-called public option was voted down by a significant \nmargin. And we hear rumors that finally the administration will come up \nwith a proposal. Doesn't that mean the goal will be basically to get \nany bill through both the House and Senate and then go into conference \nbehind closed doors and rewrite the bill? That is my greatest fear.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is my fear. The danger is that they will put the \nbills together from these various committees and ram it through, and \nthen we won't be able to ask the questions: Is my State going to pay \nmore taxes for Medicaid? Is my Medicare benefit going to be cut, or is \nthe national debt going to increase? These are important questions we \nhave a right to know the answers to before we begin the vote on the \nbill.\n  I ask the Senator from Utah, what does he see coming down the pike?\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I have said repeatedly that I would vote \nagainst my own bill, even if it were to pass the Senate unanimously, \nunless there were an ironclad guarantee--iron is not strong enough; \ncarved in marble guarantee--from the President that he would veto a \nconference report that came back that did not have the kinds of \nprotections I think my bill has.\n  I agree completely with the Senator from Arizona. The big fear is \nthat we craft something in the Senate that is reasonable and then \nsubmit it to a conference and it comes back in a conference report that \nis not amendable and gets passed by a majority vote here and we are \nstuck with it.\n  As important as it is that we try to get the Senate bill right, we \nmust recognize that there are two Houses of Congress. At the moment, \nthe other body is not showing the degree of analysis we are trying to \nget going here in the Senate. The House bill is completely \nunacceptable.\n  If I could pick up on the comment about the consequences of what is \nbeing done with respect to Medicaid, I will add the experience from the \nState of Utah to the experience that has been referred to for other \nStates.\n  In Utah, an expansion of Medicaid, as outlined in the Finance \nCommittee bill, would mean anywhere from an additional $150 million to \n$248 million to Utah taxpayers. I realize that in a State such as \nCalifornia that is multiple billions of dollars in debt, an extra $150 \nmillion to an extra quarter of a billion is not a lot of money. But in \nUtah, it is a significant amount. We need to pay attention to the fact \nthat every State is facing those kinds of significant increases.\n  I call the attention of the Senate to an analysis that is in today's \nCongressional Quarterly, dated September 30, talking about the bill as \nit is moving through the Finance Committee. I quote:\n\n       Under current law, taxpayers can deduct expenses that \n     exceed 7.5 percent of their adjusted gross income. Under the \n     Baucus original proposal, that floor would have been raised \n     to 10 percent, starting in 2013.\n\n  Then further:\n\n       According to data from the Joint Committee on Taxation, 45 \n     percent of the taxpayers affected and 53 percent of the \n     revenue from the change would come from people 65 and over.\n\n  So for those who are asking--and we read about them in the paper all \nthe time--why are the elderly upset, they have Medicare? The elderly \nare smarter than that, and they recognize that 53 percent of the \nincrease that would come as a result of these proposed changes would \ncome from them.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Would the Senator not agree that therefore older \nAmericans who depend on Medicare might especially want to read the \nbill?\n  Mr. BENNETT. They certainly are going to want us to read the bill and \nbe honest with them as to what is in it. They are going to want us to \ngo into the managers' package, into the small details that usually are \nconsidered technical and get passed over, and be very specific in \nsaying to our constituents: We know what is in the bill, and we are \nbeing very upfront with you in telling you what is in the bill.\n  One of the things we need to be upfront about is the amount of \nincrease this will cost seniors and the amount of impact it will have \non States. States will then have to turn around and raise their taxes, \nand seniors will pay twice, with the increase at the Federal level and \nthe increase at the State level.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Wyoming was home last weekend. I \nwonder if he is hearing especially from senior Americans who worry \nabout the effect of this bill on Medicare.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I heard that in Wyoming this past weekend. People who \ndepend upon Medicare are rightly suspicious, very suspicious about this \nprogram. As they try to learn more about it, what they learn is that it \nis going to cut Medicare. They are learning it is going to increase \ntaxes. They are learning it will limit what they have in terms of \nchoices for their health care.\n\n[[Page S9949]]\n\n  For all Americans, if you ask: What do you think, is this going to \ncost more or less, they think it is going to cost more. When I ask \npeople at townhall meetings: Do you think you will have better or worse \ncare, the show of hands is that they will have worse care. Americans \ndon't want to pay more and get less. People want value for their money.\n  People who depend on Medicare are rightly more suspicious than other \nfolks because of the impact this is going to have on them. They \nunderstand $500 billion is going to be cut from their health care.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We have 4 minutes left. I believe I will wrap up and \nleave the last minute to the Senator from Utah. Our point is a pretty \nsimple one. We believe, we Republicans, that after this bill is put \ntogether, we ought to have ample time to read it, that it ought to be \non the Internet for 72 hours, and that we ought to hear from the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office how much it costs. Why would we \ndo that? Because we have differences of opinion over whether it hurts \npeople on Medicare, over whether States will have to raise taxes in \norder to pay for Medicaid, over whether the assumptions made will \nactually add to the debt, over how large taxes are on small businesses. \nWe have differences of opinion. The only way we can intelligently \ndebate those is if we can read the bill and know what it costs.\n  On the Republican side, we believe we should focus on reducing costs \nand go step by step to re-earn the trust of the American people by \nfixing health care in that way, starting with such ideas as permitting \nsmall businesses to pool their resources in order to offer insurance to \na larger number of people. Another way to reduce cost would be to find \nways to eliminate junk lawsuits against doctors.\n  The Senator from Utah may have other thoughts about the importance of \nreading the bill.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I will make this comment with respect to \nthe remarks of the Senator from Tennessee with reference to the CBO. We \nneed hard numbers, but we do have a preliminary understanding already.\n  The Director of the CBO, Mr. Elmendorf, was asked if it is true that \nthe fees established in the bill would ultimately be passed on down to \nthe health care consumer, and his response:\n\n       Our judgment is that the piece of legislation would raise \n     insurance premiums.\n\n  If we go more deeply into the CBO analysis, we find that not only \nwould premiums in the individual market be higher than under the \nproposed reform, but taxes on insurers and drugs and devices would be \npassed on to consumers in the form of higher premiums. Finally, CBO \nalso says that the premiums would be extremely high even after the \nproposed reforms because taxpayers would be subsidizing expensive \nplans. We clearly need the kind of careful analysis that clothes these \ncomments with actual numbers. Without those, how can we vote with any \nkind of clarity on the proposal before us.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Utah and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9949-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9949-S9952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to debate the Republican plan \nfor reforming health care. I would like to see the Republican plan for \nreforming health care. I would like to know what they stand for when it \ncomes to reforming health care. They have been given adequate \nopportunity--\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Will the Democratic leader yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Regular order, please.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois has the \nfloor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. He asked me what our plan is. I would be glad to tell \nhim.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, they have been given ample opportunity, to \nthe point where they offered 160 amendments which were adopted in the \nHELP Committee when we were debating the bill, 160 Republican \namendments. So they brought in their ideas, we put them in the bill, \nand then when the bill came up for final passage, not one Republican \nwould vote for it. Over and over again, all they can do is criticize. \nThey are just upset with the idea of changing the health care system.\n  I am particularly amused with the defense of Medicare by Republicans. \nThis is a historic change for a party that used to call it socialized \nmedicine, a party that said: Keep the government out of health care, \nwhen we created Medicare. Now they are coming to the defense of \nMedicare. The reason they are is because 45 million Americans count on \nMedicare every single day; 45 million seniors know that without \nMedicare, their family savings would be in danger if they had a \ncatastrophic illness after they have reached retirement; 45 million \nAmericans who know the fact that for the last 40 years we have improved \nthe longevity, the life expectancy of seniors because of Medicare.\n  Let me tell the Senate what their real agenda is. When Republicans \ncome here and talk about Medicare, it is all about health insurance \ncompanies. It is all about the health insurance companies that are \nturning down Americans when they want to have their basic coverage for \nmedical care. It is all about health insurance companies that continue \nto raise the cost of their product and exclude people from coverage. It \nis all about health insurance companies that are seeing some of the \ngreatest profits on Wall Street.\n  So how do you link up these two, Medicare and health insurance \ncompanies? In a program called Medicare Advantage. Pay close attention \nto this program. Here is what the health insurance companies said to \nthe Republicans several years ago. They said: The government doesn't \nknow how to run health care. The government doesn't know how to run \nMedicare. We, the private health insurance companies, will show you how \nto do this. Let us offer Medicare benefits. We will call it Medicare \nAdvantage and let the people decide, let seniors decide if they want to \nbuy the private health insurance plan for Medicare or if they want to \nstay in the traditional government-administered Medicare.\n  About one out of four seniors decided to buy into the private health \ninsurance plans for Medicare called Medicare Advantage. In fact, across \nAmerica, more than 10 million Americans have enrolled in Medicare \nAdvantage. Since 2003, the number of Medicare beneficiaries enrolled in \nprivate plans has nearly doubled, from 5.3 million to the 10.2 million \nI mentioned earlier. It is higher in urban areas than it is in rural \nareas, higher in some parts of the country than in others.\n  How did the experiment work? How did it work when the health \ninsurance companies said: We can do it better than the government when \nit comes to Medicare? They failed. Not by my estimation, by MedPAC, a \ngroup that has stepped back and has said: Well, the premiums they are \ncharging per Medicare recipient are higher than what people would be \npaying under Medicare--14 percent higher.\n  So these private health insurance companies have a sweet deal: 10 \nmillion Americans buying their private health plans instead of \ntraditional Medicare, and they are overcharging them by 14 percent. Who \npays the 14 percent? All the rest of Medicare recipients. The money is \ntaken out of the Medicare Program. It means Medicare solvency is \nchallenged because private health insurance companies have failed under \nMedicare Advantage.\n  President Obama and Members of Congress have said: This subsidy to \nprivate health insurance companies to try to offer Medicare at a lower \ncost, which has failed, has to come to an end. If it comes to an end, \nwhat is it worth over 10 years? It is $180 billion. So when we say we \nare taking $180 billion in savings in Medicare, we are closing down the \nfailed experiment by private health insurance companies to offer \nMedicare as a private health insurance plan.\n  The Republicans are coming and complaining: Oh, they are taking money \nout of Medicare. Yes, we are. We are taking the subsidies to the \nprivate health insurance companies out of Medicare. So their complaints \nare basically complaints in defense of private health insurance \ncompanies. They can make all the case they want about private health \ninsurance companies. I will take the case to the American people that \nprivate health insurance companies need to treat Americans a heck of a \nlot better than they are right now.\n\n[[Page S9950]]\n\n  You know what I am talking about. Preexisting conditions. If you are \nunfortunate and have a preexisting condition and turn in a claim to a \nhealth insurance company, get ready for a battle. First, you are going \nto battle some faceless clerk in Omaha, NE; and the next thing is going \nto be your doctor calling that office saying: For goodness sakes, you \nare not going to cover this procedure, this surgery this person needs \nunder health insurance?\n  That battle takes place every single day, thousands of times, when \nprivate health insurance companies say no or they wait until you are \nsick to cancel you or they will not let you take your health insurance \nfrom one job to another. Over and over again, people across America \nknow what the private health insurance companies are up to.\n  Because, unfortunately, the Republicans do not have a plan in terms \nof health care reform, because they will not join us in trying to put \none together, President Obama has reached out to them, we have reached \nout to them. We have asked them to join us in this conversation: Join \nus in this debate. They have refused to do it. They will not be part of \nit.\n  Only one Republican, a Senator from the State of Maine on the Senate \nFinance Committee, Senator Snowe, is keeping an open mind on this. I \nappreciate that. All Americans should. She said: I want to see this \nfinal product. I am not ruling out voting for it. Senator Baucus, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, spent months, literally months, in a \nroom with three of our colleagues--Senator Snowe was one, Senator Enzi \nof Wyoming, Senator Grassley of Iowa--trying to come up with a \nbipartisan approach, and eventually the Republicans walked out of the \nroom but for Senator Snowe.\n  It is not as if we have not tried to engage them. But for reasons I \ncannot explain, they do not want to be part of this conversation about \nthe future of health care in America. They come down to one or two \nissues or one or two theories, and then they take a walk.\n  Democrats want to protect consumers from health insurance companies \nand the abuses they have heaped on the American people. Unfortunately, \nwhether it is Medicare Advantage or other health insurance reforms, the \nRepublicans will not join us. They are on the side of the health \ninsurance companies, not on the side of change to protect Americans \nfrom the abuses of health insurance companies.\n  We want to strengthen Medicare. We want to maintain the benefits, \neven expand them, to the point where, for example, we close the \ndoughnut hole in the Medicare prescription program. That is a term of \nart that has come about on Capitol Hill that basically reflects the \nfact that if you are under Medicare Part D, having your prescriptions \npaid for, and you have a lot of bills, you could reach a point during \nthe course of the year where there is a gap, a percent where you have \nto put all the money in out of your own pocket, and then, after you \nspend up to another level, you get coverage again. They call it the \ndoughnut hole. We would like to fill it. It is an uncertainty for \nseniors that needs to be taken care of.\n  We also would like to make sure seniors have preventive care, so \nwhether they need a mammogram or a colonoscopy or some sort of \nprocedure to find out if there is an illness at an early point, they \ncan get it to be able to deal with it effectively. That ought to be \npart of it as well. But instead, what did we run into?\n  Senator Johnny Isakson is from Georgia. He is a conservative \nRepublican and proud of it. He came into the HELP Committee, and here \nis what he said: We think we ought to provide, under our insurance \nplans, that patients can have a confidential meeting with their doctor \nto discuss one of the most delicate and difficult topics we can \nconsider--end of life care--so the doctor would know: What is your \nwish, what do you want to have happen if you find yourself in a long-\nterm illness and some important decisions have to be made about \nextraordinary care.\n  Senator Isakson of Georgia said: I think we ought to cover that under \nhealth insurance. We ought to at least give one appointment so the \ndoctor and patient can discuss the possibilities and so the doctor \nknows what the patient feels will give peace of mind on both sides, \nshould that terrible day ever come.\n  Do you know what happened to Senator Isakson's idea of that meeting? \nIt turned into a Republican diatribe against death panels: Somebody is \ngoing to pull the plug on grandma. In fact, one of the Republican \nCongressmen took to the floor of the House of Representatives and \nactually said: This is a death panel. Sarah Palin, former Governor of \nAlaska, used that phrase too.\n  I can tell you Senator Isakson did not propose that. What he proposed \nis a sensible, commonsense approach. But it shows you the extremes in \nfear that are being spread by some who do not want to discuss health \ncare in an honest and open way.\n  We want to make sure people are happy with the insurance they have. \nIf they are, they can keep it. Republicans would put people's insurance \nat risk by allowing insurance companies to drop people's coverage or \nput artificial limits on what they will be paid when someone gets sick. \nWe want to make sure insurance is affordable and available for people \nwho have no coverage or if you lose your job or change your job or have \na preexisting condition.\n  I am afraid the Republicans want to maintain the status quo. The \nstatus quo is unsustainable. We cannot continue the health care system \nwe have today. Let me give you one statistic which tells the story \nabout the cost and, I guess, the danger when it comes to health care. \nIn the last few years, the percentage of Americans filing for personal \nbankruptcy because of medical bills has doubled from 31 percent to 62 \npercent. That is almost 2 out of every 3 people filing for bankruptcy \nin America are filing for it because of medical bills.\n\n  I think an even more troubling statistic: 78 percent of those filing \nfor bankruptcy because of medical bills have health insurance, health \ninsurance that failed them, health insurance that was not there when \nthey needed catastrophic protection, health insurance that was denied \nthem because of a preexisting condition, health insurance that was not \nthere at the moment when they needed it the most.\n  That is the reality. To ignore that and say, as some have said on the \nRepublican side of the aisle: We have to go slow, we have to take this \nslowly and decide whether we need change. We need change. We have asked \nthe Republicans to join us in this conversation about change. They have \nnot done it.\n  Senator Bennett from Utah is on the floor. He and Senator Wyden are \nexploring an approach to health care which has a few sponsors on both \nsides of the aisle. It is the only effort I know of on his side to put \nup a constructive alternative. At least they have come forward with \none. It is not one I think most Americans would immediately come to \nbecause it eliminates employer-based health insurance. It basically \nsays we, as individuals, would be in a market for health insurance, \ntrying to find the best policies and, under their plan, hope for the \ncompetition of that pool of people who would bring costs down.\n  But, unfortunately, when it comes to the Republican side of the \naisle, that is the only offering. The Bennett-Wyden bill is the only \noffering. Unfortunately, as well, the Republicans have not engaged us \nand have not agreed to be part of the conversation that leads to a \nfinal bill.\n  Well, we have to deal with this in an honest and open way. We \nunderstand that doing absolutely nothing at all is unacceptable because \nevery American, including those on Medicare, will be far worse off if \nwe do nothing at all. Doing nothing at all for many Republicans is the \nanswer. They have created these arguments.\n  Yesterday, there was an argument in the Finance Committee about \ngovernment health care and the question of the public option. Should \nthere be, in the choices available to Americans, one not-for-profit \noption that is trying to bring down costs? Well, I think there should \nbe. Many of the Republicans do not. Some Democrats do not.\n  In the course of the debate yesterday, a question was asked of \nSenator Grassley, who opposed the public option: Well, what do you \nthink of Medicare? Isn't that a government-run health care program?\n  Yes, it is.\n  Would you eliminate Medicare?\n  He said: No. That has become part of the social fabric of America.\n\n[[Page S9951]]\n\n  Why has it become part of it? Because it is reliable, it is \naffordable, and it changes lives for the better. Why wouldn't you want \nthat option? If you do not want to take the public option under health \ninsurance because you think it is socialism or communism or just plain \nwrong or you do not trust the government to run health insurance, you \ndo not choose the option. But if you believe in keeping costs down in a \nprogram you can rely on that is administered by the government--a \nprogram such as, incidentally, the health insurance Members of Congress \nhave--then you can make that choice. That, to me, is what we should be \ncoming down to. But, unfortunately, that option is not open.\n  We want to hold down health care costs for Americans by attacking \nwaste and fraud. Medicare Advantage, in my mind, is wasteful. Mr. \nPresident, 14 percent more the health insurance companies are charging \nfor the same basic Medicare Program. Why in the world would we continue \nthat subsidy to these profitable health insurance companies? Some want \nto. They argue that any change in Medicare or Medicare Advantage is \ngoing to cut basic Medicare benefits. That is just plain wrong.\n  This do-nothing approach we have heard from the other side of the \naisle is going to mean costs are going to continue to skyrocket. As \nthey do, we are going to find fewer and fewer Americans with coverage. \nWe know what is happening with premiums across America. They are going \nup sky-high, and the wages of American workers are not, so workers are \nfalling behind. Fewer companies are offering health insurance. Smaller \nbusinesses even have a more difficult time offering health insurance.\n  I put together a bill with Senator Lincoln of Arkansas, Senator \nSnowe, and Senator Collins of Maine that was supported by the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses and the realtors to give small \nbusinesses a chance to get into a pool to reduce their cost and their \nadministrative overhead and to have health insurance available. I could \nnot draw any more Republican support for that idea. Too much \ngovernment, they said. Well, for a lot of small businesses that \nintervention in the marketplace could make a big difference.\n  I had a hearing back in my hometown of Springfield, IL, on Monday. It \nwas not exactly a hearing. It was more of a roundtable. I wanted it to \nbe informal because I wanted to hear stories. I heard quite a bit.\n  I heard from Sandy Hill. Sandy is an interesting woman. She and her \nhusband own an excavating company, a small business in central \nIllinois. They are proud of it. They work hard at it. She said: My \nhusband is going to die on the job. He is the kind of guy who will \nnever retire. He is a hard-working guy, proud of his business.\n  Sandy, unfortunately, has diabetes. As a result of that, they cannot \nafford health insurance. No health insurance for her or her husband, \nand Sandy is in a position in life where she needs it. Her doctor was \nthere with us. Sandy talked about the fact--because she does not have \nhealth insurance, and can spend up to $900 a month on insulin and other \ncare for her diabetic condition--that sometimes she has had to make the \ndecision to cut back on her medication. I looked over at her doctor, \nDr. Albers, who was sitting next to me, and she winced when Sandy said \nthat and thought that is the wrong thing to do. It is the wrong thing \nto do. But Sandy Hill has no choice. She does not have health \ninsurance. She gets up and goes to work every single day, proud of the \nlittle business she and her husband have put together, and she cannot \nget health insurance.\n  In 2009, in the United States of America, a hard-working woman and \nher husband with no health insurance, with a medical condition that \ncould be life-threatening if she does not receive basic care and \nprotection. We have said to our Republican friends, and we have said to \nall the critics and detractors: Join us in solving this problem. Let us \nget costs under control. Let's start reducing the increase in the costs \nof health care. We have to do this. Let's also make sure health \ninsurance companies treat people fairly, that they do not deny coverage \nto them when they need it the very most. Let's make sure as well that \npeople like Sandy Hill who have no health insurance will have a choice, \nan option to turn to. That is only sensible. I think it should include \na public option. She can decide whether she wants it. If she doesn't \nwant it, she doesn't have to take it. She will have private health \ninsurance companies and the public option--her choice to take one or \nthe other.\n\n  Let's also start dealing with some fundamentals here. We need to \nfocus more on prevention and wellness in America. Keeping people \nhealthy and well is not only good for them and their families, it is \ngood for the cost of health care in our country. I believe it is \nimportant that we focus more on that.\n  If you have a $5,000 deductible--and a lot of people do because they \nhave health insurance policies with expensive premiums, so they put a \nbig deductible on it--let's assume you have a $5,000 deductible or \ncopay. I just ran into a man with that. What does that do to you? Some \npeople say: Well, it is an incentive not to overuse the system. That is \ntrue, but you have to watch out that it isn't a perverse incentive.\n  The man I met had been told by his doctor that he needed a \ncolonoscopy. There were some worrisome signs that indicated he needed \nthat procedure to find out if he, unfortunately, had polyps or colon \ncancer, and he needed to be treated right away. Because he had a $5,000 \ncopay, he asked: What does it cost?\n  They said: It is $3,000.\n  He said: I can't afford it. I will try to get back to that later.\n  People with copays and deductibles that are very high turn down some \nvery basic procedures, preventive procedures, that can catch something \nin an early stage and deal with it in an effective way. That is what we \nare trying to achieve here. We are trying to achieve this quickly so we \ncan turn this around and move this forward and so we have real health \ncare reform.\n  I agree with those who say the bill should be in writing and Members \nshould have a chance to read it. That just makes sense, and it will be. \nBut those who want to slow it down for weeks or months--maybe let's \nwait until next year; maybe it will take a few years--don't understand \nthe pressing urgency of our dealing with this problem.\n  The President has committed himself to this like no other President \nsince maybe President Clinton or President Lyndon Johnson. It has been \nyears. Under the previous Republican President, there were no proposals \nwhen it came to health care reform--none. None that I can recall. The \nclosest thing I can remember is the Medicare prescription drug plan \nwhich I mentioned earlier. An extension of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, which we had to fight with the administration over, \nis one that I think has been good, to extend health care, with the help \nof the government, to a lot of kids who otherwise wouldn't be \nprotected.\n  The Republican leader came to the floor today and talked about his \nconcerns, and there were many.\n  He said it was going to raise taxes. Well, let's make it clear. When \nwe talk about health care reform, first, President Obama has said he \nwill not sign any health care reform bill that adds to the deficit. So, \nunlike the Medicare prescription drug program which added to the \ndeficit dramatically, this approach cannot add to the deficit. We have \nto pay for it.\n  He said it would include tax hikes. Well, I don't know what is going \nto be included in the health care reform bill in terms of increases in \nrevenue. If we are talking about taking the subsidy back from the \nhealth insurance companies under the Medicare Advantage Program and the \nRepublicans are objecting to that, they can, but I think most Americans \nwould agree that the subsidy is something that shouldn't be sustained.\n  He argues that the bill is 1,000 pages long. It might be. We are \ntalking about a change in our basic economy that affects $1 of every $6 \nspent. It, of course, is going to have a lot of sections to it to \nconsider all of the possibilities.\n  He talks about the cost of $1 trillion over 10 years. The Republican \nleader objects to that. This year, we will spend $2.5 trillion on \nmedical care and health care in America. Over the next 10 years, I am \nsure the total figure will be over $35 trillion. So addressing it with \na $1 trillion program over 10 years is less than 3 percent of what we \nanticipate spending on health care if we do\n\n[[Page S9952]]\n\nnothing. So $1 trillion is a staggering figure until it is put into \ncontext.\n  He says it will impact a sixth of the economy. He is right.\n  He says it will impact every American. He is right about that. It is \nthe biggest challenge we have faced. It is one that is going to be \ntough, politically difficult, but we have to do it. As the President \nsaid, if it were easy, some other President would have done it a long \ntime ago, but we have to do it now.\n  I believe most people understand that the bottom line here is that \nfailing to do this--do nothing, as some on the other side of the aisle \nwould suggest--isn't going to solve this problem, it is going to make \nit much worse. It is going to reach a point where we are going to face \neven grimmer choices in the future. The American people will stand up \nand work together on a bipartisan basis for something that is truly \ngood for the common good. There will be dissenters. There are people \nstanding outside now with signs against the public option. That is part \nof the American way. But the fact is, if we do nothing, this situation \nwill get dramatically worse.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I appreciate the words of Senator Durbin, \nespecially his story about Sandy Hill from Illinois and what he said \nabout her situation.\n  I come to the floor often to share letters I have received from \npeople all over my State who oftentimes were very happy with their \nhealth insurance and then found out their health insurance, once they \ngot sick, wasn't so good. Let me share a couple of these letters, and \nthen I have some other comments I wish to make.\n  Susan from Stark County, in the Canton area, writes:\n\n       The cost of having health insurance is coming to a point \n     where I may have to drop it because of the cost. I have three \n     years until I can qualify for Medicare, but in that, how high \n     will my premiums increase? Right now my insurance costs \n     almost $500 a month and as of this November will increase \n     another $60 a month. The insurance companies dictate to the \n     doctors what they can charge and to the patients how long \n     hospital stays can be. This is not fair to those of us who \n     have to try to pay our own way.\n\n  That is exactly what we are addressing in this bill. Many people have \ninsurance. Many people are generally satisfied with their insurance, \nbut they are seeing several things happen: The costs continue to go up; \nsmall businesses continue to be more burdened with the expense of \ncovering their employees; and in too many cases, people who had decent \ninsurance get denied care, perhaps because of a cap or a lifetime cap \nwhere they get very sick, they take biologic drugs, they go to the \nhospital for a long hospital stay, and all of a sudden they have busted \ntheir cap. In other words, the fine print in their insurance policy \nsays: We are not covering you after we spend X number of dollars. They \nhave lost their insurance, and bankruptcy is too often around the \ncorner.\n\n  Jeanne from Dayton writes:\n\n       Last November I was laid off from my job and lost my \n     benefits at the same time. My husband has health insurance \n     through his employer, but he might lose his job soon. We're \n     both in our mid 50s and have more than 10 years to go before \n     we can get on Medicare. We've been frugal all our lives. \n     We've got enough money in savings to pay off our mortgage, if \n     necessary. We could even live on the pensions we've \n     accumulated starting today if we had to. But that's assuming \n     we have no health problems in the next 10 years. Please don't \n     let greed take away what we have worked so hard for.\n\n  The assistant majority leader, Senator Durbin, just spoke about \ninsurance subsidies and how this legislation is going to be good for \ninsurance companies. It is going to get a good bit of money to the \ninsurance industry so they can cover people and bring their rates down. \nThat is why the public option Senator Durbin spoke about is so \nimportant.\n  The public option will make sure the insurance companies play by the \nrules. We are going to have insurance reform in this bill. We are going \nto outlaw preexisting conditions, the game of community rating. We are \ngoing to outlaw those insurance companies putting a cap on costs for \nany individual patient, either an annual cap or a lifetime cap. We are \ngoing to outlaw discrimination based on geography or gender or \ndisability or age in this legislation. We are going to enforce these \nrules because we have all seen the insurance companies game the system \neven when the rules were thought to be strong and tight and ironclad. \nWe know the insurance companies will still try to game the system. That \nis why the public option is so important.\n  The public option is an option. You can choose CIGNA or Aetna; you \ncan choose, in my State, Medical Mutual, a not-for-profit headquartered \nin Cleveland; or you can choose the public option. The public option \nwill make sure CIGNA and Aetna and those other for-profit insurance \ncompanies play by the rules. That is why it is so important.\n  Randolph is from Summit County. He says:\n\n       I have operated a small business in Ohio for 25 years. We \n     have provided all of our employees health insurance from day \n     one. It does hurt, it's the only area we can count on going \n     up every single year--and not three or five percent, but \n     double digit increases nearly every year for the past 27 \n     years. These increases stop us from what we could do: Add \n     more employees. This country needs health insurance reform \n     now.\n\n  Randolph is exactly right. Almost every small businessperson I know \nwants to cover his or her employees. Those small businesses are getting \nso oppressed by these health insurance costs that it stops--in many \ncases, it means they have had to scale back the benefits they provide \ntheir employees, force their employees to pick up more of the cost. It \nalso means, as Randolph points out, he would like to hire more people, \ngrow his business more, expand, but he can't do it because of health \ncare costs. That is why this legislation is so important.\n  The public option is important to keep the insurance companies \nhonest. The assistance we are going to provide for small businesses \nwith tax credits will allow them to pool their resources, with the \nopportunity, if they choose, to go into the public option. All of that \nwill help those smaller employers in Mansfield and Gallipolis, in \nFremont and all over my State, will help those small employers, those \nsmall businesses prosper, be able to provide insurance for their \nemployees, and allow them to grow and do what they want to do as \nbusinesspeople.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9952-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9952-S9953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PEDIATRIC CANCER RESEARCH\n\n  Mr. BROWN. On August 6, Alexa Brown, an 11-year-old from Clyde, OH, \ndied of brain cancer. Alexa was an active, happy, and beautiful little \ngirl. Her courage in the face of such tragic circumstances was \ninspiring.\n  Unfortunately, Alexa's battle with cancer is not an isolated case. \nCancer is the No. 1 cause of nonaccidental death in children. It is \nresponsible for more deaths from ages 1 to 19 than asthma and cystic \nfibrosis and AIDS combined.\n  In northwest Ohio and the area around Clyde, 19 other children have \nbeen diagnosed with a form of invasive cancer in the last decade. \nPublic health officials are trying to get to the bottom of the \nenvironmental origins of this cancer cluster, as it is called, but in \ntoo many cases we simply don't know enough about the disease to reach \nany definitive conclusions.\n  It is this lack of knowledge and it is heartbreaking stories such as \nthat of Alexa Brown that persuaded us in Congress to unanimously pass \nthe Caroline Price Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act last year. That \nbill, named after former Ohio Representative Deborah Pryce's 9-year-old \ndaughter who died of cancer, established a national patient registry \nfor pediatric cancer patients at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention as well as authorized additional funding for pediatric \ncancer research at the National Institutes of Health. After passing \nthat bill, it may have been tempting to just claim victory, but today, \n14 months later, there is still much to be done to fully realize the \ngoals of that legislation.\n  The Senate version of the Labor, Health and Human Services \nappropriations bill does not yet include the direct funding authorized \nby the Caroline Pryce Walker Conquer Childhood Cancer Act. The House \nbill does. That is why today, on the last day of Childhood Cancer \nAwareness Month, Senator Voinovich and I sent a letter to appropriators \nurging that the final Labor-HHS package include $10 million \nspecifically--specifically--for pediatric cancer research.\n\n[[Page S9953]]\n\n  Currently, the National Cancer Institute spends less than 4 percent \nof its budget on pediatric cancer. An extra $10 million would boost \nthat percentage and help our effort to get to the bottom of this deadly \nproblem. It would give hope to those in Clyde, OH, and northwest Ohio \nand across my State and across this great country who have seen \ncancer's destruction firsthand.\n  I had a chance to meet with Alexa's family just a few days after \ntheir daughter passed away. You can imagine, it was a very emotional \ntime for them and for their neighbors and for their friends at church \nand for their friends throughout Clyde and that part of the State. But \neven in their state of mourning, Alexa's mom and dad stressed the \nimportance of making sure other families don't have to go through the \nsame thing. I think our colleagues couldn't agree more.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9953-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9953]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of the conference report to accompany H.R. \n2918, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Conference report to accompany H.R. 2918, making \n     appropriations for the Legislative Branch for the fiscal year \n     ending September 30, 2010, and for other purposes, having \n     met, have agreed that the House recede from its disagreement \n     to the amendment of the Senate and agree to the same with an \n     amendment, and the Senate agree to the same. Signed by all \n     the conferees on the part of both Houses.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senate will proceed to \nthe consideration of the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in the House proceedings of the \nRecord of Thursday, September 24, 2009.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nupon disposition of the conference report to accompany H.R. 2918, the \nSenate then proceed to the consideration of H. Con. Res. 191, a \ncorrecting resolution; that the concurrent resolution be agreed to and \nthe motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I rise today to present the \nconference report on H.R. 2918, the Legislative Branch Appropriations \nAct of 2010.\n  I will start by thanking the ranking member of the subcommittee, \nSenator Murkowski, for her help throughout the process of completing \nthe bill. We worked very well together, and the result is a true \nbipartisan product.\n  I also thank Chairman Inouye and Vice-Chairman Cochran for their \nsupport and direction this year as well.\n  At the request of the full committee, a clean, 1-month continuing \nresolution has been attached to this conference report.\n  I believe the bill we have before us today is a good one. This bill \nwill allow the legislative branch to continue to operate and move \nforward during the next year.\n  When Senator Murkowski and I began our hearings this year, we both \nagreed we should lead by example in the legislative branch--being good \nstewards of the taxpayers' dollars. Fiscal year 2010 would be a year of \n``must haves'' versus a year of ``nice to haves.'' With one notable, \nimportant, and understandable exception, I think we have been \nsuccessful.\n  The final conference report contains $50 million for the renovation \nof the Cannon House Office Building. The conferees included this \nfunding at the request of the House. As a matter of comity, the House \nand Senate defer to the other body on funding decisions related to \ntheir side of the Chamber. The $50 million for the Cannon Building \nHistorical Fund accounts for most of the new overall spending above the \ncost-of-living increases in our bill.\n  The conference report before us today totals $4.65 billion, which is \n$156 million, or 3.5 percent, over fiscal year 2009, $386 million below \nthe budget request.\n  The bill provides $926 million for the operations of the Senate, \nwhich is $31 million, or 3.4 percent, above fiscal year 2009, and $83 \nmillion below the request. I am happy to say we were able to reduce the \nSenate funding by $8 million from the Senate-passed bill. In addition, \n$1.37 billion is included for the operations of the House in fiscal \nyear 2010.\n  The bill also provides $328 million for the Capitol Police, which is \n$22 million, or 7 percent, above fiscal year 2009. This amount fully \nfunds the current onboard strength of 1,799 officers and provides for \nan additional five civilian employees to assist with the implementation \nof the radio project. Congress made the decision earlier this year to \nmove forward with this long-overdue project. So now it is critical that \nthe Capitol Police has the personnel it needs to bring this project in \nsuccessfully--on time and on budget. No excuses.\n  The Library of Congress is funded at $643 million, an increase of $36 \nmillion, or 6 percent, above current year, including full funding \nrequested for the Library's information technology upgrades, which is a \ntop priority of Dr. Billington.\n  The conference agreement includes $602 million for the Architect of \nthe Capitol. Setting aside the $50 million for the renovation of the \nCannon House Building, this mark represents a $22 million, or 4 \npercent, overall increase for the Architect of the Capitol. The bill \nincludes a very good balance of energy reduction, deferred facilities \nmaintenance, and code compliance projects within the funding provided.\n  The Government Accountability Office is funded at $557 million, an \nincrease of $26 million, or 5 percent, above fiscal year 2009. This \nfunding supports additional staff to assist GAO in carrying out its \nvital role in the oversight of the Federal Government.\n  The Government Printing Office is funded at $147 million, an increase \nof $7 million, or 5 percent, above current year. This increase provides \nfunding for several of GPO's high-priority information technology \nprojects and much needed repairs to the elevator system of the GPO \nbuilding.\n  The conferees included $45 million for the Congressional Budget \nOffice, which is an increase of $1 million above fiscal year 2009. This \nwill provide CBO with the support it needs to fulfill its mission \nserving Congress.\n  The Office of Compliance is funded at $4.4 million, which is \n$305,000, or 7 percent, over current year.\n  Finally, the conference report includes $12 million for the Open \nWorld Leadership Fund. This represents a decrease of $2 million below \ncurrent year and $2.5 million below the Senate-passed fiscal year 2010 \nlevel.\n  Mr. President, in closing, I thank the staff members who have \nassisted us throughout this process. First, from Senator Murkowski's \nstaff, I thank Carrie Apostolou and Sarah Wilson for their hard work on \nthis bill. From my staff, I thank Nancy Olkewicz, Kate Howard, and Teri \nCurtin for their assistance in producing this important legislation.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator in Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to support the Legislative Branch \nconference report, which includes a continuing resolution allowing the \ngovernment to maintain normal operations until October 31, 2009.\n  I thank Chairman Nelson and Ranking Member Murkowski for their hard \nwork on this bill. I believe the final product before us is fiscally \nresponsible legislation that meets the essential needs of both the \nHouse and Senate. I applaud their efforts to urge its adoption by the \nSenate.\n  With regard to the continuing resolution, I note that today is \nSeptember 30, the last day of the fiscal year. With our men and women \nin uniform fighting on two fronts, and with our economy at a critical \nstage in its recovery from the worst recession we have faced in several \ngenerations, it is inconceivable that we would allow for any disruption \nof the essential services provided by the Federal Government. We simply\n\n[[Page S9954]]\n\nmust pass this bill today and send it to the President for his \nsignature.\n  The continuing resolution before us is clean and does not contain any \ncontroversial provisions. It increases funding for our veterans health \ncare services in order to meet the needs of our wounded warriors \nreturning from Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  The continuing resolution increases funding for the Census Bureau to \nallow that agency to continue to ramp up its necessary activities prior \nto the 2010 census.\n  Mr. President, I note that the continuing resolution prohibits any \nfunding for ACORN, and it extends a number of necessary authorizations.\n  Finally, in order to cover a budget shortfall, the continuing \nresolution allows the Postal Service to reduce by $4 billion a payment \ndesigned to prefund retiree health benefits.\n  Continuing the operations of this government should not be a partisan \nissue. I note to my colleagues that in both 2006 and 2007, the Congress \nattached a continuing resolution to an appropriations conference \nreport.\n  In 2006, the Republican-led Congress passed the conference report and \nthe attached continuing resolution by a vote of 100 to 0.\n  In 2007, the Democrat-led Senate passed the conference report and the \ncontinuing resolution by voice vote.\n  When I assumed the chair of the Appropriations Committee, my first \npriority was to work with my colleague and vice chair, Senator Cochran, \nto return the appropriations process to regular order. This is a tall \norder given that we did not receive the administration's budget until \nMay.\n  Today, we have our second and third conferences scheduled with the \nHouse, and we expect to hold several more in the coming weeks. This \nshort-term continuing resolution will give us time to consider a good \nnumber of appropriations bills under the regular order.\n  Mr. President, we have more work to do to pass all 12 bills. But I am \nproud of the committee's efforts thus far, and I look forward to \nreporting continued progress throughout the month of October.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Legislative \nBranch conference report, which contains this short-term continuing \nresolution. I congratulate the chair and the ranking member.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to speak today once again \nconcerning the really astounding, irresponsible, unjustified increases \nin spending we have seen in this Congress. I don't believe this Nation \nhas ever seen anything like it in the non-defense area, and it is \nthreatening this country's long-term financial health. So I am going to \nfocus today on some of the appropriations bills considered in this \nChamber as well as the next highway trust fund bailout, which is in the \nworks.\n  I have some prepared charts, and my staff will bring those here in a \nminute, which will show the runup in appropriations spending we are \nseeing today, which is pretty much unprecedented in the history of this \nCongress.\n  Take for instance the agricultural appropriations over the past 8 \nyears. They are dramatic. We passed that recently. Agricultural \nappropriations increases were 14.5 percent in this year's \nappropriations bill over last year's. That would double the \nagricultural budget in 5 years if we maintained those increases. That \nis a stunning number. The average increase in agriculture spending was \n2.1 percent compounded over the 7-year period from 2003 to 2009. Yet we \nnow jump up, in this time of unprecedented deficits and debt, to where \nwe have a 14-percent increase. The 2.1-percent average we had from 2003 \nto 2009 was criticized by many as being excessive, but it was about the \nrate of inflation. As we know today, inflation is virtually \nnonexistent, and yet we end up with a 14-percent increase.\n  If you look at the Department of the Interior, those changes over the \npast 9 years are also dramatic. We just passed the Interior \nappropriations bill. Interior and EPA, the Environmental Protection \nAgency, have now been put together. Their increases were 16.6 percent \nin over the previous year in the 2010 Senate bill.\n\n  This chart just shows in graphic detail how agricultural spending has \ngone. I know my colleague from Nebraska believes in agriculture, and I \ndo, too, but this is one of the few times I have not been able to \nsupport an agriculture bill. We don't have the money to increase \nspending 14 percent.\n  President Bush, they said you spent too much on agriculture. We heard \nthat a lot, didn't we, I say to Senator Nelson. But it was pretty \nfrugal over the years. Here we have, in 2009, a 15 percent increase, \nand in 2010 a 14.5 percent increase in spending. Our debt today is so \nmuch greater than what we had in those years, it makes us wonder how \ndid we get here.\n  If you look at Interior, as I just mentioned, we see the same thing. \nThe Environmental Protection Agency has not always been a part of this \nfunding mechanism, but we worked hard to try to make sure we are \ncomparing apples to apples, and you see less than 1 percent in 2002, \n5.6, 1.6, a minus 1.3, minus 4.0, then 16 percent this year. I couldn't \nvote for that. I do not think our colleagues are listening to their \nconstituents back home. They know something is going awry up here. They \nthink we are detached from reality. Doesn't this chart suggest that \nthey are correct?\n  I will just mention the Environmental Protection Agency. Their \nincrease this year is 33 percent. That would double EPA's funding in 2 \nto 3 years.\n  Let me add, these funding levels do not count the largest \nappropriations bill in the history of America, which we passed in \nFebruary--wait a minute. I hear my wife right now: Jeff, would you quit \nsaying ``we'' passed, when you voted against it? The Senate passed $800 \nbillion. If you add the stimulus funding the Interior bill agencies \nreceived, that would add another $11 billion to their spending and take \nit to over a 50-percent increase.\n  So Interior got a lot of money out of the stimulus bill. This chart \nis not including the stimulus spending; this is baseline spending. So \nnext year, they will want an increase again and it will be on a much \nhigher baseline, a 16-percent higher baseline than the previous year.\n  I will get to this one next, the T-HUD appropriations, as we call it \naround here, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development.\n  Since the Transportation-HUD bill has only been around for 3 years in \nthis configuration, together, this is what we have been able to graph \nout for those two bills. The average of all discretionary \nappropriations increases for all appropriations bills that we have had, \nfrom 1995 to 2009, 15 years, averaged 5.2 percent compounded. So when \nyou see a 23-percent increase this year in the fiscal year 2010 bill, \nthat is over four times the 15-year average of appropriations for \ndiscretionary spending in our cup. At a 23-percent rate, spending on T-\nHUD would double every 3 to 4 years.\n  Next, let's look at Commerce-Justice-Science. Although CJS has also \nonly been around for the past three years, we were able to reconstruct \nthe funding levels for all agencies going back to FY2003. What we \ndiscovered was surprising. The average spending increases from 2003 to \n2009 for CJS was 4.4 percent. However, this year we have a 12.3-percent \nincrease in the baseline funding for the CJS bill. At that rate, \nspending in that CJS--Commerce-Justice-State spending would double \nevery 6 years, and that doesn't include the $16.9 billion CJS accounts \ngot from the stimulus legislation.\n  Finally, there is the State and Foreign Operations bill. The State \nand Foreign Operations has only been around together in this \nconfiguration for 3 years, and that is all we have been able to graph. \nHowever, we can once again compare it to the average of all \nappropriations increases for all the bills from 1995 to 2009, which I \nsaid was 5.2 percent.\n\n[[Page S9955]]\n\n  So the 33-percent increase in the fiscal year 2010 State and Foreign \nOperations bill is over six times the 15-year average increase for \ndiscretionary spending. At a 33-percent rate, the spending would double \nevery 2 to 3 years, at a time of unprecedented deficits.\n  This week, we are going to have the Legislative Branch appropriations \nbill, our budget. It increases spending at a 5.9-percent rate compared \nto fiscal year 2009. That is four times the rate of inflation excluding \nfood and energy, which, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, is \n1.4 percent for the last 12 months. So, excluding food and energy, we \nhave inflation at the rate of 1.4 percent, and we are funding our own \nselves in the legislative branch at a 6-percent increase. If you \ninclude the cost of food and energy--and there is some good news here: \ninflation has gone down, actually. We are in a period of deflation. It \nhas gone down 1.5 percent when you figure that over the entire year, \nincluding food and energy prices, which have dropped considerably from \nthe huge gasoline prices we remember not long ago. So if you add the \nstimulus and the supplemental funds from fiscal year 2009 to fiscal \nyear 2010 instead, you come up with an 8.2-percent increase.\n  So what is wrong with spending 23.2 percent or 16 percent more on \nthese bills than last year, or on the average? The simplest way to put \nit is, we don't have the money. We are going to have to borrow money to \ndo this spending. We borrow the money. It is not free money. We don't \nhave the power just to spend money. When we go into debt, we borrow the \nmoney, and people buy Treasury bills and notes, and we use that money \nto pay the debt, the shortfall between what we spend and what we take \nin in taxes. We are going to have to borrow money from a lot of people, \nbut China is our biggest loaner of money. Other countries lend as well.\n  Shortly after President Obama's inauguration, he released a budget \nentitled ``A New Era of Responsibility.'' Here are some quotes from his \npassage in that document:\n\n       Therefore, while our Budget will run deficits, we must \n     begin the process of making the tough choices necessary to \n     restore fiscal discipline, cut the deficit in half by the end \n     of my first term in office, and put our Nation on sound \n     fiscal footing.\n\n  That is a good statement. I just have to say that I am still looking \nto where those tough choices are going to be made. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, our independent source of information, the \nPresident's budget doubles the debt in 5 years and triples it in 10. \nThis is the Congressional Budget Office. This is a nonpartisan group, \nalthough our Democratic majority on the Budget Committee, of which I am \na member, has the votes to select the Director. Since the history of \nthe founding of this Nation, we ran up a total debt, national debt, of \n$5.8 trillion. According to the Congressional Budget Office, the \nPresident's budget would double it in 5 years, by 2013, to $11.8 \ntrillion, and in 2019 it would be $17.3 trillion, thus tripling the \nnational debt in 10 years. I know people do not think that is true, but \nthose are the numbers we have, and we are on track to get there. This \ndoes not include unprecedented increases in discretionary spending that \nwe are seeing on the floor of the Senate. It also doesn't include \nhealth care. This number was scored before we talked about spending $1 \ntrillion or more on health care additions.\n  I have to mention interest on the debt because the numbers are so \nlarge that people have difficulty comprehending them. People tell me \nthat all the time: A trillion dollars, I have difficulty understanding \nhow large that is.\n  What about interest? We know what it takes when you pay your mortgage \ninterest or your credit card interest. You have to pay the underlying \ndebt and then you pay the interest on top of that. Sometimes interest \ncan put you in the poorhouse.\n  This year, 2009, the interest on our total national debt is $170 \nbillion. That is a lot of money. Alabama's State budget, including \neducation, is about $15 billion. We are about one-fiftieth of the \nNation in size. Interest this year will be $170 billion, and it will go \nup dramatically. CBO scores the annual payment of the United States to \npeople we owe money to at the end of 10 years, as almost $800 billion. \nIf interest rates go up a little higher than they had projected, and \nmany have projected interest rates will go up higher, particularly the \nBlue Chip Forecast, which is a highly respected group of economists who \nforecast various things, they forecast it would be $865 billion because \nthey forecast a higher interest rate. And if we have what some people \nfear will occur, which is a surge in interest rates, as we had in the \nlate 1970s because of our irresponsible spending, it could hit $1.29 \ntrillion or $1,290 billion in interest.\n  So we spend about $40 billion a year on highways, we spend about $65 \nbillion in this Congress on aid to education, and we are going to see \nfrom $170 billion to $800 billion or more we have to pay in interest? \nThere is no free lunch. You can't borrow your way out of debt. When you \nspend money you do not have, you borrow it and you have to pay interest \non it.\n  We have low interest rates today. That seduced some of our masters of \nthe universe to say: Let's run up a little debt right now. Running up a \nlittle debt is one thing, but the interest rates are going to go up, as \nCBO projects. They are pretty low today because of the slow economy.\n  I am very concerned about this. What I am concerned about is our \nspending in these appropriations bills indicates we are oblivious to \nthis. This is reality. I am not making this up. This is reality, and \nthe American people intuitively understand it and they are really \nworried about it. I think they should be. We are the ones who seem to \nbe not connected to reality.\n  The President also stated these words in his budget submission \ndocuments:\n\n       Then there are the years that come along once in a \n     generation, when we look at where the country has been and \n     recognize that we need a break from the troubled past, that \n     the problems we face demand that we begin charting a new \n     path. This is one of those years.\n\n  It does seem apparent that we are having a break with our past. We \nare definitely seeing increases in spending, the likes of which we have \nnever seen before in our basic baseline appropriations bills. Even the \ndeficits I have mentioned assume not a recession in the next 10 years \nbut robust growth in the next few years and solid growth in the last 5 \nyears. Basically, the projections on the deficit and the interest rate \nwe are going to have to carry are greater.\n  And the deficits--let me share this with my colleagues. I get asked \nthis at townhall meetings: Well, when do we pay back the debt? When do \nwe pay it off? I am paying my mortgage. I pay principal and interest. \nWhen is the Federal Government going to pay back its debt? The answer \nis: We have no plan to do so. The only plan we have is to pay interest \nand increase the debt.\n  For example, this year the budget deficit has been estimated to be \n$1.8 trillion, the largest ever. Last year it was $450 billion. It is \n$1.8 trillion this year. The CBO forecasts that the lowest deficit, \nannual deficit, we will have in the next 10 years is over $600 billion.\n  How can you pay any debt down when the lowest deficit you are going \nto have is $600 billion? The best year they are projecting, we increase \nthe debt by $600 billion. Indeed, what is even more troubling is in the \nouter years, years 8, 9, and 10, the deficit is growing. In the 10th \nyear, they project that the deficit that will result from the \nPresident's spending policies would be over $1 trillion.\n  So there is no plan to pay this back. It is only a plan to increase \nthe total debt, which inevitably increases the interest burden that is \ngoing to fall on our children and grandchildren. We are reaching into \nthe future to pour money into today to satisfy our current needs \nbecause some say we are in a crisis and we have to get out of this \ncrisis; let's just spend money.\n  We are using that as an excuse to increase our legislative branch \nspending, our interior spending, our agriculture spending that, at \nbaseline level, is higher than anything we have ever done in recent \nmemory. Let's hope the scenarios I mentioned do not happen. I think it \nis possible. I have a lot of confidence in the American people that \nsomehow, some way their voice is going to be heard. There are going to \nbe some changes in Washington. If we do not do it ourselves, they are \nliable\n\n[[Page S9956]]\n\nto send someone up here to replace us who will do it.\n  But it appears that some of our major creditors are taking note of \nthe debt we are running up. Our creditors are looking at these numbers. \nThey are not oblivious to what is going on. There is a special kind of \nTreasury Bond that we sell to get people to loan the government money \ncalled treasury inflation-protected securities or TIPS. Unlike regular \nbonds that would be at a certain interest rate and that could be \ndevalued when inflation increases, TIPS adjust their value if inflation \ngoes up. So if people with a lot of money looking at these numbers, are \nthey betting that we will see inflation go up or are they expecting \ninflation to go down? It is pretty clear that they expect inflation to \ngo up because investor interest in the TIPS is soaring.\n  The Dow Jones Newswires reported September 13 that prices on TIPS \nhave risen 8.7 percent this year; whereas, the prices of regular \nTreasury bonds have shrunk by 2.6 percent.\n  Smart Money magazine reported September 23 that investors poured $8.5 \nbillion into TIPS in the second quarter of this year alone, double the \namount for the same period last year. The Wall Street Journal reported \nthe same day that investors have poured $17 billion into TIPS so far \nthis year; whereas, they purchased only $10 billion in TIPS all last \nyear.\n  Meanwhile, the Chinese, who are some of our biggest creditors, with \nmore than $800 billion in Treasury bonds, have expressed concerns about \ninflation here and have shown a corresponding interest in buying TIPS. \nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, they discussed TIPS at high-level \ntalks in Washington at the end of July.\n  The United Kingdom's Daily Telegraph, in an article entitled ``China \nAlarmed by U.S. Money Printing,'' on September 6, even quoted a top \nChinese Communist Party official lecturing the United States on \nspending and then quoting Benjamin Franklin to the Americans.\n  He said: ``He who goes borrowing goes sorrowing.'' How ignominious is \nthat, to be lectured on spending by Communists. Due to interest from \nboth the Chinese and others, the spread in the interest rates between \nthe 10-year TIPS and the regular 10-year Treasuries has grown from \nabout zero--they both had about the same rate of interest at the \nbeginning of this year--to nearly 2 percent.\n  That means one can get nearly a 2-percent better rate by buying \nregular Treasuries. But people still want TIPS. Why? Because they \nbelieve and are afraid that as the years go by, inflation is going to \nrise, and they will get more interest back by buying TIPS, even though \nit is 2 percent below the basic Treasury rate.\n  Meanwhile, the dollar is hovering at a 1-year low, partially because \nthe Fed recently decided to have interest rates unchanged at basically \nzero percent, and decided to extend through March its timeframe for \npurchasing $1.25 trillion in mortgage securities and $200 billion in \ngovernment agency debt.\n  The dollar has slid 6.2 percent this year on inflation fears, while \ngold has soared 15 percent. Gold goes up on inflation fears in the \nfuture.\n  Confidence in the dollar has sunk so low that the U.N. proposed \nreplacing the dollar as the global reserve currency in its U.N. \nConference on Trade and Development annual trade report, published \nSeptember 7. China has also expressed interest in an alternative \ncurrency.\n  Not only that, because of all this borrowing, we are about to hit our \n$12.1 trillion debt limit, which was last raised when? Not too many \nmonths ago, when we passed the $800 billion stimulus package in \nFebruary.\n  Our debt has increased by $1.1 trillion just since President Obama \nwas inaugurated. The Treasury Department has been holding record \nauctions of Treasury bills and notes to keep up with the deficit and \nthe debt.\n  Another aspect of the continuing resolution that we will be \nconsidering this week is yet another bailout of the Postal Service. \nThis is the third Postal bailout in 8 years. The Post Office was \nsupposed to be completely self-funding by now. But they still refuse or \nare unable to pay for their outyear benefits and expenses.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, they face about $95 \nbillion in total unfunded liabilities--$95 billion--which is why they \nare supposed to make payments that are being suspended by the \ncontinuing resolution. They are scheduled to make $5.1 billion in \npayments this year for the unfunded pension liabilities. But in this \nbill, we are letting them only pay $1.1 billion.\n  There is nothing free here. OK? We will let them not pay the full \namount. Those payments are to make their benefits actuarially sound. \nThis $4 billion in relief is in addition to the $7.1 billion that was \nprovided in 2003 and the $1.5 billion that was provided in 2006.\n  CBO, our Congressional Budget Office, says this is costly because it \nshifts money from future accounts to current expenses. But if we keep \ndoing this without structural reforms from the Postal Service, \ntaxpayers will wind up on the hook for a good portion of those unfunded \nliabilities.\n  Why is the Post Office in such a financially poor position? In terms \nof efficiency, labor costs consume 80 percent of their revenue; \nwhereas, UPS and FedEx spend 65 and 45 percent, respectively, on their \nlabor costs.\n  The Postal Service is nearly insolvent despite not paying any taxes. \nThey have to have some reform in the Postal Service. I am not going to \ngo into detail now, but a recent Federal Times article pointed out some \nof the inefficiencies. We cannot continue this.\n  Let's turn to the highway trust fund. We are going to be asked to \npass an extension of the trust fund spending. It struck me as perhaps \ncoincidental that our highway trust fund keeps running out of money \nyear after year after year. What is happening here? Why is it always \nrunning out of money? After all, the highway program is supposed to be \nfunded by the gas tax and to be deficit neutral.\n  However, last year we were told we had to borrow $8 billion from \npeople who loan us money, including China and Saudi Arabia and others, \nto replenish the highway fund. This year, we have already borrowed \nanother $7 billion to fix the shortfall.\n  Although the bill before us this week does not borrow additional \nmoney from the Treasury, it also does nothing to address the constant \ndeficit the trust fund faces. I am told the fund has been facing and \nwill face a deficit of about $10 billion a year, which means this bill \nis just kicking the can down the road, and we are going to be asked for \neither another bailout or a tax hike in the future.\n  We cannot savage the highway budget. We have to maintain a reasonable \nspending level for our highway budget. But we have not been going about \nthis responsibly. We are basically funding it by increasing our debt. \nThat is no way to go.\n  Some make the point that people are driving less and they pay less \ngasoline taxes. There is some truth to that. But the most recent \nauthorization bill, the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient \nTransportation Equity Act, contained a timebomb in it that created the \ncrisis we are in today.\n  It appears to have been written with the objective of drawing down \nthe highway trust fund rapidly to zero and perhaps beyond. The previous \nhighway bill had some safety mechanisms built into it to prevent \ndeclines in our revenue from bankrupting the trust fund. But the \nSAFETEA-LU weakened both of them, one known as revenue aligned budget \nauthority and one known as the Byrd test, to the point that they are \nbasically irrelevant today.\n  The combination of constantly increasing spending and disabled safety \nmechanisms to contain spending means that a crisis was almost \ninevitable. As early as April of 2006, the Congressional Budget Office \nwas predicting significant negative balances in the outyears of \nTransportation spending. But did we take any action to confront that \nlooming shortfall?\n  No, no action was taken either in the authorizing committees or the \nappropriations committees. The predictable gap between authorized \nspending and predictable revenue, a prediction that the highway trust \nfund will soon go bankrupt, which is where the balances hit zero and \nthe timebomb goes off. Despite predictions from CBO that this would \nhappen, to this day, no action has been taken by either the authorizers \nor appropriators to rein in spending or create the kind of revenues \nnecessary to sustain the program.\n\n[[Page S9957]]\n\n  Instead we are supposed to keep borrowing, borrowing, debt, debt, \ndebt. The excuses we keep hearing to justify these bailouts is that the \nhighway trust fund has been raided at various times in the past. But \nthat is not accurate.\n  It is inaccurate. According to the GAO, an independent agency, the \ngeneral fund paid for $39 billion in highway expenses from 1956 to \n1996. Including interest, these payments were worth $164 billion. So it \nseems that at best, the highway trust fund isn't owed anything, and at \nworst, it perhaps actually owes money to the general fund. In fact, GAO \ndetermined in that report that as of 1998, if the highway trust fund \nhad been forced to pay for all highway expenditures, it would have been \nin deficit $152 billion. We are not raiding the highway fund. We have \nbeen putting in extra money. Where did we get it? By borrowing more \nmoney and increasing our debt.\n  Those transfers didn't stop in 1997 either. Before the current series \nof bailouts began, Congress already provided for $31 billion in \ntransfers over 10 years from the general fund to the highway trust fund \nas part of the 2004 American Jobs Creation Act.\n  As I mentioned before, we have before us this week a highway trust \nfund extension that does nothing to help with the constant deficit in \nthe program except borrow more money to put into it. All it does is \nkeep spending at levels we know we don't have the money to sustain. In \nfact, if we keep spending at the current levels, the highway trust fund \nwill require $87 billion in bailouts from 2010 to 2019. I remember a \nfew weeks ago, in a stunning vote, Senator Vitter from Louisiana \noffered a fine amendment. We were told that the stimulus package that \nhad to be passed so quickly in February to save jobs was going to \nrebuild our crumbling infrastructure and our highway programs, creating \npermanent improvements that would benefit the Nation for years to come.\n  Most people perhaps missed the fact that less than 4 percent of the \n$800 billion that was appropriated in February went to highways. \nHundreds of billions of dollars of the stimulus bill have still not \nbeen spent. Senator Vitter said: We said we were going to use this \nmoney for highways. We are having a shortfall in the trust fund. It is \ngoing to cause serious repercussions in the transportation industry. \nLet's take the money and fix it on a more permanent basis, 18 months, 2 \nyears, and take the money from the stimulus bill that hasn't been \nspent.\n  I voted with Senator Vitter, but the amendment was voted down, the \neffect of which was to say that the Senate prefers to borrow the money \nnecessary to fix the highway trust fund and increase our debt rather \nthan using the money we basically told the American people we were \nsetting aside for highways. That was a very irresponsible vote. It \nspoke volumes. Basically, with few exceptions, the Democratic majority \nmade up their minds how they wanted to handle this shortfall which was \nincreasing the debt. They refused to consider taking it from the \nalready appropriated stimulus package.\n  Unfortunately, CBO scores are not the clearest when it comes to these \nbailouts. I am not sure that is all CBO's fault or the Budget \nCommittees'. One would think a bill that allows billions of dollars in \nadditional deficit spending would score as much. But according to the \nCBO, highway spending is discretionary; therefore, what matters in \nterms of the deficit is what is appropriated not what is authorized. Of \ncourse, if we ask the appropriators, they will simply say they provide \nwhat is authorized. For fiscal 2010, the appropriators provided what \nthey expected to be authorized by simply assuming that this extension \nof spending and eventual general fund transfer would happen. That is \none of the reasons there was an incredible 23-percent increase in \nspending in the Senate-passed bill.\n  The committees are playing a shell game with taxpayer dollars. \nSomebody has to step up and start taking responsibility for the \nseriousness of the situation. If we look at how much transportation \nspending has increased over the last 10 years and where it is expected \nto go, the 2005 highway bill provided $286 billion in spending over 5 \nyears and allowed spending to increase 23 percent over that 5-year \nperiod. The 2007 spending it provided represented a 92-percent spending \nincrease from 1997; 10 years, almost double. I offered an amendment in \n2005 to reduce that spending and fund it properly. It failed 84 to 16.\n  The House Transportation Committee apparently wants the next major \nreauthorization to spend $500 billion over the next 6 years. That is a \nper-year increase in spending of 46 percent.\n  One thing we are pretty unified on is that we need to adequately fund \nhighways. I thought we had unanimous agreement that the stimulus bill \nwould emphasize highways and bridges and roads and infrastructure, but \nit did not. But we still spent the money.\n  The reason we are not getting nearly as much jobs impact from this \nFederal stimulus package is too much of it is going to amorphous things \nthat don't create positive benefits and jobs. Regardless, the number we \nshow on this chart of the debt of the United States, projected to \ntriple in 10 years, is unsustainable. Everybody says that, but when do \nwe get serious? We are not getting serious in this year's budget. It is \nan unprecedented increase in spending.\n  The long-term budget the President submitted to us and what was \nessentially approved by this Congress shows it tripling in the next 10 \nyears, based on what their projections are for spending. I am troubled \nby it. We have to keep talking about this. We need to listen to what \nthe American people are telling us. If we do, we will be acting in a \nmuch more responsible way than we are today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the 12:30 \nrecess be extended so that I may finish a statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on the Senate floor this morning, there has \nbeen some debate about one of the provisions in one of the proposals \nthat will ultimately make up the health insurance reform bill, a bill \nthat will finally make it more affordable to live a healthy life in \nAmerica. I welcome such a debate. It is an important part of a \ndemocracy. It is how we do business in the Senate. I would like to take \na little time to respond.\n  My Republican colleagues made two primary points this morning. The \nfirst is that they were upset that we are helping the hardest hit \nStates in the country. It is hard to comprehend, but that is what they \nwere saying. The second is, they were upset that we want to address an \nurgent national problem such as the health insurance crisis.\n  Let's talk about them one at a time. First, Republicans are upset \nthat we are helping the hardest hit States. The specific section they \nmentioned would look at all States in the Union and see which are \nsuffering the most in our troubled economy, which citizens are \nsuffering the most from an unhealthy health care system, and make sure \nthese States' Medicaid Programs get the support they need to make \npeople's lives a little easier. The four States affected are Michigan, \nOregon, Rhode Island, and the State where I was born, Nevada.\n  Were these four States selected at random? No. Were they just picked \nout of a hat in the Finance Committee? No. Were they chosen to \nintentionally exclude 46 other States? Of course not. These States are \nsuffering more than most, and that is an understatement. Three of the \nfour are the top three in unemployment, and as national legislators, we \nknow our job is to help States in precisely that position.\n\n  First, Michigan. Time magazine this week: ``The Tragedy of Detroit.'' \nLook at this picture. I was in Detroit a few months ago. I am not an \nexpert on Detroit. I have been there a few times, but I was stunned by \nthe buildings\n\n[[Page S9958]]\n\nboarded up, the streets in distress. ``How a Great City Fell.'' That is \nwhat it says in Time magazine, a major feature article. Who can say \nthat Michigan is not bleeding? Who can say its Medicaid Program doesn't \nneed a hand? The cover of Time magazine shows a dilapidated city, \ndilapidated streets with debris covering the road and windows knocked \nout of abandoned buildings. It looks like a ghost town.\n  I am pulling for Detroit. I know I am going to upset everybody here, \nbut I was glad they beat the Redskins. They have lost so many games in \na row, they needed a lift. It is not going to hurt the Redskins to be \non the losing side of playing the Detroit Lions. I am pulling for the \nDetroit Tigers. They are a game or two ahead, and they might make it to \nthe playoffs. Detroit needs a little boost.\n  If we look at this cover--windows knocked out, debris covering the \nroads--it is like a ghost town. The cover reads: ``The Tragedy of \nDetroit.'' The State of Michigan is in trouble. Even Sports Illustrated \nput Detroit on its cover this past week and wrote about how the city is \ntrying to cope with its unparalleled plight. The cover stories in both \nthese national magazines tell the distressing tale of the largest city \nin our most populous States, a State where unemployment is more than 15 \npercent. Do Senators want to come here and say Michigan doesn't need a \nlittle shot in the arm? That is higher than any State in the country. \nThat is why we are supporting Michigan's Medicaid Program. That is what \nthis legislation is all about in the Finance Committee that people \ncomplained about today.\n  Second, Oregon. Oregon's unemployment is more than 12 percent. In \nMarch the unemployment rate was 12.1 percent, and many economists said \nthat was as bad as it could possibly get. Guess what. It got worse. Not \nonly did the unemployment rate rise, but the rate of underemployed \npeople in Oregon, those looking for full-time jobs who can only find \npart-time work, went up also. Together the unemployed and the \nunderemployed in the great State of Oregon is almost 23 percent. Yet \npeople are coming to the Senate floor saying Oregon doesn't deserve \nthis little shot in the arm they get from Medicaid. Almost a quarter of \nthe people in that State cannot find the work they want. That is why we \nare supporting Oregon's Medicaid Program.\n  Third, Rhode Island. Unemployment in that State is 12.8 percent. It \nhas been hit very hard by job losses, foreclosures, and evictions. In \nfact, last month a record number of Rhode Island residents sought \nemergency shelter. At no month in the 219-year history of that State \ndid more citizens seek emergency shelter than in August of this \nyear. That is tragic, and that is why we are supporting Rhode Island's \nMedicaid Program. People should be embarrassed to come and complain \nabout trying to help Michigan and trying to help Rhode Island with \ntheir Medicaid Programs.\n\n  Let's talk about Nevada. We have talked about Michigan, we have \ntalked about Oregon, and we have talked about Rhode Island. Let's talk \nabout my State, I repeat, where I was born, a State that was on a \nfinancial uptick for more than two decades. Well, there is not a single \nState in the Nation now that has felt the full force of the foreclosure \ncrisis like Nevada. We have led the Nation in foreclosures for 31 \nmonths in a row. Let people come and complain about trying to help \nMedicaid recipients in Nevada.\n  In the nationwide housing crisis that has been both a cause and an \neffect of the global economic crisis, Nevada has been hit the hardest. \nWe lead. It is nothing we are proud of, but it is true. On top of that, \nour unemployment rate is more than 13 percent. The people of Nevada are \nhurting, and I make absolutely no apologies, none, for helping people \nin my State and our Nation who are hurting the most.\n  Let me repeat, Mr. President, I make absolutely no apologies for \nhelping Michigan, Rhode Island, Oregon, and my State of Nevada. That is \nwhy we are supporting Nevada's Medicaid Program.\n  In fact, that is what our entire health care debate is all about: \nhelping those who are hurting. That is what our jobs are all about--\nyours, Mr. President, and mine--looking out for our constituents who \ngive us the incomparable honor of representing them and serving their \ninterests.\n  I said this before, but it bears repeating: The price of living a \nhealthy life in America is simply unaffordable with many people. Those \nwith health insurance are at the whim of insurance companies that look \nout only for their bottom line and drop patients left and right, even \nwhen they need coverage the most.\n  Those without health insurance are forced to file foreclosure, go \ninto bankruptcy, or simply succumb to curable diseases because of \nexorbitant costs and abusive policies. Those fortunate enough to have \nhealth insurance are already paying a hidden tax to cover those who do \nnot. Surely, that is no way for the wealthiest and greatest Nation in \nthe history of the world to treat its citizens. We should not do that. \nWe have to do better.\n  I said I wanted to comment on two points my Republican colleagues \nmade on the floor this morning. I have done one. The second is their \nobjection to how this bill is moving through the Senate. They are \ncomplaining it is moving too fast. That is a subject for a Jay Leno \ncomedy spot.\n  Since May 2008, the Senate Finance Committee has held 20 roundtables, \nsummits, and hearings on their proposal for fixing our health care \nsystem. They are complaining the process is going too slowly?\n  If I told you the Senate Finance Committee held more than 50 meetings \non their proposal for fixing our health insurance system--including \nmore than a dozen member meetings, hundreds of hours of negotiations \nwith the bipartisan group of six members of that committee--we have \nwatched that on national television over the last several months--well, \nyou could be excused, I guess, for thinking the other side is \ncomplaining that this process is moving too slowly.\n  If I told you the Senate Finance Committee is adding to that number \nas we speak, since it is now in its second week of marking up their \nproposal for fixing our health insurance system, you might assume the \ncomplaints are that the process should be sped up.\n  I could go on, Mr. President. If I told you when the HELP Committee \ndrafted its own proposal to fix our health care system, it held 14 \nbipartisan roundtables, 13 bipartisan committee hearings, and 20 \nbipartisan walk-throughs, you might think they are complaining that \nthis process is going too slowly. Hard to comprehend.\n  If I told you that committee accepted more than 160 Republican \namendments on the HELP bill, you might say the same.\n  If I told you we have known our health care system is headed for \ndisaster since Harry Truman was President, you might think the \ncomplaint is that we are taking too much time.\n  But here is the surprise: Republicans think this process is going too \nfast, not that it is moving too slowly. We have talked about all these \nhearings. Republican Senators are on the record saying they will vote \nagainst health insurance reform, even though they admit they do not \nneed to read the bill to draw that conclusion. Pretty good. But it is \njust another excuse.\n  They have all these diversions. They come up with them: death panels, \nfrightening people who are old in America, which is absolutely \nuntruthful. Not a scintilla of evidence that is true. Then they came up \nwith one: All these Democrats want to do is give insurance to illegal \nimmigrants. Absolutely false. And there are many other red herrings \nthey have thrown up along the way. It is just more evidence that for \nsome on the other side there will never be a good time for health care \nreform--never. It is just more proof they want to defend the status \nquo, refuse to take care of their suffering and struggling \nconstituents, and ignore the will of the American people. Their \naccusations are false, their complaints are disingenuous, and their \nrhetoric is dangerous.\n  Under the Republicans' plan, insurance companies can deny you \ncoverage for a preexisting condition, because you are getting old or \nyou are a woman. Under their plan, insurance companies can take away \nyour coverage when you need it the most. They want the status quo. That \nis what that is.\n  Under our plan, if you like what you have, you can keep it, but if \nyou do\n\n[[Page S9959]]\n\nnot, there will be affordable choices for you that cannot be taken \naway. We will protect Medicare, we will not raise taxes on the middle \nclass, and we will not add a dime to the deficit.\n  Mr. President, debates are great. But the reason--my being a trial \nlawyer--you have a judge determining what happens in a trial is because \nthe judge makes sure what takes place is honest from both parties. Here \nwe do not have that kind of a judge. So people can come to the floor \nand make the most false accusations, and it is up to us to explain to \nthe American people whether what they are saying is true. Just because \nsomeone comes to this floor and says something, it does not mean it is \ntrue. And the complaint of my friends on the other side of the aisle \nabout Michigan and Rhode Island and Oregon and Nevada getting special \nconsideration is false.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Chair to put the Senate in recess at this \ntime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9959-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

In fact, we violated one of our new ethics \nrules we talk so much about in the Senate and in the House where these \nconference bills cannot contain a provision that was not part of either \nthe House or Senate bill. We call that ``air dropping.'' But we air-\ndropped some significant things into this bill, violating our own \nethics rule.\n  First, we added a 1-month continuing resolution that funds our \ngovernment since we haven't finished our work here in the Congress, but \nwe also added a $4 billion bailout for the Postal Service into this \nconference report bill, again, violating our own ethics rule. The air-\ndropped provisions are undemocratic. There was no debate or \ntransparency. Like earmarks, it is another tactic politicians use to \nhave an end run around our constitutional limits.\n  It is also wrong for Congress to fund itself while allowing all other \ngovernment agencies to operate under a short-term continuing \nresolution. In 1995, President Clinton vetoed the legislative branch \nbill for this reason:\n\n       Congress should not take care of its own business before it \n     takes care of the people's business.\n\n  If we are going to pass a continuing resolution, it should cover the \nentire government until we can have a transparent process that the \nAmerican people can see. The only reason these tricks are pulled is \nthat politicians don't want people to see what we are doing.\n  Even worse than the process that has been used for this legislation \nare the policies contained within it. Around the country, families and \nbusinesses are having to tighten their belts because of the recession. \nMany are out of work. At the same time, we are increasing our budgets \ndramatically here. This legislative branch bill itself has increased \nnearly 6 percent versus last year, despite the growing debt and the \nserious economic problems we are having as a country.\n  Just a couple of statistics from the bill: We have increased spending \n128 percent for the House office buildings; a 155-percent increase for \nthe Government Printing Office; a 6.2-percent increase for the Senate \nwhip offices; a 4.3-percent increase for Senate leader offices; a 4.1-\npercent increase for Speaker Pelosi's office; a 4.3-percent increase in \nthe Vice President's office; and don't forget a $200,000 earmark for a \nmuseum in Nebraska.\n  If we were in prosperous times and had plenty of money, surpluses, \nthen perhaps some of these increases would make sense, but not at a \ntime when we see all Americans hurting and having to tighten their \nbelts.\n  This is one of the smaller increases compared to the ones that have \ngone through in the last couple of weeks. We are spending our Nation \ninto bankruptcy. Our debt is almost as large as our entire economy, and \ngrowing by $1 trillion every year. Long-term deficits for Medicare and \nSocial Security are more than $100 trillion. We have no idea how we are \ngoing to keep our promises to seniors. When will all this end?\n  The head of the World Bank, a former U.S. Trade Representative, is \nquestioning whether the U.S. dollar will long remain the world's \nreserve currency because of our spending and because of our debt. A few \nweeks ago I noted that some officials in Zimbabwe were concerned about \nAmerica, our spending and our debt, and what could happen to our \ncurrency. They have good reason to. A friend of mine who returned from \nZimbabwe brought me one piece of their currency. This is a 100 trillion \ndollar bill from Zimbabwe. It is so worthless he gave it away as a \nsouvenir. They are worried about our debt. We need to be worried about \nit too.\n  This bill also includes a $4 billion bailout for the Postal Service, \nthe third bailout they have gotten in 8 years. But the money is not \ncontingent on any reforms within the Postal Service, so the underlying \nwaste will continue and require another bailout in the next year or \ntwo. Why would we bail out the Postal Service without any requirement \nthat they reform their policies, the policies that have led to this \nmess? There are some very obvious things we could do. We could save $50 \nmillion by stopping paying employees an average of 45,000 hours of \nstandby time. We could close unnecessary post offices. There is a long \nlist of things we could do to reform the Post Office so that we don't \ncontinue to bail them out with taxpayer money, but there is nothing in \nthis bill about doing that. It is only another bailout, another \ngiveaway. So simply bailing them out will only prolong the problems and \ncost the taxpayers more money.\n  In sum, if we look at the legislative branch bill, it is bad policy, \nit has followed a bad process, and it continues this out-of-control \nspending and debt for our country. It does not deserve our vote.\n  I thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Does the Senator from Nebraska \nwithdraw his request?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Without objection, yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a little bit of time today \ntalking to my colleagues and the American people about where we are. I \ndon't know of a better description of where we are than this sign. The \nPresident said and some in the House have said that certain facts about \nhealth care reform are indisputable, but nobody will dispute this one: \nForty-three cents out of every dollar we spend this year, we borrow \nagainst the future of our children; 43 cents out of every dollar the \nFederal Government spends. What does that come to per family? What that \ncomes to is $15,603 per family--every family in this country--we \nborrowed against this year.\n  The reason I came down to the floor--I have a lot of problems with \nboth the CR and this bill, but I want to know where the leadership is \nin America today. We are in tough times, and if\n\n[[Page S9960]]\n\nthere ought to be one bill the Congress passes with no increase in \nspending, it ought to be the bill that pays for the things we do. The \nreason it ought to be that bill is because we ought to lead by example. \nWhat we are saying with this legislative branch bill is that, you know \nwhat, there is just not 5 percent to cut in our efficiency. Nothing \ncould be further from the truth.\n  Every year I have been here, I have been allocated a certain amount \nof money for my office. In no year have I turned back less than 18 \npercent of that money, 460-some thousand bucks. We didn't spend it \nbecause we know how to run things efficiently and effectively.\n  That is a misnomer for the Federal Government, as led by the Senate, \nas exampled by this bill.\n  So what have we done so far this year? Here is what we have done. \nHere is where the 2009 increases were, and here is what we are \nproposing this year. This doesn't take into account any of the money we \nspent in the stimulus or any of the money in the emergency \nappropriations we passed or that we wanted to increase the baseline.\n  Last year, we increased our own budget by 10.88 percent. Inflation \nwas minus last year; there was a negative inflation. So we had an \ninfinity, as far as recognizing the increase of our own budgets, \nbecause, in fact, the costs actually went down in America. CPI \ndeclined. This year, we are at a 1.4-percent CPI increase year over \nyear, from September 30 to September 30.\n  Legislative branch is almost three times what inflation is; Homeland \nSecurity, four times inflation; Energy and Water--because they got such \na large bump with the stimulus bill, we only increased it 1.41 percent. \nEvery other bill, such as Agriculture, is 12.68 percent; but if you \nlook at it, it is almost 22 percent. The THUD bill is 22.54 percent. \nInterior is 16.28 percent. Here is the inflation rate, 1.6 percent.\n  Where is the leadership? That is what the American people ought to \nask. I don't fault the chairman. He is given a number and he is \nsupposed to meet it. I fault our leadership. Things are never going to \nchange until we model the behavior that will set the example to cause \neverything else to change. When we don't have the self-discipline and \nthe courage to make hard choices in the running of our own offices and \nour own facilities, how can we ever expect anybody else in the rest of \nthe government to do that?\n  You heard Senator DeMint talk about what kind of shape we are in. Our \ndebt today is $11.790 trillion. That is going to double in the next 5 \nyears. It is going to triple in the next 10 years. Medicare is an \nunfunded liability. For Medicare alone, it is $89 trillion. What are we \ndoing? Why are we not--Democrats and Republicans alike--saying the \nproblem is in our leadership? The problem is the example we set. We \ncan't even hold our own expenses flat at a time when the rest of the \ncountry is making the most difficult choices. Every family and every \nbusiness is in tough times, and we are flying through it because we \ndon't have to lead by example. We don't want to make hard choices.\n  There is something lacking in America today. It is sorely lacking. \nThe trouble we are in isn't partisan. It is not one party or the other. \nIt is the combined leadership of this country that fails to recognize \nthe depth and severity of the problems before us, and then it is \ncompounded by not making the hard choices and leading by example to \ngive us a result that will change that path. No other appropriations \nbills have passed Congress. There have been no conference reports \npassed for this year. The one that we are going to pass is the one for \nus. That doesn't fit with any sense of reality to the average family in \nthis country.\n  Today, it was released that we have a 16-percent approval rating. \nThat is way too high. That is way too high. Leadership is about \nsacrifice, giving up something so somebody else can gain. We have none \nof it in any of these appropriations bills we have passed. But they \nhave not gone to the President because we don't have conference \nreports. Then we have the gall to bring in our budget at three times \nthe inflation rate for us and pass it as the only one. Everybody else \nwill be frozen, with minor exceptions, in the CR. Everybody else--the \nrest of the government--cannot plan. They don't know what they can do. \nBut we are going to make sure we take care of us. That is exactly why \nwe have a 16-percent approval rating.\n  I struggled a long time with whether I would seek my seat in the \nSenate again. Quite frankly, I came down to the fact that, other than \nthree or four of us, nobody in the Senate is speaking about the real \nlong-term problems. Nobody is thinking long term. What we are thinking \nabout is short-term parochial instances such as the $200,000 the \nchairman put in for his own State. It may be a great project, but now \nis not the time to do that. It sends a signal to the rest of America \nthat I am going to take care of me and the heck with you. It is the \nwrong message. Yet we are going to do it anyway. We are going to say: \nOh, well, never mind. It is a good cause, $200,000 doesn't matter.\n  When we are growing up, our parents try to teach us a lot of things. \nIt becomes the small things that are important. This legislative branch \nbill is a small bill compared to all the others we are going to pass. \nBut it is big on symbolism because this is never going to change until \nwe change. The symbolic act of passing this bill, where we are \nincreasing our own expenses three times the rate of inflation, when \nmost people in this country are spending less money on everything they \ndo, some by choice, some out of fear, and some out of absolute \ncircumstances that they have no control over--yet we pass a bill for us \nthat makes us look absolutely foolish in Americans' eyes. America gets \nit. We don't. This is an embarrassing time for us as a country. The \nreason is because there is a difference between what the American \npeople expect and want out of Congress and what we are delivering. It \nis not about Republicans or Democrats. People are scared. What is the \nfuture going to be like? I can tell you. If, in fact, we don't \nreestablish frugality and common sense in how we fund our expenses and \nevery other aspect of the Federal Government, what we will see is the \ndiminishment of the greatest magnitude of freedom this country has ever \nseen. We are starting to see it. Where do you think we got the 43 \npercent we are borrowing? We got most of it from people outside this \ncountry. They now have an influence over our ability to remain free \nbecause they control the money strings.\n  This isn't just a rhetorical statement. We know--and I put it on the \nfloor 10 times--nobody disputes that there is at least $350 billion \nworth of waste, fraud, and duplication in the Federal Government. Not \none time in any of the bills that have come through this Chamber have \nwe addressed the significant causes of those problems or addressed \nfixing it to right them. When we make amendments, they are defeated but \nnot on party-line votes; they get defeated by the appropriators. The \ngreatest power in the Senate is not Senator Harry Reid, it is the \nAppropriations Committee.\n  Consequently, when we try to fix the problem, we have a united front \nthat says parochialism and short-term thought is much more important \nthan the long-term future of the country, and our political positions \nare more important than the health of this Nation. Consequently, \ntonight, even after points of order will be raised--and I plan on \nraising some myself--we will pass this. Everybody will say the shower \nfrom Coburn is over and we can keep on doing what we have done.\n  America, don't let us get away with this. Don't let us lead by this \npoor example. Don't let us not sacrifice in our own offices so we can \ncreate the kind of leadership that is necessary to right this ship. \nThis is the worst display I have seen in my years of service in the \nCongress. It is not about the details. It is the very fact that we have \nthe audacity to take care of us before we take care of the rest of \nAmerica. We have the audacity to increase our own budgets, which are \nfat.\n  If I can turn back the large amount of money I turn back every year, \nand every office could do the same thing, we could cut significant \nmoneys from this bill. But we don't have the courage, the spine or the \nbackbone that every American family has today--the actual guts to make \nhard choices. So we ignore them because it is so easy to take the \ncredit card and say charge it to the next generation.\n  Yesterday, I heard Senator Schumer go after several members on the \nFinance Committee over Medicare. He\n\n[[Page S9961]]\n\nsaid: You can't be against this. You are for Medicare, aren't you? \nSure, Medicare is great.\n  The only problem is, the unfunded liabilities with Medicare are going \nto cripple our economy starting in 2017. Alexander Tyler said all \nrepublics die, all republics fail. They fail at that moment in time \nwhen the vast majority of the citizens of the republic figure out they \ncan vote themselves something from the Public Treasury.\n  Is it morally acceptable for us to continue to steal from our \nchildren? Is it morally acceptable to take opportunity away in this \ngreat land of freedom? Or will we sit back some day and tell our \ngrandchildren about what it used to be like to be free in this country? \nAll republics fail because all republics become deficit ridden.\n  It does not have to be that way for our country. Real leadership, \nreal courage, real clarity of character says that now is the time, \nwhether you are a Democrat or a Republican, to lead on the issues that \nwill solve the problems in front of this country. This bill doesn't do \nit. As a matter of fact, this bill conditions more apathy and less \nconfidence in the country and rightly so. We are not going to see that \nlevel of confidence come back to the Congress until we start paying \nattention to the long-term needs of this country and making those \ndecisions in a way that doesn't have any consideration of our political \nposition whatsoever, but every consideration about the truth, welfare, \nand long-term viability of our country. This bill doesn't do it.\n  The fact that this bill is used as a vehicle to fund the rest of the \ngovernment, and we put us ahead of everybody else, to me, sends a very \nclear message to America: It is time to change who is here. It is time \nto send new people here. It is time to have people who are more \ninterested in the country than their political careers or their party.\n  We example the worst of Washington politics and the worst of \nparochialism when we put us first and our desires first and our careers \nfirst, rather than the long-term viability of this country.\n  The CR contained in this bill violates the budget resolution--\nviolates 311 of the Budget Act. It is all over the place. Even though \nwe will raise points of order, we probably will not win. But when we \ndon't win on that, America, you ought to ask why didn't we win. It will \nbe because the Members of this body think more about their budgets than \nthey do yours. They think more about their comfort than they do yours. \nThey think more about their future than they do yours. It is very easy \nto solve this situation. What should happen is the legislative branch \nshould be frozen like everybody else in the country, and we should pass \nbills coming out of conference committee as soon as we can, and we \nought to work hard on doing that. Then we ought to pass a CR tonight \nthat is free of this, that doesn't violate the Budget Act.\n\n  I want to make one more point talking about the $4 billion and the \npostal provisions. There are a lot of great people who work for the \nU.S. Postal Service. There is no question about it. They are a victim \nof technology today more so than anything else. The fact is we use \nelectronics rather than the mail, and the first-class mail volume and \nthe volume for second and third-class items is going to go down. There \nis nothing the post office is going to be able to do to turn that \nrevenue around. There is nothing. And that is not the average postal \nworker's fault. But the postal portion that came out of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee contained a very key component that has been ignored \nin this CR, and that was this: the negotiation of labor rates in this \nnext round. Heretofore, they have never taken into consideration the \nfinancial health of the post office. Some of us find that kind of \nstrange, but they never have. But there was an amendment that was \nagreed to in the committee that said: This time, when you arbitrate the \nlanguage for the postal service employees, you have to consider the \nhealth of the post office, because that is where the revenue comes. \nWell, that has been conveniently left out of this CR. It passed out of \ncommittee. Yet we didn't put it here.\n  What does that mean for the post office? That means when we go to \nnegotiate the labor agreements, the fact the post office is going to \nlose $8 billion or $10 billion next year--they will lose at least $8 \nbillion this year, maybe even $12 billion or $14 billion next year--\nthere won't be any consideration given in evaluating the labor \ncontracts. Any other business whose revenue is declining rapidly that \nignores the revenue side and ignores expense increases is sure to fail.\n  As Senator DeMint said, this is the third time in 5 years we have \ntried to put a patch on the U.S. Post Office, and this patch is only \ngoing to last for 1 year. It is not going to solve anything. We are \ngoing to ignore the hard choices that need to be made both by the \npostal employees and the post office in order to fix this so it is not \na drain.\n  That is what I am talking about--the failure to lead. We duck the \nhard problems. We don't want to offend anybody. What we have to do is \nto start thinking long term. We have to start being about a vision of \nAmerica that is financially healthy, and we have to swallow the hard, \ntough medicine of getting there.\n  We are setting an example with this bill that says we don't care; it \ndoesn't matter. So America is disgusted. And that is what it is when 16 \npercent have confidence in us. I guarantee a large percentage don't--84 \npercent. A good portion of that is disgust with us. You know what. I am \ndisgusted too. I know the individuals in this body. They are great \npeople. But there has to be a change in the dynamics of the thought and \nthe reasoning or we are going to suffer the consequences. Actually, we \nare not; our kids are. They are going to suffer the consequences.\n  I will end with this point. If you were born today--September 30, \n2009--in this country, the first present you get for your birthday is \nan IOU for $400,000. Because when you take all our unfunded liabilities \nand apply to it the living segment of Americans over the next 70 years, \ntheir portion of our indiscretion is $400,000. It just takes simple \nmath: Take 5 percent interest--and none of us can probably borrow any \nmoney at 5 percent interest--and that is $20,000 a year for the first \n20 years of their life they are going to have the pay the interest on. \nSo what does that come to, 20 years times $20,000? Now we are at \n$800,000 before they are out of college.\n  How in the world will they ever own a home? How will they ever send \ntheir kids to college carrying that kind of load? There is one of two \nanswers to it: We either enter into the real world and start making the \nhard decisions and fixing the programs that are broken and eliminating \nthe waste, fraud, and abuse, or we devalue our currency and everybody's \nassets in this country are going to shrink by about another 30 percent \nin terms of their real value.\n  That is the answer.\n  But those are inconvenient truths. We don't want to talk about them. \nWe don't want to talk about the consequences of our actions. A former \nPresident said: Freedom is a precious thing. It's not ours by \ninheritance alone. It is never guaranteed. It has to be fought for and \ndefended by each and every succeeding generation.\n  How do you fight for freedom when you owe $800,000 and you are not \nout of college yet? How do you do that? When will we start to take the \nshackles off the next two generations? When will we start to eliminate \nthe burden of our excesses on our children?\n  We are not far from a time when it is going to be too late to reverse \nthis course. The international financial market is signaling that now. \nWouldn't it be wise for us to lead with courage, to make tough choices, \nand truly secure the freedom of our children and grandchildren?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nduring the quorum call be equally divided between the majority and the \nminority.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S9962]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Sanders). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  South Pacific Earthquake and Tsunami\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, before I turn to the Legislative Branch \nappropriations bill and the continuing resolution that is under \ndiscussion, I wish to take a couple of brief moments to speak about the \nvery devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit American Samoa, also \nSamoa, Tonga, and the other islands that are in the region, and offer \nmy thoughts and prayers to those who have lost loved ones in this \ndisaster.\n  As we saw yesterday, an earthquake in the range of 7.9 to 8.3 in \nmagnitude occurred about 120 miles from American Samoa. It was followed \nby three aftershocks, all of about 5.6 in magnitude. These are \nincredible earthquakes we are seeing. Even the aftershocks are \nenormously significant. When we think back to the earthquake that hit \nAlaska in 1964, it was about 7.9 on the Richter scale. We in Alaska \nremember that most vividly.\n  To appreciate what American Samoa and the islands in the region have \nbeen hit with--it is incredible. According to the media reports, these \nearthquakes caused four tsunami waves approximately 15 to 20 feet high. \nThey struck the island 25 minutes after the quake, reaching up to 1 \nmile inland. There are reports from residents on the island that the \nquake lasted 2 to 3 minutes. That is an eternity when the earth is \nrocking underneath you, and then to know that these tsunamis came in so \nquickly after those earthquakes. I understand that as of this morning \nthere are 24 confirmed deaths in American Samoa and many more in Samoa, \nTonga, and the other islands. This number is likely to rise as many \nindividuals remain missing and unaccounted for. The President has \ndeclared American Samoa a major disaster area, and we have FEMA teams \nthat are heading to the area now.\n  To those who have family members and loved ones in American Samoa, \nthe White House and FEMA will be holding a teleconference this evening \nat 7 o'clock p.m. eastern time. Hopefully, we will have more \ninformation available at that time. I understand that few landlines are \nworking and getting updates has been difficult. As far away as Alaska \nis from American Samoa, we have a surprisingly large Samoan and Tongan \npopulation in my State, so I know there are people at home in Alaska \nwho are worried about their families and their loved ones. Hopefully, \nwe will have more updates on that.\n  Again, my thoughts and my prayers go out to those who have lost loved \nones and to those in American Samoa affected by this terrible event.\n  Mr. President, I want to speak this afternoon on the conference \nreport that is accompanying H.R. 2918, the Legislative Branch \nappropriations bill, as well as the continuing resolution for fiscal \nyear 2010.\n  Before I speak to the specifics of the legislative branch agreement, \nI would like to make clear my very strong objection that this \ncontinuing resolution that will be part of this was made part of the \nlegislative branch conference report. This was done at the last minute. \nIt was done at the direction of the House majority. It precludes \namendments and careful consideration of all the issues.\n  The conferees were not offered an opportunity to concur in this \nprocess. This is what is known around here as air-dropping, where new \nmaterial, new matter is inserted into a conference agreement that has \nnot been considered by either body. We didn't take it up in the Senate. \nThey didn't take it up in the House. What we have in front of us is a \npretty onerous example. We have rules here in the Senate against air-\ndropping. I think we have good reason for those rules.\n  While it has been said that this is a clean CR, certainly there are \nitems that are contained within this CR that represent important policy \ndecisions and go beyond simply funding the Federal Government for \nanother month. Provisions in this so-called clean CR include one \nrelating to the Postal Service. This is Postal Service reform. The \nauthorizing committee has been working on this for some time. There is \nanother example related to the extension of surface transportation \nreauthorization.\n  We had time a week ago to take a freestanding continuing resolution \nthrough the normal process in both the House and in the Senate. We \nwould have been able to present that bill to the President before the \nend of today, before the end of our fiscal year. I am very disappointed \nthat normal process was not followed.\n  As I understand it, the reason this occurred was the House majority's \ndesire to prevent its minority from offering motions to recommit the \nbill.\n  So here we are, last day of the fiscal year, and we clearly have to \ncontinue the critical operation of the Federal Government. But I do \nwant to make clear this was not the right process for us to follow.\n  I have enjoyed the opportunity I have had to work with my chairman on \nthe Legislative Branch Appropriations Subcommittee. We worked hard to \nproduce an appropriations bill that we believed was reasonable and fair \nand balanced. We greatly reduced the scope of the budget, and we \nfinished our work in a timely manner. We had some very substantive \ncommittee hearings. It was a good process. I was pleased in that \nprocess.\n  So it seems more than a little bit troublesome that we, with a very \nsmall appropriations bill coming out of the Legislative Branch \nSubcommittee, working quite concertedly to make sure we did work the \ncommittee process in an appropriate manner, should be hung with the \ncontinuing resolution at the very end. It is more than just a bit \nironic.\n  At this time I would like to speak to the Legislative Branch portion \nof this conference report. Again, I want to thank my chairman, Senator \nNelson, for his work. I also want to recognize and thank the full \ncommittee chairman, Senator Inouye, and our ranking member, Senator \nCochran, for the support they provided in getting the Legislative \nBranch conference put together.\n  Aside from the continuing resolution I just mentioned, I think it is \nfair to say our conference was without controversy. The final agreement \nmeets the high priority needs of our legislative branch.\n  Now, Senator Nelson and I are both new to the Appropriations \nCommittee, and we worked well together on this. We did our best to see \nthat the legislative branch served as a model for others within the \nFederal Government. We worked to tighten our belt wherever possible. We \nfunded only the highest priority initiatives.\n  In looking at the appropriations bill itself, funding for the \nlegislative branch totals $4.65 billion, and while the agreement is $44 \nmillion over the level the Senate passed, the increase is due to items \nthat the House had included. We were able to make reductions below the \nSenate-passed level in certain areas, such as our Senate office \nbudgets.\n  The bill is about 4 percent over fiscal year 2009. This is a big \nimprovement, considering that when they came to us initially with the \nrequest for the legislative branch it was about a 15-percent increase. \nSo we were able to scale it back.\n  The conference agreement enables us to meet the highest priorities \nthat have been identified by the Architect of the Capitol, in looking \nat health and safety, building improvements, particularly in the \nLibrary building and the projects that reduce the deferred maintenance \nin our buildings.\n  We recognize if we do not address deferred maintenance, it does not \ngo away; it continues and, unfortunately, that pricetag continues as \nwell.\n  The bill continues the efforts of the Architect of the Capitol to \nimprove energy efficiency with over $14 million in funding designated \nfor this purpose. Also, within the Library of Congress, we managed to \ninclude funding to begin to update the agency's information technology \ninfrastructure.\n  For about a decade, there have been no increases to IT within the \nLibrary. Yet most of the users of the Library are virtual users. I had \nan opportunity, a couple of weeks ago, to meet with Dr. Billington, the \nLibrarian of Congress. He was showing me some of the incredibly \nhistorical documents, old maps\n\n[[Page S9963]]\n\nfrom the 1800s from Russia where they were mapping Alaska. Some \ndocuments we looked at, the only way I would ever have an opportunity \nto view them is if I were able to visit the Library of Congress.\n  Well, now, most of that, much of that incredible history is available \nthrough the Internet. So Alaskans, in a classroom thousands of miles \naway, can access the treasures we have within our Library of Congress.\n  The information technology infrastructure was clearly Dr. \nBillington's highest priority. I believe this investment will ensure \nthat millions of people who access the Library through its Web site \nwill be able to find what they are looking for. It is phenomenal.\n  Similarly, within GPO, the Government Printing Office, we funded the \nfinal increment for updating GPO's Web site to ensure that government \npublications can also be easily accessed and searched.\n  Also, the bill provides the final increment of funding to complete \nthe merger of the Library of Congress Police into the Capitol Police. \nThis is a project that was initiated years ago by Senator Bennett when \nhe was chairman of the subcommittee about a decade ago. It has been \npromoted by each of the successive chairs and ranking members to \nimprove the security of the Capitol Complex. Today, the Library of \nCongress Police officially join with the Capitol Police in a ceremony \nthat is taking place this afternoon at the Library.\n  So this is good news for them. Congratulations need to go out to the \nmen and women of the Capitol Police and the Library Police who worked \nvery hard to ensure that this initiative happened relatively \nseamlessly.\n  So there are good initiatives within Legislative Branch \nappropriations. I am pleased to have been able to work with Senator \nNelson closely on these, and I am pleased with the product we have \nmoved through our subcommittee.\n  Were it not for the add-on that we had just last week, I would be \nstanding before you and saying this is almost a perfect product. We \nrecognize we must deal with the ongoing funding of our Federal \nGovernment. It is the last day of the fiscal year, and a continuing \nresolution must advance.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask \nunanimous consent the time be divided equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Defense Appropriations\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor essentially to \noppose the McCain amendment to the Defense appropriations bill, which \nwould stop production of the C-17 Globemaster III Airlifter.\n  The McCain amendment would cut funding approved by the Appropriations \nCommittee to maintain an important national asset in the C-17 program.\n  Without the inclusion of this funding, the production line would \nbegin to shut down this year, and the last plane would roll off the \nline in mid 2011, as opposed to mid 2012 if these additional 10 planes, \nwhich are in the Defense bill, are, in fact, funded.\n  I believe the funding is important, and the risk of losing the \nproduction line without filling the C-17 need is real. The concern is \ntiming. If this amendment passes, suppliers will be notified within \nmonths that their contracts have been terminated. It will become \nvirtually impossible to restart production.\n  By then it will be too late to take into account the impending \nQuadrennial Defense Review, the QDR, and a Mobility Capabilities \nRequirement Study which will assess whether, in fact, we truly have \nenough C-17s in the fleet. It is my view that failure to fund this \naircraft would be a tremendous blow to the future readiness of the \nmilitary.\n  Now, why do I say that? The C-17 has been essential to our combat \noperations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as humanitarian missions \nworldwide.\n  It is the most flexible and versatile transport in the U.S. military \ntoday and the only one capable of flying troops and cargo directly from \nair bases here to the front lines of Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  Even more important is what the C-17 carries on the way back from the \nfront line. It is a vital component of aeromedical evacuations of our \ntroops to Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany.\n  Finally, it should not be forgotten that the C-17 contributes to \npeacekeeping and humanitarian relief missions worldwide. It has become \na welcome site to victims of the tsunamis in Asia and the victims of \nhurricanes along the gulf coast. But that alone is not enough to \njustify it. Simply put, as former Air Force Chief of Staff, GEN Mike \nMoseley, has said: ``The C-17 is worth its weight in gold.''\n  With so many capabilities and so many complimentary things said about \nit, it is no surprise the Air Force has been ``flying the wings off the \nC-17.''\n  To make this point, let me read from the House committee report for \nthe 2010 Defense appropriations bill.\n\n       The C-17 is the workhorse of the theater, flying 50 percent \n     of all sorties for the U.S. Transportation Command over the \n     last 24 months. While the aircraft is designed to fly 1,000 \n     hours per year over 30 years, over the last 10 years the C-17 \n     fleet has averaged 1,250 hours per aircraft, with some \n     aircraft flying in excess of 2,400 hours in a single year.\n\n  That is over 200 percent more. This heavy usage is reducing the \nexpected service life of the aircraft.\n  So what does this mean? It means C-17s are being utilized much more \nthan anticipated. It means the C-17 is carrying more of the workload \nthan expected. It means C-17s flown today may not be available for as \nlong as we thought they would.\n  This brings us to the second issue. If not the C-17, what are the \nother options available?\n  The C-17 is a complement to a decades-old military transport, the C-\n5. The oldest C-5As are an average of 39 years old and will require \nliterally billions of dollars in engine and avionics upgrades to keep \nflying. We don't yet know the exact cost, but as with many \nmodernization programs, it will likely only go up.\n  The GAO clearly stated last year that DOD would need to fully \nmodernize seven C-5s to attain the equivalent capability achieved from \nacquiring one C-17 and the cost would be three times more. So we need \nto modernize seven C-5s at three times the cost of a new C-17 to get \nthe equivalent capability of one C-17. This makes no sense to me.\n  The C-5A has been unreliable, with a readiness rate barely over 50 \npercent. The Air Force has been asking for years for authorization to \nretire some of the aircraft. As those aircraft are retired, the C-17 \nwill be expected to cover the gap left behind.\n  So we have to ask: How are taxpayer dollars better spent? Are they \nbetter spent maintaining and upgrading a 40-year-old, unreliable \naircraft at three times the cost, or are they better spent adding C-17s \nto an already overtaxed fleet? I believe the answer is clear.\n  Those in Congress who advocate for shutting down the line are doing \nso prematurely.\n  Later this year, a Mobility Capability Requirements Study will be \nreleased that will address the future airlift needs of the military. \nOne thing we know this country lacks is strategic lift. By that I mean \nto rapidly move troops and equipment to wherever those troops and \nequipment are needed. The staging of a military operation takes time \nbecause we lack strategic lift.\n  The Department of Defense is also actively working on the next \nQuadrennial Defense Review which will take a comprehensive picture of \nwhat tools our forces will need in the coming years.\n  Previous studies that have analyzed our airlift needs did not take \ninto account planned increases in the number of Army and Marine Corps \npersonnel.\n  We have more troops that need to be moved, including 30,000 \nadditional personnel authorized by the Senate during consideration of \nthe Defense authorization bill in July. These studies also did\n\n[[Page S9964]]\n\nnot take into account new combat vehicle programs for the Army as well \nas the needs of the new Africa command.\n  All of this has to be figured into this mobility review. In fact, the \nGAO has expressed concern about the calculations used by the Defense \nDepartment's previous studies and recommended significant changes for \nthe next mobility capabilities study.\n  The GAO also found that because the Department of Defense did not \nidentify specific airlift requirements in its previous mobility \ncapabilities study, it could not determine how the DOD concluded that \nthe current number of C-5s and C-17s was adequate. That is the basis on \nwhich the Pentagon has weighed in saying we will do with what we have, \nin essence. The GAO is saying that no specific airlift requirements in \nthe previous study were even considered on which one could base a \nrecommendation such as ``leave it as it is.''\n  To me, this indicates we are not in a position to shut down the last \nstrategic airlift production line in the country.\n  I understand this has been identified as a congressional jobs \nprogram. To a great extent, I disagree with that view. There are many \nof us who have followed the C-17 program for years. We know what a \nmistake it would be to end production of this aircraft prematurely.\n  The distinguished chairman of the Defense Appropriations Committee, \nSenator Inouye, agrees. Therefore, the committee has added these 10 \nplanes, $2.5 billion in the bill for these 10 additional C-17s.\n  In his introductory statement for this bill, he identified other \ntimes the Defense Department was wrong to determine a program \ntermination, and he listed the F-117 stealth fighter, which was a great \ntool in fighting in the Gulf War and Bosnia; the V-22 Osprey, now a \nfavorite of the Marine Corps; and Central Command, which the Department \nproposed eliminating.\n  It is clear the Department of Defense doesn't always get it right. \nAlready we know we may be faced with a White House request to add \nanother 40,000 troops that will need to be air lifted to Afghanistan. \nWhether that happens or not, I don't know. But I do know we have a \nremaining 8,000 to complement the 60,000 already there who need to get \nto Afghanistan before the end of the year.\n  Earlier this year, the administration fought hard against programs \nthey felt were not necessary. This included aircraft such as the F-22 \nwhich, it was argued, was not being used in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nInstead they advocated for systems that support the current missions of \nthe military. That is what the C-17 does.\n  The C-17 is being used at 125 percent of its anticipated flying hours \nin support of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is the only aircraft \ncapable of flying many of the missions the Air Force is asked to fly. \nThat is exactly the kind of system we need more of. It takes troops, \nsupplies, equipment directly to the front lines where it can land on \nunpaved runways and on runways nearly half the length of those needed \nto land a C-5. That is a real asset because it means we get closer with \nthe troops, the supplies, the equipment to where they need to go.\n  Finally, from a business perspective, keeping the line open preserves \nthe option for several other countries to purchase C-17s of their own.\n  Other governments are actively pursuing contracts to buy C-17s. The \nopportunity to maintain good-paying U.S. jobs would be lost if the line \nis shut down. Ten planes, one plane a month, essentially keep the line \nopen for approximately an additional year over when it would shut down \notherwise.\n  When I think where our military investment should go, I agree it \nshould go toward ensuring we have the capability to bring our troops \nand supplies to where they must fight and where they are needed, to \nbring our injured servicemembers to the medical care they require, and \nto maintain a program that sees heavy use in supporting the wars we are \nfighting today.\n  This is exactly the wrong time to remove these 10 C-17s which are \nalready in the Defense appropriations bill. The future is uncertain. It \nis uncertain with respect to Afghanistan, with respect to Pakistan, \nwith respect to Iran, with respect still to Iraq, with respect to a \nnumber of other places in the world.\n  Where we are short is strategic airlift. The most efficient, most \neffective airlifter we have is the C-17. I strongly support its \ninclusion in this bill, and I thank the chairman of the Appropriations \nCommittee, the distinguished Senator from Hawaii, Daniel Inouye.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business \nfor up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      praising nicole nelson-jean\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise once again to recognize the \nservice of one of America's great Federal employees.\n  In recent months, President Obama has spoken of his vision of a world \nfree from the threat of nuclear weapons. While nuclear disarmament \nremains a long-term project, there are important steps already being \ntaken right now toward that goal.\n  The public servant I will speak about today has already distinguished \nherself as a top-notch negotiator on nuclear proliferation issues for \nthe Department of Energy.\n  When Nicole Nelson-Jean was just 28 years old, she led a delegation \nof Energy Department negotiators in an effort to secure Russian nuclear \nmaterials in Siberia. Based out of our Embassy in Tokyo, Nicole had to \novercome the skepticism of her Russian counterparts, who were not \naccustomed to negotiating with someone her age. Remember, she was 28. \nBut she quickly won their respect and developed a working relationship \nthat enabled them to move forward on technical assistance and create a \njoint training and service center in the Russian Arctic for securing \nnuclear material.\n  After this achievement, Nicole was made director of the Department of \nEnergy's Asia Office. She distinguished herself in that position for 2 \nyears, also serving concurrently as energy attache to our ambassador in \nJapan.\n  In 2006, Nicole was tapped to head the Global Threat Reduction \nInitiative for North and South America which runs projects in over 90 \ncountries to remove radiological material from nuclear reactors and \nreconfigures them from processing weapons-grade highly enriched uranium \nto those processing the type used for peaceful purposes.\n  Following her success in that role, Nicole was appointed to serve as \nDirector of the United States Mission to the International \nOrganizations in Vienna, Austria. While there, she helped secure \npassage of the IAEA's Nuclear Security Resolution, which is now the \ncentral international statute used to prevent nuclear terrorism.\n  When asked about her work as a public servant, Nicole said: \n``Personally, I don't think that there's anything more important than \nthe national security of our country,'' and that ``service is in my \nblood.''\n  Earlier this summer, Nicole returned to the United States to begin a \n10-month program at the National Defense University as a counter-\nterrorism fellow.\n  She is just one of countless Federal employees who, even though they \nare highly educated and experienced, continue to immerse themselves \nacademically in their career fields.\n  As I have stated before from this desk, our Federal employees combine \ngreat intellect and a passion for service. The result is a Federal \nworkforce that excels.\n  Without Nicole and those like her, our government could not carry out \nthe policies, such as nuclear arms control, that keep the American \npeople safe and free.\n  I call on my fellow Senators to join me in thanking Nicole Nelson-\nJean and all the outstanding men and women of the Department of Energy \nfor their contribution to our Nation.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S9965]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, during the intervening time allowed that I \nhave been allocated, I intend to speak on two issues. One is the point \nof order under rule XXVIII against the pending legislation, H.R. 2918, \nthe Legislative Branch Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2010. The \nother issue I wish to speak about is the amendment I have pending that \ncalls for the $2.5 billion that has been appropriated for the \nacquisition of unneeded and unwanted C-17 aircraft to be allocated to \noperations and maintenance which has been cut by some $3 billion, \nwhich, obviously, is vitally important to the men and women who are \nserving in the military so they have the proper equipment and \ncapabilities to defend our Nation in the two wars in which we are \nengaged and around the world.\n  First, I will raise a point of order--and I will formally raise it \nwhen the manager chooses for me to do so--so this legislation is not \npermitted to proceed to full consideration. Specifically, as is known, \nrule XXVIII is a rule that precludes conference reports from including \npolicy provisions that were not related to either House or Senate \nversions of the legislation as sent to conference. This $4.7 billion \npiece of legislation was bloated enough; however, conferees took this \nopportunity to airdrop into the bill's conference a ``continuing \nresolution'' to continue funding the operations of the government \nthrough October 31, having, obviously--certainly not according to the \nrules of the Senate--any relation to the appropriations bill. By \nincluding a CR or continuing resolution, we are precluded from offering \namendments to modify it.\n  That is why we have the rule that you don't put these things in \nconference reports because it then inhibits and actually prohibits \nMembers from trying to amend and perfect the legislation. So it is a \ndirect assault on how we do business in the Senate, by adding a very \nmammoth piece of legislation to what is a very small piece of \nlegislation designated to allow the legislative branch to receive the \nfunding it needs.\n  It is particularly troublesome, since conferees are treating the \nresolution as a Christmas tree--reauthorizing and extending several \nprograms; forgiving billions of dollars of the Postal Service's debt; \nincreasing funding for the Census Bureau--and not simply just a stopgap \nmeasure to allow the government to continue operating at last year's \nlevels. Specifically, the continuing resolution provides $3.9 billion \nmore than last year for the Census Bureau; $3.85 billion more than last \nyear for the Veterans Health Administration; it frees up funds for the \nPostal Service that is severely in the red by lowering the payment it \nmust make into the trust fund intended for future retiree health \nbenefits, which are obligations, to $1.4 billion from $5.4 billion last \nyear. It extends the authorization for the highway program; \nintelligence program; stop-loss payments to U.S. troops; restrictions \non funding to Guantanamo Bay; housing assistance programs; flood \ninsurance programs; religious worker, physician, and investor VISA \nprograms; use of e-verify and much more.\n  I wish to warn my colleagues: If we allow this kind of procedure to \ngo forward in the Senate, it will deprive every single Member of the \nSenate of his and her right to amend legislation because, unless this \npoint of order is upheld, we have only two choices: a ``yea'' vote or a \n``nay'' vote, up or down. That flies in the face of the fundamentals \nupon which the Senate functions.\n  You may be in favor of all these programs. You may think we need, \nright away, $3.9 billion more for the Census Bureau. You may think we \nneed--and we probably do--more money for the Veterans Health \nAdministration. Who is going to oppose more money for the Veterans \nHealth Administration if it is brought up as a single bill? Certainly \nnot this Member and not anybody I know. But what we are doing here, by \nputting the continuing resolution as part of the least controversial of \nall appropriations bills, is setting very dangerous precedence for this \nbody. My colleagues should have no doubt about it.\n  There is a little book we give out all the time. We give it out all \nthe time. We send it to schoolchildren all over America. It is called \n``How Our Laws Are Made.'' On page 43 it says:\n\n       The House conferees are strictly limited in their \n     consideration of matters in disagreement between the two \n     Houses. Consequently, they may not strike or amend any \n     portion of the bill that was not amended by the other House. \n     Furthermore, they may not insert new matter that is not \n     germane to or that is beyond the scope of the differences \n     between the two Houses.\n\n  Let me tell my colleagues what else we tell schoolchildren and young \npeople all over America:\n\n       A report that contains any recommendations which extend \n     beyond the scope of differences between the two Houses is \n     subject to a point of order in its entirety unless that point \n     of order is waived.\n\n  So why don't we--if I am defeated here--and I may be--why don't we \nchange this book. Why don't we have a resolution from the Senator from \nNebraska who put this in, along with his $300,000 museum, to change \nthis book so we don't mislead schoolchildren all over America in a \npamphlet that says how our laws are made.\n  There is no reason why the majority can't bring the continuing \nresolution to the floor as a stand-alone piece of legislation. A \nChristmas tree of funding increases and authorizations deserves floor \nconsideration and discussion, rather than a process by which the \nappropriators unilaterally decide how, when, and where what is \ndeserving of getting a 30-day extension and which programs are able to \nexpire. The American people deserve better.\n  Just this morning, Politico, a newspaper published here in \nWashington, wrote a story: Lawmakers jack up spending for themselves: \n$500,000 for townhalls.\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       Congress is on the verge of giving itself a bump in its \n     annual budget--even as local governments, families, and \n     businesses across the country are tightening their belts in \n     the worst recession in decades.\n       The measure includes a hodgepodge of new funding for \n     lawmakers: a $500,000 pilot program for Senators to send out \n     postcards about their town hall meetings--\n\n  Is there any Member of Congress in the Senate who needs to send out a \npostcard to tell our constituents that we are having a townhall \nmeeting? Really: $500,000.\n\n       --$30,000 for receptions for foreign dignitaries and $4 \n     million for consultants.\n       There's $15.8 million for salaries for the Senate \n     Appropriations Committee--plus an extra $950,000 for the \n     committee's administrative expenses.\n\n  So here we are with people not--Americans can't have an office \nbecause they have lost their jobs, and conferees have included $50 \nmillion to refurbish congressional offices. While millions of American \nfamilies risk losing the roof over their head, appropriators have set \naside millions to replace the roof of the Rayburn House Office \nBuilding. While millions of Americans have seen their income and \nhousehold budgets decrease significantly this year, Congress has \nprovided a 5.8 percent increase over last year to cover Congress's \nexpenses and salaries. Millions of small businesses across America have \nbeen forced to shut down or severely cut expenses. Somehow, Congress \nsees fit to provide itself with a 5.8 percent increase. Incredible. \nMillions of Americans are seeing their hours cut or their salaries \nslashed. This conference report includes an 8.4 percent increase over \nfiscal year 2009 for salaries--for salaries.\n  According to the House committee report, this is to:\n\n       Allow for compensation improvements beyond inflation for \n     the staff of Member offices, especially among younger staff \n     where current salaries are often less competitive.\n\n  I have had no difficulty with people applying for work in my office. \nMaybe the managers of the bill have.\n  If this weren't enough, the conference report retains an earmark from \nthe Senate bill of $200,000 to support a photo exhibit at the Durham \nMuseum in Nebraska. So people who are having trouble making mortgage \npayments and putting food on the table are probably a little bit \nsurprised, although maybe they shouldn't be. National unemployment is \nat almost 10 percent, public debt is close to $2 trillion, the deficit \nis projected to hit $1.6 trillion\n\n[[Page S9966]]\n\nthis year, and we go on spending. We go on spending.\n\n  I ask my colleagues, in supporting this point of order, to block this \nbill from full Senate consideration and allow Congress to rethink its \npriorities.\n  So I raise a point of order that the legislation violates rule \nXXVIII.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I move to waive all applicable \nrule XXVIII points of order and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The yeas and nays are ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                         Defense Appropriations\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, now I wish to make some final remarks \nabout the amendment that cuts $2.5 billion that the Defense \nAppropriations bill uses to fund 10 C-17 Globemaster aircraft, planes \nwhich the Secretary of Defense says the Pentagon doesn't need and that \nthe President didn't ask for, and restores that money to the critical \noperations and maintenance accounts that support military training, \nreadiness, flying and steaming hours and depot maintenance that is so \ncrucial to our Armed Forces in wartime.\n  Let me make it clear to my colleagues what I am doing. We are taking \nthe $2.5 billion that has been appropriated for the purpose of \nprocuring 10 additional C-17s and transferring that money back to the \noperations and maintenance account I described--training, readiness, \nflying, steaming hours, et cetera--to make up for the cuts--or at least \nmostly to make up for the cuts--that have been made in O funding.\n  I understand a budget point of order will be lodged against the \namendment. Let me make it clear to my colleagues: We will have an up-\nor-down vote on this amendment. So if it fails, I will have two more \namendments, separate amendments, one that cuts the C-17 and one that \nadds funding to operations and maintenance funding if this pending \namendment of mine is challenged on a technical basis.\n  I agreed with Secretary Gates when he said the military has no more \nneed to buy more C-17s. The fact is, the Air Force and the U.S. \nTransportation Command: ``Have more than necessary [strategic airlift] \ncapacity'' for airlift over the next 10 years.\n  Mr. President, I received a letter from the Secretary of Defense. I \nask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                     The Secretary of Defense,\n\n                                                   Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John McCain,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McCain: The President's defense budget request \n     has requested no additional C-17s. This position is based on \n     the Department's firm judgment that we have acquired \n     sufficient number of C-17s to meet the nation's military \n     needs. The C-17 airlifter remains a valuable military asset \n     that will serve as the backbone of the nation's strategic \n     airlift fleet for decades to come. However, continuing to \n     purchase C-17s in numbers beyond what is required simply \n     diverts limited resources from other more pressing military \n     needs. More specifically, the $2.5 billion it will cost to \n     purchase 10 additional C-17s plus the $100 million per year \n     it will cost to operate them will invariably result in a \n     reduction in critical warfighting capability somewhere else \n     in the defense program.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert M. Gates.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I will quote partially from the letter:\n\n       The President's defense budget request has requested no \n     additional C-17s. This position is based on the Department's \n     firm judgment that we have acquired a sufficient number of C-\n     17s to meet the Nation's military needs.\n\n  Let me point out what is really important about this letter:\n\n       More specifically, the $2.5 billion it will cost to \n     purchase 10 additional C-17s, plus the $100 million per year \n     it will cost to operate them, will invariably result in a \n     reduction in crucial warfighting capability somewhere else in \n     the defense program.\n\n  So the Secretary of Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, all of our military leaders, and the highly respected Secretary \nof Defense say not only that they don't want any more C-17s, but if we \nspend this $2.5 billion and the $100 million annually required to \nmaintain them, there will be a reduction in critical warfighting \ncapability somewhere else in the defense program.\n  We are in two wars. We have 68,000 young Americans in Afghanistan--\nand most likely more to come--and 120,000 in Iraq, and we are going to \nbuy 10 more C-17s when they need their equipment maintained and they \nneed to be replaced and they need to fly and they need to have the best \ncapability in combat.\n  President Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex. \nIt is not the military industrial complex anymore; it is the industrial \ncomplex. You cannot walk through the hallways without bumping into a \nlobbyist from Boeing. Of course, there are subcontractors all over \nAmerica, absolutely. But this is really egregious because they have \ntaken money from the operation and training capabilities and readiness \ncapabilities--that is what operations and maintenance money is all \nabout--and cut it below the request our military and the Secretary of \nDefense and the President think is vitally needed, and they added 10 \nadditional aircraft that no one in the military--the Air Force \nincluded--believes is needed.\n  This is a young Presidency, and this will be a defining moment in the \nPresidency. If I am defeated by Boeing today, then it will be up to the \nPresident to decide whether to veto this bill. If we don't turn this \ndown here, then we will be sending a signal to every lobbyist in this \ntown--and there are thousands--that if you lobby hard enough and you \nhave enough subcontractors, you can do anything.\n  This is a very important amendment at this particular time in our \nhistory, while we are fighting two wars and we have a new \nadministration. If we defeat this amendment, we will also be \ncontradicting the opinion of perhaps one of the most highly regarded \nindividuals in America, and, of course, that is our Secretary of \nDefense.\n  Mr. President, I have already asked for the yeas and nays on this \namendment. I believe we can do a better job for the American people and \nthe men and women in the military than what is being attempted by the \nDefense Appropriations Committee.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I rise to associate myself with the \ncomments of the Senator from Arizona on rule XXVIII and on the issue of \nplanes. I also want to point out that we are violating the budget this \nbody has with this bill.\n  I understand the situation in which the Senator from Nebraska finds \nhimself. His bill is in the wrong place at the wrong time, and people \nthrew a lot of baggage on it, and it was inappropriate that it was \nthrown on.\n  One of the most inappropriate things is a $4 billion bill that is \nbeing sent to the taxpayers of America to bail out the Postal Service. \nThis wasn't a surprise. This didn't come on as, oh, my gosh, we don't \nhave $4 billion to pay our pension funds. This occurs because of \nsomething that occurred in 2006, when we bailed out the post office the \nlast time. Everybody knew it was coming. This train has been coming \ndown the track, the track has been straight, and we have seen it for a \nlong time. So suddenly this bailout, which the taxpayers will have to \npay for, gets thrown on the Senator's bill. I regret that. It makes his \nbill out of whack relative to the budget.\n  This is the last day of the fiscal year. We have already spent all \nthe money. In fact, we spent a little bit more too, but we spent all of \nthe money in the budget. We are over outlays and all of the BA has been \nspent. Suddenly, out of the clear blue sky, on the last day of the \nbudget, we are going to spend another $4 billion.\n  We passed the budget, so let's stick with the budget. That is the \nidea. I think the American people are getting tired of us spending \nmoney we don't have, especially since it is theirs and their \ngrandchildren's. It goes right on the debt, by the way. All I am asking \nthis body to do is live by the budget we passed.\n  I intend to make a point of order under rule 311 of the Budget Act, \nwhich says you cannot exceed what you said you budgeted for. It is a \nsimple Budget Act. We pass a budget, and if you go over it, there is a \npoint of order that\n\n[[Page S9967]]\n\nyou should not waive. So we should not spend $4 billion we don't have.\n  Again, this was not the doing of the Senator from Nebraska. He plays \nno role in this other than being the unfortunate baggage car passing \nthrough Congress when somebody decided to stick this on his bill.\n  At this point, I will make a point of order that the pending \nconference report would cause the aggregate level of the budget \nauthority and the outlays for fiscal year 2009 as set out in the most \nrecently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget, S. Con. Res. \n13, to be exceeded. I raise a point of order under section 311(a)(2) of \nthe Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Pursuant to section 904 of the Congressional \nBudget Act of 1974, I move to waive all applicable sections of that \nact, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I will simply note that there were two \nother Budget Act points of order against this item in the bill. I \npresume he is asking on behalf of leadership to waive them all.\n  It is really inappropriate that we should waive the whole Budget Act \nand spend $4 billion we don't have on the last day of the fiscal year. \nSo I hope Members will look at this. This can be corrected in other \nways. We can find ways to offset this money. It can be done on another \nbill with the proper offsets. Therefore, I hope my colleagues will \nsustain what they passed, which was the budget for this year, on the \nlast day of the budget enforcement for the year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in support of the \nmotion to waive the rule XXVIII point of order being made against the \nconference report for containing a continuing resolution provision \nallowing the government to maintain normal operations until October 31, \n2009.\n  Today is the last day of the fiscal year. As I noted earlier, our men \nand women in uniform are fighting on two fronts. On the homefront, our \neconomy is at a critical stage in its recovery.\n  Our Federal agencies provide essential services every day of the year \nto our men and women in uniform, to our veterans who have returned from \nwar, to homeowners and workers struggling to recover from the downturn \nin our economy, and to businesses and maritime commerce reliant on \nweather forecasts and data. These are just a few examples of a \nmultitude of critical services we must maintain by passing this \nconference report with the continuing resolution provision included and \nhaving it sent to the President for his signature.\n  This point of order is made and raised against the conference report \nbased on the fact that this continuing resolution was added to it \nwithout being included in either the House or Senate versions of the \nbill. While the vice chairman and I are not inclined to add provisions \noutside the scope of the conference, there are occasions when it is \nnecessary. This is one of those times.\n  As chairman of the Appropriations Committee, I have worked diligently \nwith my colleague and vice chair, Senator Cochran, to return the \nappropriations process to regular order.\n  When we finally received the administration's budget--and may I ask \nmy colleagues to recall that it was in May of this year--we worked \nnonstop, holding budget hearings with the agencies, analyzing their \nbudget proposals, and marking up and reporting out all 12 bills in 4 \nmonths. Eleven of them were reported out before the August recess. I \nmight add that the Senate Appropriations Committee reported nine of \nthese bills by a vote of 30 to 0--unanimous--and the other three by a \nvote of 29 to 1--one vote in opposition. The Senate is currently \nconsidering the Defense bill, the seventh appropriations measure to \ncome to the floor.\n  We have made great progress in our efforts to return to regular order \nand pass individual bills, but we are not there yet. We need to pass \nthis continuing resolution so that our agencies can continue to operate \nwhile we conclude our business. In fact, today we had our second and \nthird conferences with the House, and I am happy to report that both \nconferences have concluded in harmony and a report will be forthcoming \nto the Senate floor. Several more are scheduled for the rest of the \nweek. This short-term continuing resolution, which is clean and does \nnot contain what I consider controversial matters, will give us time to \nconsider a good number of appropriations bills under regular order.\n  For my colleagues who may be interested in specific details regarding \nthe impact of a government shutdown, here are just a few examples:\n  For veterans who have served, all nonemergency health care, including \nelective surgeries, would be deferred. This means that those veterans \nwhose medical needs are not life-threatening or an emergency would have \nto wait to see their doctors. The end result would be rationing health \ncare, causing significant waiting times for appointments, which would, \nof course, spill over after the shutdown has ended.\n  A government shutdown would suspend much of the work Treasury staff \nis doing to promote economic recovery and would impact transportation \nfunding that also plays an important role in supporting the economic \nrecovery and putting people back to work.\n  A government shutdown could derail the 2010 census, for example. Even \na brief shutdown could jeopardize the accuracy and timeliness of the \nconstitutionally mandated 2010 census, which everybody is depending \nupon for numbers. Specifically, the Census Bureau could be forced to \nabandon or delay the hiring of tens of thousands of temporary \nenumerators. Under a government shutdown, the census would be unable to \ncontinue setting up field operations needed to count our citizens.\n\n  A government shutdown would halt highway, transit, and motor carrier \nsafety programs, which would disrupt State and local efforts to \nmaintain and improve our Nation's transportation infrastructure, and \nwould impact upon commuters and movers of goods.\n  A government shutdown would lay up NOAA's entire fleet of ships, \nincluding the hydrographic vessels, which would stop any current \nnautical charting operations for the purpose of navigation. Even \nnavigation service conducted by the private sector under NOAA contracts \nwould cease and any data processing would be put on hold.\n  Our Nation's physical oceanographic real-time system would not be \nmaintained, eliminating live environmental information, such as tides \nand currents that coastal pilots rely on when safely guiding huge \nvessels in and out of our ports. Imagine what would have happened if \nthis shutdown was in place at this moment. The knowledge that we have \nof the Samoan disaster would not be available to us, simply put.\n  Maritime commerce, which accounts for 90 percent of our Nation's \nimports and exports, would be dramatically slowed and the risk of an \nenvironmental disaster would be heightened.\n  Mr. President, I could continue on with other services being impacted \nby the shutdown, but I think you have got the gist of it.\n  Twice in the past 4 years--in 2006 and 2007--the Congress passed a \nsimilar type continuing resolution as a provision to a conference \nreport. Yes, they had CRs in the conference report in 2006 and 2007. In \n2006, the Republican-led Congress passed a continuing resolution \nprovision by a vote of 100 to 0. In 2007, a Democratic-led Senate \npassed a conference report with a continuing resolution by a voice \nvote--unanimous. It is not a partisan issue and it should not be a \npartisan issue today.\n  With that, I urge my colleagues to vote to waive any point of order \nagainst the Legislative Branch conference report because of the \ncontinuing resolution.\n  Mr. President, I submit pursuant to Senate rules a report, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S9968]]\n\n         Disclosure of Congressionally Directed Spending Items\n\n       I certify that the information required by rule XLIV of the \n     Standing Rules of the Senate related to congressionally \n     directed spending items has been identified in the conference \n     report which accompanies H.R. 2918 and that the required \n     information has been available on a publicly accessible \n     congressional website at least 48 hours before a vote on the \n     pending bill.\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on behalf of the leader, I ask unanimous \nconsent that upon disposition of the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 2918, the Senate then stand in recess until 6:30 p.m. today; that \nupon reconvening at 6:30 p.m., the Senate resume consideration of H.R. \n3326 and there be 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to \nthe McCain amendment No. 2558, with the time equally divided and \ncontrolled in the usual form; with no amendment in order to the \namendment prior to the vote; that upon the use of the 2 minutes, the \nSenate then proceed to vote in relation to the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the agreement \nbe modified so that after the first vote, the following votes be 10 \nminutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to waive any points of \norder under rule XXVIII.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I move to lay that motion upon the table.\n  The motion to lay upon the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida.) The Senator from New \nHampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this is a very simple point of order. It \nsimply says: A budget was passed. This is the last year of the budget. \nWe have spent all the money under the budget. We should not add another \n$4 billion to the budget that is going to go directly to the debt our \nchildren will have to bear.\n  So let's vote in favor of supporting the budget that we passed. Let's \nvote against adding $4 billion of more debt to our childrens' backs. We \ncan correct the problem this issue confronts without adding to the \ndeficit and the debt, and we can correct it without doing violence to \nthe budget which was passed by the majority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, it is important that this \nmotion pass just like the previous one. If we do not get this done, we \nare sitting with a continuing resolution that will not be in effect, \nand we will be in trouble moving forward.\n  So just as the other one, I ask my colleagues to vote aye on it as \nthey have in the past.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, will the Senator from Nebraska yield the \nremaining time to me?\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. I will yield.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska has 20 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire has 12 seconds \nremaining.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, the Senator from New Hampshire is correct \nthat this should not have been done this way and that the Postal \nService needs fundamental reform. But the fact is, the Postal Service \ncannot afford to pay the $5.4 billion that is due on October 1.\n  The CBO says this provision has no budget impact. So I urge a vote \nagainst the Judd Gregg point of order.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, if it had no budget impact, the point of \norder would not lie. It actually does have a $4 billion budget impact. \nThat will be added to the debt. It can be corrected. We can still pass \nthe continuing resolution by supporting this point of order.\n  I ask Senators to vote no on the motion to waive.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, before we recess--I know there is an \norder--I ask unanimous consent that I have 1 minute and Senator Inhofe \nhave up to 2 minutes to address the Senate on an issue unrelated to the \nconference report that was just adopted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish to let colleagues know on both \nsides of the aisle that Senator Inhofe and I are working very closely \ntogether as chair and ranking member of the Environment and Public \nWorks Committee to resolve an issue which, if we do not resolve, is \ngoing to result in job losses. Senator Inhofe will expand on that.\n  We have to repeal a recision that was put into the last highway bill, \nSAFETEA-LU. We know what we want to do. We know how we are going to \nfund it. It will be deficit neutral. It will keep people working. It \nwill help our States. If we do not do it, we are going to see layoffs, \nand nobody wants to see layoffs when we are in this difficult economic \ntime.\n  So I am very pleased to be here to inform colleagues we are working \nvery hard, and we have very few objections, if any. We will get back to \ncolleagues later in the evening on this issue.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and will listen with great interest \nto my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me thank the chair of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee--a position I held at one \ntime, but I am the ranking member for the minority. This is a huge \nissue. This is one we cannot let go unattended. Tonight at midnight \nthis thing expires. So we have to do it. Let me compliment Senator \nBoxer in being willing to go to some extremes that, quite frankly, I \ndid not know she would be able to agree to.\n  What is at stake right now is about $500 million of projects that \nwill have to be canceled. If you cancel these projects--these contracts \nhave already been let--we are talking about lawsuits. We are talking \nabout around 17,000 jobs being lost unless we are able to fix this \nrecision thing and to get it offset. Well, that is what is going to \nhappen.\n  We are drafting an amendment right now. I know the hour is late. I \nknow we are going to come back for a vote at 6:30. But I think this \nabsolutely has to be done, and I think it will be done. I am looking \nright now for any of the Republicans who might be objecting to this so \nI can talk to them. Quite frankly, I do not think there will be \nobjection on our side.\n  The highway money at risk would put people to work, unlike much of \nthe so-called stimulus. So I think we have an opportunity now to do \nthis, and it is only going to be done because of the cooperation \nbetween the chairman of this committee and myself as ranking member.\n  So let's do everything we can. I say to the Senator, I think you have \ncome up with a solution. We have, together, come up with a solution. \nLet's make it happen.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9969-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9969-S9970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      MAKING TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS IN THE ENROLLMENT OF H.R. 2918\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to the consideration of H. Con. Res. 191, which the clerk will \nreport by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 191) directing the \n     Clerk of the House of Representatives to make technical \n     corrections in the enrollment of H.R. 2918.\n\n  Thereupon, the Senate proceeded to consider the concurrent \nresolution.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, one of the must-pass items in the \ncontinuing resolution regards the U.S. Postal Service.\n  Under current law, each year the Postal Service is required to cover \nthe health care costs of retirees and provide an actuarially determined \nrate for future costs of health care.\n  These funds are required to be placed into a trust fund to be \ninvested.\n  Because of the recession as well as the increased reliance on the \nInternet for personal communications, the Postal Service is \nexperiencing financial difficulties.\n  Working with members of the authorizing committees of both Houses, \nthe Committee crafted a short-term solution for this problem which \nwould allow the Postal Service to reduce the amount it would otherwise \nbe required to invest this year.\n  The impact of the amendment is it allows the Postal Service to retain \n$4 billion to pay for its ongoing cost of operations.\n  Let me be clear, this provision will not provide any additional \ntaxpayer dollars to the Postal Service.\n  It doesn't mean that current health benefits of our postal workers \nwould be shortchanged.\n  It does assume that when the recession ends and profitability returns \nto the Postal Service the funding they would need to invest in future \nhealth care costs would probably increase.\n  Some might want to decry this amendment because it is scored by the \ncongressional budget amendment as a net loss to the Treasury.\n  It should be noted that the proposal will not require additional \ndiscretionary funds to be expended.\n  The provision will, on the other hand, do a great deal to preserve \nthe financial solvency of the Postal Service.\n  This amendment should not be controversial.\n  It does not add costs to the taxpayer.\n  It was an item that was in keeping with the needs of the Postal \nService; and, it was an item that has the support of the chairman of \nthe authorizing subcommittee with jurisdiction over the matter.\n  This needs to be done today and I would urge my colleagues to vote to \nwaive any points of order that might be raised in relation to this \nmatter.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, currently the Nation's unemployment rate is \nhigher than it has been since 1983. In my home State of Michigan, the \nunemployment rate is 15.2 percent--5.5 percent higher than the Nation's \nunemployment rate of 9.7 percent. Translated into real people, this \nmeans that 14.9 million Americans are unemployed, of which, more than \n735,000 are living in my home State.\n  Michigan provides a little more than 450,000 individuals with \nunemployment benefits. As of September 18, more than 26,000 \nMichiganders have exhausted much needed unemployment benefits and by \nthe end of this year, this number will rise to more than 100,000 folks. \nSince the beginning of this year, Michigan has been losing on average \nof 27,000 jobs per month. Our people need help.\n  It is critical that we provide assistance to individuals who are \nstraining to make ends meet by ensuring that their much needed \nunemployment insurance benefits do not run out. We need to provide \nsupport to those individuals who are struggling to find jobs so that \nthey do not lose their homes and are able to put food on the table.\n  We must extend unemployment insurance benefits and swiftly pass an \nunemployment insurance extension, so the President can sign this bill \ninto law quickly.\n\n[[Page S9970]]\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am disappointed that we are about to \nbegin the 2010 fiscal year having enacted just one appropriations bill. \nI am even more disappointed that we passed a continuing resolution, \nairdropped into the Legislative Branch appropriations bill, that \nprovides money to continue the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. While I am \npleased that the President has committed to withdrawing our troops from \nIraq by the end of 2011, this redeployment schedule is too long and may \nundermine our ability to combat al-Qaida while straining our Armed \nForces unnecessarily. In addition, while the President is right to \nfocus on Afghanistan and Pakistan, I remain concerned that his strategy \nfor those countries does not adequately address, and may even \nexacerbate, the threats to our national security we face in Pakistan.\n  We need to keep the Federal Government operating and make sure our \nbrave troops get all the equipment and supplies they need, but we \nshould not be providing funds to continue those wars without, at a \nminimum, engaging in a serious debate about their effects on our \nnational security.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the concurrent \nresolution is agreed to and the motion to reconsider is considered made \nand laid upon the table.\n  The concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 191) was agreed to.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9970-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9970]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There will now be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 2558 offered by \nthe Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I again quote from a letter from the \nSecretary of Defense:\n\n       The President's defense budget request has requested no \n     additional C-17s. This position is based on the Department's \n     firm judgment that we have acquired a sufficient number of C-\n     17s to meet the Nation's military needs. . . . More \n     specifically, the $2.5 billion it will cost to purchase 10 \n     additional C-17s plus the $100 million per year it will cost \n     to operate them will invariably result in a reduction in \n     critical warfighting capabilities somewhere else in the \n     defense program.\n\n  I understand there will be a budget point of order. I wish to tell my \ncolleagues we will be voting up or down on this issue because if this \nis defeated, I will have another amendment simply to kill this \nunneeded, unnecessary porkbarreling exercise in the power of lobbyists \nin our Nation's Capital.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am prepared to go right to the heart of \nthe underlying amendment rather than go through this point of order, \nbut let me just point out that there are those who have supported a \nprovision in the fiscal year 2010 Defense Authorization bill that would \nprohibit the Defense Department from retiring the 40-year-old C-5As. \nThese are the people who are now promoting this amendment to kill the \nC-17. In effect, the proponents of the McCain amendment are tying the \nhands of the Air Force, by requiring the Pentagon to upkeep a fleet of \nC-5s--aircraft that are outdated, costly to operate, and are less \ncapable than the C-17. The Air Force should be allowed to replace them \nwith C-17s and not be forced to waste hundreds of millions of dollars \nto extend the life of the C-5.\n  It is less costly to build a C-17 than it is to repair a C-5. That is \nthe reality. If we are looking for cost savings and deficit reduction, \nthen what the committee has advocated actually makes more sense \nfiscally to do. But instead, the McCain amendment in effect promotes a \n40-year-old aircraft, getting older by the day, rather than an aircraft \nlike the C-17 that has the capability of landing almost anywhere on the \nglobe for that matter, highly versatile.\n  We have nearly 100,000 new troops who have been added to our armed \nservices in 4 years. We need to have an airlift capacity that meets our \nlarger force's needs. I urge the rejection of the McCain amendment.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise today to express my continued \nsupport for the C-17 cargo aircraft program and urge my colleagues to \nretain funding for 10 additional aircraft in the fiscal year 2010 \nDefense appropriations bill.\n  The C-17 is critical to our national security and our ability to \nefficiently carry out important missions around the world. Not only is \nthis aircraft an indispensable asset in supporting military and \nhumanitarian missions in countries like Iraq, Afghanistan and Sudan; it \nhas a proven record of versatility and high performance, and it \nsustains jobs that are essential across 43 States--including my home \nState of California.\n  First, I would like to talk about the types of missions where we use \nthe C-17. According to the Air Force's budget justification for 2010, \nthe C-17 ``is a major element of America's National Military Strategy \nand constitutes the most responsive means of meeting U.S. mobility \nrequirements. . . . The C-17 will perform the airlift mission well into \nthis century.''\n  The C-17 is essential to our missions in Iraq and Afghanistan \nparticularly because of its versatility. It is used to transport \nequipment, supplies and our service members. For example, the C-17 can \nland on a dirt runway to deliver needed supplies in remote regions of \nAfghanistan.\n  We also use the C-17 to evacuate our wounded men and women from Iraq \nto Germany, and then back to the United States for treatment. And in \nsome instances, it has even been used to transport our service members \nacross a combat zone, reducing the risks that they face when they \ntravel on land by convoy.\n  And the uses don't stop there. The C-17 is used to deliver \nhumanitarian supplies. In January of this year, a C-17 delivered 18,000 \npounds of supplies to Nicaragua, one of the poorest nations in the \nWestern Hemisphere.\n  The C-17 has also been used to bring relief to Americans, including \nduring Hurricane Katrina. It can deliver a 100-bed, fully equipped \nhospital to nearly any area with an unimproved airstrip.\n  This is an amazing capability, and one we cannot afford to lose.\n  Second, the C-17 has a proven record of performance. Quite simply, it \nis the workhorse of our military. And we are using them at a much \nhigher rate than the Air Force originally intended.\n  C-17s have flown over 1.3 million flight hours since 2002. Many are \nflown at 150-180 percent of their anticipated flight hours.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, the C-17 was \ndesigned to fly 1,000 hours per year over 30 years, but the fleet has \naveraged 1,250 hours per aircraft over the last ten years. Some have \neven reached 2,400 flying hours in a single year.\n  And finally, the C-17 is the last strategic airlift production line \nin the Nation. Every day 30,000 employees from 43 states go to work in \ndirect support of the C-17. In addition to those 30,000 direct jobs, \nover 100,000 workers depend on this production line. In my home State \nof California, 13,800 people work on the C-17. And 19,200 worker's have \nan affiliation with this aircraft.\n  Too many American jobs depend on this vital program. Before we take \nany action to shut down the line, we must be absolutely certain that we \nhave all of the aircraft we need.\n  We cannot take the chance that we ``may'' have enough aircraft, \nparticularly without reviewing two studies that are due by the end of \nthe year.\n\n[[Page S9971]]\n\n  The Department of Defense Mobility Capabilities and Requirements \nStudy and the congressionally mandated study being done by the \nInstitute for Defense Analyses will determine if our airlift \nrequirements are being met.\n  We expect these studies to be complete by the end of this year. \nWithout the results of these studies, we cannot determine that our \nNation's airlift capability has been met. It would be incredibly \nshortsighted to shut down this production line without that \ninformation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in maintaining funds for the C-17, \nand to defeat the McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I make a point of order that the pending \namendment violates section 302(F) of the Congressional Budget Act of \n1974.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I move to waive the applicable section of \nthe Budget Act with respect to my amendment and ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the majority \nleader be authorized to sign any duly enrolled bills and joint \nresolutions for the remainder of today, Wednesday, September 30.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to ask the managers this. I have \nthree amendments I wish to have called up and placed in order. One is \namendment No. 2580, one is amendment No. 2581, and the third is \namendment No. 2575.\n  The first is to strike the amount for the C-17 aircraft, which is not \nsubject to a point of order, I am told. The second is to add $2.5 \nbillion for operations and maintenance, which is also not subject to a \npoint of order. The third one is to have testimony before Congress by \nGeneral McChrystal and General Petraeus before the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  I would be glad to agree to a brief debate on all three of those \namendments, and I will be glad to enter into a time agreement or \nwhatever their desires are on all three. On the first two, the issue \nhas been debated pretty well. I would only need a few minutes. On the \nthird, I think it is pretty straightforward, calling for the testimony \nof General McChrystal and General Petraeus before the Congress of the \nUnited States.\n  I call up those amendments and ask for their consideration in \nsequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to considering the \namendments en bloc?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Not en bloc, in sequence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the amendments being \nbrought up in sequence? Will the Senator specify the sequence?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that amendments Nos. 2580, 2581 \nand 2575--I call up those amendments. I think that is my right.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I inquire of the Senator from Arizona, who \nsaid the first two were in order because they strike and replace money, \nis the Senator saying the same about the third amendment? Is it in \norder on an appropriations bill?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I believe it is in order. I will be glad to have a vote \non whether it is a violation of any of the Senate rules.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will not object to the first two. On the third, I will \nobject until we have a chance to look at it more closely.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Parliamentary inquiry: Do I have the right to call up an amendment \nthat is filed?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes, one amendment at a time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2575\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I call up amendment 2575 and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2575.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To provide for testimony before Congress on the additional \n  forces and resources required to meet United States objectives with \n                  respect to Afghanistan and Pakistan)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I call up amendment No. 2580 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Reserving the right to object, it is my understanding--\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am not seeking unanimous consent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois has the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Sorry. I thought the Senator made a unanimous consent \nrequest.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I just called up the second amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate requires unanimous consent to \nconsider an additional amendment.\n\n[[Page S9972]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. I see.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Arizona, our mutual friend, \nSenator Levin, asked to be on the floor when the first amendment was \nbeing considered. I have to say, on his behalf, that I will object to \nmoving to another amendment until he has a chance to come to the floor \nand debate the Senator's first amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Senator. We will certainly accede to his \nrequest. I would like to tell my colleagues that I do not intend to \nconclude debate on this legislation until such time as we have straight \nup-or-down votes on the two amendments about which I talked. One is \nstriking the funding for the C-17, $2.5 billion and adding $2.5 billion \nfor operations and maintenance. I will be glad to discuss it with the \nmanagers of the bill how that sequence will take place, how much \ndebate. I do not intend to hold up the bill in any way. I just wish to \ntell my colleagues I want consideration and recorded votes on both of \nthose amendments.\n  What we have done tonight by not waiving the budget, the rule, is an \noutrage and is going to damage very badly the men and women who are \nserving this country because we are not giving them the equipment they \nneed to operate in harm's way--120,000 of them in Iraq, 68,000 of them \nin Afghanistan. That is the opinion of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nof Staff, General Petraeus, General McChrystal, and the Secretary of \nDefense. It is a remarkable moment--a remarkable moment--in the history \nof the Senate, although I have seen it happen before. Congratulations \nto the lobbyists from Boeing. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2555, as Modified\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside, and I ask that amendment No. 2555 be called up. \nWith that, I am sending a modification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Before we go to the reading, if I could send a \nmodification to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the amendment as \nmodified.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Johanns] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2555, as modified.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure the availability of not less than $30,000,000 for \n           High Priority National Guard Counterdrug Programs)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __. (a) High Priority National Guard Counterdrug \n     Programs.--Of the amount appropriated or otherwise made \n     available by title VI under the heading ``Drug Interdiction \n     and Counter-Drug Activities, Defense'', up to $30,000,000 \n     shall be available for the purpose of High Priority National \n     Guard Counterdrug Programs.\n       (b) Supplement Not Supplant.--The amount made available by \n     subsection (a) for the purpose specified in that subsection \n     is in addition to any other amounts made available by this \n     Act for that purpose.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise briefly this evening to speak \nabout this amendment. The amendment would help maintain, in fiscal year \n2010, the current level of funding for the National Guard's counterdrug \nefforts throughout the United States. It is important legislation.\n  As a Governor, as a mayor, I can tell you what I think everybody \nknows. One of the toughest problems we face in this Nation is fighting \ndrug abuse and addiction and putting the tools in place to deal with \nthat.\n  We all know firsthand that drug addiction rips families apart and \ntears communities down. It is accompanied by an endless parade of \nviolence.\n  Reducing drug abuse and crime was a top priority of mine as mayor and \nGovernor. In part because of steps we took, we were able to bring crime \nnumbers down. I am proud of that.\n  I know drugs are not a unique challenge to Nebraska. It is a national \nchallenge. Meth distributors commonly commit violent crimes as they \ntraffic in methamphetamine. Meth users often commit property crimes, \nburglary, and identity theft. This drug is an enormous burden on public \nhealth departments and treatment centers in our region. Meth-related \nviolence and child abuse have also strained local foster care systems, \nnot only in our State but in other States. Because of its highly \naddictive nature, it takes longer treatment programs and it has a very \nhigh recidivism rate. Treatment, needless to say, is enormously \ndifficult.\n  In the face of this problem, we need to keep up our pressure on drug \ntrafficking groups and work on providing more consistent funding to \nFederal, State, and local drug task forces. The National Guard's \nCounterdrug Support Program has been supporting law enforcement and \ncommunity-based drug reduction coalitions now for 20 years. However, \nthis program often faces considerable uncertainty over its funding, and \nthat hampers operations. Consistent funding would allow police to keep \nmany of the same officers in the drug task force. This would improve \ncommunication between multiple different law enforcement agencies, and \nit would increase their effectiveness.\n  Rural States are especially hurt by cuts and uncertainty in their \ncounterdrug budgets, since they often have a great deal of territory to \ncover with very small departments.\n  To get to the crux of this amendment, my amendment would help address \nthese problems by helping restore counterdrug funding back to its level \nlast year. We are just asking for a level budget. Last year, Congress \nadded $22.5 million to the President's level of funding. The year \nbefore it added $20 million. While the Defense authorization this year \nauthorized an additional $30 million in counterdrug support, it was not \nincluded in the appropriations bill.\n  This money goes across our country, all 50 States, and some of our \nterritories. Our counterdrug operations depend on the funds.\n  If the current shortfall continues, the National Guard would not be \nable to effectively support law enforcement in their fight against \ndrugs. Our law enforcement and National Guard personnel must be given \nthe tools they need to carry on this battle.\n  Tonight, in a very large appropriations bill, I ask what I believe is \na very necessary amount of money to help fight this war on drugs in \nyour State, Mr. President, in mine, and across this country. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment. My hope is there will be a very \nbipartisan, strong statement that we stand behind this very important \npiece of this budget.\n  For the record, if it is acceptable--and I don't know if there is an \nagreement on this or not--but I want to indicate for the record that I \nwill be more than happy to move this amendment with a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator for bringing \nto the attention of the Senate this suggested change. We have no \nproblem with having this amendment adopted on a voice vote, if that \nsuits the manager on the other side.\n  Mr. INOUYE. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 2555, as modified.\n  The amendment (No. 2555), as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. INOUYE. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wonder if the managers would allow me to \nmake a unanimous consent request on a totally other issue, the issue \ndealing with the highway trust fund, at this time. I will take about 2 \nor 3 minutes; is that all right?\n  Mr. COCHRAN. I have no objection to the Senator discussing her \nsuggestion.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 3617\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we are in a very bad situation with the \nhighway trust fund. We are working very hard on both sides of the aisle \nto resolve it. Senator Inhofe and I are absolutely in agreement on what \nwe should\n\n[[Page S9973]]\n\ndo. But yet still there is objection from the other side of the aisle, \nour Republican friends. I wish to explain where we are, and then I am \ngoing to make a unanimous consent request.\n  In the SAFETEA-LU program, which was the last highway bill, there was \nan $8 billion rescission that was made. The promise at that time years \nago was that we would fix it in the days, months, and years ahead. It \nwas not fixed, and if we don't repeal the rescission tonight, what will \nhappen immediately is that there will have to be layoffs, there will \nhave to be cancellation of contracts, and the order will go out from \nhere to our States. Mr. President, 17,000 jobs are on the line. We have \nto repeal this rescission. It translates into about $300 million.\n  I have been working with Senator Inhofe, and we reached agreement \nand, frankly, the leaders, I believe, reached agreement that what we \nought to do is repeal this rescission and, as a paid-for, cut the TARP \nmoney because we know that a lot of those funds have been paid back, \ncut that program by the equivalent of $300 million. We would repeal the \nrescission, everybody keeps working, the contracts are still going, and \nwe pay for this repeal by cutting $300 million from TARP, the Toxic \nAsset Relief Program, not very popular in the country, I might add.\n  I have to say I asked the administration for some other ideas and \nthey had none. I believe in pay as you go. So I said to Senator Inhofe \nthat I was with him on this. He and I are in agreement.\n  At this time, I am going to make this formal unanimous consent \nrequest to repeal this rescission and pay for it by cutting TARP.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 3617, received from the House and at the desk; \nthat the Boxer substitute amendment at the desk be considered; further, \nthat the Boxer-Inhofe second-degree amendment with an offset be \nconsidered and agreed to, the substitute amendment, as amended, be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, and that any statements \nrelating to the bill be printed in the Record, without further \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise to object. My understanding is \nthere is an objection on our side of the aisle relative to this \napproach. Thus, I rise this evening to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, let me say how, frankly, shocked I am at \nthis objection. We have the chairman of the EPW Committee, the ranking \nmember of the EPW Committee--this is an amendment that was brought to \nus by Senator Kit Bond of the other side of the aisle. I do not \nunderstand how the Republicans can take this position when we can see \nthese contracts abrogated as a result of our lack of action.\n  I yield to the Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask if the Senator from California will \nyield for a question. If the objection of the Senator from Nebraska \nholds and if the Republican side of the aisle does not change its \nposition, it is my understanding that there will be a rescission of \nsome $8 billion, which means cutting the highway funds going to \nNebraska, the highway funds coming to Illinois, and the highway funds \ncoming to California; is that what the outcome will be because of the \nobjection from the other side?\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think, with due respect to the Senator from Nebraska, \nthat he is saying that several of his colleagues will not allow this to \ngo through. I don't want to blame him for this. He is the messenger.\n  But the bottom line is, the $8 billion in authorizing numbers \ntranslates to $300 million in contracting authority. So as of tomorrow \nmorning, unless this is reversed, we are going to see cuts to the \nhighway program of $300 million. And it has to be made from existing \ncontracts, so people in your State, in my State, in Kentucky, in the \nState of the Senator from Nebraska--all of our States are going to \nsuffer. There will be 17,000 people thrown out of work because the \nRepublicans cannot agree with the chairman of the EPW, the ranking \nmember, and both leaders.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from California would further yield, so \nwhat the Republican side is objecting to is that we would take money \nout of the toxic asset relief program--money that was sent to the \nbanks, if you will recall, to help them out of their troubles--and put \nit into the highway trust fund to save or create 17,000 jobs across \nAmerica, and if we don't, we stand to lose those jobs--the Republican \nside is objecting to that?\n  Mrs. BOXER. The Republican side has objected to an agreement reached \nby myself and Senator Inhofe and I believe the two leaders that would \nsay we are going to replenish the highway trust fund, we are going to \nrepeal the rescission that was done and as a result the States will be \nshorted $300 million, and it is my understanding that starting tomorrow \nmorning a lot of these contracts will be canceled or delayed unless we \nfix this. We could fix it at a later date, but every day that goes by, \nit makes it more difficult because we are operating under a midnight \ndeadline tonight.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would yield for one last question, just so \nthat I understand, the result of the Republican objection is that we \nare going to protect the TARP funds, the toxic asset relief program \nfunds that were used to bail out banks, at the expense of jobs for \npeople across America at a time of high unemployment? Is that the \nresult of that objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. My friend is right. But I want to give credit to Senator \nInhofe. He is with us. There are many Members on his side of the aisle, \nhowever, who are letting this happen. But my friend has it exactly \nright. The Republicans who are objecting to this are protecting the \ntoxic asset relief program and they are jeopardizing 17,000 jobs across \nAmerica.\n  I am as stunned as you are, and I guess I am going to try one more \ntime. If I hear another objection, we will leave it for another day. I \nwill try it one more time. Maybe I have convinced my friend. Maybe my \nfriend needs to leave the floor.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nconsideration of H.R. 3617, received from the House and at the desk, \nand that the Boxer substitute amendment at the desk be considered; \nfurther, that the Boxer-Inhofe second-degree amendment with an offset \nbe considered and agreed to, the substitute amendment, as amended, be \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements \nrelating to the measure appear in the appropriate place in the Record \nas if read, without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Let me, if I might, through the Chair, inquire of the \nSenator from California if the Senator would renew her request with one \nchange: to include a different second-degree amendment from Senator \nVitter which would provide an offset from non-defense and non-veteran \nstimulus funds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Well, that is easy. If you believe we have a recession, \nif you believe the unemployment rate is too high, why in God's green \nEarth would anyone recommend cutting the economic recovery fund, the \nfund that is providing stimulus and that is putting people to work? I \nabsolutely would not agree to that. That particular fund is giving \nmoney back to taxpayers in tax breaks. It is fixing highways and \nbridges and all the other. Why on Earth would we cut that when we can \ncut the toxic asset relief program--the TARP money--that went to the \nwealthiest banks? Why on Earth would we take away jobs from working \npeople and allow the bankers to keep their little fund up there?\n  No way. We will object to that approach.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, then I do raise an objection. And here is \nthe point, in fairness to the process here. There are many who believe \nthat the TARP money, which was originally designed to buy toxic assets, \nhas drifted so far away from its original purpose that we haven't kept \nfaith with the taxpayer who paid the bill for all this. On the other \nhand, the stimulus--which, incidentally, I did not support--\n\n[[Page S9974]]\n\nhad money in it to do highways and that sort of thing, and that is \nwhere the objection is coming from.\n  So I do stand to object, and I continue the objection.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Would the Senator yield for a question?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Whether the Senator voted for the stimulus bill or not--\nand I know he did not--the stimulus bill provided tax breaks for \nworking families, provided money for his State and mine for \ninfrastructure projects that will build highways and bridges and create \njobs, and it is halfway through. They haven't really finished all the \nspending on that.\n  In the midst of this recession, you are suggesting that the way to \nsave the 17,000 highway jobs is to cut the jobs that are being created \nby the stimulus package? Wouldn't it be better to take the money away \nfrom these banks that have received billions of dollars, that have been \nbailed out over and over, than to take it at the expense of working \npeople in Nebraska and Illinois?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I thank the Senator from Illinois for that question, but \nhere is what I would say. You can restart the debate on the whole \nstimulus plan, and I can point to you the promises that were made of \nall the jobs that were going to be created, and I can point to you the \nevidence that in fact that has not occurred. But the argument tonight \nwas, look, if we can just get our hands on some TARP money, then we can \ndo all these things. And we are saying, well, look, if the promise of \nthe stimulus was to create jobs, let's use the stimulus. Why not use \nthat fund?\n  But fundamentally here is the problem. People came to the American \npeople and said: Look, our credit is melting down, our financial system \nis in serious shape, and the solution to that problem is to buy toxic \nassets. And low and behold we bought car companies, we bailed out \ninsurance companies, and it just goes on and on. And that is why the \nobjection is coming from over here because this isn't anything near \nwhat TARP was intended to do.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be brief, but the Senator from Nebraska just made \nthe argument against TARP. That is where we want to take the money from \nto protect these jobs. The Senator said the TARP money was misspent, \nand we are saying we agree with the premise; that this is a better \nplace to take money rather than to take it away from tax cuts to \nworking families in the stimulus or the infrastructure projects that \ngenerate jobs.\n  I don't know that the Senator from Nebraska wanted to assume this \nrole this evening. Occasionally, many of us are cast in these roles \nwhere we are objecting on behalf of other people who are not here. But \nI think when he reflects on this debate tonight, he will understand why \nSenator Boxer's approach to this is the most reasonable one. We are \ntrying to protect 17,000 jobs across America. We are going to take the \nmoney out of the TARP funds from banks, and I think it is money well \nspent to create jobs across the United States. But to take it away from \nthe stimulus program is to take away money that is going right now, \ntoday, into Nebraska for tax relief for your working families and into \nIllinois for the same.\n  I am sure most Republicans would agree that tax relief is a good \nthing. I myself think it is a good thing for working families. So I \nthink what Senator Boxer has suggested is a much more responsible \napproach.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will yield.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I think sometimes these debates go off on tangents and \nthey are hard to follow. They get caught up in a lot of rhetoric. But I \nthink this one tonight says it all to me. We have to ask ourselves a \nquestion: Whose side are we on? Whose side are we on? Tonight, we know \nwhat side the Republicans are on.\n  We are ready to save 17,000 jobs and to do it by paying for it out of \nthe money that was given to the biggest banks in this Nation--the banks \nthat got away scot-free while Americans suffered, whether they were \nshareholders or workers, taxpayers all. We want to take that money from \nthe big banks; they want to take it from the working people, the \nworking families of America, the ones who are out there getting their \nhands dirty and building the roads and the bridges. That says more \nabout the differences here than many of the other things we do, and I \nam stunned.\n  I particularly want to again thank Senator Inhofe for stepping up. He \ntried his best. He spoke to all his Republican friends, and he couldn't \nget this. But you know what, we are not going to give up. We will have \nthis battle on the floor. We will. We will get time for this, and we \nwill get agreement on offering these two offsets. You just had a taste \nof what the debate will be, and it will be a tough debate, and I look \nforward to it. But I am very stunned that tonight we couldn't cross the \naisle that divides us tonight. We should have. We should have done that \nfor all the States--the red States and the blue States, all the States, \nthe United States--because all are going to lose these jobs. We can say \nwe stood here at 7:30 on this night and we had a program that would \neasily stop those layoffs, easily stop them, but our colleagues on the \nother side wanted to protect the big banks. I will take that argument \nback to my home State, but I am not happy we couldn't resolve this.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from California for yielding for a \nquestion, and I agree.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am pleased the Senate is debating a \nshort-term extension of the surface transportation bill SAFETEA-LU. \nWith the fiscal year ending at midnight tonight this is an urgent \nmatter. We cannot afford to let Federal highway programs authorizations \nexpire. It would be a disaster if transportation projects across the \nnation were halted because we failed to extend their authority. \nCongress needs to rewrite the surface transportation bill, but that \nwill take some time. This short-term extension allows the program \nauthority to continue until a longer reauthorization bill can be \npassed.\n  Importantly, the Senate bill includes language to repeal the 2009 \nrescission contained in the SAFETEA-LU bill that required that on \nSeptember 30, 2009--today--$8.7 billion of apportioned contract \nauthority provided to states for investment in infrastructure be \nrescinded. This rescission could require states to de-obligate projects \nin order to free up the rescinded contract authority if they don't have \ncontract authority balances. This is critical to Michigan and all the \nother States across the Nation that cannot afford to have Federal \ninfrastructure funding cut at a time of severe budget constraints. The \nrescission repeal language would ensure that Michigan and other States \ndo not lose these needed Federal transportation funds. Michigan's share \nof the rescission is estimated to exceed $260 million or roughly 25 \npercent of its fiscal year 2009 apportionments.\n  Congress has been strong in its support for transportation \ninfrastructure funding as a way to create jobs and jump start an \neconomic recovery during the severe economic downturn. For instance, \nCongress provided $27 billion for highway projects in the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act. Congress also recently provided an \nadditional $7 billion to the highway trust fund in order to keep it \nsolvent on top of the $8 billion that it added to the trust fund last \nyear. It would make no sense to undermine the recovery efforts and \njeopardize the health of our surface transportation system by allowing \nan $8.7 billion cut in highway funding to go through tonight.\n  Time is of the essence in restoring these needed transportation funds \nto every State in the Nation. I hope this important legislation will be \nadopted immediately by the Senate and the House of Representatives.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S9975]]\n\n                             2016 Olympics\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, more than 100 years ago, four American \ncities competed to host the world's Columbian Exposition. Elected \nleaders and proud citizens traveled here to Washington to make the case \nfor their hometowns. After much debate, Congress decided that the \nexposition would take place in the center of the American heartland--\nChicago, IL.\n  The Chicago delegation had made the strongest case and shown the most \npride and conviction in their city. They bragged that their hometown on \nthe beautiful banks of Lake Michigan was the perfect site for the \nColumbia Exposition and that no other city could compare. Folks from \nChicago argued so long and so hard that a reporter referred to their \nhometown as ``that Windy City,'' and the nickname, of course, has stuck \nthroughout the years.\n  The Columbian Exposition of 1893 was a resounding success. Almost \none-fourth of the entire U.S. population came to Chicago, and the city \noverflowed with happy visitors from across the country and all over the \nworld.\n  Today, Chicago remains an economic and cultural center of America. \nThe city that hosted the Columbian Exposition has boomed into a world-\nclass metropolis. And once again the proud citizens of the Windy City \nhave stepped forward to make the case for our hometown.\n  In 2016, 10,000 athletes from more than 200 countries will come \ntogether to celebrate the human spirit. Tourists, visitors, and \nmillions of dollars will flow into a single place as a part of the \ngreatest spectacle on Earth.\n  The whole world will be watching the city that hosts the Olympic \nGames, and in 2016 that city should be Chicago, IL. From Lake Shore \nDrive to the West Side, it is a diverse and inclusive city that \nrepresents the very best of what it means to be American. It has always \nbeen a global leader in culture, art, architecture, commerce, sports, \nand even cuisine.\n  I know Chicago will shine on the world stage in 2016, just as it did \nmore than a century ago. The Olympic and Paralympic Games are a \npowerful force for global unity. It is time to bring the games back to \nthe United States.\n  President Obama understands what the Olympics will mean to our Nation \nand for Chicago. New construction and infrastructure improvement will \nrevitalize the Midwest; tourist dollars from all over the world will \nbegin flowing to American businesses once again; jobs will be created, \nrevenue will increase, our local economy will be jolted back to \nprosperity as we prepare to host the games.\n  It doesn't stop there. This impact will also be felt at the national \nlevel. Foreign visitors who travel to the Olympics in Chicago will also \nstop in Los Angeles, New York, Baltimore, Miami, Seattle, New Orleans, \nand a dozen other cities during their stay in the United States. The \ninternational spotlight will be focused on America and it will bring \nprosperity and good will. That is why I support President Obama's \ndecision to travel to Copenhagen in support of our Olympic bid.\n  Some have criticized this trip. Some say it is an unnecessary \ndistraction from the challenges we face. But I believe it is just the \nopposite. It shows that the President is more focused than ever on \nbringing economic prosperity and international prestige back to the \nUnited States.\n  A few days ago I was meeting with the mayor of Chicago and I told \nMayor Daley that I thought the President and the First Lady would go to \nCopenhagen. There was some consternation as to whether he was going to \nappear, but because of the importance of the Olympics to Chicago and \nthe Nation, I knew the President's decision was going to be made that \nwould allow him to make an appearance in Copenhagen. I know they are \nproud Chicagoans, and I am pleased they have decided on strong support \nfor their hometown. The trip will be a short one, but it could make a \nworld of difference for Chicago and for America, because this is not \njust about Chicago or Illinois, it is about bringing the Olympic Games \nback to the United States of America. The Olympics will be a boon to \nour economy and they will strengthen our friendship with other nations.\n  By appearing before the International Olympic Committee in person, \nPresident Obama can make the case that America is ready to lead once \nagain, ready to light the torch of cooperation and prosperity for all \nof the citizens of the world. He can show the committee that Chicago is \nby far the best choice among the four remaining finalist cities. For \nthe athletes, world-class training facility and event locations would \nbe very close together, allowing for convenience and ease. For \nvisitors, outstanding public transportation and modern infrastructure \nwould make all events easy to attend. For residents of the city and \npeople all across the United States, Chicago would shine on the world \nstage and dollars would pour in from across the globe to make it clear \nit is alive and well in my hometown.\n  The Chicago 2016 Committee recognizes the importance of the games in \nrenewing old friendships around the world as well as establishing new \nones. Its ideals and the value of ``friendship through sport'' is at \nthe heart of the city's Olympic bid.\n  Let us support President Obama as he travels to Denmark in hopes of \nbringing the Olympics and Paralympic Games back to the United States. \nThey are a powerful, inspiring force for unity in a world divided. Let \nus come together once again to welcome the people of every continent to \nour shores. Just as the people of Chicago did more than 100 years ago, \nlet us celebrate our Nation by sharing one of the greatest cities with \nall of the world, by sharing its greatest city with the rest of the \nworld, that great city on the lake--Chicago.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to congratulate a \ndistinguished Illinois resident, Amy Meyer. Ms. Meyer is this year's \nrecipient of the Service to America National Security and International \nAffairs Medal. This award honors Federal employees who have made \nsignificant contributions to our nation through their actions in the \nfield of national security.\n  Since 2006, Ms. Meyer has served as the Director of the U.S. Agency \nfor International Development's Office of Economic Growth in Pakistan. \nIn this, her first Foreign Service assignment, Ms. Meyer has overseen \nan expansion of Pakistan's Office of Economic Growth from a small, two-\nperson operation with a $7 million budget into a $200 million \ninitiative.\n  Ms. Meyer has dedicated herself to leading the U.S. effort to foster \neconomic growth in the country. Through her collaborative approach and \nthe development of a wide range of programs, Ms. Meyer is bringing \nchange to a country facing many problems, including a crippling energy \ncrisis and the growing influence of the Taliban.\n  Of the many programs Ms. Meyer has developed, several focus on \nassisting the women of Pakistan. Among them is the Empower Pakistan: \nAgriculture Program. Through this program 1 million women will join \ndairy cooperatives where they will collect and store milk to be sold \nlater at markets. Women who participate in this program will be able to \nearn income from these sales. Ms. Meyer also conducts focus groups for \nwomen in her own home and leads a yoga program which airs on Pakistani \ntelevision.\n  As the 2009 Service to America National Security and International \nAffairs Medalist, Amy Meyer is honored for her commitment to working \nwith the people of Pakistan to bring about economic growth and \nstability. I commend Ms. Meyer on her work in the Office of Economic \nGrowth and congratulate her on receiving the National Security and \nInternational Affairs Medal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9976-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FISCAL PRUDENCE\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I listened to the comments of the Senator \nfrom Alabama with interest.\n  I want to inform my colleagues that despite the rhetoric we have \nheard it is important to remember that the funds that we have \nrecommended in the fiscal year 2010 appropriations bills are in \naccordance with the level provided to the committee in the budget \nresolution.\n  Second, each one of the bills that he mentioned was approved by the \ncommittee by unanimous, or near unanimous, votes.\n  Third, each of the bills considered by the Senate so far this year \nhave been approved at the funding level that the Senator has noted.\n  In addition, in most cases--in the Transportation and Interior bills \nfor example--the level of funding approved by the committee is lower \nthan the amount requested by the administration.\n  We are all concerned about deficits and overspending, but the root \ncause of this problem is not in discretionary domestic spending.\n  The cause was the failed policies of the previous administration that \nran up trillions in our national debt.\n  To remind my colleagues when President Bush was elected the country \nhad a budget surplus. After 8 long years, the country inherited an \nunprecedented national debt.\n  What is even worse, the Obama administration and the Nation also \ninherited a fiscal crisis unseen since Herbert Hoover.\n  While I understand and share the concern of many of my colleagues \nover our Nation's debt, they have set their sights on the wrong target. \nThe increases in discretionary spending will reverse the neglect which \noccurred in the previous administration and will help put people back \nto work.\n  The Appropriations Committee will continue to work in a bipartisan \nfashion to recommend bills which are fiscally prudent and within the \namounts recommended by this Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9976-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9976-S9977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MEMBERSHIP AND JURISDICTION OF COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN RELATIONS\n\n  Mr. KERRY.

Mr. President, the U.S. Constitution, the document by \nwhich we define ourselves as a nation, emphasizes freedom and equality. \nIts words have inspired generations of Americans to create a society \nthat sustains those values: one that preserves our freedom and reminds \nits citizens that we are all created equally. Among those who are \nleading the fight to protect this constitutional guarantee of equality \nare the people of Vermont, who I have been proud to represent for the \npast 34 years.\n  Vermonters have consistently led the charge to perfect our Union and \nto support the fight for equality and social justice. Vermont was the \nfirst State in our Union to outlaw slavery, and was also the first to \nadopt voting rights, regardless of property ownership. Vermont \ndemonstrated its commitment to social justice years ago with the \npassage of inclusive hate crimes and employment nondiscrimination \nlegislation. I hope our Federal Government will follow Vermont's lead \nwith regard to these essential protections.\n  Vermonters have led the Nation by protecting families and by ensuring \nthat children are in stable, loving environments. This is because \nVermonters believe that parents should be allowed to strengthen their \ncommitments to one another. In 2000, Vermont took a crucial step when \nit became the first State in the Nation to allow civil unions for same-\nsex couples. Recently, Vermont took another step to help sustain the \nrelationships that fulfill our lives by becoming the first state to \nadopt same-sex marriage through the legislative process without a court \nmandate to do so.\n  I commend the Vermont State Legislature for its actions, and for \nsetting aside partisan differences to serve the people of Vermont and \nto serve as an example for the Nation. Throughout the tumultuous debate \non this issue, both chambers considered each side's viewpoint, and all \npoints of view were heard. This was a real testament to our democratic \nprocess. Yet despite that debate, the Governor vetoed the legislation \nthat was approved by the legislature.\n  The Vermont State Legislature has the distinction of being a part-\ntime body. They work within the very communities they represent on a \ndaily basis. During the debate, these legislators listened to their \nneighbors, their friends, and their constituents. During this process, \nthey realized that marriage equality was something the people of \nVermont wanted. Some members of the State legislature ultimately \ndecided to put aside their personal views. They did not want to have \nsuch an important issue decided by a single vote. They did not believe \nthat one person should be able to prevent what Vermonters were \nseeking--equality for all its citizens. In the end, several of the \nlegislators who originally voted against the bill cast their vote to \noverride the Governor's veto. I believe that the actions of those \nlegislators and the entire Vermont Legislature deserve our admiration.\n\n[[Page S9978]]\n\n  As a Vermonter who has been married for 47 years, I am a great fan of \nthe institution of marriage. I believe it is important to encourage and \nto sanction committed relationships, and to provide for stable, \nsupportive families. When Vermont passed legislation on same-sex \nmarriage, it reaffirmed my fundamental belief we should not create \nsecond-class families who do not enjoy the protections other families \nhave. Unfortunately this is still not the case in our Federal \nGovernment. With laws like the Defense of Marriage Act in effect, \nVermont same-sex marriages are still treated differently. I believe it \nis time to repeal it, so that all Vermonters can be treated equally \nunder the law.\n  Vermont's State motto is depicted clearly on our State flag: \n``Freedom and Unity.'' Today, same-sex couples in Vermont are now able \nto enjoy the same freedoms that opposite sex couples in Vermont enjoy. \nSame-sex couples now have the freedom to create and to preserve family \nunity, and to bring happiness and stability to their children and loved \nones. I am proud to represent the people of Vermont and I commend them \nfor having reached yet another milestone in the march toward equality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9978-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING THE CAPITOL HILL SCREENING OF ``THE WAY WE GET BY''\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I commemorate the Capitol Hill \nscreening of ``The Way We Get By'', a deeply moving and powerful \ndocumentary film about the iconic Troop Greeters of Bangor in my home \nState of Maine. On this wonderful occasion, I join with my colleagues \nin the Maine Delegation--Senator Collins, and Representatives Michaud \nand Pingree--in expressing my tremendous gratitude not only to the \nUSO--the indispensable ``home-away-from-home'' for our more than 2.5 \nmillion men and women exceptional enough to wear our Nation's uniform, \nso admirably led by USO president and CEO Sloan Gibson--but also to \nOperation Homefront as well as HandsOn Network--cofounded by Michelle \nNunn--who is forging her own path within the longstanding, Nunn family \nhistory of commitment to service as CEO of Points of Light Institute.\n  A part of President Obama's United We Serve initiative, all three of \nthese stellar organizations are presenting this magnificent film in the \nU.S. Capitol at the wonderful Capitol Visitor Center, and we couldn't \nbe more grateful to them--as well as to the Professional Services \nCouncil and the Corporation for Public Broadcasting--and others too \nnumerous to mention for helping bring this documentary to fruition. And \nI would like to especially thank Simon Kilmurry, executive director of \nAmerican Documentary, and Aron Gaudet, the film's director, for their \nstalwart leadership and dedication on this exemplary project.\n  And it couldn't be more fitting to have Dr. Jill Biden, the wife of \nVice President Biden, introduce this well-deserved tribute to the \nBangor Troop Greeters at today's screening--especially as Beau, the \nVice President's son and Delaware's attorney general, has just returned \nfrom his deployment in Iraq as a member of the Delaware Army National \nGuard's 261st Signal Brigade. We commend Beau and all of those \nreturning in his brigade, and we cannot thank them enough for their \ncourageous service and heroic sacrifice to our Nation.\n  And of course, expressing our admiration and thankfulness to those \nwho have placed themselves in harm's way on our behalf is the driving \nimpetus behind this superb endeavor to capture on film the incredible \ngenerosity of spirit and good will unflaggingly exemplified by the \nBangor Troop Greeters. For these extraordinary individuals, three of \nwhom are showcased in the movie and attended today's screening, meeting \nour service men and women at the Bangor International Airport is an \nundeniable labor of love and a heartfelt expression of their devotion \nto our country and all who defend her.\n  In chronicling the selfless, patriotic and frankly larger-than-life \nactions of three amazing Mainers--Bill Knight, Joan Gaudet, and Jerry \nMundy, director and Old Town native, Aron Gaudet--in tandem with Gita \nPullapilly, the film's producer and interviewer, deftly brings to this \nundertaking the venerable tradition of extending handshakes and hugs to \nour brave soldiers, dating back to the first gulf war and Operation \nDesert Storm. And to document the humanity underpinning this monumental \noutpouring of support for our troops--which occurs 24 hours a day, 365 \ndays a year, rain or shine--is a marvelous achievement and one which \ninstills enormous pride in us all.\n  On a personal note, I can't tell you how many of our soldiers I have \nencountered who have expressed their immense appreciation to the world-\nrenowned Bangor Troop Greeters. In fact, I well recall one soldier \ncoming up to me specifically to convey just how remarkable the troop \ngreeters were and that fellow soldiers shared the same sentiment. We \necho that very sensibility today.\n  Congratulations to all who have been involved in the continuing \nsuccess of this highly-acclaimed film documenting a phenomenal story of \ngiving back to those who have given us all so much--our service men and \nwomen!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9978-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO FRANK D.

From business to health care to the arts \nto charity work, there is little that happens in Detroit that doesn't \ninvolve Frank Stella in some way. Frank has long been active in the \ncity's most important business groups, including the Detroit Regional \nChamber of Commerce and Detroit Economic Club. A patron of the arts, he \nhas served on governing boards for the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, \nMichigan Opera Theatre, and Detroit Discovery Museum. He has \ndemonstrated a longtime commitment to health care, serving on the \nboards of the Detroit Medical Center, Mount Carmel Mercy Hospital, \nSacred Heart Rehabilitation Center, and Grace Hospital of Detroit. \nEducation has been another focus: He has served on the boards of the \nUniversity of Detroit-Mercy, his alma mater, as well as the Wayne \nCounty Community College Foundation.\n  The breadth and depth of his accomplishments and involvement has \ndrawn the notice of many. Organizations as diverse as the Detroit Urban \nLeague, the Rehabilitation Institute of Michigan, and the American \nInstitute of Architects have honored him for his contributions. In \n1995, he received an Ellis Island Medal of Honor, an award recognizing \nthe importance of the immigrant experience in American life. The \nItalian Government has bestowed numerous awards upon him, as have four \nU.S. Presidents. His support of his Roman Catholic faith has earned the \nthanks of popes.\n  On Oct. 30, many of Frank's friends will gather to honor his 90th \nbirthday. Fittingly, the celebration will serve as a fundraiser for \nfour more of Frank's causes: the National Italian American Foundation \nScholarship Fund, Orders of the Sons of Italy in America, Italian \nLanguage Inter-Cultural Alliance, and Boys' Town of Italy. I thank him \nfor his years of service to our city and State and wish him continued \nhealth and success in his many community endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9978-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9978-S9979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n              RECOGNIZING THE PARKS AND PEOPLE FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, today I congratulate the Parks and \nPeople Foundation of Baltimore, which is celebrating its 25th \nanniversary. Community activist Sally Michel founded Parks and People \nin 1984. Since then, Parks and People has grown from Sally's kitchen \ncounter to a planned, eco-friendly, LEED Platinum-certified \nheadquarters.\n  Today, Parks and People Foundation, under the leadership of Jackie \nCarrerra and the creative energy and advocacy\n\n[[Page S9979]]\n\nof Sally Michel, is working hard to make Baltimore green, to educate \nand enable our communities to get involved in that effort, and to make \nsure that our children grow up knowing about the importance of the \nenvironment and their role in protecting it, whether as a landscaper, \narborist, scientist, a business owner, or homeowner.\n  Parks and People also has become a leader in enriching the lives of \nBaltimore-area children. Its Kids Grow program provides afterschool \nenvironmental curriculum and instruction. SuperKids Camp has become a \nnational model for summer learning, providing rising 2nd and 3rd \ngraders in the public schools an opportunity to sharpen reading and \nmath skills as well as experience the cultural and academic resources \nin the Baltimore area. Sports Leagues provide coaches, equipment, \ntransportation, and referees for volleyball, lacrosse, soccer, and \nbaseball teams in public middle schools without athletic programs. \nParticipants are required to have good school attendance and grades.\n  In the 1980s, when support for Baltimore's parks was waning due to \nbudget cuts and lack of leadership, the Parks and People Foundation \ntook up the challenge and worked to establish and financially support \ngroups interested in maintaining and creating parks throughout the \ncity. Partnership for Parks provides grants for projects ranging from \ngarden bed improvement and planting to new fences and benches. \nWatershed 263 is an ambitious experiment to improve the quality of \nsurface water runoff on 930 acres in 13 urban communities. Parks and \nPeople works with residents to reduce litter, clean streets, increase \nrecycling, create community gardens, install storm water management \nfacilities and clean and green vacant lots and plant trees. Improvement \nhere will lead to a cleaner, healthier Chesapeake Bay and serve as a \nmodel for other urban watershed areas.\n  I know the entire Senate will join me in congratulating the Parks and \nPeople Foundation on celebrating its 25th anniversary and in thanking \nthe foundation for its work to improve the quality of life in Baltimore \nfor future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9979-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO VIRGINIA SCOTTY GOUGH\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I honor a group of women \nwho have made a lasting contribution to American history. They are the \nWomen Airforce Service Pilots, or WASP.\n  Who are the WASP?\n  They were the first women trained in American military aircraft. They \nwere trailblazers and true patriots. They are women like Virginia \nScotty Gough. They came from all walks of life. They were students, \nsecretaries, nurses, daughters, wives. One was a nun. They shared the \nsame goal: to contribute to the American war effort.\n  Between 1942 and 1944, the 1,102 WASP trained in Texas, then went on \nto fly noncombat military missions so that all their male counterparts \ncould be deployed to combat. These women piloted every kind of military \naircraft, and logged 60 million miles flying missions across the United \nStates. Thirty-eight of them died in the line of duty.\n  These intrepid women served their country with courage and valor. But \nfor too long, their country did not serve them. They were never awarded \nfull military status and were ineligible for officer status. They faced \nstrong cultural and gender bias and received unequal pay. Following the \nwar, they were told to pay their own way home. It was not until 1977--\nmore than 30 years later--that the WASP were granted veterans' status.\n  Thirteen of these brave women hail from Maryland. Four are still \nalive today: Virginia Scotty Gough, Florence Marston, Elaine Harmon, \nand Nancy Magruder. I am proud to honor them today.\n  Virginia Bradley Gough, known as Scotty, grew up in California. She \nlearned to fly at age 16 and has avidly pursed that dream for many \nyears. In 1943, when she learned about the WASP program, she was eager \nto join. But her young age prevented her from immediately enrolling in \nthe training. As is so indicative of the WASP, she didn't waste the \nyear. Instead, she earned money to continue flying by making parachute \njumps to attract people to the airport.\n  After completing her WASP training as part of the class of 44-7, \nScotty was stationed in the engineering department at Williams Army Air \nBase in Chandler, AZ. There she served as an engineering test pilot, \ntesting aircraft after major engine overhauls and other major repairs. \nShe served as a check pilot to the aircraft, ensuring repairs and fixes \nwere safe before an aircraft was released to combat. It was dangerous \nwork, requiring a devoted and precise pilot.\n  After the WASP were unceremoniously disbanded in December 1944, \nScotty Gough returned to Los Angeles and flew Luscombe aircraft from \nthe factory to west coast distributors, making the most of her well-\nhoned piloting skills.\n  Many years later, Scotty Gough and another WASP established the WASP \nexhibit at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. I am proud that Virginia \n``Scotty'' Gough now calls Maryland home.\n  Like the other WASP, Scotty Gough was a trailblazer and true patriot. \nShe paved the way for the armed services to lift the ban on women \nattending military flight training in the 1970s, and eventually led to \nwomen being fully integrated as pilots in the U.S. military. We owe her \nour ``thank you''--not in words, but in deeds. Her story should have \nnever been a forgotten chapter in American history. It will no longer \nbe.\n  I was proud to fight for legislation to award the WASP the most \ndistinguished honor Congress can give: the Congressional Gold Medal. I \nam proud the bill passed quickly and has now been signed into law. The \nprocess of designing, casting, and presenting these medals has begun. I \nlook forward to the day, very soon, when I can present Scotty Gough and \nall the other WASP this medal they have earned and so long \ndeserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9979-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9979-S9980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ELAINE HARMON\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I honor a group of women \nwho have made a lasting contribution to American history. They are the \nWomen Airforce Service Pilots, or WASP.\n  Who are the WASP?\n  They were the first women trained in American military aircraft. They \nwere trailblazers and true patriots. They are women like Elaine Harmon, \nfrom Baltimore. They came from all walks of life. They were students, \nsecretaries, nurses, daughters, wives. One was a nun.

Following the \nwar, they were told to pay their own way home. It was not until 1977--\nmore than 30 years later--that the WASP were granted veterans' status.\n  Thirteen of these brave women hail from Maryland. Four are still \nalive today: Elaine Harmon, Nancy Magruder, Florence Marston, and V. \nScotty Gough. I am proud to honor them today.\n  Born in Baltimore, Elaine Harmon began flying at College Park Airport \nwhile attending University of Maryland. An ad in the local college \nnewspaper for the Civilian Pilot Training Program piqued her interest. \nThe program required a parent's consent. Knowing her mother would never \nagree to it, she sent the form to her father instead. He signed it and \nmailed it back to her with the $40 tuition fee. The family never spoke \nof it again.\n  After Pearl Harbor, Elaine and her husband supported the war efforts \nin ways they could. Her husband desperately wanted to join the Army Air \nForce, but wasn't able to due to a constriction in his aorta. He \nlearned to repair aircraft instruments and moved to Biak Island, West \nPapua, to locally repair the instruments, thus saving several weeks in \nrepair for transit.\n\n[[Page S9980]]\n\n  Nearly 5 years after learning to fly, Elaine's husband suggested she \njoin the WASP. She earned her wings as a WASP in the class of 44-9. \nAfter completing her WASP training, Elaine was stationed at Nellis Air \nForce Base, near Las Vegas, NV. There she flew BT-13s and B-17s. BT-13s \nwere used to allow pilots to practice instrument flying. Elaine would \npilot the aircraft, freeing her male counterparts to practice their \ninstrument flying.\n  It was a daunting task. The technology was different then. The men \nhad to sit in the backseat, under a dark hood which obscured their view \nof everything but the instruments in front of them. They could only do \nit because they had a great pilot in the front ensuring their safety.\n  After the WASP were disbanded in December 1944, Elaine made her way \nback to Baltimore. She didn't stay long. Her mother was embarrassed, \nashamed that Elaine would participate in what was seen at the time as \nan unlady-like endeavor. So Elaine scraped together what skimpy savings \nshe had and bought a one-way ticket to California. With her husband \nstill overseas and with less than $30 in her pocket, she eventually \nfound a job as an air traffic controller in Oakland.\n  Thirty years passed before Elaine Harmon was offered veterans' \nstatus. Thirty years before her service to the nation was recognized. \nBut like the other WASP, Elaine Harmon believed in the cause she \nserved. She knew the obstacles, but chose her own way. In the end, she \npaved the way for the armed services to lift the ban on women attending \nmilitary flight training in the 1970s, and eventually led to women \nbeing fully integrated as pilots in the U.S. military. Today women can \nfly every type of aircraft and mission, from fighter jets in combat to \nthe shuttle in space flight. Women like Elaine Harmon made this \npossible.\n  The WASP were trailblazers and true patriots. We owe them our ``thank \nyou''--not in words, but in deeds. For their courage, service and \ndedication to our nation, the WASP have earned the most distinguished \nhonor Congress can give: the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  Now the bill to give WASP Congress' top award has been passed and \nsigned into law. The process of designing, casting, and presenting \nthese medals had begun. I look forward to the day, very soon, when I \ncan present Elaine Harmon and all the other WASP this medal they have \nearned and so long deserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9980-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO NANCY MAGRUDER\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I honor a group of women \nwho have made a lasting contribution to American history. They are the \nWomen Airforce Service Pilots, or WASP.\n  Who are the WASP?\n  They were the first women trained in American military aircraft. They \nwere trailblazers and true patriots.

It was not until 1977--\nmore than 30 years later--that the WASP were granted veterans' status.\n  Thirteen of these brave women hail from Maryland. Four are still \nalive today: Nancy Magruder, Florence Marston, Elaine Harmon, and V. \nScotty Gough. I am proud to honor them today.\n  Iola ``Nancy'' Clay Magruder earned her wings as part of class 44-7. \nAfter graduation, she was stationed at Enid Army Air Base in Oklahoma. \nHer mission was to train aviation cadets to become pilots and \ncommissioned officers, an honor that would not be extended to the WASP \nduring WWII. While at Enid Army Air Base, Nancy flew utility missions, \nor testing missions, to ensure the aircraft were safe for the cadets. \nShe also flew ferrying missions of the BT-13s and BT-15s. In all, Nancy \nwould fly five different aircraft variants: the BT-13; BT-15; PT-17; \nand the B-18 ``Bolo,'' the most numerous long range bomber of WWII.\n  Like the other WASP, Nancy was unceremoniously disbanded in December \n1944. The promise that she would be militarized and become part of the \nArmy was not kept. Still, Nancy wanted to serve. She would join the \nU.S. Air Force Reserve and earned the rank of second lieutenant.\n  Nancy's story is a story of dedication to this county. She risked her \nlife in service to our nation so that the rest of us may live in \nfreedom. She did so without the promise of recognition or pay. And she \npaved the way for the armed services to lift the ban on women attending \nmilitary flight training in the 1970s, and eventually led to women \nbeing fully integrated as pilots in the U.S. military. We owe her our \n``thank you''--not in words, but in deeds.\n  For too long, the WASP story of service and sacrifice has been left \nuntold. I'm proud to have fought to right this wrong by sponsoring \nlegislation to award Nancy Magruder and her fellow WASP the most \ndistinguished honor Congress can give: the Congressional Gold Medal.\n  Now the bill has been passed and signed into law. The process of \ndesigning, casting, and presenting these medals has begun. And I look \nforward to the day, very soon, when I can present Nancy Magruder and \nall the other WASP this medal they have earned and so long \ndeserved.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9980-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9980-S9981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO FLORENCE MARSTON\n\n Ms. MIKULSKI.

Four are still \nalive today: Florence Marston, Elaine Harmon, Nancy Magruder, and V. \nScotty Gough. I am proud to honor them today.\n  Florence Niemiec Marston, born in Buffalo, NY, volunteered to enter \nWASP training at an early age. She paid her own way to get to the \ntraining site in Texas, and earned her wings as part of the class of \n43-6. After graduation, her talents and bravery were needed in several \nduty locations: South Plains Army Air Base, Dodge City Army Air Base, \nand Pueblo Army Air Base.\n  At South Plains, Florence flew B-25s and C-60s, and trained to tow \nCG-4 gliders mostly at low altitude and at night. It was a risky and \narduous mission. Later, Florence was selected to transfer to Dodge City \nArmy Air Base and fly the B-26.\n  The B-26 was a difficult aircraft to fly. It was called the \n``widowmaker,'' for it was notorious for its number of early accidents. \nOnly about 100 WASP would learn to fly this aircraft. Florence Marston \nwas one of them.\n  While stationed at Dodge City, Florence Marston flew B-26s on tow-\ntarget\n\n[[Page S9981]]\n\nmissions. This intense mission meant towing a target behind the \naircraft, a target that training aerial gunners would practice shooting \nusing live ammunition. It was one of the most dangerous missions the \nWASP would be asked to perform. Florence mastered it with courage, \nskill and dedication.\n  Later, after being transferred to Pueblo Army Air Base, Florence \nwould pilot B-24s, B-25s, UC-78s, and L-5s, primarily in administrative \npiloting duties. In all, Florence Marston piloted ten different \naircraft types as a WASP.\n  Like the other WASP, Florence Marston was a trailblazer and true \npatriot. She paved the way for the armed services to lift the ban on \nwomen attending military flight training in the 1970s, and eventually \nled to women being fully integrated as pilots in the U.S. military.

Whitehouse, and \n        Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 1730. A bill to provide for minimum loss ratios for health \ninsurance coverage; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I am pleased today to introduce the \nFairness in Health Insurance Act. This bill will hold health insurance \ncompanies accountable by requiring that at least 90 percent of your \npremium dollars go toward health services, not profits or \nadministrative waste. As we move forward in health reform, it is \nessential that health insurance companies know that their top priority \nmust be serving beneficiaries, not taking care of shareholders or CEOs.\n  This bill is inspired by the unique culture of health care in \nMinnesota, which includes the Mayo Clinic, cooperative models like \nHealthPartners, and visionary public health leadership from State \nlegislators. Heath care in our State is also distinguished by the fact \nthat 90 percent of Minnesotans are served by a nonprofit health plan. \nThese plans outperform their national peers and are able to put 91 \ncents of every premium dollar toward actual health care services.\n  In other plans throughout the nation, though, you may find less than \n60 percent of your premium is put toward health care; the rest is for \noverhead, marketing and profits. By taking the profits out of the \nhealth insurance industry, Minnesota health plans do a better job \nhelping our residents to live healthier, longer lives. The Fairness in \nHealth Insurance Act will help us hold all health plans to the same \nstandards we've set in Minnesota by requiring that 90 percent of \npremium dollars actually pay for health services.\n  But while millions of Americans struggle to pay for health care, \ninsurance executives continue to make obscene salaries. Last year, \nthree top health insurance executives saw boosts in their total \ncompensation--some of them making almost $10 million. I believe in fair \ncompetition but I do not support companies making obscene profits off \nof health care. The Fairness in Health Insurance Act will force \ninsurance companies to prioritize health services for beneficiaries \nover bonus packages for CEOs.\n  In fact, the current reality is that most of us don't know where our \nhealth insurance premiums go. It's challenging enough to understand a \nbilling statement from your health insurance company, much less track \nwhere your money is being spent. The Fairness in Health Insurance Act \nalso requires transparent reporting of how health insurance companies \nare spending your money. This transparency is especially important as \nwe move to cover all Americans in health reform. Clear reporting will \nhelp us hold insurance companies accountable for every dollar we invest \nin health insurance.\n  Now, although Minnesota outperforms most states in health care, I \nknow we can continue to do better as well. When I talk with \nMinnesotans, I hear again and again that people are living in fear \nabout health care. They are afraid of losing their health insurance, or \nworried about getting sick and going bankrupt. The reality is that 50 \npercent of bankruptcies today are caused by health costs and 80 percent \nof these Americans actually have health insurance.\n  Passing national health reform this year is my top priority because I \nhave listened to Minnesotans across the State. They have told me, loud \nand clear, that the current health insurance system is not working for \nthem. The Fairness in Health Insurance Act of 2009 is an important part \nof my health reform strategy that also includes cost containment, \nsimplifying paperwork, focusing on prevention, pushing for a public \noption and making\n\n[[Page S9984]]\n\nsure that all Americans have access to affordable, secure health \ninsurance.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me to ensure that these commonsense \nstrategies are included in our health reform bill when it comes to the \nfloor. Taken together, these elements will bring our country into a new \nera in which high-quality--and affordable--health care is a reality for \nall Americans.\n  Mr. President, I ask for unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1730\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require certain mortgagees to make loan \nmodifications, to establish a grant program for State and local \ngovernment mediation programs, to create databases on foreclosures, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce the Preserving Homes and \nCommunities Act of 2009. I thank Senators Durbin, Whitehouse, and \nMerkley for joining me as original cosponsors of this bill. In the last \nyear the Federal Government has taken decisive action and devoted \nsubstantial financial resources to shoring up financial markets, \naverting a potential national and global financial meltdown. However, \nthe current foreclosure crisis continues to pose a threat to the \nwellbeing of individual families, local communities, and the broader \neconomy. We must take similarly aggressive actions to stabilize the \nhousing markets.\n  Despite efforts to forestall the current crisis, the number of \nforeclosures is alarming. A reported 1.5 million properties were in the \nforeclosure process during the first 6 months of 2009, on pace to \nsurpass last year's foreclosure filings by more than a third. \nMeanwhile, economist Mark Zandi suggests that the number of mortgages \nin default could rise to 4 million this year.\n  The situation in my own State of Rhode Island is particularly dire. \nMoody's Economy.com reports that 22 percent of Rhode Island mortgages \nare underwater, and the State has the highest rate of foreclosure \nstarts in New England. More than one in eight mortgages are at least \none payment past due, suggesting that the situation may be getting \nworse. Indeed, as foreclosures dipped nationally in August, they \ncontinued to rise in Rhode Island.\n  These numbers are more than statistics. They represent children \nuprooted from schools, life savings evaporated, and families faced with \nthe daunting prospect of starting over. For communities, these numbers \ncan translate into cycles of blight, disinvestment, and crime that \nweaken neighborhoods and damage the property values of the families \nstruggling to retain their homes.\n  This did not happen overnight. As we all know, during the past \nseveral years, housing prices in cities and States around the country \nfar outpaced any increase in wages. Some families stretched themselves \nfinancially to become homeowners, but many others were steered towards \nalternative or exotic mortgage loan products to purchase their homes. \nHowever, as home prices have declined, many people who took out these \nand other exotic loans are now finding they owe more than the value of \ntheir property and that they cannot sustain the sharp monthly payment \nincreases their alternative mortgages require.\n  However, as unemployment has risen, so has the number of foreclosures \namong homeowners with more traditional mortgages. According to the \nMortgage Bankers Association, more than a third of the overall increase \nin the start of foreclosures in the second quarter was attributable to \nprime, fixed rate loans. More and more households are finding that even \nwith a fixed rate mortgage that they could afford in normal times, they \nare just one pink slip away from losing their biggest investment.\n  I am introducing the Preserving Homes and Communities Act to address \nthis crisis. First, it establishes a new mortgage payment assistance \nprogram to help homeowners who, with temporary financial assistance, \nwould be able to hold onto their homes. Specifically, it authorizes \n$6.375 billion in formula funding to enable states to offer grants or \nsubsidized loan funds to qualified families who have suffered \nsignificant decreases in income. My bill outlines requirements to \nensure that states will carefully steward Federal dollars by evaluating \napplicants' prospects for future employment, targeting middle class \nhomeowners, prohibiting payments that reward predatory lenders, and \ncapping maximum loan or grant amounts. Yet the criteria are flexible \nenough that states can design programs that will most effectively meet \nlocal needs.\n  My bill also takes aim at the slow progress that servicers and \nlenders have made in implementing the administration's foreclosure \nprevention programs. A September report on the Home Affordable \nModification Program indicated that just 12 percent of eligible \nhomeowners with delinquent mortgages had been granted trial \nmodifications. Too many homeowners are waiting too long--weeks, months, \nor longer--to get answers to their loan modification applications. In \nthe meantime, they are still subject to costly foreclosure proceedings \nthat can make it more difficult for them to eventually qualify for \nassistance.\n  The Preserving Homes and Communities Act creates an incentive for \nlenders to more quickly evaluate whether homeowners qualify for \nmodifications by requiring that homeowners be evaluated for a loan \nmodification that conforms with the Administration's programs before a \nbank can initiate foreclosure. It also states that homeowners who \nqualify must be offered a modification. My bill prevents costly fees \nfrom piling up while qualified homeowners wait to be granted more \naffordable mortgages, and no longer will homeowners be left out in the \ncold if their particular loan servicer chooses not to participate in \nthe government program. And if lenders fail to follow the rules, this \nbill will allow homeowners to use servicers' noncompliance as a defense \nto foreclosure. The bill also places prudent\n\n[[Page S9985]]\n\nlimits on the fees that homeowners can be charged--particularly \nforeclosure-related fees.\n  My legislation provides $80 million as an incentive for more States \nand local governments to create strong mediation programs, an \nadditional tool to help homeowners facing foreclosure. Mediation \nprograms allow homeowners and servicers to meet, face to face, to try \nto find an alternative to foreclosure. These programs have shown \npromise in several state and local settings for helping homeowners \navoid foreclosure, and this legislation will provide matching funds to \nhelp establish new mediation initiatives. This bill also sets aside $5 \nmillion for the creation of a Federal database on defaults and \nforeclosures to improve oversight of public and private efforts to \nsustain homeownership.\n  Finally, we know that these tough economic times are impacting \nrenters as well. Competition for already-scarce affordable housing has \nincreased. With the poverty rate at its highest level in 11 years, more \nindividuals and families with limited incomes are at risk of \nhomelessness. For this reason, the Preserving Homes and Communities Act \nuses proceeds from the warrant provisions I crafted for the financial \nrescue package to capitalize the National Housing Trust Fund. These \nwarrant provisions are allowing taxpayers to benefit from the upside of \nour investments in faltering financial institutions. My view is that \nsome of these returns from providing a firmer foundation for our \nfinancial institutions would be put to good use by providing a firmer \nfoundation for affordable housing in our country. The National Housing \nTrust Fund, which I worked to establish in the Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act, will enable the building, preservation, and \nrehabilitation of affordable housing.\n  I am introducing the Preserving Homes and Communities Act because \nwhen homes get foreclosed on, it does not just affect individual \nborrowers and lenders. Whole neighborhoods pay the price. Housing \nindustry experts estimate that for every foreclosure within an eighth \nof a mile of a house, two and a half city blocks in every direction, \nthe property value of surrounding homes drops by about 1 percent.\n  I believe that the Federal Government has a role to play in ensuring \nthat millions of Americans, including neighbors who avoided risky loans \nand have sacrificed and saved to pay their bills on time, are protected \nfrom further declines in property values and the blight of abandoned \nhomes.\n  This legislation is targeted relief that will help more families keep \ntheir homes and protect communities from even greater losses. The \nPreserving Homes and Communities Act will set us on the path to \nstabilizing the housing sector as a foundation of lasting economic \nrecovery. I hope my colleagues will join me and Senators Durbin, \nWhitehouse, and Merkley in supporting this bill and other foreclosure \nprevention efforts.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1731\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 295\n\n       Whereas metastatic breast cancer refers to stage IV breast \n     cancer, when cancer cells travel from the breast, either \n     through the bloodstream or the lymphatic system, to other \n     parts of the body, including the bones, liver, lungs, or \n     brain, and continue to grow in the new location;\n       Whereas in 2009, an estimated 192,370 women and 1,910 men \n     in the United States will be diagnosed with invasive breast \n     cancer, and 62,280 women will be diagnosed with in situ \n     breast cancer;\n       Whereas nearly 30 percent of women diagnosed with early \n     stage breast cancer will develop stage IV advanced or \n     metastatic breast cancer;\n       Whereas in developing countries, the majority of women with \n     breast cancer are diagnosed with advanced stage or metastatic \n     disease;\n       Whereas the statistic that 155,000 women and men are \n     presently living with metastatic breast cancer in the United \n     States underscores the immediate need for increased public \n     awareness;\n       Whereas there currently is no cure for metastatic breast \n     cancer, and metastatic breast cancer frequently involves \n     trying one treatment after another with the goal of extending \n     the best quality of life as possible;\n       Whereas scientists and researchers are conducting important \n     research projects to achieve breakthroughs in metastatic \n     breast cancer research;\n       Whereas metastatic breast cancer is rarely discussed during \n     National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, observed in October \n     2009, but those living with the disease should never feel \n     isolated or ignored;\n       Whereas metastatic Breast Cancer Awareness Day emphasizes \n     the urgent need for new, targeted breast cancer treatments \n     that will provide a high quality of life and long life \n     expectancy for patients by making stage IV cancer a chronic, \n     but not fatal, disease; and\n       Whereas the Senate is an institution that can raise \n     awareness in the general public and the medical community of \n     breast cancer: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 13, 2009, as ``National Metastatic \n     Breast Cancer Awareness Day'';\n       (2) encourages all people of the United States to become \n     more informed and aware of metastatic breast cancer; and\n       (3) respectfully requests the Secretary of the Senate to \n     transmit a copy of this resolution to the Metastatic Breast \n     Cancer Network.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9988-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9988-S9989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 296--DESIGNATING OCTOBER 2009 AS ``NATIONAL WORK AND \n                             FAMILY MONTH''\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Crapo, and Mr. Kohl) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the \nJudiciary:\n\n                              S. Res. 296\n\n       Whereas, according to a report by WorldatWork, a nonprofit \n     professional association with expertise in attracting, \n     motivating, and retaining employees, the quality of workers' \n     jobs and the supportiveness of their workplaces are key \n     predictors of workers' job productivity, job satisfaction, \n     and commitment to employers and of employers' ability to \n     retain workers;\n       Whereas, according to the 2008 National Study of Employers \n     by the Families and Work Institute, employees in more \n     flexible and supportive workplaces are more effective \n     employees, are more highly engaged and less likely to look \n     for a new job in the next year, and enjoy better overall \n     health, better mental health, and lower levels of stress than \n     employees in workplaces that provide less flexibility and \n     support;\n       Whereas, according to a 2004 report of the Families and \n     Work Institute entitled ``Overwork in America'', employees \n     who are able to effectively balance family and work \n     responsibilities are less likely to report making mistakes or \n     feel resentment toward employers and coworkers;\n       Whereas, according to the ``Best Places to Work in the \n     Federal Government'' rankings released by the Partnership for \n     Public Service and American University's Institute for the \n     Study of Public Policy Implementation, work-life balance and \n     a family-friendly culture are among the key drivers of \n     engagement and satisfaction for employees in the Federal \n     workforce;\n       Whereas, according to a 2009 survey of college students by \n     the Partnership for Public Service and Universum USA entitled \n     ``Great Expectations! What Students Want in an Employer and \n     How Federal Agencies Can Deliver It'', attaining a healthy \n     work-life balance was an important career goal of 66 percent \n     of the students surveyed;\n\n[[Page S9989]]\n\n       Whereas a 2008 study by the Partnership for Public Service \n     entitled ``A Golden Opportunity: Recruiting Baby Boomers into \n     Government'' revealed that workers between the ages of 50 and \n     65 are a strong source of experienced talent for the Federal \n     workforce and that nearly 50 percent of workers in that age \n     group find flexible work schedules ``extremely appealing'';\n       Whereas finding a good work-life balance is important to \n     workers in multiple generations;\n       Whereas employees who are able to effectively balance \n     family and work responsibilities tend to feel healthier and \n     more successful in their relationships with their spouses, \n     children, and friends;\n       Whereas 85 percent of wage and salaried workers in the \n     United States have immediate, day-to-day family \n     responsibilities outside of their jobs;\n       Whereas, in 2000, research by the Radcliffe Public Policy \n     Center revealed that men in their 20s and 30s and women in \n     their 20s, 30s, and 40s identified a work schedule that \n     allows them to spend time with their families as the most \n     important job characteristic for them;\n       Whereas, according to the 2006 American Community Survey by \n     the United States Census Bureau, 47 percent of wage and \n     salaried workers in the United States are parents with \n     children under the age of 18 who live with them at least \n     half-time;\n       Whereas job flexibility often allows parents to be more \n     involved in their children's lives and research demonstrates \n     that parental involvement is associated with children's \n     higher achievement in language and mathematics, improved \n     behavior, greater academic persistence, and lower dropout \n     rates;\n       Whereas the 2000 Urban Working Families study demonstrated \n     that a lack of job flexibility for working parents negatively \n     affects children's health in ways that range from children \n     being unable to make needed doctors' appointments to children \n     receiving inadequate early care, leading to more severe and \n     prolonged illness;\n       Whereas, from 2001 to the beginning of 2008, 1,700,000 \n     active duty troops served in Iraq and 600,000 members of the \n     National Guard and Reserve (133,000 on more than one tour) \n     were called up to serve in Iraq;\n       Whereas, because so many of those troops and National Guard \n     and Reserve members have families, there needs to be a focus \n     on policies and programs that can help military families \n     adjust to the realities that come with having a family member \n     in the military;\n       Whereas research by the Sloan Center for Aging and Work \n     reveals that the majority of workers aged 53 and older \n     attribute their success as an employee by a great or moderate \n     extent to having access to flexibility in their jobs and that \n     the majority of those workers also report that, to a great \n     extent, flexibility options contribute to an overall higher \n     quality of life;\n       Whereas studies show that \\1/3\\ of children and adolescents \n     in the United States are obese or overweight, and healthy \n     lifestyle habits, including healthy eating and physical \n     activity, can lower the risk of becoming obese and developing \n     related diseases;\n       Whereas studies report that family rituals, such as sitting \n     down to dinner together and sharing activities on weekends \n     and holidays, positively influence children's health and \n     development and that children who eat dinner with their \n     families every day consume nearly a full serving more of \n     fruits and vegetables per day than those who never eat dinner \n     with their families or do so only occasionally;\n       Whereas unpaid family caregivers will likely continue to be \n     the largest source of long-term care services in the United \n     States for the elderly;\n       Whereas the Department of Health and Human Services \n     anticipates that by 2050 the number of such caregivers will \n     reach 37,000,000, an increase of 85 percent from 2000, as \n     baby boomers reach retirement age in record numbers; and\n       Whereas the month of October is an appropriate month to \n     designate as ``National Work and Family Month'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates October 2009 as ``National Work and Family \n     Month'';\n       (2) recognizes the importance of work schedules that allow \n     employees to spend time with their families to job \n     productivity and to healthy families;\n       (3) urges public officials, employers, employees, and the \n     general public to work together to achieve more balance \n     between work and family; and\n       (4) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     National Work and Family Month with appropriate ceremonies \n     and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/30/senate-section/article/S9989-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2576.
