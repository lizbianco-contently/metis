Mr. President, within the next few minutes, in \nJohannesburg, South Africa, before almost 80,000 people, the U.S. \nsoccer team will begin its World Cup quest. They are going to be \nplaying Slovenia, which has the fewest citizens of any of the \nparticipating countries. So I wish all the athletes representing our \ncountry success in today's match.\n  I also want to take a minute and talk about a Nevadan who is on our \nteam. His name is Herculez Gomez. He is a graduate of Las Vegas public \nschools. He was, of course, an outstanding high school athlete. He \nplayed professionally here in America, but the team decided not to sign \nhim--Kansas City--to anything he was satisfied with, so he went to \nMexico to play. He became the No. 1 player in Mexico. He holds the \nrecord for scoring more goals than any person, as I understand it, who \nhas played for another team in that country.\n  He is a great young man, and we are very proud of him. He is a great \ngoal scorer, a terrific representative of Nevada and the United States \nin this tournament watched by billions of people around the world. He \ndidn't play in our first game. He was standing on the sidelines. The \ncoach had told him to go in, but soccer is an unusual game. It is not \nlike a lot of sports. It is very difficult to substitute in a soccer \ngame, and the referee didn't blow the whistle or stop the game, so he \ncouldn't go in. But he will be in this game, I am sure.\n  I am a great soccer fan. I often boast about my youngest son, who \nplayed on three national championship soccer teams for the University \nof Virginia. Anyway, I watch soccer closely.\n  I wish the next remarks of mine could be as pleasant as those I have \njust given regarding Herculez Gomez. I wish we could have a lot more \npleasant talk here in the Senate. But with what happened last night and \nwhat has happened for the last year and a half, it is very hard to be \npleasant when you have people who are hurting in America.\n  Unemployment is something that is difficult to understand unless you \nhave been unemployed. I have never been unemployed. I am very \nfortunate. From the time I was a boy until now, I have always had a \njob, even in the summers. I worked as a very young boy, starting when I \nwas very, very\n\n[[Page S5142]]\n\nyoung. But I have seen my dad trying to get a job and not able to find \nwork. My father was a strong young man during the depression, and I \nheard him tell the story many times that he would go to a mine where \nthey were going to hire some people, and they would line up the people \nwho were prospective workers, and one of the bosses would come out and \nhe would go down the line and say: I will take you, I will take you, \nand I will take you. I guess how they looked is all they had to base it \non. They had no applications. No one filed applications.\n  Well, even though it is not the Great Depression, we now have people \ngoing through the same thing my father went through. I heard on NPR \nthis morning on the way to work that a woman has been out of work for a \nyear and a half. She was hired once for 1 day. She has applied 150 \ndifferent times. She keeps a notebook of the places she has applied and \nwhat happens to each of those. She is going to a job fair today, hoping \nsomething will happen and she can get a job.\n  The American people have had it with those who create messes and then \nrefuse to take responsibility for cleaning them up. They are tired of \nthe excuses. They are sick of the misplaced priorities that say one \nparty's politics are more important than their jobs or families, their \nincomes and their savings.\n  If you want to know what we stand for on this side of the aisle--\nDemocrats--look at our agenda this year. And our agenda has been so \ndifficult because, without exception, everything we have tried to do \nhas been stalled. The Republicans have made every attempt to divert our \nattention from what we want to do.\n  Here is what our agenda has been: making health insurance more \naffordable and health insurance companies more accountable. What kind \nof a country would we be if we had stood silently while 50 million of \nour fellow men and women had no health insurance? That is where we \nwere. If you had a job, a good job, you might have had insurance, but \nthat was no guarantee either. People were losing their insurance by the \nmillions as time went on. So we did something that had to be done--\nhealth insurance.\n  We protected Americans' savings and seniors' pensions from Wall \nStreet greed, making sure the American people were never again asked to \nbail out a big bank. Although we were stymied every step of the way, we \nworked to stop these people on Wall Street from doing again what they \ndid to the American people.\n  During part of my career--in fact, for 4 years--I was chairman of the \nNevada Gaming Commission. Now, that isn't about hunting animals; it is \na gambling commission. We call it gaming. We did everything we could to \nmake sure people who came to Nevada and gambled on the tables in Las \nVegas or Reno or Lake Tahoe had a fair game. When they won money, they \ngot to keep it; when they lost, it was their money they lost. But Wall \nStreet had a much better deal than you can get anyplace in Nevada. On \nWall Street, they gambled away our money. If they won, they kept it; if \nthey lost, they came to us for help. So we took that on. That bill is \nin conference now, and we are going to come out with something the \nAmerican people will like very much.\n  We have worked hard to create jobs. Today, Joe Biden is announcing \nthe 10,000th highway project that has been funded from our stimulus or \neconomic recovery bill. So we have created jobs, including full-time \nwork for 3 million Americans who have the stimulus to thank for the job \nthey are going to today.\n  In Nevada, the Recovery Act has created or saved more than 4,000 jobs \nin just the past 4 months alone. The economy in Nevada is not in good \nshape. It is getting better, but it is not good. We are one of the \nleading States in the Union in unemployment. But think how much worse \nit would be if we hadn't been able to create these jobs in Nevada with \nthe recovery bill.\n  Our agenda has been making sure those still looking for jobs in \nNevada--where 14 percent are out of work--and people across the country \nhave the unemployment assistance they need to make ends meet in the \nmeantime. Why the Republicans would not allow people who are out of \nwork to collect unemployment compensation is hard for me to comprehend. \nJohn McCain's chief economic adviser when he ran for President is a man \nnamed Mark Zandi, and Mark Zandi said the No. 1 way to stimulate the \neconomy is to give people who are out of work some money--unemployment \nassistance. The Republicans rejected the advice of John McCain's chief \neconomic adviser; we followed it.\n  In our legislation, we cut taxes for families and businesses. Ninety-\nfive percent of the people in America, as a result of our stimulus \nbill, the economic recovery bill, got a tax cut.\n  We have helped small businesses grow and hire more workers in the \nlast bill we passed dealing with jobs. And we would have been happy to \ndo more, but we get stalled every time we try to do something. Remember \nthat bill? We had four things in it:\n  We extended the highway bill for a year. That saved a million jobs in \nAmerica. Hundreds and hundreds of jobs were saved in Nevada. Thousands \nwere saved in Minnesota, the Presiding Officer's State.\n  In that same legislation, we said that if a small business wants to \nbuy something for their business--let's assume they need a new vehicle \nor equipment of any kind--they didn't have to even depreciate it \nanymore; that up to $250,000 they can write off. That was to help small \nbusiness.\n  We also said that if someone is out of work for 60 days and someone \nis willing to give them a job for 30 hours a week--we didn't set how \nmuch they would have to be paid, but if they give them a job for 30 \nhours a week, then that employer doesn't have to pay the withholding \ntax, and at the end of that year, they get a $1,000 tax credit.\n  In addition to that, we decided that one of the things that worked so \nwell in the recovery bill was Build America Bonds. That was very \nsuccessful and so popular that we ran out of money. In this little jobs \nbill, we funded that again. Right now, as we speak, there are jobs all \nover America taking place as a result of what we did with that bill.\n  So we have done a lot of things to help small businesses. We have in \nthat bill and we tried yesterday to give our States the critical aid \nthey need to keep firefighters in our communities, police officers on \nthe streets, and teachers in the classrooms. But Republicans said: No. \nLet the States handle their own problems. We have problems back here; \ndon't worry about the States.\n  I learned a long time ago in college that one of our responsibilities \nback here as a Congress is to do things for the States they can't do \nfor themselves. That is what we are doing here. But the Republicans \nsaid no yesterday. And it wasn't the majority of them, it was every \nsingle one of them.\n  We have worked hard to protect doctors who treat senior citizens from \na massive pay cut created by the Republicans when they were in charge. \nNow there are going to be seniors who won't be able to find their \ndoctor of choice because the doctors simply can't afford to work under \nwhat the Republicans decided they should be paid. They will take a pay \ncut. They will only get 79 percent of the money they got yesterday for \nthe same treatment.\n  As part of our agenda this year--and I am not going to go through it \nall because Norm Ornstein, a famous journalist, said we have been the \nmost productive Congress in the history of the country, in spite of \nwhat was going on here, despite the secret holds, the filibusters, the \nstalling, the delay; according to Norm Ornstein and others, the most \nproductive Congress in the history of the country.\n  As part of our agenda we believe we should hold BP accountable for \nthe sickening environmental disaster caused by its own gross negligence \nand maybe criminal activity in the endless pursuit of profits. One of \nthe richest companies in the world cut corners so they could make more \nmoney.\n  Those are a few of the things we stand for. We stand for those things \nbecause we know we work for families, taxpayers, and hard-working \nAmericans. But as far as I can tell, the only thing Republicans stand \nfor is standing together. As far as anyone can see, Republicans come to \nwork each day to fight for their special-interest friends, for \ncorporate America, for multimillionaires, for billionaires, and for \ngreedy CEOs who ship jobs out of\n\n[[Page S5143]]\n\nAmerica. Remember, part of the legislation they turned down yesterday \nwas going to stop all of that.\n  The trends are unmistakable. The records are public. I am not making \nup a thing. They are public, and numbers do not lie. It is not hard to \npiece together the puzzle and see who is working for the American \npeople and who is working against them.\n  But you do not have to comb through voting records; just look at what \nhappened yesterday. In the morning Republicans apologized to BP. Listen \nto this. Republicans apologized to BP. One of the longstanding \nRepublican leaders in the House of Representatives said he was sorry \nthat President Obama had asked them to come up with $20 billion. We \nwrote a letter to BP. The idea started with us, Democratic Senators. \nThe President picked this up. He met with the head of BP and they said \nOK, we will do that. The Republicans in the House said it was a \nshakedown and they were embarrassed for our country that this had \nhappened. Try that one on. Whose side are the Republicans on?\n  I heard an interview where a man said 9/11 did not ruin my business, \nKatrina didn't ruin my business, but the oilspill has ruined my \nbusiness. I filed bankruptcy yesterday. And it is a shakedown?\n  I repeat, yesterday morning Republicans apologized to BP for holding \nthem accountable for their own recklessness and their own greed. I \nrepeat that because it is incredible: Republicans apologized to BP \nbecause we are making sure it pays for its mess and the taxpayers do \nnot have to pay for their mess.\n  In the evening Republicans voted to help the wealthiest of the \nwealthy avoiding paying their fair share of taxes, while at the same \ntime voting against giving out-of-work Americans the assistance they \nneed.\n  I have friends who are billionaires. They run these big companies. \nWith rare exception, they have come to me and said yes, we have a \npretty good deal. Do you know why it is a pretty good deal? Because \nthey pay less taxes than somebody who works for the minimum wage. The \nRepublicans are going to continue to allow my friends, and billionaires \naround the country, to continue to pay less taxes than someone who \nworks for minimum wage. What kind of a picture is that?\n  Their priorities are baffling to me. They are indefensible. But it is \neven harder to believe when you look at who got us into this mess and \nwho is now refusing to let us get out of this mess. The same people. \nWhy are the doctors getting a 21-percent pay cut? It is because of what \nthey did over here. Why are so many people out of work? It is because \nof the policies of the prior administration--it is what went on on Wall \nStreet, cutting the legs off of the American economy. So the people who \ngot us into the mess are the ones who are doing everything they can to \nmake sure that we do not get out of the mess.\n  If not for the years of failed Republican policies, high unemployment \nwould not be an issue in the first place. If not for the Republican \nfailed policies, there would not be a doctors payment problem in the \nfirst place. If not for the Republicans' disdain for sensible \noversight, the disasters from Wall Street to the Gulf of Mexico, to \ncommunities across America, might not have been so devastating. And if \nnot for the weeks and weeks of Republican delay, the emergencies in our \nhouseholds and businesses and big cities and small towns wouldn't be \nnearly as bad as they are.\n  Republicans might be willing to turn their backs on out-of-work \nAmericans but Democrats are not. We are not. We are going to keep \nfighting for them. We are not going to give up.\n  As I said earlier, the American people have had it with those who \ncreate messes and then refuse to take responsibility for cleaning them \nup. That goes for BP and the GOP.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/18/senate-section/article/S5143-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5143]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, the legislation we have before us today \nand have been working on is problematic. It is just not healthy because \nit is going to increase the debt to a significant degree.\n  According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the Democrats' first \ndraft of the extenders bill--that is what we are calling this \nlegislation--presented this week would have added $78.6 billion to the \ndebt--another $78 billion.\n  Total spending in that bill was $126 billion. They claim that $47 \nbillion of this amount had been offset, meaning paid for. However, what \nwe were not told is they were double counting many of the items. It was \na manipulation. The numbers were worse than that. They were double \ncounting some of the money and hiding the extent of the debt. There \nwere just too many budget gimmicks, and the total impact of the bill, \nin truth, would have vastly exceeded the $78.6 billion that had been in \nthe score.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates the annual deficit for this \nfiscal year will be $1.5 trillion--$1,500 billion. This represents the \nlargest annual deficit in the history of the American Republic.\n  The CBO estimates that deficits will average--average--$1 trillion \nper year over the next 10 years under the budget as presented to us by \nPresident Obama. The lowest projected deficit in the 10-year period--\nthe lowest year--would be $724 billion. That is in 2014. The way the \neconomy is moving, I have my doubts that would occur. In fact, a fair \nanalysis of the entire amount would indicate those numbers are less \nthan likely to occur, unless we make significant changes, which we \nshould do.\n  Last week, the gross public debt exceeded $13 trillion. This \nrepresents 89 percent of our GDP. So the debt of $13 trillion \nrepresents 89 percent of GDP. This is a serious matter. According to \nCarmen Reinhart's testimony before the Budget Committee--who studied \nthis and has written a book about it--when gross debt exceeds 90 \npercent of GDP, growth in your country is reduced. What otherwise would \nbe an economic growth of 3 percent would be reduced to 2 percent. You \nwould have, in their estimation--Ms. Reinhart's and her partner, Mr. \nRogoff's, book--it would knock off 1 percent of growth, which is huge. \nOne percent of growth dragged down as a result of debt and interest is \na huge matter.\n  Interest payments rise--interest payments on the debt we have to pay. \nWe borrow the money, we have to pay interest on it in the form of T-\nbills held by people. China and other places and individuals buy these \nT-bills. We pay them interest. Interest in 2010 will be $209 billion. \nAs of September 30 of this year, when fiscal year 2010 ends, it will be \n$209 billion.\n  The Federal highway bill is about $40 billion, the baseline highway \nbill. Just to give an indication, Alabama's general fund budget is less \nthan $10 billion a year. We are an average-sized State, so $210 billion \nin interest is significant.\n  Well, what happens at the rate we are going, with budget deficits \naveraging a trillion dollars a year for the next 10 years? According to \nthe Congressional Budget Office, that calculates this out carefully, \nthey estimate that interest in 2020--for that 1 year--just 10 years \nfrom now, would be $916 billion--the largest single expenditure in the \nFederal budget, and our debt will have tripled in 10 years under the \nPresident's budget.\n  So this is clearly unsustainable; every witness, every economist, \nevery\n\n[[Page S5144]]\n\nperson on Wall Street, every talking head you see on television says it \nis unsustainable. But we have not seen any action to get us off this \npath. How much longer can we go before we do something? The bullet, as \none person said a number of years ago about a bank that went bankrupt--\nthey found out the Atlanta housing market collapsed, and he said: It \nwas too late. The bullet was in the heart. When will the bullet be in \nour heart? When will it be too late to fight back?\n  On Wednesday of this week, the Democratic majority--after having \nbrought up their bill that I have referred to; and the Senate rejected \nthis excessive debt and spending by a vote of 45 to 52--a number of \nDemocrats said: No, we are not going for that, Mr. Leader. A vast \nmajority of the Democrats supported the bill, but a significant number \nsaid: No, we are not going to keep doing this. So they have now \nproposed yet another version of the extenders bill, on Thursday, \nyesterday. This version would add $55 billion to the deficit instead of \n$78 billion. But the number is a distortion, and it is done as a result \nof double counting certain funds and simply shortening the time some of \nthe provisions would take effect--not fixing it in a significant way.\n  To pay for some of this spending, the Democratic majority proposes to \nincrease the oil excise tax that funds the Oil Spill Liability Trust \nFund to 49 cents from its current 8 cents a barrel. So the Oil Spill \nLiability Trust Fund was created to have a fund to pay costs that might \nrelate in the future to oil--\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator asked to be notified \nwhen 7 minutes had elapsed, and we are at about 7 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Acting President pro tempore and will wrap \nup.\n  There is so much to be said about this. But I just wish to point out \nhow the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is a complete shell game. It is \nan absolute double counting of money, and it adds to the debt, and the \ndebt of the bill in the way it has been scored hides the real impact.\n  The legislation would increase the tax on oil but does not set aside \nthe increased revenue and save it in a fund to clean up the oil spill \nin the gulf or other such disasters as it is supposed to. Instead, it \ntakes the money and creates a paper trust fund but sends the money \ndirectly over to the Treasury in order to pay some of the spending in \nthis package and is used to reduce the amount of debt they say the bill \nwill create.\n  Do you follow me? They claim they are creating a trust fund but at \nthe same time using the money to fund the spending in this bill and \nclaiming this money as income to justify that. Well, what is going to \nhappen when the fund needs money to clean up a spill, which is what it \nwas created for? Well, it is not going to be there because it is going \nto already have been spent. There is no dispute about this. This is \nabsolute fact, and it is just another example of the recklessness and \nirresponsibility of the spending that is going on here. It is time for \nthe American people to rise up and say to Congress: We need to have \nhonest spending and restraint in spending.\n  I thank the Acting President pro tempore and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent I be recognized \nfor 20 minutes, to be followed by the Senator from Connecticut, Mr. \nDodd.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say it was my \nintention to come down and talk about the same subject my friend from \nAlabama has addressed, and I will do that if there is time at the \nconclusion of my first subject, which has to be said and addressed \ntoday, and if not, I may have to come back after my friend from \nConnecticut to address this subject. It has to do with the liability \nlimits--something we need to think through. There is a gross \nmisunderstanding and a lot of pandering going on of people demagoging \nthat issue, and I want to address that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/18/senate-section/article/S5144-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5144-S5147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NEW STRATEGIC ARMS REDUCTION TREATY\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, something has happened that \nwe haven't even talked about on the floor, and it is very timely and \nvery significant. We all remember what has happened in the past about \ntreaties that have come up and the administration, whether it is \nDemocratic or Republican, if they want a treaty, they are going to try \nto rush it through. This same thing happened with the Law of the Sea \nTreaty under President Bush, and when that happened, it was somewhat of \na crisis because many of us were opposed to our own President. We are \ngoing to find this to be true about the treaty I wish to address, and \nthat is the New START treaty. I think we all remember the START treaty, \nthe START II treaty, and now they are calling this the New START \ntreaty.\n  Yesterday, on June 17, in the committee on which I am the second \nranking member, the Senate Armed Services Committee, we held the first \nhearing on the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty or the New START treaty. \nDuring the hearing, we had Secretary Clinton, Secretary Gates, Dr. Chu, \nand Admiral Mullen all emphasizing the importance of verifying the \ntreaty. But wait a minute. They are all speaking in behalf of the \nPresident, which means we haven't had a hearing yet. This is something \nwe are going to be talking about doing before we get any closer to \nratifying this treaty.\n  I think the bottom-line question for all Americans and the Senate is, \nDoes this treaty improve the national security of the United States? I \ndon't think so. To put it bluntly, this treaty will have a profound \nnegative impact and implications on the U.S. national security.\n  Let's start with the need for the treaty because we are being told it \nis either this treaty or it is nothing at all, and that is just not an \naccurate statement. The United States and Russia are still committed \nunder the 2002 Moscow Treaty to reduce the number of deployed nuclear \nweapons to a range of about 1,700 to 2,200--a decrease from 6,000 under \nSTART. Additionally, the United States and Russia had the option of \nextending START for 5 years and keeping in place the same detailed \nverification and inspection protocols under START. So it is not a \nmatter that we have to do something or we won't have anything at all \nbecause we will continue under the existing treaties that are there. It \nwas the decision of the Obama administration to abandon START I \nprotocols and rush forward to another START treaty. Both countries are \nstill bound under the Moscow Treaty.\n  Let's keep in mind that this treaty addresses two things: It \naddresses nuclear capability, warheads and the reduction of the \nwarheads down to about 1,550, as well as delivery systems. This is the \nsomething we keep hearing about. People don't really have an \nunderstanding. If you have a nuclear warhead, you still have to \ndeliver. There are three basic categories of deliverance. One is to do \nit with ICBMs. We all know what that is. The other is SLBMs; that is, \nsubmarine-launched ballistic missiles. The third would be through the \nair. We have two vehicles that can do this; that is, the old B-52 and \nthe B-2.\n  So I think we need to talk about four things: modernization, force \nstructure, missile defense, and verification, and then the overall \nability to deter our enemies.\n  Keep in mind that this is a treaty between two countries, Russia and \nthe United States. That is not really what the problem is. I think we \nall understand the problem is Syria, North Korea, and now Iran, which \nour intelligence tells us is going to have the capability of delivering \nan ICBM to the eastern part of the United States as early as 2015. That \nis very serious.\n  First of all, modernization. The well-respected Perry-Schlesinger \nCommission, a bipartisan congressional commission on strategic posture, \nhas been working for a long period of time, and they have come up with \nthe conclusion that our nuclear arsenal is a victim of disrepair and \nneglect. We haven't been doing anything with these. Even Secretary \nGates--keep in mind, he was here yesterday at this hearing--he said:\n\n       There is absolutely no way we can maintain a credible \n     deterrent and reduce the numbers of weapons in our stockpile \n     without either resorting to testing our stockpile or pursuing \n     a modernization program.\n\n\n[[Page S5145]]\n\n\n  We haven't done that for any period of time at all. Nonetheless, \nSecretary Gates, the same one who was testifying yesterday, said as \nrecently as last October that we have to modernize and we have to test.\n  General Chilton, the commander of the U.S. Strategic Command, \ntestified that modernization was not only important but essential. The \nlast B-52--we are talking about the equipment we have--the last B-52 we \ncranked out was in 1964. These are ancient vehicles.\n  Under President Obama's first budget, he has done away with the next \ngeneration of bombers, so we can kind of forget about that as long as \nhe is President and has a majority in this Congress. The only major \nnuclear power not modernizing its weapons is us. Everybody else is. \nEvery other major power in the world is modernizing, and we all agree \nwe shouldn't be the only one who is not doing this. Some lack modern \nsafety features such as insensitive high-explosive and unique signal \ngenerators, and some rely on vacuum tubes.\n  A lot of people who are the age of my kids and grandkids don't \nremember how old vacuum tubes are. They look at the radios on their \ncars and they wonder why mine in my 1965 Ford pickup takes so long to \nwarm up. It is because they don't remember that is the way things were. \nThat is the way our nuclear equipment is operating now. No weapons have \nbeen fully tested since 1992 when the United States voluntarily \nsuspended its underground nuclear testing program, and that was in \nanticipation of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. Meanwhile, other \nnuclear countries, including Russia, continue to modernize and replace \ntheir nuclear weapons.\n  Press reports indicate the administration will invest $100 billion \nover the next decade in nuclear delivery systems. Now, this comes out \nof the press. I haven't heard this from the Obama administration. About \n$30 billion of this total will go, as it should, to the development and \nacquisition of a new strategic submarine. That will leave about $70 \nbillion over that 10-year period. According to estimates by the \nStrategic Command, the cost of maintaining the current dedicated \nnuclear forces is about $5.6 billion a year or $56 billion over the \ndecade. So that leaves $14 billion, which is totally inadequate to do \nwhat we need to do, and certainly it is not sufficient enough to get to \na higher degree of sophistication and modernization of our aging 1964 \nB-52 bomber.\n  I am concerned that the appropriators are not going to be able to \nfully fund the President's fiscal year 2011 budget request of $624 \nmillion for the National Nuclear Security Administration. I commend \nthem for this. This is an amount we should invest. I am not convinced \nwe are going to be able to do that.\n  Here is something people haven't talked about; that is, in the fiscal \nyear 2010 NDAA--that is the National Defense Authorization Act which I \nam active in--we required that the submission of a new START agreement \nto the Senate be accompanied by a plan to modernize the U.S. nuclear \ndeterrent. That is under law. That is section 1251 of the fiscal year \n2010 NDAA. So that is something we have to comply with. Yet what we are \ntalking about now is ratifying a treaty before we have that \nmodernization. We are not going to let that happen. It puts off \ndecisions on a follow-on bomber and ICBM until 2013 or 2015.\n  A letter was written to President Obama--and I was the one who wrote \nit--on December 15, 2009, signed by 41 Senators, and it stated that \nfurther reductions are not in national security interest of the United \nStates without a significant program to modernize our nuclear \ndeterrent.\n  So, therefore, the first issue of this is the ratification of the New \nSTART treaty by the Senate has to be linked to some kind of commitment \nfor modernization, which is not in place now.\n  The second thing is force structure. According to the Perry-\nSchlesinger Strategic Posture Commission--and I will quote two \nsentences out of that. Keep in mind, the triad is ICBM, SLBM, and the \nair delivery system.\n  The triad of strategic delivery systems continues to have value. Each \nleg of the nuclear triad provides unique contributions to stability. As \nthe overall forces shrink, their unique values become more prominent.\n\n  This is this Commission. We all know about the Perry-Schlesinger \nCommission. No one questions that they are the final authority, and \nsomething has to be done. We need to listen to them.\n  We get this also: We need to understand what the Russian force \nstructure will look like and do a net assessment to determine whether \nwe can maintain a viable nuclear deterrent in this new agreement. And \nwe need to take into full consideration the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review \nwhich concluded--and I am quoting now--this is the third posture \nreview:\n\n       Large disparities in nuclear capabilities could raise \n     concerns on both sides and among U.S. allies and partners, \n     and may not be conducive to maintaining a stable, long-term \n     relationship.\n\n  So right now, we are talking about the nuclear force structure \nsuggested in section 1251 of the NDAA. We have 420 of the 450 currently \ndeployed single-warhead ICBMs; we have 60 of the nuclear capability B-\n52s and B-2s, and we have 240 total of the warheads or the SLBMs. Add \nthat up, and that is 720. This treaty calls for 700. When we asked the \nquestion of the panel yesterday: Where are you going to come up with \nthe 20 reduction, they didn't have it, but that is still under \nconsideration. So we don't even know at this time in terms of force \nstructure and the problems we have.\n  Additionally, this treaty does not address tactical nuclear weapons \neven though tactical nuclear weapons remains one of the most \nsignificant threats. A tactical nuclear weapon could be a suitcase \nbomb; it could be anything other than the three legs of the nuclear \ntriad this treaty addresses. One thing we know is that the Russians \nhave 10 times--the ratio is 10 to 1--they have 10 times the tactical \nnuclear weapons that we do. I agree with Henry Kissinger. Just the \nother day, he said:\n\n       The large Russian stockpile of tactical nuclear weapons, \n     unmatched by a comparable American deployment, could threaten \n     the ability to undertake extended deterrence.\n\n  Again, there is a lot more on this, but I think this gets the point \nacross that we have to be looking at the force structure.\n  I wish to move to the missile defense part of this.\n  We have heard--and we have been talking about this since January--\nthat the New START treaty has a provision in it, in the preamble, which \nsays that if we expand our missile defense capabilities, the Russians \ncould get out of this treaty. We have been told by the administration \nthat is not true. I have heard so many different explanations of \narticle V in the treaty that I remain concerned that it is as clear as \nmud. The Obama administration assures us there are no limitations. Yet, \nif you look at the preamble, it says:\n\n     . . . the interrelationship between strategic offensive arms \n     and strategic defensive arms, that this interrelationship \n     will become more important as strategic nuclear arms are \n     reduced, and that current strategic defensive arms do not \n     undermine the viability and effectiveness of the strategic \n     offensive arms of the Parties.\n\n  In other words, we don't want you to be concerned with your own \nnational defense.\n  There is a unilateral statement that was issued by the Russian side \nof missile defense released the same day as the full agreed-upon text. \nThis was in Prague in April. This is what our President signed. It said \nthat the treaty ``can operate and be viable only if the United States \nof America refrains from developing its missile defense capabilities \nquantitatively and qualitatively.'' There it is. That is a statement. \nThat is undeniable. It is there.\n  Sergey Lavrov, who is the Russian Foreign Minister, stated to \nemphasize that:\n\n       We have not yet agreed on this [missile defense] issue and \n     we are trying to clarify how the agreements reached by the \n     two presidents . . . correlate with the actions taken \n     unilaterally by Washington.\n\n  He added that:\n\n       [The] Obama administration had not coordinated its missile \n     defense plans with Russia.\n\n  So this is the one that I think is very significant.\n  Since I am running out of time--I am going to be able to pursue this \nand get into a lot more detail. But if you look at what happened in \nPoland when we had the ground-based missile defense shield that was \nbeing installed in the\n\n[[Page S5146]]\n\nfirst budget this President had, he pulled the rug out from under both \nthe Czech Republic and Poland and discontinued this ground-based \ncapability. That is something that put us in a position that is pretty \nscary.\n  I do wish to mention one thing about verification. There is limited \nverification. We all remember that President Reagan always used to say: \nTrust, but verify. Trust, but verify. This is all trust and no \nverification.\n  We are looking at it right now and seeing that the verification \nprocess is not there. I am concerned that there are 18 inspections per \nyear that are allowed--that would be 180 inspections in 10 years--given \nthe fact that we conducted on the order of 600 inspections during the \n15 years of START I. The top verification priorities need to be \naccurate and effective, and they are not there now. They are still \nwaiting on the National Intelligence Estimate that will assess our \nability to monitor the treaty. I think we all recognize we are going to \nhave to be able to have that verification.\n  Lastly would be the deterrence. As Secretary Gates said back in \nOctober of 2008:\n\n       As long as others have nuclear weapons, we must maintain \n     some level of these weapons ourselves to deter potential \n     adversaries and to reassure over two dozen allies and \n     partners who rely on our nuclear umbrella for their security, \n     making it unnecessary for them to develop their own.\n\n  I agree with that, but that is not the message we heard yesterday. \nThe New START focuses on reducing the strategic nuclear arsenals of \nRussia and the United States and fails to address the proliferation of \nnuclear weapons of other countries. The whole idea is that we are \nhaving an agreement, this treaty between two countries, but it is \nbetween the wrong two countries. This ought to be with countries such \nas Iran. Russia is not a threat; Iran is a threat to us. North Korea is \nalso a threat to us. We have to be looking at where the real problem \nis. We know--and it is not even classified--that Iran will have the \ncapability of sending an ICBM to the United States as early as 2015, \nand we have taken down the only defense we would have against that by \ntaking out the Poland ground-based interceptor. That is scary.\n  The conclusion I come to on this is the Senate must receive a \ncomprehensive net assessment of benefits, costs, and risks, with a \nclear and precise listing of terms, definitions, and banned permit \nactions, and the Senate has to continue to receive a series of follow-\non hearings. We haven't had many hearings.\n  I remember when we had the Law of the Sea Treaty. That was during a \nRepublican administration. The Bush administration decided that Ronald \nReagan was wrong, I guess, so they were going to have this. They \nweren't having hearings either. They sent people over there who were \nanswering to President Bush. At that time, the Republicans were in the \nmajority, and I chaired the Environment and Public Works Committee. We \nheld a hearing, and the Law of the Sea Treaty passed the Foreign \nRelations Committee 16 to 0, and it was ready to sail through. We \nrealized what was in it. They had not changed it since the 1980s when, \nat that time, Ronald Reagan was opposed to it. With that being the \ncase, we had to have our own hearings. We had people coming in and \ntalking about why we should not have the Law of the Sea Treaty.\n  The Law of the Sea Treaty would have turned over to the United \nNations authority over 70 percent of the Earth's surface. We were able \nto effectively kill that because we were able to show it was wrong. We \nhaven't had those hearings on this treaty yet. We have to have hearings \non the treaty before they are going to be able to get the votes. I am \ntaking this opportunity, since nobody is talking about this right now, \nof alerting our Members on both sides of the aisle that this Obama \nadministration is going to rescue this treaty and get it done before we \nhave our hearings. That isn't going to happen. Fortunately, it takes \ntwo-thirds to ratify a treaty. That is our responsibility.\n  Later, I will talk in more detail, as it gets closer. I will use a \nlittle bit of time and address the problem that my friend from Alabama \nwas talking about a few minutes ago, which is that we have received a \nlot of criticism for our objection to raising the limits, which are \ncurrently way too low, to $75 billion.\n  First, they wanted to raise the limits of liability for economic \ndamages to $10 billion, and I objected to that because both the \nPresident and the Secretary of the Interior, Ken Salazar, said we need \nto think it thoughtfully all the way through as to how high a liability \nlimit we want. Then they came forth with no liability limits.\n  These are my words and not the words of any experts, but I have spent \nmany years in my life in the insurance business. I remember, in 1994, I \nwas one who introduced a bill to put a repose on aviation products. At \nthat time, we were importing aviation products and airplanes from other \ncountries because we weren't making them here. Why weren't we making \nthem here? Our tort laws would not let us. We had unlimited liability. \nThey didn't have limits out there. Consequently, Piper Aircraft had to \ngo into bankruptcy. They had to actually move some of their operations \nto Canada because their tort laws were different at that time. We \nintroduced and passed a bill that was intended to be a 12-year repose \nbill.\n  That meant if a company manufactured an airplane or an airplane part \nand it worked fine for 12 years, and there was an accident, you could \nnot go back against the manufacturer. We could not get it through. \nInstead, we had an 18-year repose bill. That was one that I thought was \ntoo long. That meant if something had been running well for 18 years, \nthen you could not go back and sue.\n  I called Lloyd's of London, and they said: You are right. We don't \ncare if it is 18 years or 12 or 20 years; you have to have an end to \nunderwrite against. In other words, we cannot insure it unless we know \nthere is an end in the future.\n  Consequently, that is what we need to do in this because companies \nhave to be able to have insurance in order to drill. We didn't think \nthat was so necessary prior to the tragedy we are addressing now in the \ngulf. Now we realize we should be and what we need to do. If we leave \nit open ended, that will mean if we ever have any drilling or exploring \nin the gulf, it is going to have, in my opinion, to be done not even by \nthe big 5, including BP, it would have to be done by the international \noil companies--those in Venezuela and in China. So, in my opinion, if \nwe adopt something with an open-ended, unlimited liability that means \nwe are all through drilling in the gulf.\n  Quite frankly, that is exactly what the Obama administration wants. \nAll this hype and their talk about oil and gas--earlier this week, we \nhad the Sanders amendment, which would have put anyone out of business \nwho was in the business of drilling, including our marginal producers \nin Oklahoma. A marginal well is only 15 barrels a day. That is what we \ndo in Oklahoma. Yet the average marginal well produces only two barrels \na day but accounts for 28 percent of the domestically produced oil. \nThat is significant. They would have been out of business if we had \nadopted the Sanders amendment, which we handily defeated earlier this \nweek.\n  I believe the statement made yesterday by Senator Rockefeller pretty \nmuch says it right. I hope I have it so I can refer to it. He was \ncriticizing all these efforts to try to have some kind of cap and \ntrade, and I think the meeting that took place yesterday verifies that \ncap and trade is in fact dead. The votes simply aren't there. I don't \nhave that--yes I do. This is what took place yesterday. It is in this \nmorning's Politico:\n\n       The Senate Democrats may have emerged from a much-hyped \n     caucus meeting without a clear plan for this summer's energy \n     bill, but they appear to agree on one point; that is, cap and \n     trade is dead.\n\n  I have been saying that for about 3 months. I think we are hearing \nthat now from a lot of the Democrats. Senator McCaskill said:\n\n       I don't see 60 votes for a price on carbon right now.\n\n  There is the same quote by several others. This is a quote I like. \nListen, this is profound, and I don't think I have ever quoted Senator \nRockefeller and said it was something with which I totally agree. But \nthis is something he said:\n\n       The Senate should be focusing on the immediate issues \n     before us: to suspend EPA action on greenhouse gas emissions, \n     push clean\n\n[[Page S5147]]\n\n     coal technologies, and tackle the gulf oil spill. We need to \n     set aside controversial and more far-reaching climate \n     proposals and work right now on energy legislation that \n     protects our economy, protects West Virginia, and improves \n     our environment.\n\n  I agree wholeheartedly. We on the Republican side have said we have \nan energy policy, and that it is all of the above.\n  I will yield at any time to my friend from Connecticut, since he had \ntime reserved. Apparently, he doesn't want it.\n  It may be that the caucus that met yesterday was united in the idea \nthat cap and trade is dead. But I don't think that is necessarily true \nwith the Obama administration.\n  I am glad to yield to my friend. My understanding is that they only \nhave 4 more minutes, and a unanimous consent request will be made here. \nI am almost out of time anyway.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am told we have time. Floor staff will let \nme know. We have a little more time available.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask the Chair, how much time is remaining before--the \nSenator from Nebraska has reserved time; is that correct?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Evidently not.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me conclude and say I will come back \nand talk about this at a later time. I do believe President Obama's \npollster has some ideas that became public. I will share this last \npoint.\n  Joe Benenson, the President's campaign pollster, did a survey for \nsomewhat of an extremist environmental group, and, among other things, \nhe found that based on his interpretation of the survey result, pushing \nfor cap and trade and tying opposition to it to big oil is a potent \npolitical weapon for Democrats against Republicans this fall.\n  I think that says it all. People are using the tragedy in the gulf \nfor political purposes. This is something we want people to understand.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/18/senate-section/article/S5147-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5147]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  U.S. Army Specialist Blaine Redding\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to remember a fallen hero, \nU.S. Army SPC Blaine Redding of Plattsmouth, NE.\n  Blaine was a proud member of Company A, 2nd Battalion, 327th Infantry \nRegiment, of the 101st Airborne Division, operating in one of the most \ndangerous areas of Afghanistan, the Kunar Province.\n  On June 7, only 4 weeks after arriving in that country, Specialist \nRedding was killed when his vehicle was struck by a remotely detonated \nimprovised explosive device.\n  His death is a great loss to our Nation and to Nebraska, his home \nState.\n  Blaine was a model of persistence, determination, and patriotism. \nFaced with challenges during his adolescent years, he realized that \nmilitary service was the best way to fulfill his longings.\n  Blaine overcame an early departure from high school by earning a \ngeneral equivalency diploma to join the U.S. Army. He was determined to \nsustain a family history of service to our country in uniform, \nbeginning with a great-grandfather and continuing through subsequent \ngenerations.\n  Fort Campbell became a very special place for Specialist Redding. He \nand his brother, PFC Logan Redding, were assigned to the elite 101st \nAirborne Division.\n  But more important, he met his future wife Victoria, or Nikki, while \nat Fort Campbell. They were married on March 13, 2010. With this came a \nrenewed sense of responsibility to defend this great Nation and its \nprinciples of freedom.\n  Specialist Redding knew combat operations, having completed already a \nyear-long tour in Iraq. The rugged terrain and close proximity to the \nPakistan border of the area of Afghanistan where he was poses special \nchallenges to allied forces. Losses have been heavy in this region. \nSpecialist Redding was comforted by his brother being deployed nearby. \nUltimately, Logan would aid in returning his brother's body to the \nUnited States.\n  Specialist Redding will be remembered in different ways. His Army \nbuddies sometimes refer to him as ``a perfect soldier,'' a great \n``mortar man.''\n  To family and friends, he had a priceless personality. To his wife \nNikki, he was a devoted husband with a very big heart.\n  The decorations and badges earned during a far too brief Army career \nspeak to his dedication and to his bravery: the Army Commendation \nMedal, the Army Achievement Medal, the National Defense Service Medal, \nGlobal War on Terrorism Service Medal, Army Service Ribbon, and the \nPurple Heart. He proudly wore the Combat Infantry Badge and Air Assault \nBadge.\n  Today, I join Nikki, family, and friends in mourning the death of \ntheir beloved husband, son, brother, and friend. Blaine made the \nultimate sacrifice in defense of our great Nation, and we owe him and \nhis family an immeasurable debt of gratitude.\n  May God be with the Redding family, friends, and all those who mourn \nhis death and celebrate his life. We will remember Blaine as we \nremember all the Nation's fallen warriors who gave their lives so that \nwe may live in peace. Their names are etched on the conscience of our \nNation in glory undimmed unto the end of our people.\n  I also offer my prayers to all those serving in uniform today, and \nespecially those serving in peril overseas.

Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes to recognize \nthree individuals, two of whom are no longer with us, and one is a man \nwho just retired from a life of dedication to his community and family. \nI wish to spend a few minutes talking about the three of them, if I \nmay.\n  The first is a friend of mine who passed away several weeks ago, an \nindividual who made a wonderful contribution to our country.\n  Doug Gravel was a wonderful friend, a great champion of American \neducation, and a person who attracted a legion of friends, supporters, \nand followers throughout his life.\n  Although he never lived for fame or even for recognition, Doug Gravel \nwas instrumental in shaping the way we teach our children in this \ncountry, from one end of our Nation to the other.\n  The Montessori method of teaching, familiar to many people, was \ndeveloped a century ago by Maria Montessori in Italy. It was designed \nas a system to educate the whole child by empowering children to guide \ntheir own development. It encourages kids to develop their own unique \npersonalities and fosters their curiosity in the world around them \nwhile removing environmental obstacles to their progress.\n  For many children, the Montessori method has proven to be an \nunqualified success. Many of its methods are incorporated in public \neducation in this country as well. Its revitalization in the latter \nhalf of this century can be traced back to a very small group of \nindividuals--parents who lived in my state in Greenwich, CT. One of \nthose people was a fellow named Doug Gravel.\n  Realizing there was no clearinghouse for parents, teachers, and \nschool administrators interested in the Montessori method, Dr. Nancy \nMcCormick Rambusch established the American Montessori Society at the \nWhitby School in Greenwich, CT in 1960. It is today America's oldest \nMontessori School, and Doug Gravel was right there with Nancy Rambusch \nwhen the program started.\n\n[[Page S5148]]\n\n  At that time, the fate of the Montessori School was in doubt. In \nfact, an article in 1964 in Time magazine confidently predicted that \nthe American Montessori movement would die out entirely within a few \nyears.\n  The critics, obviously, were terribly wrong, as they often are, \nthanks in no small part to the work of Dr. Nancy Rambusch and Doug \nGravel. The American Montessori Society grew and prospered. Today, the \nsociety has 11,000 members in 50 nations around the world, and it works \nto ensure that the high standards and excellent education that have \ncome to symbolize the Montessori schools are available to children \neverywhere.\n  I was very privileged to serve as honorary Chair of the society's \nannual conference back in 2007 when it celebrated the 100th anniversary \nof Montessori education. I am pleased that the organization's archives \nfrom the Montessori Society are housed at the research center at the \nUniversity of Connecticut, named for my father.\n  As part of my work for the organization, I had the honor of getting \nto know Doug Gravel very well. His commitment to quality education was \nmatched by his commitment to treating those around him with respect and \ncompassion.\n  His warm personality, his wise mind, and his tremendously sharp wit \nwere a source of great joy to his friends and to the many whom he \neducated--and entertained--throughout his life and certainly in his \ncapacity as a Montessori trainer and headmaster of the Caedmon School \nin New York.\n  My family will always have a special love for Doug Gravel. I come \nfrom a family of educators, starting with my great-grandmother \nCatherine Murphy who came to this country unable to read or write her \nown name. But soon after arriving in Connecticut she got herself \nelected to the local school board because she knew the future belonged \nto those who were educated.\n  My father's three sisters, my brother Tom, and my sister Carolyn all \nbecame teachers as well. In fact, Carolyn, in particular, carried on my \nfather's passion for Montessori education at the Whitby School in \nGreenwich, CT, back in the late 1950s and early 1960s. Doug was such a \ngood friend to Carolyn, to our entire family, and to educators \neverywhere, for that matter.\n  On behalf of all those grateful for the good work Doug Gravel did for \nAmerican education, for the great person he was, I offer my condolences \nto his beloved Maria, his brilliant and beautiful daughters Mary and \nAnne, and his cherished grandchildren. I offer that wonderful family my \nthanks and the thanks of many thousands of parents and children, all of \nwhom benefitted because there was someone named Doug Gravel who \nmodernized and revitalized American education.\n\n\n                      Tribute to Preston J. Empey\n\n  Mr. President, the second individual I wish to recognize has no \nparticular fame in any way at all. He is just a wonderful human being \nwho announced his retirement. I rise today in the midst of all the work \nwe are doing to support ordinary Americans, working families--people \nwho go about their daily lives in every way to try to support their \ncommunities and their families.\n  In particular, I rise to celebrate one of them, a man named Preston \nEmpey--``Press'' to his friends and family.\n  In 1953, Press Empey, who had served in the Navy during World War II \nand then gone on to college, got a job at the Cloverleaf Dairy in \nProvo, UT, where he was soon promoted to manager.\n  Press Empey worked hard to support his young family. And over the \npast 60 years, he became legendary for treating his customers as though \nthey were members of his own family.\n  Milk was cheaper in those days when Press started out. It was also \nsomething you got from a face you knew instead of a cold case at a \nconvenience store or grocery store.\n  To our younger members, some of the people who work in this Chamber, \nthe idea of having a milkman show up at your house sounds like ancient \nhistory. It is not that ancient. It was not that many years ago when \nmost Americans were familiar with someone who actually delivered the \nmilk. Press did it, up until a few weeks ago, in his community for \nalmost 60 years.\n  Press's customers got to know him--some so well that if they were not \nhome when he delivered the dairy, they trusted him to go inside and put \nit in the refrigerator anyway. And he got to know them. When hard times \nbefell customers--as they certainly have in every one of our \ncommunities over the years--and they could no longer afford their \nshipments or products, he worked with them to ensure they got their \ndeliveries every day and at some future point paid him back for the \nproducts and services they were receiving.\n  No matter what befell him--bad weather, injury, illness, even \nmechanical troubles--he would be there on time even if it meant \nstarting his day hours before sunrise. Once, after his truck rolled \nover on the highway, Press calmly got it back on the road, dusted \nhimself off, and made every single delivery that day.\n  Still, when he was asked about his greatest accomplishment, he paused \nand said: ``Well, we've raised five children.'' He and Glenna did just \nthat. He and his lovely wife had great fun. I have known the family for \nyears. They are remarkable people, hard-working, diligent, delightful \nhuman beings.\n  Once Press invited some friends, including my late father-in-law Karl \nClegg, to go hunting in the Utah mountains. Maybe because Press \ncouldn't bear to be away from that dairy truck of his, he decided that \nit would make a fine camper for all of them. After all, it had good \ninsulation, lots of space for sleeping, and, best of all, a cooler \nstocked with ice cream.\n  Off they went, taking the dirt roads and crossing streams, drawing, \none can imagine, wide-eyed stares from fellow hunters in huge SUVs as \nthey bounced along in the dairy truck through the mountains and hills \nof Utah. The cooler turned out to be a fine meat locker as well, \nalthough Press and Karl's snoring echoed off the truck's walls and \nposed an obstacle to others who might have wanted to sleep. They had a \ngreat trip in Press Empey's dairy truck.\n  For more than half a century--almost 60 years--Press has been an \ninstitution. He is now retiring at the age of 83, not because he is \ntired but because his trucks, in his own words, are plum worn out.\n  That is good news for his lovely wife Glenna and wonderful family who \nwill get a little more of Press to themselves after a life spent \nsharing his generosity of spirit and profound dedication with their \nneighbors and his customers. As I said, for more than half a century, \nthey have been a hard-working American family.\n  I am pleased to congratulate Press on his retirement and join my wife \nJackie and our family in wishing him and Glenna many years of happiness \nand joy.\n\n\n                        Remembering Bill Stanley\n\n  Mr. President, lastly, I wish to spend a minute talking about a \nwonderful man who passed away a few weeks ago in my home State of \nConnecticut. I rise to talk about the rich and eventful life of one of \nConnecticut's great champions and favorite sons, William Stanley of \nNorwich, CT.\n  Bill Stanley was a stockbroker for 46 years, although that is about \nthe last thing anyone would ever think of when asked to describe him. \nThat was his job, but his life was far more interesting and far more \ncomplicated than that. He was active in politics. He served for a term \nin the State senate. He was an influential adviser and trusted friend \nto my father, who served in this body, as well as former Governor and \nSenator Abe Ribicoff, and Ella Grasso, the first woman elected Governor \nin her own right in the United States, among many others.\n  He served as the official photographer of his hometown newspaper, the \nNorwich Bulletin. He had his own radio show for more than a decade, and \nhe published the history of his community on a regular basis.\n  But most importantly, Bill Stanley's life was defined by his love for \nhis community of Norwich, CT, and the incredible work he did for many \nyears to boost its prominence and champion its virtues and favorite \nsons, regardless of who they were.\n  When Bill was a very young boy in elementary school, he wrote an \nessay for school and attempted to redeem one of American history's most \ndespised figures and a native son of Norwich, CT--not that his \nconnection to the community is often bragged about--Benedict\n\n[[Page S5149]]\n\nArnold. Sure, he was a traitor, young Bill wrote, but what about his \npositive attributes, he suggested. Bill Stanley was suspended for 3 \ndays from elementary school because of that essay. But that did not \nshake him. It is not that Bill abided treason but Benedict Arnold could \nnot have been all that bad in Bill Stanley's mind--after all, he was \nfrom Norwich.\n  Later in life, he would insist that Samuel Huntington, not George \nWashington, should be recognized as our first President. Why? Well, \namong other things, Samuel Huntington was from Norwich, CT.\n  Each year, the Second Company Governor's Footguard of New Haven--\nBenedict Arnold's organization--would convene a ceremony at the \ncemetery where Samuel Huntington was buried. Why? Well, as the \nFootguard's Major Commandant said, ``We did it for Bill.'' Because Bill \nStanley is from Norwich. Well, 2 years ago, they even made Bill an \nhonorary captain in the Footguard.\n  Bill fostered a lifelong crusade to create a Founding Fathers museum, \ndesigned to recognize the Presidents elected under the Articles of \nConfederation and the Continental Congress, to secure Norwich's \nrightful place. Samuel Huntington was the first President under the \nArticles of Confederation, so there is some legitimacy to Bill \nStanley's case, although it has never been recognized by many more than \nBill Stanley and those of us who come from Norwich, CT.\n  When the executive editor of the Norwich Bulletin asked Bill to write \na regular column about Norwich history, each one began, ``Once upon a \ntime.'' It became so popular that he eventually published 10 books, \nwhich earned $\\1/4\\ million, which Bill promptly gave to charity. \nBecause it wasn't all about glorifying Norwich's past--Bill made it his \nmission to build a better future as well for his neighborhood and \nfriends and the people he cared deeply about.\n  In 1987, St. Jude Common, a retirement home, opened on three acres of \nland Bill donated to that charity. He used his political acumen to \nraise $4.5 million in State funds to open the home, and another \n$400,000 from the Diocese of Norwich.\n  A friend who served with him on the home's board of directors \nrecalled:\n\n       Every year at Christmas, he would make sure we set up a \n     dinner for all the residents. I would always attend to see \n     the joy he had in bringing joy to others. He captured the \n     Christmas spirit and was always a joy to be around.\n\n  Bill Stanley was truly a joy to be around. He was a fascinating guy, \nwho always had an interesting story and was busy as he could be up \nuntil his last illness. He was a great friend to my family. My father \nloved him dearly. He was a loyal and true friend in so many wonderful \nways. I am glad I never had a tough race against someone from Norwich \nas well.\n  I join his beloved wife Peg, his son Bill, Jr., whom I know so well, \nand his daughters Carol and Mary in mourning Bill Stanley's passing, \nand I join every man, woman, and child in Norwich, CT, in giving thanks \nfor the wonderful life of William Stanley.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/18/senate-section/article/S5149-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5149-S5150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KAGAN NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last month, the President nominated his \nfriend and member of his administration, Solicitor General Elena Kagan, \nto a lifetime position on the Supreme Court. Ms. Kagan has never been a \njudge and only practiced law for 2 years as a junior associate before \nher current position as Solicitor General. She has largely been an \nacademic, administrator, and policy advocate and advisor.\n  So we have not had a lot of information about her background.\n  But recent documents from her time as a policy advocate in the \nClinton administration have shed more light on her views. And, in my \nview, they help answer the question some have asked as to whether she \nwould be able to transition into a very different kind of role; namely, \nthat of an impartial jurist Americans expect to sit above the political \nfray.\n  As a judge on our highest court, Ms. Kagan would no longer be a \nmember of President Obama's team. Rather, her job would be to apply the \nlaw even-handedly to persons and groups with whom she might not \nnecessarily empathize. And in that regard, it is instructive to see how \nshe's viewed the law and applied it when it comes to persons and groups \nwith which she may not agree.\n  I previously discussed Ms. Kagan's role in the Citizens United case. \nHere was a case in which the government said it could block a small \nnonprofit corporation from showing a movie that it made about then-\nSenator Hillary Clinton because it viewed the film as the kind of \npolitical speech that was prohibited by Federal campaign finance laws.\n  This was not only the first case Ms. Kagan argued as a member of the \nObama administration; it appears to have been the first case she has \never argued in any court. And in it, she and her office took the \nposition, at different points in the case, that the Federal Government \nhad the power to ban videos, books and pamphlets if it didn't like the \nspeech or the speaker, a shocking position for the solicitor general of \na nation that has always prided itself on a robust exchange of ideas \nunder the first amendment.\n  The justices on the Supreme Court, conservative and liberal alike, \nalso seem to have been taken aback by this position. As were legal \ncommentators of all political stripes; but now, in looking at some of \nthe documents from her time as a political advisor in the Clinton \nadministration, perhaps her views before the Supreme Court in Citizens \nUnited are not that surprising after all.\n  As a part of President Clinton's team, Ms. Kagan co-wrote a memo in \nwhich she said it was unfortunate that the Constitution stands in the \nway of many government restrictions on spending on political speech. \nShe also wrote that many of the Supreme Court's precedents that protect \npolitical speech in this area were, to quote her memo, ``mistaken in \nmany cases.''\n  We have also learned from the documents produced by the Clinton \nLibrary last week that Ms. Kagan was a member of the campaign finance \nworking group at the Clinton White House. These documents appear to \nshow that in this area, at least, Ms. Kagan placed her political \ndesires over an evenhanded reading of the law and of the rights that \nthe Constitution protects.\n  What is more, these newly released documents show that Ms. Kagan went \nout of her way to prevent the professional lawyers at the Justice \nDepartment from officially noting their concerns that the legislation \nbeing considered in Congress could infringe on Americans' first \namendment rights.\n  In the mid-1990s, for example, the Office of Legal Counsel was \nconcerned with the constitutionality of campaign finance legislation \nmaking its way through Congress. As a July 17, 1996, memo by Ms. Kagan \nput it: The OLC believed that all of the campaign finance bills under \nconsideration by the House at that time ``present[ed] serious \nconstitutional issues.''\n  Now, Ms. Kagan did not say these lawyers were wrong. In fact, she \nnoted that their concerns were to be expected in a case like this. But \nallowing them to express their legal analysis would have been at odds \nwith the Clinton administration's political strategy, a strategy she \nhelped develop.\n  She was determined, as one memo put it, to ``try to head off DOJ . . \n. letters'' that noted constitutional problems. So she called a \npolitical appointee at the Justice Department and told him that \nClinton's Office of Management and Budget ``might well disapprove'' any \nsuch opinion letter from the Justice Department.\n  The phone call evidently worked. The documents we have now seen show \nthat the political appointee with whom she spoke called back and told \nher the ``OLC did not have adequate time to prepare comments on the \ncampaign finance legislation and, given the possibility that such \ncomments might not go through, would not attempt to do so.'' What a \ncoincidence.\n\n[[Page S5150]]\n\n  Whether one works in the judicial, legislative, or executive branches \nof government, you take an oath to support and defend the Constitution \nof the United States. In this case, Ms. Kagan recognized that the \nprofessional lawyers at the Justice Department had valid legal concerns \nthat these bills might violate Americans' free speech rights. But she \ndisregarded these valid concerns, and even helped prevent them from \nbeing aired, in order to help advance a political agenda.\n  Now, I understand that Ms. Kagan was part of President Clinton's \nteam, just like she is now part of President Obama's team. Both \nPresidents were no doubt pleased with her political and policy advice. \nAnd we know President Obama is very pleased with the job she did in \nCitizens United. But if she were confirmed to the Supreme Court, she \ncan not be on anyone's team.\n  Ms. Kagan has said that judging is a ``craft,'' and that the Senate \nshould always insist that a nominee's background show that they can \n``master'' that craft. I agree with Ms. Kagan that judging is a craft. \nBut for most of her adult life, she has practiced a much different \ncraft, the craft of political advocacy. We must be convinced that \nsomeone who has spent the better part of her career as a political \nadviser, policy advocate, and academic, rather than as a legal \npractitioner or a judge, can put aside her personal and political \nbeliefs, and impartially apply the law, rather than be a rubberstamp \nfor the Obama or any other administration. The Clinton library \ndocuments make it harder, not easier, to believe that Ms. Kagan could \nmake that necessary transition.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley).

I think we have come \nup with a proposal and achieved a goal that both sides wanted to \nachieve, which is to get a doctor fix for at least a 6-month period of \ntime. Also, it is paid for. So we have done it without adding to the \ndeficit, and I think that is something both sides can feel good about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, sometimes the Senate can be terribly \ndisconcerting and aggravating, but that is the way the Senate is. Those \nare the rules we work under. I love the Senate. Every day that goes by, \nI understand there are times I am aggravated and disconcerted, but the \nvast majority of the time I am amazed how we are able to get work done.\n  I say through the Presiding Officer to my friend, the Republican \nleader, I am glad we were able to work out this legislation. This is \nextremely important for everybody, and we are going to move on with the \nrest of the bill and try to finish that as early as possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I very much appreciate this development. \nThis is very important. Now doctors will be paid. More important, \nseniors will get the benefits they deserve. Payments under TRICARE will \nnow go out. Military who participate in TRICARE, the retired military \nprogram, will get their benefits because that is all tied together. It \nis important because this provision expired June 1, this month, and it \nis about the last day for the payments to be paid; otherwise, there \nwould be a 21-percent reduction in payments to physicians, and many \nproviders would not provide the services to seniors, or even Medicaid, \nfor that matter. So it is very important that we are taking this action \nthis day; otherwise, there would be near chaos in the absence of \nmedical care and procedures.\n  I appreciate the cooperation on both sides of the aisle in working \nthis out. This is all paid for. This is not deficit\n\n[[Page S5151]]\n\nspending, which I think is critical to many. Third, it is a good omen. \nI hope we can take this cooperation and work out the rest of the so-\ncalled extenders bill together on both sides of the aisle. I am very \npleased with this development. I thank the majority leader and the \nminority leader for working this out. Now we can put this issue aside \nand doctors will be paid, seniors will get the benefits they deserve, \nand we can go on to work cooperatively to finalize the rest of the \nbill.\n  I thank my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this year has been an extremely difficult \nyear. No one has been more involved in everything we have done here \nthan my friend from Montana. In true times of crisis--and we have had \nplenty of crises in the last 18 months, and he and I had a relationship \nbefore that. In the last 18 months, we were in the trenches together to \nwork through some big problems we have here legislatively. Because of \nhis responsibility as chairman of the Finance Committee, much of the \nburden of what goes on in the Senate is on his shoulders. He has broad \nshoulders and a wonderful staff. I enjoy working with him, and I enjoy \nhis friendship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/18/senate-section/article/S5151-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING ARKANSAS FLOOD VICTIMS\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, it is with heartfelt sympathy that I \nstand before you today to offer my deepest condolences to the family \nmembers and friends who lost their loved ones in the flash floods that \nswept through the Albert Pike Recreation Area in the Ouachita National \nForest Campgrounds in the early morning hours of June 11, 2010. \nApproximately 8 inches of rain fell in 1 hour overnight, providing very \nlittle warning to campers of the danger. The warnings went unheard \nearly Friday morning; the campground has no sirens, no park ranger on \nsite, poor radio reception, and spotty cell phone service.\n  The Caddo and Little Missouri rivers rose by 20 feet overnight, \nengulfing the hikers and campers who were spending the night in tents \nalong the rivers in the isolated Ouachita Mountains. The 54-unit \ncampground was quickly inundated with water, which was rising as \nquickly as 8 feet per hour. The water was so violent it overturned RVs \nand peeled asphalt off the roads.\n  Twenty people, in some instances several members from the same family \nincluding young children, lost their lives in this tragedy. Among those \nlost were eight Louisianans, and my heart goes out to the Smith family, \nwho lost Anthony, Joey, and Katelynn; to the Basinger family, who lost \nShane and Kinsley in Gloster; and the Roeder family in Luling who, lost \nKay, Debbie, and Bruce.\n  The 20 people lost to this tragedy will be greatly missed by their \nfamilies, friends, and communities. I ask that you remember the victims \nof the flash floods in your thoughts and prayers.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/18/senate-section/article/S5151-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          HEBRON, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. \nFrom July 1-4, the residents of Hebron, ND, will gather to celebrate \ntheir community's founding.\n  The city of Hebron was established in the 1880s and was formed into a \nvillage in 1885. It was incorporated as a city in 1916. Hebron grew to \nits highest population of 2,000 in the mid-1950s and now is a town of \naround 900 nestled in a peaceful valley located 2 miles north of \nInterstate 94 in southwestern North Dakota.\n  Hebron is home to the Hebron Brick Company, Inc., which was started \nin 1904. Soon after European settlers began arriving in western North \nDakota, Charles Weigel and Ferdinand Leutz established Hebron Fire & \nPressed Brick Company. It is the oldest manufacturing operation in \nNorth Dakota, and its state-of-the-art brick making facility had made \nit one of the most successful brick companies in the upper Midwest. \nAbundant natural resources of the area allow the Hebron Brick Company \nto provide its customers with an array of brick options. Their modern \nfacilities ensure that the Hebron Brick Company manufactures \nconsistent, durable, and elegant products for their customers.\n  Hebron sits along the Old Red Old Ten Scenic Byway. The Old Red Old \nTen Scenic Byway allows tourists the opportunity to explore the rich \nhistory of North Dakota settlers. The culture of Native Americans and \nthe diversity of European pioneers are captured along this route. The \nnatural beauty of the buttes, river valleys, and prairie provides an \nimage of pleasant, rural life for visitors.\n  The citizens of Hebron are proud to mention the many reasons their \ncommunity is so strong. The city offers genuine small-town living with \na weekly local newspaper, two grain elevators, a public library, an \noutstanding public education system, parks, and recreational areas for \nfamilies and friends to spend quality time together. Hebron will soon \ncelebrate the completion of its new community center, and I wish to \ncongratulate the city on achieving this milestone.\n  In honor of the city's 125th anniversary, community leaders have \norganized a parade, car show, street dance, concerts, and other \ncelebratory events.\n  I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in congratulating \nHebron, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well in the future. By honoring Hebron and all other historic \nsmall towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier \nspirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Hebron that \nhave helped shape this country into what it is today, which is why this \nfine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Hebron has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/18/senate-section/article/S5151-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5151-S5152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NEW LEIPZIG, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that is celebrating its 100th anniversary. \nFrom July 1-4, the residents of New Leipzig, ND, will gather to \ncelebrate their community's founding.\n  In May 1910, a town site was platted by the Milwaukee Land Company of \nChicago. The German-Russian residents of nearby Leipzig, wanting a \nlocation closer to the railroad, relocated to what was soon named New \nLeipzig. New Leipzig underwent a brief name change in 1912, but after \ninput from residents, the town was once again called New Leipzig.\n  Hertz Brothers Hardware is believed to be the oldest company still \ndoing business in Grant County. Originally located in Leipzig as the \nFarmers Commerce Company, the company quickly moved to New Leipzig and \nbecame known as Hertz Brothers Hardware in 1912. Today, the business is \nunder its third generation of management. Roehl Trucking is also a \nthird-generation business, and Stelter Repair is under its fourth \ngeneration of management. Main Street today is almost entirely \npopulated by farm-related service businesses. Businesses currently \nservicing the area include Tietz Hardware, Larry's Service Center, \nStern Motors, Randy's Sales & Service, Stelter Repair, Roehl Transfer \nInc., Schock Real Estate, B & L Lounge, Star Grocery, Hertz Brother's \nInc., the United States Postal Service, New Leipzig Grain, and Dakota \nCommunity Bank.\n  New Leipzig, like so many other rural communities, strives to be a \ntrue home for its people and to provide a solid upbringing and quality \neducation for its children.\n  In honor of the city's 100th anniversary, community leaders have \norganized class gatherings, a bonfire, a parade, a dance, and an ice \ncream social, among many other fun and exciting events.\n  I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in congratulating \nNew Leipzig, ND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in \nwishing them well in the future. By honoring New Leipzig and all other \nhistoric small towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering \nfrontier spirit alive for future generations.

Mr. President, in 1995, U.S. News and World Report \nnamed Stanley Israelite one of the ``Twelve Indispensible Americans.''\n  But I didn't need U.S. News and World Report to tell me just how \nindispensible Stanley is. He worked with me for 25 years, beginning the \nvery first day I was sworn in as a Member of the House of \nRepresentatives. This weekend, he celebrated his 85th birthday, and I \njoin in that celebration.\n  One day, very early in my service, I was out to dinner with Stanley--\nwhich was a very important part of any decision I made. He listened to \nme talk for a while about some issues we were working on, but when I \nasked him for his advice, he simply said, ``I am going to tell you one \nthing about this job. Never forget the people.''\n  Stanley never has. In my office, he was the person who could be \ncounted on to stand up for any constituent, no matter how big or small \ntheir need. And in his spare time, he became a fixture of his community \nand a champion for small businesses. When he retired, he took exactly 1 \nday off and then returned to work for the Norwich Community Development \nCorporation.\n  When he won an award from the Norwich Rotary last year, Stanley, in \nhis typical modest fashion, said, ``I hope I deserve this. If you said \nI do, I'll accept it. I won't give it back.'' Well, that was the first \ntime Stanley Israelite ever passed up an opportunity to give something \nback to this community.\n  Mr. President, Stanley Israelite is a national treasure, a favorite \nson of Connecticut, one of my closest advisers, and one of my dearest \nfriends. I wish him all the best on his 85th birthday and in all the \ndays ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/18/senate-section/article/S5152-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR. RAYNARD S. KINGTON\n\n Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I wish to salute Dr. Raynard S. \nKington and thank him for his outstanding service and leadership at the \nNational Institutes of Health over the past decade.\n  Dr. Kington has had an exemplary career in public service. In 1997, \nhe joined the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services as Director \nof the Division of Health Examination Statistics and Director of the \nNational Health and Nutrition Examination Survey within the National \nCenter for Health Statistics at the Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention. He joined the NIH in 2000 as Director of the Office of \nBehavioral and Social Sciences Research. While leading that office, he \nsimultaneously served as Acting Director of the National Institute on \nAlcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. In 2003, he was promoted to Principal \nDeputy Director of NIH.\n  Dr. Kington is an extraordinarily accomplished scientist, \nadministrator and physician. His quiet leadership and wisdom were \nespecially evident during his tenure as Acting Director of NIH from \nOctober 2008 to August 2009. Most notably, he led the agency's effort \nto quickly and judiciously allocate the $10.4 billion that this \nCongress provided to the NIH in the American Recovery and Reinvestment \nAct. In addition, his keen leadership skills were critical to \nsuccessful implementation of President Obama's Executive order on human \nembryonic stem cell research and to establishing the Basic Behavioral \nand Social Science Opportunity Network Initiative. I am also grateful \nto Dr. Kington for leading NIH's efforts to strengthen conflict of \ninterest regulations.\n  Dr. Kington possesses a remarkable range of experience in higher \neducation, research, management, public policy, and rigorous \nintellectual achievement. In 2006, he was elected to the prestigious \nInstitute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences, where he \ncurrently serves as the chair of the Section on Administration of \nHealth Services, Education, and Research.\n  He has been a senior scientist at the RAND Corporation, and was \ncodirector of the Charles R. Drew University/RAND Center on Health and \nAging. He has served as an assistant professor of medicine at UCLA and \nas a visiting associate professor of Medicine at the Johns Hopkins \nUniversity School of Medicine.\n  Mr. President, at the age of 16, Dr. Kington began his postsecondary \neducation at the University of Michigan, where he received his B.S. \nwith distinction and his M.D. at the age of 21. He completed his \nresidency in internal medicine at Michael Reese Medical Center in \nChicago. He was appointed a Robert Wood Johnson Clinical Scholar at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, where he completed his M.B.A. with \ndistinction and his Ph.D. with a concentration in Health Policy and \nEconomics at the Wharton School. He is board-certified in internal \nmedicine, geriatric medicine, and public health and preventive \nmedicine.\n  Dr. Kington has a broad range of knowledge and experience in \nscientific, health, economic, and social issues. His research interests \nlie in the relationships among race, socioeconomic position, and health \nstatus, especially in older populations. He is a leading scientific \nresearcher on the role of social factors as determinants of health.\n  We all owe a debt of gratitude to Dr. Kington for his extraordinary \npublic service. The scientific community and the Nation have benefited \nenormously from his skilled leadership.\n  Finally, I would point out that NIH's loss is my State's great gain. \nOn August 1, he will be inaugurated as the 13th president of Grinnell \nCollege in Iowa. I join with my Senate colleagues in thanking Dr. \nKington for his past service and wishing him even greater success in \nhis challenging new position in Iowa.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/18/senate-section/article/S5152-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5152]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ARKANSAS HISTORIC SITES\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

These Arkansas landmarks help define our State's \nhistory and heritage, and I am proud to see them included on the \nNational Register.\n  The newly listed properties are:\n  The Century Flyer at Conway, a miniature train manufactured by the \nNational Amusement Device Co. of Dayton, OH, around 1955.\n  Arnold Springs Farmstead at Melbourne in Izard County, featuring a \nvernacular Greek Revival house built around 1857, plus several \noutbuildings.\n  The Walnut Street Commercial Historic District at Walnut Ridge, with \nbuildings dating to around 1875.\n  Fargo Training School Historic District near Fargo in Monroe County, \nwhere Black children attended school between 1949 and 1968.\n  Old Searcy County Jail on Center Street in Marshall, a 1902 Native-\nstone building influenced by the Romanesque style of architecture.\n  Cherry Street Historic District Boundary Expansion at Helena-West \nHelena.\n  Along with all Arkansans, I congratulate these communities for \nreceiving this national recognition. I also salute the local officials \nand residents of our State for their efforts to maintain the beauty and \nhistory of their communities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/18/senate-section/article/S5152-4", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5152-S5153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WINROCK INTERNATIONAL\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, this year marks the 25th \nanniversary of a landmark nonprofit in my home State of Arkansas. \nWinrock International will celebrate 25 years of empowering the \ndisadvantaged, increasing economic opportunities and sustaining natural \nresources in our State and around the world.\n  With its global headquarters in Little Rock, Winrock International \ntraces its roots to a charitable endeavor that Arkansas Gov. Winthrop \nRockefeller established at his home and ranch on Petit Jean Mountain, \nthe Winrock International Livestock Research and Training Center. In \n1985 that institution merged with the Agricultural Development Council \nand the International Agricultural Development Service, both founded by \nMr. Rockefeller's brother, John D. Rockefeller III, to form Winrock \nInternational.\n  From Arkansas to Africa to Asia, Winrock touches lives all across the \nglobe. They find solutions that work in the real world, increase long-\nterm productivity and make lasting improvements in people's lives.\n  Near Helena-West Helena, AR, my hometown, Winrock helped five sweet \npotato farmers build a new industry based on local produce grown by \nsmallholder farms. Important projects like these put infrastructure and \nexpertise on the ground that support our\n\n[[Page S5153]]\n\ntraditional industry of agriculture while also building new \nopportunities for growth.\n  In the Philippines, a Winrock project has supported the \nelectrification of 474 villages, 13,422 households and 224 schools. \nThis project improved education for more than 44,000 students and gave \nfamilies and communities access to modern energy sources, which is a \ncritical first step in increased social and economic development.\n  I salute Winrock International for their dedication, commitment and \nsupport of our neediest communities and citizens--both in the United \nStates and around the world, and I am proud that Winrock calls Arkansas \nhome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/18/senate-section/article/S5153-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        LOUISIANA PEACH FARMERS\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I would like to recognize all \nLouisiana peach farmers, the festival's title sponsors: Squire Creek \nCountry Club, the Ruston-Lincoln Chamber of Commerce, the city of \nRuston, and all the other sponsors who partnered to celebrate the \nDiamond Anniversary of the Louisiana Peach Festival the weekend of June \n25 to 27, 2010.\n  In 1947, the area peach growers of Lincoln Parish organized the \nLouisiana Fruit Growers Association. In 1951, the association voted to \npromote their industry by spreading the word about the exceptional \nLincoln Parish peaches throughout Louisiana.\n  In June 1951, the president of the Louisiana Fruit Growers \nAssociation, J.E. Mitcham, and Walter Smith founded the Louisiana Peach \nFestival in Ruston. The association, with the cooperation of the city \nof Ruston, chamber of commerce, civic clubs, garden clubs, merchants, \nand many other individuals, worked tirelessly to prepare the city for \nthe inaugural festival. Area merchants filled the Ruston Daily Leader \nwith advertisements offering special sales and savings to honor the \nfirst Peach Festival. The program of the First Annual Louisiana Peach \nFestival, which was held on June 27 to 28, 1951, consisted of ``Peaches \nand Posies'' flower show, a peach cookery contest, an art show, and \nseveral athletic tournaments. The festival also crowned the First Queen \nDixie Gem and Princess Peach.\n  In the years following, the Louisiana Peach Festival grew in size and \npopularity. In 1952, the festival's activities doubled in number. By \nthe third year, the festival won national attention when Queen Dixie \nGem III, Dorothy Etta Goff, traveled to Washington, DC, to present then \nVice President Richard Nixon a box of peaches. Over the past 60 years \nthe festival has become an iconic event in the region.\n  Thus, today I would like to recognize all the organizations, \nvolunteers, and especially the farmers for continuing to put on the \nLouisiana Peach Festival. I would also like to thank them for their \nappetizing service to Lincoln Parish and to the State of \nLouisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "18"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/18/senate-section/article/S5153-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:42 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill and joint resolution, in which it requests \nthe concurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.R. 5297.
